NMWORANDU3 AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIM PR$SIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPN$e, AND
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR THE NATIONAL SERICULTURE PROJECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of US$ 30
million equivalent and development credit of SDR 113.8 million (US$ 147
million) equivalent to India is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be for 20 years, including a five year gcace period at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 35 years maturity. The Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) has
agreed to cofinance the project with a grant contribution of SwF 40 million.
The IBRD loan, IDA Credit and SDC funds will help finance the required
expansion and strengtheniaig of infrastructure and support services for India's
development of sericulture industry.
2.   Dackgxund Agriculture in India accounted for about 35% of GDP and 25%
of exports in 1986, and employed about 65% of the labor force. Production has
increased at a steady annual rate of about 2.5% from 1971 to 1984, lower than
the GDP growth rate of 4.5% over the past decade. Accelerated agricultural
growth will be an important element in attaining India's long run objectives
of 6% per annum overall GDP growth, and reduction in the high incidence of
poverty and under-employment, especially in the rural areas. Diversification
of agriculture into commodities with high returns and growth prospects will be
equally important objectives.
3.    Sericulture, a development priority in India's Vllth Plan, has the
unusual advantage of addressing simultaneously and rapidly several aspects of
India's overall development strategy: high employment and income generation in
the rural areas; major participation of low income groups and social target
groups; good comparative advantage and growth potential; potential for
contribution to export earnings; supporting a greater role for women in
development; and strong linkages (and employment generation) with raw silk
production for the industrial sector. These combined features make sericulture
a particularly attractive sector for further development support.
4.    IDA has financed one sericulture project in India, the Karnataka
Sericulture Project (Credit 1034-IN) which was approved for a Credit of US$ 54
million in June 1980. The project was completed in 1988, about three years
after the appraisal target. Despite this delay, project performance was
satisfactory with establishment of project infrastructure and services at
about 95% of appraisal targets. Incremental production of raw silk in
Karnataka expected to be about 1600 tons per year has increased to 2,700 tons
per annum and the project has also had significant impact on stimulating
sericulture in adjacent areas of the neighboring states of Andhra Pradesh and
Tamil Nadu. A Project Completion Report is under preparation. The Karnataka
project experience has provided a useful basis for design and implementation
of further sericulture development.



5.    Part of the proposed project will be carried out in the State of Jammu
and Kashmir, which includes areas over which India and Pakistan have been in
dispute since 1947. In making the proposed loan and credit to India, IBRD/IDA
does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the claims of the
parties involved.
6.   RationalA for Rank/mDA InvolvemAnt: Emphasis of Bank Group's assistance
strategy to India is on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in
the public sector, and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support
systems to the poor. The proposed project would contribute to policy and
institutional changes, increase the role for the private sector and improve
the long-term sustainability of the industry. Given its rural base and the
labor-intensive characteristics of sericulture, the project will contribute to
reduction of poverty in rural areas through creation of employment, including
for women and scheduled castes/tribes which account for about 60% and 30%,
respectively, of labor engaged in sericulture. Project support for the
national body - the Central Silk Board - and inclusion of sericulture
development in 12 pilot states will enhance and broaden the Bank's involvement
in sericulture development to the national level. In Jammu and Kashmir, Bank
involvement will support the state's efforts to demonopolize and revitalize
the industry through market forces.
7.    Protjct Obiectives:    The project would promote higher productivity
and product quality in the sericulture sector. Government supporting services
and facilities would be improved and intensified; public sector grainage
facilities would be operated on a commercial basis, thus promoting private-
sector participation in such activities; and private sector involvement in
other aspects of the industry would be promoted. The success of this endeavor
will substantially determine the degree to which India can exploit over the
long term its natural comparative advantage in silk production and potential
for further growth without incurring unsustainable demands on the state and
central budgets. This will require a combination of supporting investments
and policy charges.
8.    Project DescriptiM:    The project will provide resources to CSB and
the five participating states to strengthen and expand production support
services and facilities for research, training, extension services, nurseries
for mulberry saplings, basic seed (silkworm egg) production, seed
multiplication grainages, cocoon drying and testing, cocoon markets, silk
exchanges and silk testing houses. Infrastructure for r"ssearch will include
construction and operating costs of a germ-plasm bank and a silkworm seed
technology laboratory for CSB and a state sericulture research institute in
Andhra Pradesh similar to the one financed for Karnataka under the previous
IDA financed project. In addition, the project will finance CSB's pilot
development programs for sericulture in 12 states (Assam, Bihar, Gujarat,
Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa,
Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) where sericulture is a relatively new
activity. The project funds will be utilized for civil works for operational
buildings, staff quarters, equipment, vehicles and incremental staff and other
operating costs of the facilities mentioned above (except grainages) and new
headquarters offices and additional administrative staff of CSB and the five



-3-
Directorates of Sericulture in participating states. Other project components
include:
(a) Transfer of chawki (young silkworm) rearing to private sericulturists
and assistance to chawki rearers.
(b) Assistance to small private reelers around new cocoon markets.
(c) Foreign technical assistance in various aspects of sericulture research
and silk production processes, as well as for overseas training visits
of project agencies.
(d) Selected universities' programs in sericulture research
(e) Appointment of senior level female officers in the five participating
states who will initiate actions *o support and enhance women's role in
sericulture development generally and to liaise with NGOs engaged in
sericulture.
(f) Support for NGO09 actions oriented to promoting social objectives
(involvement of women, landless scheduled castes and tribes) or
innovative technical or managerial actions and
(g) A major beneficiary assessment exercise to be undertaken during the
project period.
Total project cost is estimated at USS 347 million. This includes US$ 104
million estimated to be required as credit funds for on-farm development and
reeling establishments during the project period. Up to US$ 7.7 million
equivalent would be available for retroactive financing of eligible
expenditures incurred since appraisal. All requirements for credit are
expected to be met by banks and other financial institutions including
refinance facilities from NABARD and IDBI. A break-down of costs and financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts, procurement categories, disbursement
percentages and estimated disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The
timetable of key processing dates and status of Bank Group's operations in
India are also attached as Schedules C and D. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No.7730-tN dated April 21, 1989 is al&o attached.
9.   Aur-ad Alctina.  The project requires actions relating to various
components. Main actions agreed with CSB and the participating states are
summarized below:
(a) All public sector grainages will adjust their prices of seeds so as to
recover full costs of grainages, be subject to increased financial
disciplines; CSB and project states will take actions to encourage
greater private sector involvement in grainage business;
(b) Participating states will transfer existing Chawki Rearing Centers
(CRCs) to the private sector during the project period. Assistance to
CRCs will be on the basis of criteria, and contractual arrangements
acceptable to IBRD/IDA;



- 4 -
(c) Ja*mu & Kashmir has confirmed its continuid commitment towards de-
monopolization of sericulture, and for establishment of facilities for
open auction of cocoons and silk yarn:
(d) CSD and participating states will take actions to ensure flow of credit
to eligible borrowers from banks and commercial institutions within the
existing procedures and criteria;
(e) CSB and Project States' will enhance the role of women in sericulture,
including allocation of seWarate space for wwv   in cocoon markets,
effo ts to attain training and recruitment tar%rts for women in CSB and
Directorates of Sericulture of participating states;
(f) Advances to private reelera shall be in accordance with a 'plan of
operation' submf.tted by CSB, specifying interest rate, repayment terms
and other criteria acceptable to IBRD/IDA;
(g) Equity participation of project states in joint sector reeling
enterprisea shall not exceed 25% of share capital of the corporations
and for investments whose financial viability has been independently
verified;
10.  BmnefZta:  The project will accelerate sericulture development in
Xndia; total incremental production during the project period is expected to
be about 8,100 tons, of which some 4,200 tons would be attributable to the
project. Even if the proportion of production exported does not increase,
incremental fabric exports would amount to 1,000 tons, in which the raw silk
content would exceed US$40 million per annum. The project would create the
equivalent of 510,000 full-time jobs, 60% of which will be for women and
about 30% for scheduled caste and tribes in the rural areas. To make
sericulture self-sustaining in the longer run, the project is also intended
to provide a redirection of the industry with greater emphasis on the role of
the private sector. Quality improvement should result from emphasis on
research, quality seed production, silk testing and continued efforts toward
bivoltine silk particularly in Jammu & Kashmir and in pilot states.
11. The economic rate return for the overall project is estimated at 32%.
Financial benefits for the main groups of beneficiaries (farmers and reelers)
are adequate to substantial. The project is not expected to affect the
environment adversely and may in fact have a positive effect; mulberry (a
perennial plant) generally replaces higher water consuming crops (sugarcane
and paddy), contributes to soil conservation and produces twigs and branches
used for burning fuel.
12.  RlAkq.  With respect to improving services, the major risk lies in under-
funding by the state governments. However, the funds required are a very
small proportion of total state budgetary resources, and the participating
states have demonstrated strong commitient to the project during the
preparation and appr:aisal process.



13.  A second risk is that greater private sector involvemeAt in grainages
depends primarily on fair competition between existing goveOrment facilities,
and existing and potential c.mmercial producers. Assurances that government
production would be commercially priced would provide the basis for
attraccing increased private participation. Implementation of this
underlying concept will require a continued commitment by CSB and
participating states and a willingness to promote private sector in
activities (grainages and chawki rearing) which have hitherto been
predominantly in the piiblic sector. However, these risks are reduced in tho
light of experience in Karnataka and Jammu & Kashmir so far, and conviction by
CSB and the project states that private sector needs to be more heavily
involved in grainages, chawki rearing and reeling.
14.   A third risk is in the expansion of private sector production of raw
silk which depends on the improved services and facilities provided under the
project. The technical packages on which most extension efforts are to be
based are proven, and the project provides for research to improve still
further. The development of improved and expanded reeling facilities would
depend on commercial perceptions of the potential beneffts, however the
buoyant domestic and export market for silk, and the shortages of higher
quality raw silk in the international markets, suggest that the risk is
limited. Moreover, experience to date shows that reelers are highly
responsive to increased availability of raw silk.
15.  R        mmendation  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would
comply with the Articles of Agzrement of the Bank and Association
respectively and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.
