moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned include the following:\n            Both the IRPII and IRPI, which was closed in 1999, had\n            similar developmental objectives, outcomes and issues. It\n            would have made much sense to delay the commencement of the\n            IRPII and have the reforms planned under IRPI implemented\n            first. If this had been followed, the design of IRPII would\n            have benefited from the experience of the former project\n            which was rated unsatisfactory. The design and\n            implementation arrangement of the project should have given\n            more attention to improving the limited capacity of the\n            implementing agencies and prepared a less ambitious project.\n            Attempts to build institutional capacity without appropriate\n            reforms are likely to be frustrated and become\n            unsustainable. In-country presence of Bank staff is critical\n            for success of projects, particular transport infrastructure\n            development, that have lengthy preparatory and procurement\n            phases. A strong monitoring and evaluation capacity should\n            be inbuilt in project preparation and supervision."}, "docdt": "2007-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
