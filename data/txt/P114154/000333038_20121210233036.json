The closing date for the\n            project will be extended from December 31, 2012 until June\n            30, 2013. The RTG has so far withdrawn USD100 million and\n            intends to withdraw the remaining USD900 million in support\n            of the implementation of their FY2013 budget; in particular,\n            the extension will enable the withdrawals to be more aligned\n            with the implementation of the RTG's investment plans\n            for FY2013 (October 2012-September 2013) which will mostly\n            be in the first half of 2013. The extension will also be\n            helpful in lowering the cost of swapping the PSRDPL proceeds\n            from US dollars to Thai Baht for the RTG. The baht swap\n            market is quite thin and is therefore volatile. The\n            extension of the PSRDPL closing date to June 2013 will make\n            it difficult for speculative investors to predict when the\n            Ministry of Finance (MOF) will make the swaps and how much\n            each time. The extension will also allow the MOF to make\n            swaps in smaller amounts at a time - which will not swing\n            the swap market by too much which is undesirable by (and may\n            hurt) other non-speculative clients in the swap market (e.g.\n            exporters). This will be the second extension of the\n            project, and a cumulative extension of nine months."}, "docdt": "2012-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
