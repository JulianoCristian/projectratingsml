7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objectives of the PSRDPL are to assist the Royal Thai Government (RTG) in its response to the
financial crisis and to support institutional development in the public sector by: (i) improving the
effectiveness of the public financial management framework through better governance and accountability;
(ii) enhancing the skills and performance of the civil service; and (iii) improving quality and timeliness of
service delivery. The prior actions corresponding to each objective were met since the loan was negotiated
in May 2009. Further progress have been made since then as outlined in Annex 3 Development Policy
Matrix of the PSRDPL program document.
