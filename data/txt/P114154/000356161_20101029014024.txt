Main Policy Areas   Public Financial Management, Public Administration, and Public Service Delivery
Program             The objectives of the PSRDPL are to assist the Royal Thai Government (RTG) in its response
Development         to the financial crisis and to support institutional development in the public sector by:
Objectives and      (i) improving the effectiveness of the public financial management framework through better
Contribution to     governance and accountability; (ii) enhancing the skills and performance of the civil service;
CAS                 and (iii) improving quality and timeliness of service delivery.
                    The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) prepared concurrently with this operation has two pillars:
                    (i) assisting the country to recover from the financial crisis; and (ii) helping improve
                    Thailand's competitiveness and sustainable development. This operation is at the center of
                    the Bank's support in responding to the crisis, while the public sector reforms are an
                    important component of the second pillar.
                    Related operations of the World Bank Group and other donors.
                    The reforms supported by this DPL were catalyzed by the Public Sector Reform Loan (1999-
                    2001) and Economic Management Assistance Loan (1998-2003) and steadily implemented
                    by the Government ever since. After the loans closed in 2003, World Bank assistance was
                    continued through technical support from the Country Development Partnership for
                    Governance and Public Sector Reforms. A parallel budget support operation to support
                    capital market development was approved by the board of the Asian Development Bank
                    (ADB) on September 21, 2010.
Key Outcome         1. Economic recovery underway supported by fiscal stimulus that helps mitigate the impact
Indicators          of the financial crisis, including progress with implementation of public investment programs
                    to foster long-term economic growth.
                    2. A more accountable and efficient public financial management system through improved
                    fiduciary controls, better monitoring and reporting of public finances, increased policy focus
                    on budget formulation, increased transparency and disclosure of the use of public resources,
                    and enhanced external audit capability..
                    3. A better performing public administration with reduced rigidities in the civil service
                    structure, improved incentives for civil servants, and establishment of a performance
                    monitoring framework for the civil service.
                    4. Improved service delivery through increased public monitoring and oversight over quality
                    and timeliness of services delivered by public agencies, and enhanced internal performance
                    measurement and monitoring by aligning budget monitoring tools with service delivery
                    indicators.
Risks and Risk    Political uncertainty. The political outlook is subject to significant risk, but there are also
Mitigation         important mitigating factors. A coalition of opposition groups, the United Front for
                   Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), staged large protests in Bangkok in April and
                   May that culminated in violence. The ruling coalition is working on a national
                   reconciliation agenda, which may involve an early dissolution of Parliament. While
                   relative calm has followed the end of the protests, the underlying political divisions remain
                   and are likely to have been exacerbated by the violence. The Government's parliamentary
                   majority was unaffected, and Parliament has approved the FY2011 budget and financing
                   plan in August 2010. The financing plan includes borrowing from ADB and the Japan
                   International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in addition to borrowing from the World Bank.
                   Although plans to borrow from international financial institutions (IFIs) were approved in
                   Parliament by a wide margin, the vote was largely along party lines and there is a risk that
                   borrowing from IFIs may be politicized, and that these institutions are seen as supporting
                   the ruling coalition. Several factors mitigate this risk: (i) the loan was originally requested
                   by a finance minister currently in the opposition; (ii) the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has
                   carried out public consultations on the operation and solicited comments on its website;
                   (iii) the loan is being submitted to the World Bank Board only after parliamentary
                   approval has been received; and (iv) designing the operation as a standalone operation
                   rather than a programmatic one helps the Government manage the political risk.
                  Implementation risks. Notwithstanding the political instability, the public sector reform
                   agenda has been maintained under different political administrations. This has been the
                   case over the past twelve months as the reform program has been sustained despite the
                   political turmoil. This is because the underlying reform program has broad support across
                   the political spectrum and is owned by senior civil servants in respective agencies.
                   Therefore the risk to reform program implementation is modest. Inevitably, continued
                   political turmoil will have some impact on the implementation of the program, and
                   especially through delays in passage of needed legislation.
                  Macroeconomic risks. Thailand is recovering strongly from the global financial crisis with
                   year-on-year GDP growth at 10.6 percent in the first half of 2010 and projected to reach
                   over 7 percent for the year as a whole. However, growth remains largely dependent on
                   external demand conditions, and a new slowdown in world trade would have a substantive
                   negative impact on Thailand's economy. A track record of prudent macroeconomic
                   management and conservative banking practice means that the likelihood of a balance of
                   payments or banking crises is relatively low, and that the authorities will continue to
                   manage debt prudently. Given the strong macroeconomic fundamentals, markets have
                   reacted calmly to political events in Thailand, although a renewed escalation in violence
                   may lead to a market reappraisal.

      FOR A PROPOSED PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                               TO THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND

I.     INTRODUCTION

1.       The Royal Thai Government (RTG) is requesting this US$1 billion Public Sector
Reform Development Policy Loan (PSRDPL) to sustain economic recovery from the global
financial crisis. Discussions on a possible loan that would supplement Government funds to
implement a larger development budget began in mid-2008 and a formal request was made before the
2008 Annual Meetings. During loan preparation in late 2008 and early 2009, Thailand became one
of the countries in Asia most affected by the global financial crisis making more urgent the need for
resources. Around this time, the political climate also deteriorated significantly. The loan was
negotiated in May 2009, but the government did not submit it to Parliament as the political situation
did not allow parliamentary discussion as required by the Constitution. The economy began to
recover in late 2009, and there has been a period of relative political calm since June 2010. As a
result, the government initiated the process for parliamentary discussion of the loan, Parliament
approved the loan in August, and the Government has now requested the Bank for final approval.
The reforms supported by the loan are summarized in paragraph 4 and in Table 8. The delay in
Parliamentary approval meant a relatively long gap between negotiations and final Board
consideration. During this period, the government continued to make significant progress in
implementation of the forward-looking reform program discussed during negotiations, in addition to
the standard consideration of implementation of the prior actions (see Table 8 and Annex 3).

2.      The Thai government's renewed interest in borrowing reflects widespread consensus
across the political spectrum on the need to increase spending on public investment. Public
investment had never fully recovered from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, raising concerns about
the sustainability of growth over the long term. Increasing public investment was viewed by the
authorities as important to both sustain Thailand's recovery from the global financial crisis as well
as to support structural change and medium term growth. As a result, the stimulus packages
emphasized public investment in critically needed infrastructure, health, and education. In addition
to the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA) have also been asked for support. The ADB Board approved a program loan
focusing on capital market development on September 21, 2010, while JICA is preparing a number
of investment loans for infrastructure, supporting among others the construction of mass transit in

3.      Accessing World Bank funds supports prudent debt management and policy reforms.
Thailand's financing needs are largely met through the domestic debt market (Table 4). However,
foreign financing from the World Bank, ADB and JICA is viewed as an important component of the
financing plan to (i) prevent crowding out of the private sector in the debt market and to diversify
funding sources to manage risk; (ii) allow the Government to access long term finance to match long
gestation investment projects that are planned (as in many countries, the global financial crisis led to
reliance on debt of shorter maturities - the amount of government debt with maturities of less than
three years increased from 31 percent of the portfolio in June 2008 to 38 percent in December 2009);
and (iii) benefit from the policy components of IFI financing that will help maximize the
development impacts of the planned investments.

4.      The Government's reform program supported by this loan seeks to strengthen public
sector institutions that foster efficiency, good governance, accountability, and results ­ a focus
that fits well with the government's accelerated public investment program.               The public
financial management reforms supported by the loan promote improved fiduciary controls, better
monitoring and reporting of public finances, increased policy focus on budget formulation, increased
transparency and disclosure in the use of public resources, and an improved external audit system.
Parallel reforms in public administration aim to reduce rigidities in the civil service structure and
improve incentives and performance monitoring for civil servants. Accountability for service
delivery is being promoted by increased public monitoring and oversight over the quality and
timeliness of services delivered by public agencies and enhanced internal performance measurement
by aligning budget monitoring tools with service delivery indicators.

5.      The public sector reform program has been implemented over a number of years
despite long-standing political instability. Public sector reforms were launched in the aftermath of
the Asian financial crisis, and were initially supported by World Bank policy-based lending and
technical assistance (TA). The last policy-based loan closed in 2001 and the corresponding TA loan
closed in 2003. Although the Bank has remained substantively involved in key policy discussions
over the entire period since these loans closed (see paragraph 10), Thailand's reform program
evolved without conditionality from the international financial community. This reflects the fact that
while Government policy actions have benefitted from Bank analytical work and advice, these
reforms are clearly owned by senior civil servants in the key agencies. While the focus of the
diagnostic work described in Section V is on the areas of the program needing improvement, it is
important to note that in some areas such as civil service reform the Thailand program is already
serving as a model for regional peers and in some areas, such as the program and performance
budgeting, Thailand compares well with OECD countries. Inevitably, the political instability has led
to some slowdown in the program ­ typically through a delay in the passage of needed legislation.
Notwithstanding such slowdown, reforms have continued during 2009 and 2010 with reasonable
progress. The level of ownership by Government and its demonstration of steady implementation, in
spite of a political change in leadership, clearly support a judgment that the public sector reform
program will continue, regardless of the status of subsequent operations and political instability.

6.      The Bank will be able to continue to support the medium-term reform program. In
parallel with the PSRDPL, World Bank support to the Government's public sector reform program
will continue. Ongoing work includes an important study on central-local fiscal relations, technical
assistance to implement the results-based management, and strategic performance-based budgeting
reforms. In addition, the Government has also indicated that it intends to continue borrowing at
modest levels for investments in specific bottleneck areas over the next three years as described in
the Interim Strategy Note.

7.      The political situation in Thailand remains challenging and adds uncertainty to the
prospects for the Thai economy. In end-2008 a new coalition Government led by the Democrat
Party took office after the previous ruling party was dissolved by the Constitutional Court on
violations of electoral law. The opposition has been staging protests since, which in 2009 led to the
cancellation of an ASEAN+6 summit in Pattaya and riots in Bangkok, and in April/May 2010 an
outbreak of violence that led to nearly 100 deaths and over one thousand injured. However, since


                                                  2
early-June a level of stability has returned and Parliament has met and supported the borrowing under
PSRDPL. Nevertheless, it seems likely that it will take some time before full political stability is
restored.

8.      The economy is recovering strongly from the financial crisis, although political strife
highlights that the recovery is still fragile. The Government's fiscal stimulus prevented a more
significant decline in domestic demand in the face of a substantial external shock as well as ongoing
political tensions. In addition, the Government is using the crisis response as an opportunity to also
increase social sector spending and to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks through a medium-term
scaling up of public investments. The political crisis has severely affected tourism and both domestic
and foreign investment, and the continued dependence on exports adds urgency to implementing
policies to support growth in both the short- and medium-terms. Nevertheless, even with such
policies in place, the combination of crises has lowered growth prospects.

9.      Request for Bank support has come from Thai governments led by parties on either
side of the political spectrum and has been confirmed twice by Parliament. The request for this
proposed PSRDPL was initially made by the People's Power Party (PPP) Government led by the late
Mr. Samak Sundaravej, was reconfirmed by the following PPP Government of Mr. Somchai
Wongsawat, and has again been reconfirmed by the Democratic led Government of Mr. Abhisit
Vejjajiva. The main drivers of the underlying reform program and the request for World Bank
support have come from senior civil servants. On March 24 2009, Parliament authorized the
Government to negotiate with the World Bank, ADB and JICA, and on August 17, 2010, Parliament
authorized the Government to conclude the borrowings that had been negotiated under the previous
authorization.

10.     There have been public consultations on the PSRDPL. Government has solicited feedback
on the PSRDPL as well as the ADB and JICA loans through the websites of the Ministry of Finance,
Prime Minister, Parliament and Senate in March 2009. The Ministry of Finance also conducted a
series of public consultative forums in May 2009 in Bangkok, Khonkkean (Northeastern), Surrathani
(South), and Pitsanulok (North) to solicit views from the public. Participants included academics,
community leaders and representatives of professional groups. Surveys were conducted at the end of
each session. There have also been consultations in the context of the preparation of the Interim
Strategy Note.

11.    The Ministry of Finance has summarized the main messages received from the public
consultations. These were grouped into four main areas:

     (i)    Rationale for borrowing from abroad: Given the current economic situation in Thailand,
            most participants agreed on the importance of borrowing to restore the economy and
            develop infrastructure in Thailand.

    (ii)    Use of the funds: There should be a focus on value for money;              since domestic
            borrowing is larger than foreign borrowing, domestically financed spending should also
            be monitored closely and local infrastructure projects should have high priority.

    (iii)   Debt management: Debt should be managed efficiently so as not to cause a fiscal burden
            in the future



                                                  3
      (iv)      Monitoring: There should be close monitoring of the expenditures from loan proceeds to
                ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability; expenditures financed by domestic
                debt should also be monitored closely.

II.      COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES

A.           Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
12.     Thailand's open and globally integrated economy experienced a V-shape contraction
and recovery from late 2008 through the first quarter of 2010. Driven by the manufacturing-for-
exports sector, Thailand's real GDP fell 6.3 percent between the third quarter of 2008 and the first
quarter of 2009, as global demand slumped, before rebounding by 12 percent over the following four
quarters. The rebound was primarily due to the recovery in global demand (exports were up
16.2 percent), while private consumption grew at a more modest 4 percent during the period. Real
GDP returned to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2009 (as measured in seasonally adjusted terms);
although for 2009 as a whole real GDP fell by 2.2 percent.

13.     The recent political turmoil of April/May 2010 had a limited effect on the economy,
although the social impact was larger. The critical manufacturing-for-exports sector was little
affected by the turmoil and performed extremely well given buoyant export demand in the second
quarter of 2010 and a surge in domestic demand for cars, which jumped as much as 50 percent over
the period. The tourism sector, on the other hand, suffered substantial losses, and service receipts
contracted by over 18 percent from the previous quarter (seasonally-adjusted). The retail sector also
contracted in the quarter, suggesting it was also affected by the turmoil. Since the retail and tourism-
related sectors employ about 25 percent of the workforce compared to 15 percent in manufacturing,
the social impact of the crisis was likely greater than its impact on GDP.

14.     Despite a pick-up in household consumption in the second quarter of 2010, exports will
remain the main driver of growth in the near term. Sectors linked to the production of tradable
goods and services (namely, manufacturing, hotels and transport) have been the main contributors to
growth since the Thai economy recovered from the 1997 financial crisis and also accounted for most
of the economic dynamism since the onset of the global financial crisis (Figure 1). A change to this
pattern is unlikely in the near term, implying that the outlook for exports will continue to be the key
determinant of GDP performance.

15.     The economy will slowdown in the second half of 2010 as the inventory cycle fades and
the recovery of advanced economies proceeds at a modest pace. The Thai economy grew by
10.6 percent in the first half of 2010 from the previous year, but quarterly growth already slowed
down substantially in the second quarter and is expected to contract modestly in the second half. The
outlook for external demand is subdued: global trade has rebounded, but growth was likely
concentrated in the first half of the year as activity indicators in the US, Japan and China point to
slowdown in global demand. This moderation is due to the waning of the global inventory cycle and
fiscal policy stimulus, as well as the continued slow pace of growth in advanced economies. Because
of the low base of GDP in 2009 and robust performance in the first half of 2010, the year-on-year
growth rate is expected to come at 7.5 percent in 2010 before slowing to 3.2 percent in 2011.

16.      Inflation risks are generally low, but food prices need to be monitored. Thailand's
headline CPI increased 3.3 per cent year-on-year in August whereas core prices rose 1.2 percent in
the same period. Prices of food, especially raw food, were the key drivers, explaining the difference
between core and headline numbers. Year-on-year increases in energy prices have moderated to
0.3 percent from a peak of 36 percent in December/January, whereas fruits and vegetables registered
a 40 percent year-on-year increase. Year-on-year readings will remain relatively high due to base
effects, but core prices are likely to remain below their long-term trend in part due to continuing
government subsidies to transportation and utilities. The current readings, as well as the last-twelve-
month average (annualized) are still below Thailand's 2006-2007 average (an approximation for
`normal times') and well within the Bank of Thailand's (BOT) target of between 0.5 and 3 percent
(see Figure 2 below).

17.     A slowdown in export growth from the breakneck pace of the first half is likely.
Merchandise exports grew by 42 percent year-on-year in nominal terms in the second quarter of
2010, acceleration from the 32 percent pace registered in the first quarter. Growth was driven almost
entirely (92 percent) by exports of manufactured goods, and it is likely that much of this growth was
linked the global restocking cycle, which is expected to have been largely completed. This is likely
to lead to a stabilization of demand for Thai exports at a lower level, consistent with slow growth in
advanced economies. Although emerging markets have been a growing source of demand for Thai
exports, they have yet to fully compensate for the shortfall in the demand from developed countries,
especially as their economies are also sensitive to developments in OECD countries. The outlook for
services exports, notably tourism, is more favorable in large part due to the low base set in the second
quarter. Indeed, tourist arrivals have already rebounded strongly and as of July were already at 84
percent of the (seasonally-adjusted) pre-crisis peak Thailand remains a competitive destination and
the recovery in consumer spending in advanced economies -- while slow -- will continue to drive
growth. Key risks include a new deterioration of sentiment in Europe, as European tourists comprise
the largest percentage of visitors from high-income countries, as well as renewed politics-related
violence.

18.      The outlook for private investment is positive in the near term, but uncertainty due to
Thailand's political situation and the speed of global recovery could dampen investment
beyond 2010. The rebound in manufacturing production has implied an increase in capacity
utilization from its low level in February 2009 and a resumption of capital expenditures that had been
all but frozen during the trough of the crisis. Private investment grew by 18.5 percent year-on-year
in the second quarter, mostly imported equipment (capital goods imports grew by 32 percent in real
terms over the same period) for machine maintenance and upgrades by existing firms. The prospect
for `greenfield' investments in new plants or by new investors is more limited, although recent
announcements by auto makers bode well for the sector, which is of increasing important to exports
and the economy overall. Remaining excess capacity on a global scale, a related highly competitive
environment for foreign direct investment, and the weight of the ongoing political turmoil and
regulatory uncertainty from the Map Ta Phut and 3G auction court cases will limit the potential
growth rate of investment in the medium term. Construction investment, long subdued, has picked
up modestly thanks to the low interest rate environment and economic recovery. The rebound in
private investment is seen in the first quarter of 2010, when private investment grew by nearly 16
percent.

19.     Public investment grew by 2.7 percent in 2009 and growth is expected to accelerate to
3.2 percent in 2010. Investment projects under two government stimulus packages helped raise
public investment slightly in 2009 ­ around 2.7 percent of total public investment or 0.3 percent of
GDP, but this contribution is expected to pick up in 2010, making up for a reduction of on-budget
investments. The investment budget from the first stimulus package that was carried forward to 2010
is expected to add about THB 11 billion in new public investments, and approximately two-thirds of
the "Thai Kem Kaeng" (TKK) budget is allocated to construction and equipment investments.
Although on-budget capital expenditures of the central government are expected to decrease by 50
percent from the previous year, investment projects under the off-budget stimulus package more than
compensate for this reduction. Slow disbursements in the initial months of 2010 and lower
investment by state-owned enterprises caused public investment to contract in the second quarter.
Nevertheless, an acceleration of public investment growth is expected in the second half of 2010
thanks to the availability of financing for, and advanced stage of, most projects under the TKK
program, as well as a recovery of investments from state-owned enterprises and an increase in the
capital budget.

20.     A recovery in agricultural prices and improved consumer sentiment will support
growth in household consumption in 2010. Household consumption contracted by 1.1 percent in
2009, the first contraction since the 1997 crisis. The global economic crisis affected household
consumption in at least three ways: first, incomes in agriculture, which employs nearly 40 percent of
the workforce, declined in 2009 along with the prices of agricultural commodities; second,
agriculture served as a safety net to workers displaced from the manufacturing and trade-related
sectors, which placed downward pressure on wages and incomes; finally, the crisis affected
consumer confidence. In response to these shocks, the Government implemented a consumption-
focused fiscal stimulus package, which was implemented quickly, and likely prevented a further
decline in consumption. Moreover, as consumer confidence returned in early 2010, accommodative
monetary policy started to have a greater impact as households took advantage of low interest rates to
purchase durable goods, especially autos. As a consequence, household consumption grew a robust
6.5 percent in the second quarter of 2010. Although this was driven by car sales made prior to the
political turmoil, consumer confidence and value-added tax (VAT) receipts have picked up in June
and July from a dip during the crisis. Given base effects and firm agricultural prices, household
consumption should post modest growth in 2010. The Government's farm support schemes have
expanded their reach to more farmers, providing sizeable transfers to a larger number of agricultural
households and further supporting consumption growth in 2010.

21.      A strong rebound in imports is expected to lead to a sharp narrowing of the current
account surplus from 7.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 2.3 percent in 2010. Imports plummeted
25 percent in US dollar terms in 2009, and are expected to jump by 29 percent in 2010 as exports and
equipment investment pick up. Importantly, given that a large portion of manufacturing firms'
inventories are comprised of imported inputs for production, a rebuilding of inventories depleted in
2009 is also likely to drive up imports. The result will be a substantial narrowing of the current
account from 2009, although a surplus is still expected given the sizeable value added of exports
(approximately 50 percent of gross exports) and import prices (especially of energy products) that are
still below the 2008 levels.

22.     As interest rates head higher and the current account surplus persists, the BoT
announced two rounds of measures to promote outflows and help manage pressures on the
exchange rate. Until recently, the BOT managed pressures for exchange rate appreciation by
accumulating reserves and mopping up the resulting liquidity through sterilization. The cost of this
policy has been limited because rates have been at historical lows and credit demand sufficiently
subdued to raise concerns about inflation or asset price bubbles; moreover, foreign inflows were
limited by the heightened political risk. Given the beginning of interest rate normalization (which
leads to an increase of the interest differential with OECD economies) and stabilization of the
political situation, sterilization costs are likely to increase while inflows of foreign capital (and
repatriation of Thai investments) may increase. This has led the Bank of Thailand to announce two
sets of measures to facilitate capital outflows facilitating the operations of regional operating
headquarters and supporting direct investments overseas by Thais. As a result, the financial account
is expected to post outflows in 2010, even as foreign direct investment (FDI) grows at a higher pace
than private investment. Reserves currently cover over about 10 months of imports and are expected
to decline marginally in nominal terms.

23.    The Thai financial and corporate sectors remain sound, and bank balance sheets
continued to strengthen through the crisis. Banks exceed statutory capital adequacy ratios, with
the average capital adequacy ratio standing at 15.8 percent at end-2009, compared to the BIS

               requirement of 8.5 (see Figure 4). Although at the onset of the financial crisis there was a concern
               that asset quality was bound to deteriorate, non-performing loans (NPLs) actually declined ­ gross
               and net NPL to total assets ratios stood at 4.9 and 2.7 percent at year-end, respectively. Large firms
               went into the crisis with strong balance sheets (debt-to-equity ratios had been declining and stood at
               about 3 times at end-2009), which allowed them to withstand the shock to their profits during the
               trough of the crisis. This minimized disruptions during the recovery and allowed firms to post solid
               financial results for 2009 as a whole.

               24.      Despite adequate liquidity in the financial sector, small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
               suffered not only to the shock to sales but also from a lack of credit. Business dissolutions
               peaked in the second quarter of 2009 even as large corporates were returning to profitability,
               reflecting the difficulties encountered by many SMEs that had neither the strong balance sheets of
               large corporates nor access to credit despite plentiful liquidity in the financial system. With the
               improved economic environment and ample room in their balance sheets, banks have increased
               lending in 2010.

               25.      As the economic recovery has consolidated, the BOT has started to raise interest rates
               towards levels compatible with precrisis levels. Monetary policy has sought to be countercyclical
               during the financial crisis, with the policy rate cut to 1.25 percent in early 2009 from 3.75 percent in
               October 2008. The impact of monetary policy on the real economy had been limited, however, given
               the demand-side nature of the economic slowdown. However, as consumers (and banks) became
               more confident of the recovery, credit growth accelerated as a response to low interest rates. The
               consolidation of the economic recovery and recent growth in domestic credit has prompted the BOT
               to start normalizing interest rates, rising to 1.75 percent following two 25 basis points hikes in July

26.     Fiscal policy has been expansionary as the Government responded to the global
financial crisis with two rounds of stimulus measures, but the deficit as a share of GDP is
expected to decline in FY2010. The fiscal deficit spiked in 2009, coming in at THB 376 billion or
4.4 percent of GDP for the fiscal year ended in September. The deficit was driven by the sharp
decline in revenues due to the global financial crisis (accounting for about 2.6 percentage points of
the deficit), the first round of stimulus (1.1 percentage points) and the lower GDP denominator
(0.4 percentage points). The exit from fiscal stimulus is comprised of the expiration of a number of
stimulus measures, a gradual move of other expenditures (especially public investments) into the
budget (and therefore within the government's fiscal rules), and revenue measures that are currently
under study. Implementing a fiscally sustainable stimulus package is a prior action for the operation,
and the stimulus package is evaluated in more detail in Section V. Because of the robust GDP
growth, temporary nature of most consumption measures under the first round of stimulus, tight on-
budget expenditures, and moderate disbursements under the Government's public investment
programs, a lower deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP is expected in FY2010.

27.      Most of the central Government spending in the past few years has been for current
expenditures, notably in the education sector. Central government expenditures averaged
17.8 percent of GDP from 2006-2009 and have been increasing by around 10 percent per year from
2007-2009. Around 75 percent of the total expenditures are for current expenditures. Wages and
salaries account for around a third of the current expenditures or a quarter of total central government
budget. Spending patterns are expected to be similar in FY2010. The largest share of expenditures
each year goes to the education sector (almost one-fourth of total expenditures).

28.     In FY2009, expenditure as a share of GDP for priority areas such as education and
health has increased in line with a higher total spending as a share of GDP. After being stagnant
in FY2008, spending on education and health increased by 0.8 percent in FY2009 (0.2 percent in
health and 0.6 percent in education). This is in line with the increase in the Government's total
expenditures of 3.5 percent of GDP from FY2008 to FY2009 (see Table 3). Expenditures in the
community and social services category posted the highest growth, up by 1.6 percent of GDP, while
economic services rose by 0.2 percent. In FY2009, around THB72.0 billion (or 0.8 percent of GDP)
out of the THB97.55 billion Stimulus Package 1 was spent on social projects. This significantly
helped raise the share of expenditures on the social services in GDP in FY2009 from its FY2008
level. The Stimulus Package 2 which is focused on public infrastructure investments will help offset
the reduction in the Government's capital expenditure in FY2010. A more in-depth analysis through
a Public Financial Management Review (PFMR) is currently being undertaken to review the
expenditures and their effectiveness in greater detail.

29.     Tax collection reforms have helped increase revenues collection modestly since 2002.
Taxes on income and profits, in particular, have been increasing as a share of GDP. This has helped
increase tax revenues from 14.2 percent of GDP in 2002 to over 16 percent in recent years. In
FY2009 (ended September), total revenues stood at 16.2 percent of GDP due to the impact of the
crisis. FY2010 revenues were initially projected to decline further, but thanks to the recovery
revenues have also grown substantially. In the first 8 months of FY2010 (October 2009 ­ May
2010), revenue collection was up 27 percent compared to the previous year. As the economy
continues to grow over the next few years, tax revenues are likely to return to around 17 percent of
GDP as personal and corporate income tax collection efforts continue to improve, helping to offset
lower tax receipts as a result of possible future tax cuts and further rationalization of tariffs.

B.          Fiscal Response to the Financial Crisis and Debt Sustainability
30.     In response to the impact of the global financial crisis, in early-2009 the Government
announced a two-pronged fiscal stimulus strategy. In February 2009, Parliament approved a
supplementary budget of THB116.7 billion, of which THB97.6 billion (US$2.8 billion or 1.1 percent
of 2009 GDP) was used to finance stimulus measures, as well as tax reductions costing around
0.45 percent of GDP. The emphasis of the first round of stimulus was on consumption measures for
quick implementation. In April 2009 the government announced a second round of stimulus known
as the "TKK" (Strong Thailand) program in an amount of THB1.3 trillion over the 2010-2012 period
(averaging 4.5 percent of GDP annually).1 The headline figure includes new and already planned


1
  As discussed elsewhere, the TKK program aims both at maintaining and raising levels of public investment;
therefore, the headline amount was intended as an upper bound on additional deficits that assumed a protracted crisis
and high disbursement rates. Please see Table 5 for an analysis of the additionality of the second round of fiscal
stimulus.

                                                                   12
items from the central government's public investment plan as well as investments by state owned
enterprises. The TKK program emphasizes public investments, especially in small-scale
infrastructure, favoring projects that could be implemented in the three-year timeframe.

31.     The first round of stimulus measures had been largely implemented by September 2009,
while execution of the second round is currently underway. Progress on the stimulus is a prior
action for this operation and is described in paragraphs 72-83. This section assesses the financing of
the fiscal stimulus and its compatibility with fiscal sustainability.

32.      The first round of stimulus was financed through domestic borrowing under the Public
Debt Management Law. Thailand's Public Debt Management Act of 2005 authorizes the
Government to borrow domestically in any fiscal year up to 20 percent of approved expenditures
(including the supplementary budget) plus 80 percent of budgeted principal repayments.2 For 2009,
this ceiling limited borrowing to THB440 billion. Although initially there were concerns that the
Government's financing needs would exceed this ceiling, thanks to a recovery of revenues towards
the end of the fiscal year the deficit came in at THB420 billion, below the borrowing ceiling.

33.      The TKK program was originally intended to be financed outside the budgetary
framework due to the limits imposed by the PDM Act, but projects have been increasingly
moved on-budget as revenues recovered. Because expenditures cannot exceed expected revenues
plus financing, the borrowing ceiling imposed by the Public Debt Management Act effectively limits
expenditures to 125 percent of expected revenues. Since the budget for FY2010 was prepared at the
height of the financial crisis, revenue estimates were low and greatly constrained expenditures. In
light of these severe constraints to the budget envelope and wishing not only to maintain the level of
public investments but also to provide a boost that would stimulate the economy, the Government
decided to finance the TKK program outside the budgetary framework. Thus the borrowing
authority for initial TKK expenditures comes from an Emergency Decree passed in May 2009. An
amount of THB 400 billion was originally authorized, of which THB 50 billion were used to
replenish the Treasury account and THB 15 billion were used to recapitalize certain state-owned
financial institutions. Although the Government originally anticipated the need to borrow an
additional THB 400 billion through another exceptional borrowing authorization, the recovery in
revenues has led many TKK expenditures to be moved back on budget.

34.    The Government's total financing requirements for TKK expenditures in FY2011 may
be as high as THB 470 billion, depending on the pace of implementation of the underlying
projects. Financing requirements after taking into account expected disbursement rates as well as
those projects moved on-budget are estimated to be approximately THB 150 billion. The
Government plans to meet these financing requirements through the remaining funds from the
Emergency Decree, as well as borrowing from official creditors (ADB, JICA and World Bank), to
which a separate borrowing ceiling applies.3 In addition, actual revenues are likely to exceed the
revenue target, which would allow the government to finance additional expenditures through a
supplementary budget. Table 4 below summarizes the Government's financing needs and sources for

  Each year, approximately 3 percent of the overall budget is earmarked for principal repayments, with any
additional principal payments coming due that year being rolled over "off budget". The 80 percent ceiling applies to
the on-budget principal repayments.
3
  In addition to the borrowing ceiling of 20 percent of overall expenditures, the government may borrow up to
10 percent of expenditures from foreign sources.

35.      Foreign borrowing, including from the World Bank is needed to finance the planned
expenditures in FY2011. The FY2011 budget recently approved by Parliament anticipates THB
2.07 trillion (19.8 percent of GDP) in expenditures, including THB 345 billion (about 16.5 percent of
the total budget) in public investments. The budget contains a number of large "headline" increases ­
the announced level of spending represents a 22 percent increase over the FY2010 budget, whereas
the investment budget was announced as an increase of about THB 100 billion (over 60 percent)
from FY2010. However, most of this increase represents TKK investments that have now been
moved on-budget. Without additional financing from multilateral sources such as the World Bank,
the Government would only be able to finance about THB 165 billion out of approximately THB 250
billion in expected TKK expenditures.

36.      A debt sustainability analysis and indicators of market perceptions suggest that the
Government has sufficient fiscal space to implement the stimulus. Under conservative
assumptions (permanent expenditure increases but no new revenue-raising measures with growth
below potential through 2014), Thailand's debt ratios are projected to decline from a peak of
46.6 percent in 2014 to 45.0 percent of GDP by 2020. Reflecting the market's view of the strength of
Thailand's public balance sheets, credit default swap (CDS) spreads and bond yields have remained
at relatively low levels notwithstanding higher deficits and the political turmoil.
37.      Thailand's long track record of fiscal prudence underpins the assumption that deficits
will enter a declining path in FY2012. In FY2010, the budget deficit will decline to about
1.9 percent of GDP from 4.4 percent in FY2009 even after taking into account the fiscal stimulus.5

  Figures are on a cash basis. Differences between cash and GFS bases are small for budgetary balances, but
relatively large (around 1 percent of GDP) for the off-budget balance. This explains most of the differences in
projected fiscal balances in this document compared to fiscal forecasts in the IMF's most recent Article IV report.
5
  The government may indeed run a surplus when the off-budget TKK is excluded. As noted elsewhere, pessimistic
GDP and revenue projections at the time of budget formulation greatly constrained expenditures in FY2010.

                                                                   14
This is in sharp contrast to the 5.5 percent deficit expected in early 2009. While the deficit is
expected to increase in FY2011, the analysis suggests that Government can afford the stimulus
package without jeopardizing debt sustainability as deficits are expected to decline starting in
FY2012.This assumption is supported by the Thai Government's consistent pursuit of a conservative
fiscal stance of low budget deficits or surpluses. Since 2002, budget deficits were no more than
2 percent of GDP and the primary balance was in surplus twice between 2005 and 2008. In addition,
the Ministry of Finance has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the bureau of the
budget committing to balancing the budget within five years.

38.      As a result of Thailand's prudent fiscal stance, public debt stocks had been declining
until the onset of the financial crisis and the debt composition had been managed to minimize
the impact of external shocks. Public and publicly-guaranteed debt, including non-guaranteed debt
of state-owned enterprises, has been falling as a share of GDP from a peak of 58 percent in 2000 to
38 percent at end-2008. Due to the financial crisis, debt levels rose to 44 percent at end-2009, but
remain below the 60-percent indicative ceiling under Thailand's fiscal sustainability framework and
earlier forecasts. The composition of the debt stock has also shifted. Foreign-currency debt, which
accounted for about 39 percent of public debt in 1999, was reduced to about 10 percent of the
portfolio by end-2009. In addition, 40 percent of the government's external debt has been swapped
back into local currency, so that risks from exchange rate fluctuations are minimal. There has also
been a move towards issuing fixed-rate government bonds, therefore minimizing risks from interest
rate volatility. The average time to maturity had been increasing, but due to the financial crisis the
Government was forced to borrow primarily in shorter tenors in 2009. The maturity profile started to
be extended again in 2010.

39.     The baseline scenario is relatively conservative, assuming a return to pre-crisis levels of
growth only by 2014, permanently higher expenditures and no new revenue-raising measures.
In addition to the projections described in Table 4 above, the baseline scenario assumes that real
GDP growth converges to its potential of 5.0 percent by 2014 and the primary public sector balance
moderates to a deficit of two percent of GDP ­ above historical averages of about 0.8 percent of
GDP. This permanent increase in the deficit is driven by the government's adoption of new social
policies (some initiated as part of the stimulus package) while as a conservative assumption revenues
as a share of GDP are only expected to (slowly) return to pre-crisis levels. The baseline scenario
incorporates the impact of the stimulus packages, which can be seen in the high budget deficit of
2009-2012 averaging 3.0 percent of GDP, well above the post-98 crisis average of 0.9 percent of
GDP. Levels of new foreign and domestic borrowing are consistent with the Government's proposed
funding sources.

40.     Thailand's external debt is owed primarily to official creditors and is therefore at
below-market terms. Even considering the projected shift in financing towards a greater share of
external debt and ignoring the fact that much of the external debt has been hedged, Thailand's public
external debt-to-GDP ratio does not exceed 17 percent under the most severe standard shock (an
unlikely 30 percent depreciation). This is in contrast to foreign reserves amounting to 48 percent of
GDP. Given Thailand's high levels of exports, debt-to-export ratios are very low.

41.     Overall external debt (both public and private) is also low at 26 percent of GDP (US$74
billion). About 40 percent of the external debt is short-term, but trade credits represent almost two-
thirds of private short-term debt, while another 18 percent are inter-company loans. Public external
debt (primarily owed by state-owned enterprises) comprises 19 percent of total external debt and


                                                 15
only 1.9 percent is short-term. External debt service ratios are manageable at 5.2 percent of exports
overall and total external debt was 51 percent of international reserves as of end-March 2010.

42.     Under the baseline scenario, Thailand's public debt-to-GDP ratio does not exceed 46
percent of GDP and ratios start to decline (albeit slowly) in 2015. After an initial spike due to the
substantial financing needs that arise from the fiscal stimulus, debt ratios resume their downward
trend. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be approximately 45 percent of GDP by 2020 following
a peak of 46.6 percent in 2014. The slow decline under the baseline arises from conservative
assumptions on fiscal balances, which remain lower than their post-financial crisis average
throughout the projection period. Debt projections are substantially lower compared to April 2009,
indicating the magnitude of the recovery.

43.     Public debt sustainability is resilient to worse-than-expected outcomes in 2011-2012, but
a permanent shock to growth could lead to an upward path of public debt. The Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) considered the effect on debt ratios of (i) a real GDP contraction of
0.9 percent in FY2011; (ii) a 30 percent nominal depreciation of the Thai baht; (iii) the realization of
contingent liabilities adding up to ten percent of GDP; and (iv) a combination of the growth and
exchange rate shocks (Table 5). The contingent liability shock is the most severe, leading the debt-
to-GDP ratio to peak at 55 percent, but favorable debt dynamics lead to a declining debt path. The
greatest risks to debt sustainability come from protracted growth slowdown and lack of fiscal
consolidation following the resumption of growth. If primary deficits remain at 1.5 percent of GDP
­ high for historical standards but almost 1 percentage point of GDP below FY2009 levels ­ the debt-
to-GDP ratio would remain on a rising trend in the longer term and would exceed 50 percent by the
end of the projection period. The scenario with permanently low growth also leads to rapidly
increasing debt ratios. This emphasizes the importance of taking advantage of the crisis to enhance
competitiveness and ensure a return to sustainable growth.

44.      Market indicators confirm Thailand's strong financial position. When the global
financial crisis struck, Thailand was clearly perceived as less risky than some of its regional peers
(reflected in Figure 6 as the sharp decline in Q3 2008). As the recovery took hold and financial
conditions in Korea and Indonesia normalized, Thailand's credit default swap (CDS) spreads
declined less rapidly than in those countries, before rising slightly in April and May 2010 on account
of the political turmoil. CDS spreads have declined since May and remained stable at levels well
below their peaks during the crisis; spreads are comparable to Korea, 20 ­ 30 bps higher than China
and Malaysia, and about 40 bps lower than the Philippines and Indonesia. Similarly, Thailand's
government bond yield curve has been generally stable (especially in the more liquid intermediate
segment of the curve between 3 and 7 years) and driven primarily by the overall interest rate
environment, suggesting that markets have not placed a risk premium on the Government's debt as a
result of expansionary fiscal policies (Figure 7).

45.      In conclusion, risks to fiscal sustainability are low, and the macroeconomic policy
framework is adequate. The financial crisis and resulting policy response put considerable stress
on the macroeconomic balances and the political turmoil in 2009-10 made the macro challenge more
difficult. However, Thailand's history of prudent macroeconomic management, conservative public
debt management and liquid financial sector provided ample space to respond. The financing plan is
prudent in accessing reasonably priced debt. As will be discussed in Section V, the stimulus has
been mostly temporary with most tax and transfer provisions having a sunset clause and the
remainder comprised of social and infrastructure expenditures that may be accommodated even
without revenue measures.

               46.      The roots of the recent political crisis go back to at least 2001. The Thai Rak Thai (TRT)
               Party, headed by Thaksin Shinawatra, was elected by a landslide that January, a first for Thailand's
               democracy which has been characterized by short-lived coalition governments. Thaksin's
               Government was the first to serve a full four-year term and was re-elected by another overwhelming
               majority in 2005. Opponents gathered under the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) and began
               a series of public protests, accusing Thaksin's Government of favoritism, corruption and conflict of
               interest. In September 2006, a bloodless coup overthrew the TRT Party and appointed an interim
               Government, which oversaw the drafting of the 2007 Constitution. An interim Constitutional
               Tribunal was also installed. In May 2007, the Tribunal dissolved the TRT and three other political
               parties found guilty of violations of electoral laws. Former TRT members then regrouped under a
               new name, the People's Power Party (PPP), contested in the December 2007 election, and emerged
               as the head of a Coalition Government.

               47.     The political crisis escalated in August 2008 and the situation remained tense through
               December that year. The Coalition Government was led by PPP leader Samak Sundaravej. In
               May, 2008, the PAD, which had set the stage for the 2006 coup, returned to the streets to protest an
               attempt to amend the Constitution and grant amnesty to banned politicians, including Mr. Thaksin.
               In August, they stormed the National Broadcasting Corp. headquarters, which they accused of being
               the mouthpiece of the pro-Thaksin Government, and successfully seized Government House. In
               September, Mr. Samak was forced out on a conflict of interest charge and Mr. Thaksin's brother-in-
               law, Somchai Wongsawat, took over as Prime Minister. In October, a clash between the police and
               the PAD near Parliament left two persons dead and about three hundred injured. Then in November,
               the PAD seized the public areas of Bangkok's airports leading to their closure and paralyzing
               Thailand's air traffic for almost two weeks, causing substantial losses for Thailand's tourism and
               export industries.




                                                                                                                                                 19
48.     In December 2008, the Constitutional Court ruled to dissolve the PPP and two other
coalition parties, leading to the end of the airport occupation and the formation of a new,
Democrat-led government. The three parties were dissolved for electoral fraud and their executives
were banned from politics for 5 years. With the expectation that PPP would be dissolved, a new
political party called Puea Thai (For Thai) had been set up and PPP members unaffected by the Court
ruling quickly joined. Puea Thai became the main opposition party in parliament after the House of
Representatives voted to elect Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the Democrat Party, as the new Prime
Minister. Mr. Vejjajiva then formed a coalition government with five smaller parties.

49.     The new Government was met with sustained protests. The United Front for Democracy
against Dictatorship (UDD) emerged in 2006 as an anti-coup movement which supported
Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra. The UDD now backed Puea Thai and launched its protests against the
Government in early 2009 on the argument that the Government did not have an electoral mandate.
UDD protests disrupted the East Asian Summit in the coastal city of Pattaya, followed by three days
of violence in Bangkok. Smaller protests in the provinces continued through the year.

50.     In 2010, the UDD occupied two areas of Bangkok with symbolic and commercial value,
culminating in two military operations in April and May. After the Supreme Court ordered the
seizure of US$1.4 billion of Mr. Thaksin's assets in February 2010, the UDD launched another round
of protests against the Government. In March, thousands of protesters began occupying an area in an
old part of Bangkok near Democracy Monument, and two weeks later they occupied Rajprasong
intersection, the city's upmarket shopping district. They also briefly invaded Parliament. These
actions prompted the Government to declare a state of emergency in Bangkok on April 7th. Three
days later, an attempt to disperse the protesters from the area near Democracy Monument resulted
several fatalities, including military officers and a Japanese journalist. UDD then consolidated its
presence at Rajprasong, effectively shutting down much of Bangkok's central business district. The
following month of UDD protests was marked by occasional episodes of violence. After
negotiations failed, the Government launched a military operation to clear protesters off the site on
May 19th. Following a week of street battles as well as concerted arson attacks at a number of
commercial buildings in Bangkok, the military was able to restore order. Subsequently, Bangkok has
remained relatively calm, however, there are occasional security incidents.

51.      The Government is currently working on a national reconciliation plan, which may
involve early elections. The Government has formed several committees to establish what happened
during the recent crackdown and to chart a path for national reconciliation. It has also gradually
lifted the state of emergency across the country although it is still in effect for Bangkok and UDD
leaders remain under arrest. The Prime Minister has spoken of the possibility of holding elections
earlier than the end of 2011, but only if conditions are appropriate. Both the UDD and Puea Thai
Party, however, questioned the impartiality of the committees and accused the Government of trying
to buy time. Another complicating factor is that the Democrat Party is presently on trial for alleged
misuse of campaign finance funds and, if found guilty, may face dissolution. The Democrat Party is
also being charged separately of allegedly accepting illegal donations, which may lead to penalties
for party executives but would not lead to dissolution. The possibility of further tension and violence
remains.

52.    At the same time, a violent separatist movement insurgency continues in the three
southernmost provinces (Pattani, Yala and Narathivas). Since January 2004, insurgency
movements have killed more than 3,000 people and affected thousands of women and children

                                                  20
from the ethnic Malay minority group in these three provinces. Even though violence has
concentrated largely in the three provinces, it has occasionally slipped into other areas of the
country. In 2009, the Government approved the "Five Southern Border Provinces Special Areas
Development Plan" with a budget of THB 73.5 billion (US$2.3 billion). The plan has six
components: (i) plan to upgrade people's income and quality of life; (ii) plan to restore justice
and security; (iii) plan to standardize social services; (iv) plan to boost the economy and
investment; (v) plan to develop economic links with Malaysia; and (vi) plan to improve local
administrative effectiveness.

53.    On the international front, resolving the long-standing border dispute between
Thailand and Cambodia remains a challenging task. However, the danger of this dispute
escalating into an armed conflict has receded. The dispute is over the 900-year old Preah
Vihear temple and a patch of neighboring territory. Littered with landmines left over from
decades of war in Cambodia, the Thai-Cambodia border has never been fully demarcated and
occasional disputes have caused border shutdowns in the past two decades. In October 2009, the
dispute turned deadly after a clash between Thai and Cambodian troops along the border killed
two people. Cambodia has sought to bring the situation to ASEAN and to the UN for mediation
while Thailand has insisted that the issue is bilateral. As of August 2010, however, tensions
have eased markedly after Mr. Shinawatra resigned as an economic advisor to Prime Minister
Hun Sen. The two countries' Ambassadors have resumed their duties.

54.      Notwithstanding political differences, there is greater consensus on economic policy
issues among the political parties, which has enabled the economic reforms to continue.
The political instability and uncertainty in Thailand is driven primarily by a competition for
power among differing factions and stakeholder groups rather than by a clash of ideologies. In
fact, all the major groupings subscribe to private sector-led development, almost all parties have
now endorsed most of the programs introduced by the first Thaksin government (in particular
universal health care) and most parties agree, at least nominally, on the importance of improving
governance. Thailand also has a strong bureaucracy which has not been significantly impacted
by the political uncertainties and recognizes the importance of continued reforms to enhance
Thailand's competitiveness, and reduce poverty and inequality. As a result--and even over the
past several years of political instability and frequent changes in government--Thailand has
continued to move ahead with the design and implementation of a steady stream of reforms
across a broad range of issues and areas, including poverty reduction, the financial and corporate
sectors, improving the business and investment environments, trade, public sector, governance
and social protection. The longevity of the reform movement speaks to the extent to which the
changes have been owned by senior members of the bureaucracy and the professionalism of the
top tier of the Thai civil service, as well as to a broad level of consensus about these reforms
among all political parties.

III.   THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PRIORITIES

55.     The RTG has implemented a sustained program of reforms, which were initiated after
the Asian financial crisis. Key reforms were in the areas of public financial management and
service delivery, national competitiveness, and social protection and health. From 2002-2005, the
reforms were spear-headed by the TRT Government under Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and
supported by the bureaucracy. These programs were carried-on by the line ministries and agencies

                                               21
even after the replacement of the TRT Government by the military Government in September 2006.
Implementation of the reforms has been continued by the military Government in 2007 and
subsequently by the PPP Government in 2008 and the current Democrat Party Government. The
continuity in the reform program suggests that there is broad ownership of the program.
Nevertheless, the political instability has inevitably had an impact. This is most clear where
legislative changes are needed, for example with the delay in procurement reforms and the passage of
the Public Financial Act.

A.      Public Financial Management and Service Delivery
56.     Thailand's recent efforts to comprehensively reform the public sector started after the
1998 Asian financial crisis and have been sustained since then. The efforts were supported by
key legislative documents ­ the 1997 Constitution and the Public Administration Act (2002), and the
Royal Decree on Good Public Sector Governance (2003). In 2002, the Public Sector Reform
Committee was replaced by the Public Sector Development Commission established by the Public
Administration Act (2002), which was promulgated that year. The Act also established the Office of
the Public Sector Development Commission (OPDC) as the secretariat and the implementing agency
for the Public Sector Development Commission. In 2003, the Cabinet approved the Strategic Plan
for the Thai Public Sector Development (2003-2007), and the follow-on Strategic Plan for the Thai
Public Sector Development (2008-2012) was approved in 2008.

57.     The impetus for reforms in public financial management (PFM) was supported by the
2007 Constitution which mandated more comprehensive public financial management
framework, transparency and disclosure of public finances. It also stipulated the drafting and
enactment of a Public Finance Act that would bring about the improvements to the PFM system,
especially with regards to fiscal transparency. The Act has now been drafted and awaits enactment
by Parliament.

58.     In addition, the 10th 5-year National Economic and Social Development Plan (2007-
2011) also has a strategy of good governance as one of the 5 national strategies. This is the first
time for good governance to be explicitly included the 5-year plan. Moreover the 4-year
Government's Public Administration Management Plan (PAMP) also has good governance as one of
the 9 policy areas that the government will pursue. Supporting this set of reforms is the focus of this
PSRDPL.

B.      Improving National Competitiveness
59.     A parallel set of reforms have focused on improving national competitiveness.           These
are as follows:

     (a) Improving productivity and moving towards a knowledge economy. Thailand has continued
         to make progress in improving its trade and investment regimes. The country undertook
         major tariff restructuring from 2003, and signed a number of free-trade agreements, for
         example, with Australia in 2005 and Japan in 2007. To improve the investment regime,
         bureaucratic processes were streamlined through the overall reform in public sector services.
         The Board of Investment (BOI) moved towards seeking investments (both domestic and
         foreign) that promote knowledge creation, skills development, technology transfer, and
         innovation. An ICT Ministry was also established in October 2002 with the specific
         responsibility to plan, promote and coordinate the development of information and
         communication technology within Thailand. The Tenth National Economic and Social

                                                  22
         Development Plan (2007-2011) has specific chapters on moving Thailand towards a
         knowledge-based economy as well as the improving Thailand's productivity. Following the
         Tenth Plan, the Government has drawn up an Industrial Productivity Master Plan aimed at
         improving productivity of the industrial sector6.

    (b) Financial and corporate sector development and legal reform. Following the considerable
        financial sector reform effort in the immediate post-crisis period, reforms aimed at further
        liberalization of the sector have continued at a more cautious pace in recent years but have
        still been sufficient to ensure further substantial reductions in financial vulnerability and
        improvements in the health and profitability of Thai firms and banks. Moreover, the
        implementation of the Financial Sector Master Plan (Phase I)7 also helped to further
        strengthen the structure of the financial sector. The BOT has been strengthening its
        supervisory policies, procedures and practices and moving to a more risk-focused supervisory
        regime; and the Department of Insurance8 has taken steps to improve its methods and
        capacity to supervise insurance companies. Voluntary debt workout mechanisms were
        established and new lending on a risk adjusted basis has been facilitated by the establishment
        of the Real Estate Information Center (REIC) and the new Credit Information Bureau Law.
        Important accounting and corporate governance changes have been introduced. The market
        infrastructure of the Thai capital markets has also been reformed considerably, progress has
        been made on promoting the supply side of the domestic bond market and a second phase of
        the Capital Market Master Plan has been proposed. Several financial acts were enacted in
        December of 2007. They are the Financial Institutions Business Act, Deposit Insurance
        Institutions Act, and a new Bank of Thailand Act. The ADB has been providing support to
        improve functioning and supervision of capital market. Finally, a modular Financial Sector
        Assessment Paper (FSAP) is being conducted jointly between the World Bank and the IMF
        to assess the government-owned Specialized Financial Institutions.

    (c) Infrastructure development. Over the last few decades, economic infrastructure ­ including
        energy, transport, water and sanitation, and telecommunications ­ has played an important
        role in supporting Thailand's growth and development. However, since the 1997 financial
        crisis new investment in infrastructure has dropped significantly; and the growing demand for
        infrastructure services and concern about declining national competitiveness has again placed
        infrastructure high on the Government's development agenda. To address this challenge, the
        Tenth Five Year Plan gives strong emphasis on infrastructure, logistics and cluster
        development, and line agencies have prepared or are preparing investment programs to meet
        the rising demand. Attention now needs to be focused on improved clarity in infrastructure
        financing policy and improvement of the infrastructure prioritization and delivery process.
        There are also important capacity building needs for the newly established regulatory
        agencies.



6
  Some of the findings from the joint NESDB-WB reports Thailand Investment Climate Study I & II (2006 & 2009) and Towards
a Knowledge Economy in Thailand (2008) were incorporated in the Plan.
7
  Currently, the government is working on the draft of the Financial Sector Master Plan Phase II which will continue to promote
better environment for financial sector development through simplifying laws and regulations; improving financial data base; and
developing risk management and human capital in the financial sector.
8
  In September 2007, Department of Insurance was transformed into the Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) under the
Insurance Regulation and Promotion Commission Act.


                                                              23
C.      Increasing social protection and health policy reforms
60.     The 1997 financial crisis highlighted weaknesses in the formal social protection system.
Subsequently, improvements have been made in the coverage as well as the efficiency of existing
government programs. However, formal social protection mechanisms continue to have very limited
coverage. To better protect those in the informal sector, in 2004, Parliament passed regulations that
gave access to labor protection to home-workers and agricultural workers. The Government also
introduced some large and ambitious programs for those in the informal sector, such as the universal
health coverage scheme (launched in 2001), the "one-million baht village/urban fund", the grants to
small-medium-large villages (SML), the Ua-athorn low-cost housing programs, and the income-
generating One Tambon, One Product scheme.

61.      The Government has introduced a number of additional social protection policies in
response to the economic and political crises. The Government has implemented a key reform to
its agricultural support schemes, replacing a `crop mortgage' scheme that was widely believed to be
inefficient with a .crop price insurance scheme, which according to the Government has reached
4 million farmers, of which 3.5 million received compensation under the scheme. The Government
has also launched a program to refinance debts of people who owed money to loan sharks (while
giving amnesty to the loan sharks). This is being done through the Government Savings Bank and
Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC), and 800,000 people have registered.
Once the beneficiaries repay the new (government-granted) loan, the amount becomes a line of credit
that can be used in the future so that the individuals do not have to resort to loan sharks. Finally, the
Government has proposed introducing a national savings/pension scheme whereby the Government
contributes matching funds up to THB 100 per month to individual contributions. The idea is to
cover many/most of the 40 million workers who are not members of the formal social security
scheme.

62.     Maintaining appropriate levels of health financing remains a key priority in Thailand.
The public sector finances about half of all health expenditures, and about 95 percent of Thais have
access to comprehensive health insurance coverage provided by Social Health Insurance Fund
scheme for formal sector employees, Civil Servants Medical Benefit Scheme for civil servants and
their dependants, and Universal Coverage Scheme (UC) administered by National Health Security
Office to cover informal sector and the poor. UC, also popularly known as "30 Baht per visit
scheme" provides coverage for 75 percent of the population and is financed through general budget
outlay that is negotiated annually. UC has dramatically increased utilization rates and reduced
catastrophic out of pocket costs for health services, but at significant cost. Although Thailand has
achieved remarkable success in controlling infectious disease, emerging burden of chronic disease
and advancing medical technologies will increase demand and cost of public health insurance
schemes.

IV.     BANK'S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A.      Thailand's Interim Strategy Note
63.      The Interim Strategy Note prepared concurrently with this operation has two pillars:
(i) assisting the country to recover from the economic crisis; and (ii) helping improve Thailand's
competitiveness and sustainable development. This operation is at the center of the Bank's support
in responding to the economic crisis, with financing as well as the support to the fiscal stimulus. The
public sector reforms are an important component of the second pillar in improving the quality and
efficiency of Thailand's public expenditures.

                                                   24
B.      Analytical Underpinnings
64.      The design of the operation is underpinned by findings of the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment (2009), analytical work being undertaken in
context of the on-going Public Expenditure Review (PER) (2010), review of the Results-Based
Management system in Thailand, as well as from technical assistance under the CDP-G. The
PEFA assessment pointed to the strengths and weaknesses in Thailand's public financial
management framework and has helped focus the reform program supported by the PSRDPL on
addressing identified weaknesses. The on-going PER is analyzing issues related to service delivery
at the local level, and as part of this process, developing a database of local authority expenditures by
sector across the country for all 7,500 local authorities. The Bank also mobilized experts on budget
formulation and service delivery, to work with government on an assessment of the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) process, public administration reform program and service delivery
reforms, and to identify critical areas of reform focus for the PSRDPL. This work has helped
identify key reform areas for this PSRDPL that will assist Thailand continuing down the reform path
and address remain challenges and capitalize on strengths.

65.      In addition to the substantial analytical work undertaken since lending to Thailand
ceased, the World Bank and the MOF have also been collaborating extensively on improving
the public financial management (PFM) system for timely and transparent implementation of
the Government's second Stimulus Package. In response to a request from the MOF, the World
Bank provided: (i) just-in-time policy note and technical assistance on improving the e-Auctions
system for timely execution of projects; (ii) technical assistance on implementation of a government-
wide Project Financial Management System (PFMS) which links financial information from the
Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) with physical progress
information from respective agencies, and discloses the information at www.tkk2555.com; and
(iii) advisory services on monitoring and evaluation system for improved results monitoring of the
government's stimulus package. This PSRDPL incorporates key issues and recommendations from
this analytical and advisory work.

66.     The World Bank has been providing technical advice on improving accuracy of
reporting from GFMIS and unification of the Chart of Accounts (COA). In this regard an
analysis of the COA and operational effectives of the GFMIS was conducted in collaboration with
the Comptroller General's Department, and work on unification of the COA and enhancing
operational effectiveness of GFMIS remains on-going. The design of this Operation builds on the
analysis conducted GFMIS and issues relating to the COA.




                                                   25
                      Box 1: Thailand's Public Sector Reform and World Bank's Support
            In 1999, the Bank granted a US$400 million Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL) and a US$20 million
    Economic Management Assistance Loan (EMAL) to Thailand to develop and implement the public sector
    reform program focusing on strategic performance-based budgeting and results-based management in the
    public. After the PSRL closed in 2002, the Bank moved to a knowledge partnership and in mid-2001 began
    its Country Development Partnership with Thailand on Governance and Public Sector Reform (CDP-G I).
    CDP-G I a non-lending program of technical assistance, capacity building and knowledge sharing had the
    same five components as those in the PSRL: expenditure management, revenue management, civil service
    reform, decentralization, and cross-government accountability and transparency. The CDP-G I, which was
    primarily funded by various trust funds, ended in 2003 and was succeeded by CDP-G II which was primarily
    funded by the ASEM Trust Fund which was aimed at public sector reforms aimed at poverty reduction.
    CDP-G II focused on 3 thematic areas: improving resource management for poverty reduction, enhancing
    service delivery and strengthening governance, and strengthening external monitoring and evaluation of the
    public sector. The ongoing CDP-G III continues support in the same five broad thematic areas as the PSRL:
    (a) expenditure management; (b) revenue management; (c) public administration and civil service reform;
    (d) intergovernmental relations and local government capacity; and (e) external accountability organizations.
    The CDP-G III will span three years (2008-2011), as with other country development partnership programs
    in Thailand.9 Significant part of the analytical work on public sector reform and governance has been
    directly supporting strengthening of oversight bodies, as well as the public administration in general.
    Technical assistance has also been provided unification of the chart of accounts and improving operations of
    GFMIS. Fiduciary was also supported by two IDF Grants: (i) Improving the Effectiveness of Public
    Procurement; and (ii) Institutional Strengthening of the Office of the Auditor General and Performance in
    Public Audits. Notwithstanding the deeply divided political landscape, the World Bank's work is to support
    the role of the public sector in promoting durable reforms, and the oversight bodies, in helping to improve
    governance.
             Preparation of the PSRDPL allowed a deepening of the analytical partnership with the completion of
    a PEFA assessment and initiation of a Public Expenditure Review (PER). Key actions from this analytical
    work have been incorporated into the Government's reform program going forward. This sustained
    involvement with Thailand's public sector reform program makes the preparation of this loan possible. Two
    reforms include introduction of a performance based pay system for the civil service, and the certification of
    Government Accounts by the Auditor General for the first time since 2005 following improved reconciliation
    of accounts. Annex 5 provides a more detailed list of the activities supported under the CDP-Gs that directly
    link to the program matrix proposed for this PSRDPL.


67.     Preparation of the PSRDPL also benefited from recent work from other institutions
including the IMF and the OECD. The Fiscal Risk Disclosure and Management Report (IMF,
2008) points to challenges faced by Thailand on managing fiscal risks, and points to areas of
improvements. The Financial Accountability Report (OAG Thailand, 2007), prepared with support
from the World Bank, reviewed the overall budget execution system and financial reporting
framework and highlighted areas requiring further improvements. The Budgeting in Thailand Report
(OECD, 2006) provided an assessment of the budget planning process along with areas that the
budgeting reform could focus. The IMF implemented the Report on Observance of Standards and
Codes ­ Data Module (IMF, 2006) which confirmed that Thailand is in observance of the special
data dissemination standards (SDDS), meeting the specifications for coverage, periodicity, timeliness
and periodicity allowed by the SDDS. The Fiscal Discipline and Sustainability study (BOB, 2006)
analyzed the fiscal sustainability issues facing Thailand and how the medium term fiscal/expenditure

    There are currently three other on-going CDPs: CDP-Environment, CDP-Infrastructure, and CDP-Health.

                                                        26
framework approach could address those issues. The IMF has prepared a Report on Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC, 2009) on fiscal transparency. This operation has also taken into
account the issues identified in this report.

C.      Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors
68.     Since the prepayment of the IMF loan in 2003, Thailand's relationship with the IMF
has been mainly through the Article IV consultations. The last Article IV consultations took
place in September 2010 and noted the importance of sustaining growth through continued public
investments in infrastructure, a conclusion that is consistent with the PSRDPL. The IMF's
macroeconomic projections are largely consistent with the analysis presented in this document with
relatively small difference in the deficit projections10.

69.     There has been active coordination with ADB and JICA who are providing parallel
financing in the preparation of the PSRDPL. ADB has been providing technical advices to
government in the area of capital market development, and the ADB Board approved a US$300
million budget support operation on September 21, 2010. The Government has also requested ADB
to provide US$300 million in new investment projects. In addition, JICA has been requested for
US$300 million for climate change support, and two new investment projects worth US$140
million11.

V.      THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM

70.      The proposed PSRDPL supports the Government's immediate response to the financial
crisis through the fiscal stimulus packages, as well as key elements of the Government's on-
going public sector reform program. This section first reviews the fiscal stimulus consisting of a
package announced in January 2009 and the outline of a second package announced in May 2009.
This is followed by a review of the Government's public sector reform program in the following
areas: (i) budget formulation and execution; (ii) reporting and accounting; (iii) internal control,
internal and external audit; (iv) debt management; (v) governance and the anti-corruption framework;
(vi) results based management; and (vii) civil service administration.

71.     The World Bank's technical support to this program has covered selective aspects of all
of these areas. Policy notes on good practice in designing a stimulus and monitoring and
implementation were prepared to support implementation of the stimulus. Support for budgeting
reform included an assessment of performance based budgeting and the MTEF process in Thailand.
Support for budget reporting included technical assistance to facilitate unification of the chart of
accounts. An assessment of the internal control regime as well as IDF grants for procurement and
the office of the auditor general are examples of support for internal and external audit. A more
detailed account of Bank support to Thailand's public sector reform program can be found in Box 1
and Annex 5.

   The differences in projections of the deficit come from differences in projection of the off-budget balance, and
Bank projection in 2011 of foreign financed expenditure.

A.      The Fiscal Stimulus Package
72.     In January and May 2009, the Government announced two rounds of fiscal stimulus
totaling THB 1.53 trillion (US$47.8 billion) over the fiscal years 2009-2012. The actual
disbursement in FY2009 amounted to THB 134.2 billion (1.5 percent of GDP, see Table 6). For
2010-2012, the Government initially announced a broad outline of areas expected to be supported
together with some details of specific projects. This program is known as the Thai Kem Kaeng
(TKK). The headline figure of THB 1.4 trillion (average of 4.8 percent of GDP per year) included
already-planned public investments that could not be accommodated on the budget (the Government
on-budget for capital expenditure in FY2010 had to be cut by almost half; see discussion above), and
spending by state owned enterprises and government agencies. Therefore, additional investment
spending from the stimulus packages in FY2010 contributed 1.5 percent of GDP. Our estimates
(table 5) are that the additional spending by the central government and state-owned enterprises for
2010-2012 is between 0.6-1.5 percent of GDP per year.

73.     For FY2009, the stimulus measures largely consisted of transfers and tax measures
aimed to stimulate domestic demand and mitigate the impact on low-income individuals.
Transfers include a one-time transfer of THB 2,000 (US$57) per person to 8.1 million workers
registered with the social security system and 1.3 civil servants receiving a monthly salary of less
than THB 15,000 (US$430), monthly transfers of THB 500 (US$14) per person to 3.8 million elderly
who currently do not receive another form of pension or transfer, full subsidy on education for
15 years (kindergarten to grade 12 or vocational school) for around 11.8 million students, and an
allowance of THB 600 (US$17) per month to each of the 987,000 community healthcare volunteers.
In addition, free training programs for 240,000 unemployed were provided with a total stipend of
THB 4,800 (US$137) per person for 3 months. At the community level, through the Sufficiency
Economy Fund (formerly known as SML Village program), THB 15.2 billion (US$434 million) have
been allocated to the 78,300 villages and communities in Thailand. The villages and communities
will need to submit proposals for the use of the funds and will receive the transfer once their
proposals are approved. In addition, subsidies on transportation and utilities were initially provided
for 6 months (February to July 2009) and extended for another 5 months (August to December 2009;
they have been subsequently extended through the end of 2010). The subsidies include electricity and
water subsidy for households with low usage, fare waiver on many routes of non-air-conditioned
public buses in Bangkok, fare waiver on third class train rides, and subsidy of cooking gas for
household use.

74.     The first stimulus package was reasonably well implemented in FY2009, meeting most
of the four "Ts" (timely, temporary, targeted and transparent) that characterize well-designed
packages. While the impact of the first stimulus package on overall GDP is likely to have been
modest, the consumption-focused measures likely prevented a further decline in consumption as they
were implemented on a timely basis. Nearly 99 percent of the planned transfer and tax measures
were disbursed, while about 50 percent of planned infrastructure projects such as the construction of
rural roads and small irrigation projects were disbursed, leading to an overall disbursement rate of the
stimulus packages in FY2009 of 83 percent. The implementation of the second round of stimulus has
been less timely due to its focus on infrastructure projects. Although measures were imperfectly
targeted (given the focus on timeliness of implementation), some programs, especially the 500-baht
pension to the elderly who were not enrolled in social security, likely supported the livelihoods of
vulnerable households. The stimulus package proved to contain mostly temporary measures, but
some programs were incorporated in the regular budget. The program was transparently implemented
through a supplementary budget, which was appreciated and approved by the parliament. The quality

                                                  28
of the fiscal stimulus also matters, and a preliminary review of the quality of Thailand's package is
provided below.

75.     The second fiscal stimulus for 2010-2012 comprises mainly of infrastructure projects.
The total planned spending is THB 1.48 trillion (US$45 billion), of which THB 54.9 billion
represents carry-overs from FY2009, in particularly the small infrastructure projects and Sufficiency
Economy Fund. Four-fifths of the total package was originally targeted for infrastructure
investments, primarily for transport and logistics, by the central government and state-owned
enterprises, and the remaining are for transfers and capacity building programs (see Table 6). This
will add around 0.6 to 1.5 percent of GDP to government and state-own enterprises' spending from
FY2010-2012. The details of projects included in this stimulus package were approved by the
Cabinet in May 2009 and implementation began in the last quarter of FY2009 (July-September
2009).

76.     Implementation of the infrastructure-focused stimulus in FY2010 so far has been slow,
reflecting the challenge of implementing these projects. Measures taken to speed up
implementation together with the seasonal factors have accelerated implementation. The stimulus
package in FY2010 amounts to THB 467 billion (US$14 billion) or 5.0 percent of GDP. As of
March 2010, total actual disbursement against budget approval projects is around 27 percent or THB
93 billion, of which one half is the bullet payment projects consisting of Price Insurance Scheme,
recapitalization to state owned Islamic Bank and Village Fund Project. Only 13 percent of actual
disbursement has been done on the infrastructure investment projects. However, with the cabinet
resolution requesting project managers whose budget were already allocated to complete their
procurement process by end of March 2010, together with the seasonal factors on disbursement
where most projects finish their procurement process in the first quarter is gradually bringing
implementation back on track.

77.      Financing for TKK projects will increasingly come from budgetary resources. Because
the Public Debt Management Act limits on-budget expenditures to 125 percent of government
revenues, the sharp upward revision of revenue projections thanks to the economic recovery has
implied a proportional increase in the on-budget fiscal space. Therefore, although the TKK continues
to exist as a separate program, projects under the program are increasingly expected to be moved on-
budget in order to be financed through regular budgetary means as authorized under the existing
PDM Act. This reduces or eliminates the need to seek special borrowing authority from Parliament
for off-budget borrowing. It may also increase parliamentary oversight over the projects, as the
projects will be formally endorsed by Parliament as part of regular budgetary approval. However,
perhaps because of the original lack of formal parliamentary oversight, transparency of projects
under the TKK program was already greater than that observed in the past for on-budget public
investments as described below.

78.     Attention has been paid to transparency and oversight although the stimulus program
has not been without controversy. There have been public announcements with detailed
information on how the programs would be implemented and how the beneficiaries of the programs
can access them. This was done through websites, media, and public events as well as direct contact
with the beneficiaries in some cases. A website (www.tkk2555.com) has been developed to provide
access to information on the implementation. Information available includes progress of project
implementation in different stages from project approval, budget allocation, procurement and
disbursement process to project completion with the update in a weekly basis. In addition, the
website also provides detailed information of each individual project such as rationale and

                                                 29
background of the project, budget approval, and duration of project implementation, location and
targeted output. Additionally, a Project Financial Monitoring System (PFMS) has been developed for
implementing agencies to provide input of implementation plan including procurement plan and
provide updates on actual disbursement and physical progress of implementation. PFMS will prepare
reports relating to operations, analysis and administration of stimulus package to different group of end-
users, project owners, executives and citizens through the website. All TKK projects will remain subject
to audits by the Office of the Auditor General. The program has not been without controversy. There
were press reports that some of the equipment purchased in the health sector were not the highest
priority, and that the costs were too high. There have also been concerns from subnational
governments about the prioritization of "dust free" roads over other projects. Weaknesses in
Thailand's public procurement system create risks for implementation of the stimulus.

79.     Most of the programs in the stimulus package are temporary, hence, will not create a
significant burden on the Government's budget in the future. A few programs that will be on-
going include the monthly transfer to the elderly (around 0.2 percent of GDP per year), 15-year free
schooling for children (around 0.4 percent of GDP per year) and monthly transfer to public health
volunteers (around 0.1 percent of GDP per year). Free public services for low income earners have
been extended to December 2010, but the subsidies for water and cooking gas have been removed.
The remaining transfer programs have sunset clauses already building in a phase-out date. The
infrastructure projects will require maintenance expenditures, but otherwise can be easily scaled back
as was the case following the Asian financial crisis.

80.     The stimulus measures in 2009 could have been better targeted towards those in the
urban informal sector. As discussed in Section VI.A, most of the poor are rural. The group likely
to be most affected by financial crisis is the urban informal sector ­ contract workers in factories,
tourism and construction. For timeliness of implementation, the Government chose to use existing
mechanisms ­ such as the social security system ­ for reaching the beneficiaries of the consumption
measures of the stimulus package. This resulted in benefits falling disproportionally on the urban
formal sector despite an attempt to target the stimulus to the poor. As Table 7 shows, approximately
23 percent of the package went to this sector, which accounts for about 11 percent of the population.
Meanwhile, the urban informal sector was the most under-represented, with 19 percent of the
population receiving only 13 percent of the package. Although specific measures targeted at
populations living in rural areas ensured that a large portion (about 64 percent) of the package
reached this sector, it was also somewhat under-represented. This is largely because the THB 2,000
baht cash transfer and subsidies to urban transportation, water and electricity, which comprise about
a third of the consumption measures, are expected to reach only a small proportion of those in rural
areas. Table 7 also shows that the package had a small pro-poor bias: nearly 10 percent of the
beneficiaries of the package are poor, compared to 8.5 percent of poor in the population. The most
pro-poor measure are the cash transfers to the elderly, given that the elderly are over-represented
among the poor and the measure targets specifically those that do not currently receive another form
of pension. The incidence of benefits of the FY2010-2012 package will depend on how they are
implemented. Public works programs are one way of trying to reach the needy while providing
infrastructure.

81.     The infrastructure projects within the stimulus package appear to be reasonably well
justified. The package includes investment projects like the double tracking and rehabilitation of
railways, and highway maintenance for which implementation readiness seems to be advanced, while
energy projects are mostly the infrastructure investment in power plant and transmission line in
which implementation timeline starts off this FY2010. These projects seem to address growth
bottlenecks but have proven to be difficult to implement. The government has put in place a
committee led by the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) and comprising
the Bureau of the Budget, MOF, the BOT, Thai Chamber of Commerce, Thai Industrial Federation
and academicians to monitor the project implementation and report to the cabinet every month.

82.     With regard to education, transfers under the program of 15 years of free education
address an important need. The main focus of the transfer program in the stimulus package is on
subsidizing books, uniforms and tuition fees. These measures are in the right direction since
education expenditure is among unavoidable cost to most vulnerable families, and there had been a
drop in public expenditures on education infrastructure since the 1997 financial crisis. To mitigate
financial crisis impact on the vulnerable groups, as the government specifies the details of
"enhancing quality of education" and "improve educational infrastructure" measures of the stimulus
package, focus should be on expanding consumer expenditure and mitigate higher cost of living by
continuing to subsidize education especially for schools in rural area and improving vocational
education/training.

83.      In health, it will be important to ensure that the universal coverage (UC) scheme
remains appropriately funded and ensuring that medical personnel are available in rural areas.
The focus of the stimulus package is on: (i) improving health service delivery at all levels;
(ii) producing and developing more medical and public health personnel; and (iii) improving R&D in
medical technology. These areas of focus are relevant, because (a) there has been underinvestment
into health infrastructure in the last decade; (b) UC scheme and changing epidemic increases the need
for healthcare; and (c) Thailand has suffered a chronic lack of medical and public health personnel,
and that the doctor per population ratio of Thailand stands well below most of the upper-and middle-
income countries. While these are all important, the existing UC system, an important part of the
social safety net will come under stress as the number of unemployed rise in conjunction with
Thailand's already rapidly aging population, and it is important that the Government continues the
commitment to fund the UC scheme. On the project to produce more medical and public health
personnel, it is important to note that there is a disproportionate distribution of medical and public
health personnel throughout the countries, with a big surplus of personnel in urban areas, and serious
lack of personnel in rural areas. The solution is not simply to produce more personnel, but a strategy
needs to be developed to ensure that sufficient number of personnel is willing to live and work in the
rural areas in the long term.

B.        Budget Formulation
84.    The legislative framework governing budgetary management is clear. Fiscal relations
between the executive and legislature are defined in the Constitution 2007 and the Budget Procedures
Act of 1959, amended 2000. The Parliament is the principle legislative body and plays a significant
role in reviewing the budget and fiscal policy. The budget is deliberated extensively by the
Parliament's budget scrutiny committee. The main government agency mandated with preparation of

                                                      32
the Budget is the Bureau of the Budget, under the Prime Minister's Office. The laws governing
budget management clearly spell out the responsibility of the Bureau of the Budget and the MOF,
and comprehensive regulations have been developed. While the Prime Minister, as head of the
Government, has overall authority to exercise national fiscal management, the Budget Procedures
Act and the Treasury Reserve Act clearly delegate the responsibility of overall fiscal management of
central government finances to the Bureau of the Budget and the MOF respectively.

85.     Budget documentation coverage is good and would benefit from information of
previous year out-turn. The budget documentation includes full information on deficit financing,
debt stock, financial assets, including extra budgetary funds. The budget documentation also provides
information on the outlook for growth and inflation alongside the budget. According to PEFA
analysis, improved areas in the budget documentation are the presentation of the prior year's budget
out-turn and the implications of new policy initiatives.

86.      The budget presentation is detailed but could benefit with appropriate presentation of
the Central Fund. Very detailed information is provided in the presentation of the budget regarding
the economic, functional and administrative classification (consistent with GFSM 1986) of most of
the expenditures for which approval of the Parliament is sought. However about 13 percent (for
FY2009) of total expenditure is placed in a Central Fund ­ managed by the Bureau of the Budget
under instructions from the Prime Minister. About 80 percent of the Central Fund accounts for
identified expenditures (like pension payments, and civil servants health insurance scheme
contributions), while the remaining 19 percent (about 2.4 percent of total expenditures) is held in a
central contingency. Payments from this part of the Budget may be reallocated at the discretion of the
Prime Minister. The management of the Central Fund weakens the overall efficacy of the budget
process. The Government is cognizant of this weakness and aims to improving the management of
the Central Fund by putting in appropriate provisions in the upcoming Public Financial Act ­ this Act
has been mandated by the Constitution for 2007. The Government plans to submit this Act for
parliamentary approval in June 2010. However, budget process for allocating Central Fund is
governed by the 1959 Budget Procedure Act, thus an alternative to tighten the Central Fund
allocation is to amend the 1957 Act.

87.     The Government has adopted a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and plans to
further improve it over time, and consider developing forward estimates. The Government has
implemented (since 2005) the bottom-up and top-down MTEF. The entire MTEF process is managed
by the Bureau of the Budget and is anchored within the well defined annual budget formulation
calendar. The bottom-up MTEF flows from the approved four year Government Administrative Plan
and respective annual ministerial/agency level implementation plans. The top-down MTEF
essentially determines the fiscal space, based on: (i) the agreed macro-fiscal aggregates;
(ii) budgetary momentum and commitments; and (iii) changes to demographics prices, etc. The
bottom-up MTEF brings together the financing requirements for achieving policy objectives as per
respective ministry operating plans. The Bureau of the Budget then allocates the available fiscal
space to the additional resource needs ­ the meeting point for the top down and bottom up MTEF.
The Bureau of Budget has been working in 2008 on improving the costing norms for the MTEF.
Overall the MTEF process has brought in some realism in the budget requests made by sector
ministries. However, the MTEF at this stage not fully linked to strategic performance based
budgeting which, in itself is very much in the embryonic stage at this time. Looking ahead, the
proposal is for Thailand to develop forward estimates to represent the cost in future years of existing
policy, and to develop a budget strategy paper. The Bureau of Budget is considering these two issues,


                                                  33
which are part of the medium term reform agenda for implementing strategic performance-based
budgeting further.

88.     Local Authority Organizations are allocated 25 percent of total revenues by
Constitutional provisions, but there is limited information on their fiscal operations and
evaluation of their performance. The Constitution for 1997 and 2007, and the Decentralization Act
of 1999 provides for local governments to receive approximately 25 percent of total revenues for
executing approximately 245 functions, including health, education, and municipal services. Local
governments are coordinated by the Ministry of Interior's Department for Local Administration
(DOLA). In order to improve financial management at the local level, DOLA has established a
complete enterprise resource planning system called Local Authority Accounting System (e-LAAS).
However only 1,000 out of about 7,500 local authorities are using this system. Therefore it is not
possible for the Government to consolidate information from local authorities. The World Bank has
started collaborating with DOLA on implementation of e-LAAS. At the same time a survey of all
local authorities is being conducted with partnership of respective agencies to determine sectoral
expenditure and revenue patterns of local authorities. Monitoring and evaluation framework for local
governments remains weak. Improving performance and monitoring of local governments is on the
central government agenda, and in this regard a new legislative framework is being developed.

89.      The Government is in the process of improving monitoring and management of extra
budgetary funds. The level and number of extra-budgetary funds is known, and annual contributions
are appropriated through the budget. Extra-budgetary funds are governed by their respective
legislative instruments and controlled by the Comptroller General Department (CDG), MOF. The
extent of off-budgetary funds seems to be more significant. Moreover, the number and extent of
extra-budgetary funds seems to be increasing. Therefore, CGD has conducted the performance
measurement of extra-budgetary funds by using the Balance Score Card (BSC) approach. While the
Bureau of the Budget is conducting a study at this time to gather information on the number and
extent of off-budget funds and to develop a plan to bring them on-budget and record them in GFMIS.

C.     Reforming Budget Execution, Accounting and Reporting
90.      Legislative framework around cash management is clear. The Treasury Reserve Act of
1948, as amended in 1991 governs budget execution and financial management. According to this
Act, MOF's CDG is the custodian of all government bank accounts and is empowered to execute
government funds and to report on the same. The CGD is mandated to ensure the accuracy of the
reports.

91.     The Government has established the Treasury Reserve Account (TRA) system (the Thai
equivalent of the Treasury Single Account) managed by the CGD, and operated by BOT and
Krung Thai Bank. The TRA comprises system: (i) the TRA-1 main holding account; (ii) TRA-2
disbursing account; and (iii) 5 sub-category accounts ­ vendor, human resources, direct payroll, and
miscellaneous. The TRA-1 account holds the uncommitted balances and it is in this account that
revenues are banked. Once payments instructions are processed, the corresponding funds are
transferred to the TRA-2 disbursing account. Based on the volume and descriptions of the
transactions/payments, TRA-2 passes the transactions through the 5 sub-category accounts. The TRA
framework includes all government and extra budgetary funds and is executed nationwide through
the on-line, real time payment settlement system managed by the BOT. The TRA framework allows
daily sweeping of cash. The Treasury Reserve Act mandates that any spending agency has to seek
prior approval of the CGD before opening any bank accounts.

                                                34
92.    MOF has implemented a Government Fiscal Management System (GFMIS). Since 2005
the CGD has deployed a GFMIS across the country. The GFMIS (a SAP system residing on an
Oracle database) is the centralized system with decentralized data processing architecture. GFMIS
executes expenditure and revenue transactions through the TRA. Budgets and General Ledger
accounting transactions are recorded in the GFMIS. GFMIS performs a budget check for available
budget but does not check for cash availability ­ reflecting the fact that Thailand does not have
problems with cash availability/management. It includes data for the Central Government Agencies
and the Provinces. Local Authorities and autonomous state-owned enterprises maintain their own
budgets and books of accounts. In the short term plan, CGD will manage GFMIS to extend data
coverage to local government.

93.     In 2010, OAG certified the consolidated financial statement of FY2005 for the first time
since introduction of GFMIS. Since introduction of GFMIS, the Office of the Auditor General
(OAG) had not issued an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements because of data
inconsistencies issues. According to the OAG, the data in the financial statements has inconsistencies
that need to be reconciled before the financial statements could be certified. This is due to errors in
data entry, transactions being duplicated, and transactions being miscoded in GFMIS. Since then
CGD had been reviewing and reconciling data inconsistencies, and in 2010 managed to receive the
audit opinion on the financial statements for FY2006.

94.     The CGD plans that by FY2012 the Government will be current with its audited
financial statements and plans to further improve operational effectiveness of GFMIS. In order
to further improve operational effectiveness of GFMIS, end user hands-on training on system and
functional areas should be conducted to eliminate errors and provide proper understanding of the
financial information, and the SAP software should be updated to the latest version ­ as the new
software has addressed many problems encountered in the previous versions. End user training
should be supported by proper user guides and documented procedures. Looking ahead, the CGD
have confirmed their intention to address these issues and that will be part of the program. The World
Bank has been providing technical advice to the Comptroller General's Department on improving
accuracy of GFMIS information and on unification of the COA.

95.      The Budget and the General Ledger (GL) data are recorded in GFMIS using different
Chart of Account structures causing problems with generating budget-actual reports. A
uniform coding structure is not used across both functions and also the GL codes cannot be mapped
to budget item codes. In many cases the Budget items and GL codes have many-to-many
relationships, instead of one budget item related one or more GL items only. Consequently, budget
and GL data cannot be reconciled, leading to the Budget Execution data becoming unreliable. This
reflects the need for developing a uniform chart of accounts (COA) structure and codes acceptable to
Bureau of the Budget, CGD, OAG, Fiscal Policy Office and other impacted departments. An
integrated budget and accounting system maintained on the same data base along with a uniform
coding structure needs to be adopted for both Budget and the GL functions to avoid reconciliation
issues and facilitate reliable management reporting. The uniform coding structure and codes should
be finalized by the COA working group preferably before the start of the budgeting process and
informed to all users. All relevant departments ought to be members of the COA working group,
including fiscal policy, so that control and reporting needs of all users are uniformly met.

96.    The budget system allows for carry-over of expenditures across fiscal years, but causes
complications with reporting. The budget execution regulations allow for carry-over of unutilized
budget appropriations into the next fiscal year, without re-authorizing from the Parliament is needed.

                                                  35
The budget system incorporates commitment accounting, and commitments outstanding at the end of
a fiscal year are carried forward into the next fiscal year and presented in the budget proposal. This
makes budget to actual reporting more complicated. However, reports on carry-overs, authorized by
the MOF, are currently requested by the Parliament on a regular basis as a supplementary document
in the consideration of the Annual Appropriations Bill.

97.      Predictability in the availability of funds for commitment of expenditures is good and
cash management is not an issue. Once budgetary provision has been determined, the timing of the
bulk central government expenditure can be forecast by CGD with a high degree of precision. The
size of the Treasury bill issue can be varied flexibly to match fluctuations in cash needs, which are
continuously monitored and assessed. Ministries and agencies can rely on the availability of cash at
all times to meet payments which are within their overall budget allocations. Budget allocations for
particular functions and sub-functions represent ceilings which are rarely changed, and there is very
little scope for movement of provision between sub-functions. An overall increase in the Budget for
economic management reasons requires the presentation of a revised Budget to the National
Assembly.

98.     In December 2009 the MOF operationalized the Project Financial Management System
(PFMS) to manage and report the execution of the projects financed by the second Stimulus
Package. The PFMS combines financial information on each project from GFMIS, with
corresponding project procurement documentation, physical progress information from respective
agencies, along with geodetic location of projects on Google-maps, for managing and reporting to
public on projects financed by the second Stimulus Package (www.tkk2555.com). The PFMS is an
effective system for project management and a significant step forward on fiscal transparency.
Looking ahead the government aims to extend such a project monitoring and reporting system to all
projects financed by the budget.

D.      External Audit
99.     The external audit framework is independent and appropriately funded. The State Audit
Commission, the Auditor General and the OAG are three main components of State Audit structure,
as mandate by Organic Act on State Audit (1999). The State Audit Commission has powers and
duties in formulating the state audit policies, set out the standard rules for state audit, prescribe rules
and procedures for budget and financial discipline as well as administrative penalties. The Auditor
General is responsible for the administration on related state audit affairs. The OAG was established
under the Constitution as an independent agency, which is departmental equivalent under the law of
administrative organization of the state. The appointment of members of the Audit Commission and
the Auditor General is made by the King with the advice of the Senate. The Auditor General is
appointed for a fixed 6 year term, reports to the State Audit Commission, is independent from the
executive, and presents annual reports to Parliament with a summary of key findings.

100.    The OAG performs audits in the areas of financial, performance, procurement, subsidy
use, tax collection and other specific audits. The OAG audits all central government revenue and
expenditure, including revolving funds together with financial statement from state-owned
enterprises as well as local authorities. Each state-owned enterprise is required to submit its financial
report, according to International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS). However, due to numbers of
local authorities, approximately 7,900 across the country, and limited numbers of OAG staff, each
local authority is audited by OAG at least once every three years. The audits are undertaken in
accordance with the OAG Auditing Standards, which are mandated in section 333 of Organic Act on

                                                    36
State Audit (1999). The audit standards are consistent with international standards (ISA); including
the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions audit standards.

101.    The OAG presents a detailed report to the Parliament, however there is no specialized
body in Parliament that reviews this reports' findings and solicits response from respective
agencies. OAG's annual reports are submitted to the House of Representatives, the Senate and the
Council of Minister for their consideration. The reports of the Auditor General are discussed at the
Parliament and by the Budget Scrutiny Committee; however there is no specialized body in
Parliament that reviews this report findings and solicits response from respective agencies, like a
public accounts committee. The OAG has initiated legislation to strength the audit follow-up
process. This legislation has been submitted to Parliament.

102.    There are efforts to strengthen the demand side of accountability. OAG has a significant
out-reach program whereby presentations are made in the print media on procurement issues.
Parliamentary deliberations on the Budget are broadcasted on television, and there is now enhanced
disclosure of information on public finances by the MOF on the internet.

E.     Internal Controls and Internal Audit
103.     The internal control framework is extensive and appropriate. The State Audit
Commission issued Regulation B.E. 2544 governing the internal control standards that must be
adopted by government agencies that are audited by the OAG. This regulation came into effect on
October 27, 2001. The prescribed internal control standards are based on the international benchmark
of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's (COSO) five
components that are necessary for an effective internal control framework. The five components
include: (i) environment of the control entity; (ii) risk assessment; (iii) control activities;
(iv) information technology and communications; and (v) assessment.

104.    The reporting requirements on internal control framework are in place. The internal
control regulation requires the government agencies to report annually on their internal control
system to the State Audit Commission, the agency's senior management and the agency's audit
committee if one exist. The report should include comments on whether the agency's internal
control system is in compliance with the prescribed regulation; assessment of the adequacy and
effectiveness of the system; and, weaknesses and recommendations for the internal control system.

105.    One-fourth of total agencies are yet to comply with regulations on reporting on internal
controls system. Although the regulation was issued in October 2001, there are approximately
25 percent of the agencies in 2008 that have not yet complied with the reporting requirements of the
internal control regulation due to capacity constraints. Most likely this is a result of a lack of
understanding by agency staff and an appreciation of the importance of an internal control system.
The OAG along with the agency's internal auditor are planning to disseminate more information
regarding the importance of internal control systems to agency staff. In addition they aim to provide
more hands-on experience to agencies in their implementation of internal control systems.

106.   The established internal audit function has been strengthened in each government
agency since 2001. The internal audit function reports to the agency's top management advising
them on issues that they need to address. Although it is noted that the amount of resources and
budget allocated to internal audit function is limited, and there is some question as to the value


                                                 37
management places on the internal audit function. Additionally, CGD has set up the Internal Audit
Development Committee to set up policy and provide consultancy for internal audit areas.

107.    The CGD issued internal audit standards in 2001 that are consistent with the
International Institute of Internal Auditors Standards (IIA), including other related
regulations and guidelines. Although, there is no systematic process to submit the internal audit
reports to the CGD in order for them to evaluate whether there is a need to amend or modify the
internal audit standards, CGD has periodically conducted the performance measurement and has
recently included within the CGD KPIs since 2008. However, to improve the existing mechanism at
CGD to review internal audit findings and to prepare lessons learned that can be shared more widely
with the various government agencies, it is recommended that CGD establish an internal audit
coordinating council that would meet periodically to coordinate the activities of the internal audit
function and make recommendations to CGD and OAG for improving the internal audit function
within the various agencies. The OAG provides some coordination and training to the internal audit
function within each agency. The OAG does use the internal audit reports in planning their audits
and also supports the internal audit staff in dealing with agency management.

F.     Public Procurement
108.     During recent years the RTG has undertaken various initiatives aimed at improving
the overall public procurement system in the country to further increase transparency and
competitiveness. Some of the measures have already been completed while others are underway or
being considered for further improvement. The priority activities are listed below.

109.      The legislative and regulatory framework needs improvement: The draft Royal Decree
on Public Procurement was prepared by MOF and endorsed by the Cabinet in November, 2007, and
is currently pending review by the Office of the State Council. Under the draft decree some new and
useful concepts have been introduced such as the requirement for an annual procurement plan from
the line agencies at the time of preparing the annual budget; requirement for disclosure of
procurement information in MOF procurement website and line agencies' web pages, and
improvements in the procedures for the selection of consultant services. However, there are areas
requiring further strengthening and the World Bank has also shared extensive comments on an earlier
draft of the Procurement Decree for MOF's consideration. The broader areas identified by the Bank
include the needs for filling gaps in selection procedures, greater reliance on primary legislation
rather than secondary legislation to address critical provisions such as . domestic preference,
registration process; more specificity in the protection of national industry and provisions for
regulating international competition; developing procurement capacity in line ministries rather than
relying mainly on centralized and bureaucratic procedures for contractor and consultants' registration
and reference prices; rationalizing the institutional setup for formation of procurement committees
to minimize discretion, avoid institutions overlap, and provide legal cover to secure professionalism
and fairness of the subcommittees. Furthermore, the government Procurement Regulations of 1992
which are still applicable, provide sample national standard bidding documents for use on
procurement from government budget. When the Royal Decree on Public Procurement is enacted,
MOF intends to update the Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) and also develop a standard
Procurement Manual consistent with the Decree. The MOF aims to finalize, adopt and fully
implement the Royal Decree on Public Procurement, and to keep incrementally strengthening the
public procurement legislative underpinnings based on good public procurement principles and
practices.


                                                 38
110.     MOF has planned to move ahead on procurement reform, and is awaiting the issuance
of the Royal Decree on Public Procurement. In case the Royal Decree on Public Procurement is be
enacted, the MOF has agreed that the SBDs should be improved to be in line with the Royal Decree
and a Procurement Manual shall also be developed. The World Bank has agreed on a program of
technical collaboration with the Comptroller General's Department on improving the legislative
framework governing public procurement in June 2010 over the next two year period.

111.      Public procurement would benefit from measures to improve transparency and
accountability. At present there is no central information system for collecting procurement data,
monitoring and reporting on procurement performance and outcomes. Some procuring agencies have
internal databases with monitoring and reporting systems, the functionality of which varies widely,
while other agencies have no formal system. While current procurement regulations include some
internal control mechanisms within line ministries, there is need for improving internal controls as
well as external monitoring. In this regard the government plans to put in place a functional
monitoring system for measuring and reporting the performance and outcomes of public
procurement. Further efforts are needed to strengthen the mechanisms for improving integrity and
transparency in public procurement, including putting in place effective complaint handling systems,
ethical standards for government staff involved in public procurement as well as for contractors,
suppliers and consultants, rationalized merit-based criteria for the composition, roles and
accountability of procurement committees.

112.     The OAG though, has powers to conduct procurement audits and refer any issues for
further investigation. There have been many instances where the OAG has found irregularities in
the procurement process, which has led to suspension of procurements and prosecutions.

113.      Electronic Government Procurement (E-GP) was implemented in April 2010: The
Office of Public Procurement Management (OPPM) is taking the lead from the government's side in
enabling implementation of e-GP at national and sub-national levels. Currently, on-line disclosure of
procurement information, including advertisements and contract award information, has already been
started through websites of OPPM and the line ministries. Over the last four years the Government
through MOF has started to carry out public procurement of goods and works above specified
thresholds through e-auction system.        The Government has established an e-Government
Procurement system linked with the GFMIS, and also put in place mechanisms to enforce its
rationalized usage and monitor compliance. The World Bank has been providing technical assistance
in this regard through an IDF Grant. Looking ahead, the CGD has also committed with the Prime
Minister's Office to implement full e-procurement by October 2012, and has requested for the World
Bank's continued collaboration in the form of technical assistance to achieve this objective.

114.      Procurement Capacity Development: Procurement capacity of government staff needs
strengthening, particularly at the provincial level. There is need for development of a national
strategy for capacity building, which could facilitate and lead to the establishment of institutionalized
in-country procurement training programs, promote the development of a cadre of procurement
professionals, and also support the growth and development of private sector contractors, suppliers
and consultants.

G.      Debt Management
115.  The legal framework for public debt management is well defined and all government
borrowings and guarantees are managed by the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO)

                                                   39
within the MOF.12 Public debt management is governed by the Public Debt Management Act of
2005. The Act entrusts public debt management to the MOF's PDMO. Under the Public Debt
Management Act PDMO is authorised to borrow domestically on behalf of the Government up to
20 percent of approved Budget expenditures for the year in question and up to 80 percent of budgeted
debt repayments. With the approval of the Council of Ministers, PDMO may guarantee borrowing by
state-owned enterprises up to the same limits. There are documented procedures for the granting of
guarantees, and guarantee fees are charged according to the state-owned enterprise's credit score.
PDMO may also borrow to on-lend to local authorities, but to date this authority has not been used.
The Act mandates half-yearly publication of information about public debt transactions, although in
practice information is published monthly about all domestic and external public debt, including the
non-guaranteed debt of non-financial state-owned enterprises and financial institutions which
received government support in the 1998 crisis. At the end of FY2009 total public debt amounted to
45 per cent of GDP; of this debt only 8 per cent was external.

116.    Domestic and external public debt data are complete and reliable, and are updated and
published on a monthly basis on the PDMO website. There have been some problems reporting to
the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) due to a transition in reporting responsibilities
from the BOT to PDMO. The PDMO has been alerted to the DRS reporting requirements and is
currently preparing the DRS submission. Overall the debt management framework, recording and
monitoring systems, and debt management capacity is appropriate.

H.     Anti-Corruption
117.     Prevention and Anti-Corruption: The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC)
takes the lead on investigating cases of alleged corruption by any branch of the executive and public
sector. The NACC is an independent agency anchored within the Constitution of 1999 and 2007.
NACC has demonstrated successful investigation of high profile cases and based on the
investigations the Prosecutor General and the Special Supreme Court for Political Office Holders has
been able to remove high profile political figures from office. In addition to investigation, the NACC
is also playing a key role on prevention of corruption and upholding conflict of interest provisions in
the Civil Service Act. The NACC seeks to develop capacity for forensic accounting, case tracking
and identification, procurement investigations, and recently on recovery of stolen assets. The NACC
plans to develop a framework for monitoring government agencies compliance with procurement
procedures. This framework will be developed by NACC in close collaboration with Bureau of the
Budget, Office of the Public Sector Development Commission (OPDC), and CGD. The World Bank
support has been: (i) assisting the National Anti-Corruption Agency with forensic accounting and
advanced training on financial crime investigative techniques to support its anticorruption work
generally and its stolen asset recovery efforts in particular; (ii) WBI working with the Office of the
Civil Service Commission (OCSC) to organize training of mid-level government officials on anti-
corruption; and (iii) collaborating with the NACC on knowledge sharing on evidence based anti-
corruption policies. The support in this area is being provided by the Stolen Assets Recovery (StAR)
Secretariat, the Department of Institutional Integrity (INT), and the Poverty Reduction and Economic
Management's (PREM) Public Sector. The NACC has requested additional training on investigating
financial crimes and recovering stolen assets.




12
  Excludes borrowing for monetary policy purposes undertaken by the Bank of Thailand. Monetary policy
operations by the Bank of Thailand are clearly separated from debt management operations by PDMO.

                                                  40
118.   Thailand has a vibrant civil society and an Official Information Act (Freedom of Access
to Information). Civil society play a key role in providing an independent check and balance on
government, and coupled with the fact that the Parliament enacted the Official Information Act in
1997, to mandate agencies to provide information to citizens as demanded within a stipulated
timeframe. With support from the Governance Partnership Facility, the World Bank is working on
improving the framework set up to implement the Official Information Act.

I.     Revenue Management
119.    The Revenue Department deployed an e-Revenue system and in 2007 implemented
online registration for value-added and corporate income taxpayers, and an online refunds
system. With continuous expansion in the areas of services offered, the e-Revenue system now
allows taxpayers to obtain tax forms, file tax, request for tax refund, and make payments
electronically. Tax records, such as financial statement, profit and loss statement, VAT reports, and
tax invoice, can be kept in an electronic format rather than paper documents since 2002. This saves
both compliance costs of taxpayers and administrative costs of the Revenue Department. As part of
the e-Revenue system, a large part of tax resources is available online (e-Knowledge). The Revenue
Department web services covers information such as tax calendar, public seminars on tax topics, tax
laws, regulations and rulings, and double tax agreements between Thailand and its trading partners.
The webpage also shows the lists of shops with VAT refunds, VAT registrants, and corporate income
taxpayers. Services to check tax identification number and calculate corporate income tax are
available. More recent developments (since 2007) include online registration for value-added and
corporate income tax payers and online tax refund status system where tax claimants can check the
refund progress electrically.

120.    Other tax services are continuously introduced. In addition to the e-Revenue system, a call
centre was launched in 2005 to enhance services delivery. The centre handles all public queries on
tax issues, ranging from recent changes in tax laws and regulations to tax refund status and
complaints. To ease tax payments, the Revenue Department introduced Tax Mobile Units at large
markets and shopping centres since 1999. Tax payments can currently be made at post offices and
commercial banks as well as through internet-banking and tele-banking. The Revenue Department
also developed and distributed software to calculate withholding personal income tax since 2000.
Finally, since 2006 individual taxpayers are allowed to use personal identification number (PIN)
instead of tax identification number (TIN) for all tax transactions, which helps to save taxpayers'
time cost in requesting TIN.

121.    Various reforms were introduced to speed up tax returns. In mid-2007, the Revenue
Department adopted the VAT refund control and monitoring system that automatically alerts its staff
for delayed cases, and allows officers to check the status of the online refund requests. The optical
character recognition technology, which saves the time to perform manual data entry, was introduced
to accelerate personal and corporate income taxes returns. To speed up VAT refund for small
taxpayers, a pre-audit is waived if the refund value does not exceed 35,000 baht but post-audit is still
needed. Since 2003, the refund can be put directly into bank account instead of cheques posted to
claimants. Finally, the Revenue Department also established a reserve fund worth five billion baht or
around 40 percent of monthly VAT refund value to advance refund payment to a claimant. This
shortens disbursement period of obtaining cash transfer from the Treasury.

122.    A comprehensive review of the overall tax structure is underway. Over the last 10-
15 years there have been significant ad-hoc adjustments to different tax rates, which have resulted in

                                                  41
an increasing number of tax exemptions, deductions, and privileges. These exceptions complicate the
overall tax system, and make tax compliance more difficult. In order to streamline the tax system, the
Revenue Department and the Excise Department are planning to have a comprehensive review of the
tax structure. One of the focuses is on the rationale of levying certain tax types. For example, the
Excise Department has levied taxes on air conditioners because they are classified as a luxury but
this seems outdated now. The Revenue Department is also interested in a more efficient way to
collect VAT on used products, especially used vehicles sales.13 The World Bank in collaboration
with the MOF is now conducting a Revenue Policy Review that will provide issues and
recommendations for revision to the tax code.

123.    Expanding the use of IT to raise tax administration efficiency will be a priority. For
instance, the e-filing is currently more common in the area of personal income tax, but less so for
corporate income tax and VAT. The Revenue Department is designing ways to increase e-filing for
these tax types. This could be achieved by either providing certain incentives for e-filing (such as
accelerated refunds) or introducing an obligation for incorporated taxpayers to file electronically as
in many other countries.

124.    Transfer pricing framework will be further developed. Vertically integrated firms as well
as conglomerates transfer goods/inputs between different component entities. The price at which
goods are transferred is known as transfer price. Firms generally have an incentive to transfer inputs
at lower prices in order to pay lower input taxes. This could result in a smaller tax base. To properly
manage this, the Revenue Department issued transfer pricing procedures in 2002 to assist auditors
dealing with transfer pricing issues. In 2004, the Department set up a specialised transfer pricing
audit team, which subsequently led to numerous tax adjustments and penalties that are together worth
THB 2.3 billion by 2007. The Revenue Department plans to further enhance its transfer pricing
guidelines and framework, looking ahead. In April 2010, the Revenue Department launched
taxpayers' guidance on advance pricing arrangement (APA) procedures in order to facilitate
taxpayers who are interested in applying for APAs.

J.      Results-Based Management
125.    The RTG has placed significant emphasis on results-based management (RBM) in its
public sector reform program, and work is ongoing in parallel streams:

        The OPDC has successfully implemented Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across all
        government agencies and a balanced score cards for improving performance at the
        Departmental Level. Agencies that meet their KPIs (monitored by an independent agency)
        and improve service delivery are provided an annual bonus.

        The Bureau of the Budget has developed the Performance Assessment Rating Tool (PART)
        styled on the US Office of Management and Budget. Agencies use this tool to carry out an
        ex-post self evaluation of the linkage between the budget and performance information ­
        between government strategy and policy, the budget plan, outcomes, outputs, activities and
        the budget. The resulting score, which is reviewed by the Bureau of the Budget, is used by


13
  In addition to SMEs taxation, taxing used goods is another area where the Revenue Department has informally
shown interest in World Bank's technical support.


                                                     42
        agencies to improve the linkage between performance and budgeting. It also assists the
        Bureau of the Budget in reviewing agency budget bids. The Bureau of the Budget also
        carries out some evaluations of agency programs to inform the budget process.

        The Office of the Civil Service (OCSC) is implementing an individual level performance
        management system for each civil servant as per the Civil Service Act 2008. In this regard,
        the OCSC has introduced performance pay in April 2010, phasing out the `step wise' pay
        increase scheme. It is expected that staff who are assessed to have performed well through
        the performance management system will receive higher salary increase.

126.    Service delivery has started to improve due to results based management reforms, with
Thailand ranking at 12 in the World Bank Doing Business Report. Through the strategic application
of KPIs the Government has managed to significantly improve service delivery by government
agencies including: (i) reducing the service time for issuing permits; (ii) issuance of passports and
driving licenses; (iii) reducing time taken for filing taxes etc.

127.     Looking ahead the focus has to be on integrating the parallel RBM efforts by OPDC,
Bureau of the Budget, and OCSC. There is no direct linkage between departmental performance
(measured through KPIs) and budgetary appropriations (measured via PART). At the same time the
linkage between individual performance measurement framework developed by the OCSC and
departmental performance system is missing. The Government has established a Public Audit and
Evaluation Committee under the Office of the Prime Minister to undertake this task of integrating the
parallel RBM systems. The PSRDPL is supporting this integration of RBM by different agencies.

K.      Civil Service Management
128.    The Thai public sector is not large. The Thai public sector is made up of around
1.94 million employees (in 2007) who include government officials and permanent and temporary
employees in all central government agencies, autonomous organizations, and local administration or
local government organizations. This represents around 3 percent of the population or 5 percent of
the Thai labor force. Government officials are made up of ordinary civil servants, teachers,
university officials, police, judges, public prosecutors, legislative body officials, and autonomous
organization officials. There are 1.28 million government officials, of which around 30 percent or
365,000 officials are ordinary civil servants (government officials in central government agencies).
This section focuses on the management of ordinary civil servants which falls directly under the
responsibility of the OCSC under the Office of the Prime Minister.

129.   In 2008 a new Civil Service Act was promulgated, and implementation has been on-
going:

        The civil service classification was restructured in December 2008 to allow for more flexible
        deployment of staff across ministries, develop a cadre of senior technical specialists, and
        differentiated pay structure. Prior to December 2008, there was only one classification with
        1-to-11 grades for ordinary civil servants. Grades 1-4 were for support staff, Grade 5-8 for
        technical specialists and Grade 9-11 for senior management. This classification structure had
        resulted in the following issues: (a) technical specialists had move into the management
        stream for career progression, and it was not possible for the government to have a cadre of
        senior specialists; (b) staff with similar specialization could not move between agencies;
        (c) differentiated pay structures could not be considered because of a single grade structure.

                                                 43
        The new classification structure, introduced on December 11, 2008 comprises of four groups.
        These are: (i) operations staff; (ii) knowledge workers, (iii) mid-level management, and
        (iv) executives.

        Performance Pay was introduced in April 2010, phasing out the step wise salary increase
        system to ensure salary increase is based on performance rather than be time-determined. In
        this system an overall salary increase percent will be provided to departments. This increase
        would be allocated to staff based on annual performance evaluations.

        Royal Decree on Morals and Code of Civil Servants was issued in 2010. This Decree
        provides for establishing a code of ethics for all civil servants, implementation of which
        would be monitored on a regular basis. At the same time, for the first time a system for
        protection against harassment has been introduced.

130.    The central government's wage bill is a little more than a quarter of the central
government's annual budget and the wage structure is not compressed. Wages and salaries
account for around 27 percent of the annual budget, which is slightly higher than the international
benchmarks of 25 percent. The wage compression ratio is around 1:14, which is higher than those of
many of its neighbors and higher than the good practice of 10. However, the gap between civil
servants compensation and that of comparable positions in the private sector has been continuously
widening over the last two decades, particularly in the higher positions in the ordinary civil service.

131.    Greater mobility of the civil service could help break the silo mentality and promote
greater coordination amongst line agencies. Thailand's civil service has been characterized by
silos down to the departmental level as according to the law, each department has a legal status of its
own. For decades, civil servants typically pursue their career paths in one ministry as mobility across
ministries and even across departments are difficult as there needs to be approvals from the heads of
both the releasing and receiving agencies. This has not only limited the scope for broadening of
knowledge and career advancement, but also created a silo mentality that many a times hindered
collaboration across the departments.

132.   The OCSC needs to have a comprehensive database of the civil service in order to be
able to formulate accurate HR policies. However, the OCSC's current database is still missing
information on the Ministry of Public Health's civil service as the Ministry has developed their own
database, which is currently not linked to the OCSC's.

L.       Areas of Focus for Future Reforms
133.     The review above suggests that the public financial management systems in Thailand
have strengths and weaknesses14. Some of the strengths include: (i) orderliness and participation in
the budget process; (ii) effective controls over stock and monitoring of expenditure arrears;
(iii) revenue administration and collection; (iv) oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public
sector entities; (v) predictability in the availability of funds for commitment of expenditures; (vi)
recording and management of cash balances, debt and guarantees; and (vii) an operational system of
results based management which informs budget allocations and monitors service delivery. Some of


14
  Strengths and weaknesses are based on findings of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
Assessment, 2009, and technical review of the results based management framework in Thailand.

                                                  44
the weaknesses include: (a) transparency of intergovernmental fiscal relations; (b) classification of
the budget, primarily on account of the modalities of the management of the Central Fund; (c) follow
through on the findings of the audit reports: (d) procurement legislative framework and monitoring
and accountability systems; (e) lack of a uniform coding structure across both budgeting and
accounting; and (f) multiple performance measurement exercises leading to significant transactions
costs and loss of potential synergies across different performance management tools.

134.  In the short-to-medium term, progress on the following on-going PFM reforms will be
important to further improving Thailand's public sector management.

         Developing a uniform chart of accounts across all government entities to ensure consistency
         between budget and general ledger codes. This uniform COA will allow the Government to
         improve accuracy of budget-to-actual reporting and hence the quality of budget and
         management reporting;
         Enhancing GFMIS operations so that it is able to prepare accurate financial reports for all
         government entities on a timely basis and that financial reports for each fiscal year since
         2006/7 are certified by 2012;
         Putting in place an appropriate legislative framework governing the Central Fund through the
         Public Financial Act;
         Effective implementation of e-LAAS so that information on fiscal operations of all local
         authorities is recorded and consolidated. At the same time to continue integrating e-LAAS
         with GFMIS;
         Improving central-local government coordination and bottom-up regional development
         strategies by operationalizing the newly established provincial clusters;
         Develop a framework of forward estimates and budget strategy paper to further enhance the
         effectiveness of the MTEF, and implementation of the strategic performance based budget
         framework;
         Link results based management systems across agencies in order to ensure that individual and
         departmental performance is linked internally as well with overall budgetary appropriation
         system.

135.    The aforementioned reforms are being actively pursued and prioritized by the RTG.
This proposed operation supports the key policy reforms that will ensure that Thailand continues to
make progress on the results based management reform program and instills performance focus
across the entire public sector. In addition, taking the view of the status to the PFM framework and
focus of the reform program looking ahead, the Bank assessment team does not propose putting in
place any additional fiduciary arrangements for this operation.

VI.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION

136.    The prior actions for the operation reflect the status of the reform program at the time
of negotiations in May 2009 and summarized in Table 8. However, as discussed in the previous
section and summarized in Annex 3, the reform program has been sustained in the intervening
eighteen months and there has been important progress consistent with plans at the time of



                                                 45
negotiations. Annex 4 presents the reform program going forward as well has detail on how it has
been sustained.
137.    The reforms supported by the loan promote efficiency, accountability and results. In
public financial management this includes increased policy focus on budget formulation, improved
fiduciary controls, better monitoring and reporting of public finances, increased transparency and
disclosure in the use of public resources, and an improved external audit system. Reforms in public
administration aim to reduce rigidities in the civil service structure and improve incentives and
performance monitoring for civil servants. Accountability for service delivery is being promoted by
increased public monitoring and oversight over the quality and timeliness of services delivered by
public agencies and enhanced internal performance measurement by aligning budget monitoring
tools with service delivery indicators. Table 8 details the prior actions while Annex 3 covers the
entire policy matrix.

                      Table 8. Status of Prior Actions negotiated in May 2009

Prior Action 1: Parliament approved and the Government is implementing an economic stimulus package for its
Fiscal Year 2009 to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis
Current status: Completed. While the implementation of the stimulus will continue until 2012, the prior action
refers to the stimulus for FY2009. Disbursements were about 83 percent of planned disbursements, with transfer
and tax measures disbursing almost fully, while the implementation of infrastructure projects including rural road
construction and small water resource projects at 50 percent of plan.
Progress since May 2009: Implementation has slowed as the focus has shifted to the implementation of the
larger infrastructure projects. However measures taken to speed up implementation together with the seasonal
factors that typically peak in the second quarter could bring implementation back on track.
Prior Action 2: The Bureau of the Budget has (i) revised costing norms for its Medium Term Expenditure
Framework under its budget for Fiscal Year 2008; and (ii) taken steps to ensure that the Performance Assessment
Rating Tool (PART) is implemented in all Government agencies
This Prior Action was the responsibility of the Bureau of the Budget, in close collaboration with MOF and
NESDB. The main objectives of this prior action are to: (i) improve the costing norms for the MTEF so that sector
ministries can prepare better costs MTEFs (ii) operationalize a monitoring and evaluation system to determine the
efficiency and effectiveness of public spending for projects and recurrent expenditures.
Current Status: Completed. In order to improve the costing framework for sectors to better plan their budget
requests, in 2008 the Bureau of the Budget reviewed and revised the costing norms that were used by ministries
for the FY2008/09 Budget. Improved costing norms have allowed the Bureau of the Budget to improve the policy-
budgeting links and thereby increase the realism of the MTEF.
In 2008 the Bureau of the Budget rolled out the PART to all agencies and departments. The PART is an ex-post
self-evaluation tool used by agencies to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of spending on pre-identified
programs and projects. This deployment of PART, which continues to be refined for better integration with the
MTEF process, would allow the Government to progressively link medium term resource allocations to
effectiveness of spending programs and projects. Based on the pilot, the Bureau of the Budget commenced rolling
out of PART to all agencies.
This prior action is the center-piece element of the budget formulation reform program and has allowed the
government to significantly improve the policy consistency with budgetary outlays within a medium term
perspective.
Progress since May 2009: The Bureau of the Budget (i) introduced agency level ceilings in the top down medium
term expenditure framework which reduced the deviation between the top-down and bottom-up MTEF from more
than 5 percent to in FY2009/10 to less than 2 percent in FY2010/11. This results in more predictability for
agencies for their budget requests and less need for top-down budgetary adjustments by BOB; and (ii) set up six
inter-ministerial budget appropriation committees to formally consider PART results to guide budget allocations.
Prior Action 3: (a) The Ministry of Finance has: (i) piloted the use of the e-financials accounting module for

                                                       46
direct financial reporting from the Government Fiscal Management Information System (GFMIS); (ii) begun
undertaking daily reconciliation between the GFMIS and the Treasury Reserve Account and targeted training; and
(iii) introduced e-token interface with the GFMIS for secure data access for management reporting by budget
entities; and (b) The Bureau of the Budget has piloted an e-budget system in the Government's line ministries for
improving links between sector policies and budget requests.
This Prior Action is the responsibility of the CGD at the MOF, with collaboration of the Bureau of the Budget and
BOT. The main objectives of this prior action are to improve the operational effectiveness of GFMIS so that more
accurate consolidated financial statements are prepared and to link the budget preparation process via e-Budget
with the budget execution system, so that budget execution is timely with appropriate fiduciary controls, and to
foster improved budget reporting.
Current Status: Completed. Since deployment of GFMIS, the OAG has not certified the financial statements
because of reconciliation errors with system. These errors are a consequence of: (i) inadequate user training;
(ii) compressed system deployment time with no parallel GFMIS run with the manual system; and (iii) system
architecture and software limitations.
In order to rectify these data inconsistencies and related problems, the CGD has been providing user training and
refining system functionality to minimize data errors and effectively reconcile expenditure information. Over the
last two years the reconciliation errors have reduced. At the same time, in order to improve reporting, in 2008 the
CDG has started deploying the e-financial module that will allow budget managers to generate customized
reports. This system which is modularly linked to GFMIS to ensure that management reports and other budget
reports can be generated in real time to budget managers. At the same time, the CGD has developed an "e-token"
interface to GFMIS in order to extend access to the system for other budget agencies. It is expected that with on-
going refinements and user training it will be possible for GFMIS to fully reconcile budget execution information
with the Treasury Reserve Account information, so that by 2009/10 fiscal year, the Auditor General will be able to
certify the consolidated financial statements in a timely manner. Furthermore, with the aim of linking the budget
formulation process with budget execution, the Bureau of the Budget has developed the e-Budget system and
commenced its pilot. The e-Budget system is linked up with GFMIS and should allow the government to generate
budget-to-actual reports in a timely manner, with greater accuracy. Full deployment of e-Budget will be
completed by 2010.
Progress Since May 2009: In 2010 the Auditor General certified for the first time since introduction of GFMIS
the financial statements for FY2005 as the data inconsistencies were reduced by MOF; (ii) Real time payment
order interface to the GFMIS was introduced ­ "web-online" ­ to improve accuracy and speed of budget
execution; (iii) the Executive Information System for financial reporting to agency level management was
implemented; and (iv) integration of GFMIS with e-Budget at the Bureau of the Budget was completed.
In order to rectify these data inconsistencies and related problems, the CGD has been providing user training,
refining system functionality to minimize data errors and effectively reconcile expenditure information, and
correcting data inconsistencies. As a result of this work, in 2010, the CGD managed to obtain audit opinion from
the Auditor General for FY2005/06 financial statements. The CGD is now working on addressing data issues so
that by FY2011/12 they will be current with the audits of government financial statements. This was a key
recommendation from the PEFA.
At the same time, in order to improve reporting, in 2010 the CDG implemented a real-time payment order
interface to GFMIS, allowing agencies to directly enter in real time Payment Orders through the internet (web on-
line). This has resulted in more accurate data recording and faster budget execution. In order to foster greater
management reporting ­ a weakness identified in the PEFA analysis ­ the CGD has deployed the Executive
Information System. This system draws information from GFMIS and provides management level reports to
agency heads. With the aim of linking the budget formulation process with budget execution, the BOB has
developed the e-Budget system and by 2010 this system has been implemented across all government agencies.
In order to improve transparency and management of the second Fiscal Stimulus projects, MOF established in
December 2009 a comprehensive Project Financial Management Reporting System which publically identifies
each project on Google maps using GPS coordinates, and reports in real-time on: (i) project financial information;
(ii) procurement documentation; and (iii) physical progress of projects. The Ministry of Finance established the
Project Financial Management Reporting System­ see www.tkk2555.com. The Project Financial Management
Reporting System combines financial information from GFMIS, procurement information from CGD, physical
progress information from agencies for all projects being financed by the stimulus package and publishes this


                                                       47
information for each project using project GPS coordinates on Google maps. Analysis conducted by the World
Bank team providing assistance on developing of PFMS show that indeed the reporting system is a very
comprehensive and appropriate system for reporting on projects and a significant leap on transparency.
Prior Action 4: Nine working committees constituted by the Government and representing forty Government
agencies have taken necessary actions to: (a) shorten their service-delivery times; (b) streamline processes, and
(c) and reduce the costs of interacting with government in ten district areas of dealing in which they deal with
private businesses.
This Prior Action is the main responsibility of the OPDC. The main objective of this policy action is to
specifically improve service delivery of agencies that are related to improving the business climate in Thailand.
Current Status: Completed. By 2008, 40 government agencies that are related to improving the business
climate have reduced their service delivery time, processes and direct costs according to the indicators of the
Doing Business. This followed from the Cabinet resolution in December 2005 which had led to an establishment
of 9 working committees, one for each area of the Doing Business (with the 9th committee responsible for
2 areas). The resolution stated that the agencies in the working committees will improve their service delivery in
the areas the Doing Business so as to help increase competitiveness. These achievements were monitored by the
OPDC through the targets and KPIs of each agency. This has led to an increase in Thailand's Doing Business
ranking from 20 in Doing Business 2006 to 13 in Doing Business 2009.
Progress since May 2009: The committees have continued to function, and Thailand is ranked 12 in Doing
Business 2010.
Prior Action 5: The Office of Public Sector Development Commission and the Bureau of the Budget have
harmonized their reporting systems to facilitate the formulation of key performance indicators (KPIs) for a four
year ministerial and departmental operation plan covering all Government agencies.
This Prior Action is the responsibility of the OPDC in coordination with respective government agencies. The
main objective of this prior action is to shorten delivery times, improve quality, and foster greater accountability
in the provision of public services, and move the public sector towards more results based one that is responsive to
the needs of the citizens.
Current Status: Completed. Since the promulgation of the Public Administration Act and the Royal Decree on
Good Public Sector Governance, all government agencies and public schools, hospitals, and universities have
established targets and KPIs as mandated by the Act and the Royal Decree. KPIs have been used a tool to monitor
the achievements of the targets (as stated in each department's 4-year Operations Plans) as well as to further
improve their service delivery. Currently, each department identifies its own targets and the KPIs. The targets and
the KPIs are however checked by an independent evaluator hired by the OPDC (currently, the Thailand Rating
and Information System Company) to make sure that they are realistic. Service delivery agencies also conduct
customer satisfaction surveys which are used as an input to the achievement of their KPIs. Government units that
meet their output targets according to their KPIs and have passed the OPDC's evaluations are awarded lump sum
cash bonuses at the end of each fiscal year.
In order to develop an integrated results based management framework, the Bureau of the Budget and the OPSDC
started in 2008 to harmonize reporting systems that request agencies to provide the key performance indicators
(KPI's) for the Ministerial and Departmental 4-year Operational Plan. The new forms were distributed to all
government agencies to fill for FY2010/11.
Progress since May 2009: In order to consolidate and integrate these systems, in 2009 a Public Audit and
Evaluation Committee was established with participation by the concerned agencies to review all the different
RBM systems and make concrete recommendations how these systems could be linked and integrated. This
review and its subsequent implementation are critical to have an operational integrated results management
framework across the public sector. The Public Auditing and Evaluation Committee in 2009 conducted a review
of results based management systems in government in order to consolidate and integrate them appropriately
Prior Action 6: The Parliament promulgated the Civil Service Act in 2008, and the Office of the Civil Service
Commission has taken necessary action to implement a new grading structure across the entire civil service with
effect from December 11, 2008.
This Prior Action is the main responsibility of the OCSC. The main objective of this to allow for the Government
to have a differentiated career stream for technical and management officers, increase flexibility of moving staff

                                                        48
 between agencies, introduce differentiated salary levels based on skills and competency, and increase
 competitiveness for skilled positions vis-à-vis private sector.
 Current Status: Completed. The Civil Service Act (2008) was promulgated in January 2008. Effective
 December 2008 the civil service grading system was reclassified from eleven grades into four groups:
 (i) operational and support staff (4 levels); (ii) knowledge workers (5 levels); (ii) middle management (2 levels);
 and (iv) senior executive service. At this moment the OCSC is considering increasing steps within the levels to
 make sure that the overall structure is not too broad banded. Additionally, the Government is considering
 developing differentiated pay policies for each group.
 Progress since May 2009: The OCSC implemented performance based pay from April 2010, thereby phasing out
 the common `step wise' compensation scheme. Following though on the reclassification system OCSC moved
 ahead to implement the performance based pay system across the civil service and in April 2010 this new system
 was introduced. With this system departments are provided a general salary adjustment amount, which is then
 provided to officials based on annual performance assessments. Looking ahead, this system will be reviewed and
 adjusted as appropriate to ensure the link between salary adjustments and performance is further strengthened.

VII.                OPERATIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

A.                  Poverty and Social Aspects
138.    Over the past decades, high rates of economic growth have been an important
contributor to poverty reduction in Thailand. Based on the national poverty line, Thailand has
made impressive progress in reducing poverty from 42 percent headcount ratio15 in 1988 and its
recent peak of 21 percent in 2000 (as a result of the 1997 Asian crisis) to 8.5 percent in 2007 (see
Figure 8). This represents 7 million people being lifted out of poverty from 2000 to 2007. Poverty
reduction has been driven by high rates of economic growth: over the past 20 years, real GDP grew
an average of 5.9 percent per annum and poverty declined by 34 percentage points, implying that
each percent of real GDP growth per annum helped to reduce the poverty headcount ratio by roughly
0.1-0.3 per year per year.

139.    Poverty in Thailand is primarily a rural phenomenon and is concentrated in the
Northeast. Out of 5.4 million poor, 88 percent live in rural areas. In 2007, over half of the poor were
engaged in agricultural activities with the 60 percent being farmers who own land (see Figure 9).
About 20 percent was engaged in trade and manufacturing, which are activities in the urban sector
and another 20 percent was economically inactive, relying on charity or remittances from family
members for their livelihoods. Eleven percent of the rural population is poor as compared to
3.3 percent in the urban areas (see Table 9). The populous Northeast is home to both half of the poor
in the rural areas and the poor in Thailand. Nevertheless, the Northeast had made the most progress
in reducing poverty over the past few years; poverty headcount in the Northeast fell from 35 percent
in 2000 (7.3 million people) to 13 percent in 2007 (2.8 million people). Of the 4.5 million people in
the Northeast who moved out of poverty from 2000 to 2007, 4 million were those in the rural areas.

140.    The global financial crisis likely halted poverty reduction in 2009. The net effect of the
economic volatility of 2008 and 2009 on Thailand's poor is difficult to measure, but poverty likely
increased in 2009 compared to 2008. As a result of the crisis, real per-capita consumption levels,
which are highly correlated with the poverty rate, contracted in 2009 for the first time since the 1997
crisis. Given the elasticity between per-capita household consumption and the poverty rate, the
observed 1.7 percent decline in real per-capita household consumption in 2009 is associated with an
increase in the poverty rate between ½ to one percentage point from 2008.

141.   The global economic crisis affected vulnerable households through two main channels:
a decline in agricultural prices and softer labor markets. The contraction in household
consumption and associated increase in poverty was due to a decline in agricultural incomes from
lower agricultural prices compared to 2008 (on average, rice prices in 2009 have declined by
15 percent from 2008; see also Figure 10) and a relative shift of labor towards lower-productivity
(and lower-wage) sectors, which contributed to a decline in average real wages. Although labor
markets appear very tight (the unemployment rate is currently below one percent), real wages remain

                                                   50
below their pre-crisis levels. This is due to the flexibility of Thai labor markets and limited formal
safety nets, which implies that employment is usually high and labor market adjustments take place
through sectoral shifts (e.g. from manufacturing to agriculture and informal services, such as retail),
reduced work-hours (35 percent of the workforce works over 50 hours per week on average), and
lower wages.

142.     The social impact of the political crisis was larger than the GDP impact because of the
large number of workers in affected sectors. The external-demand-driven manufacturing and
logistics sectors, which are expected to continue to perform well and be relatively unaffected by the
crisis, account for only 17 percent of the labor force. On the other hand, the retail and tourism
sectors, which have been hit hardest, account for 23 percent of the labor force. This suggests that
incomes of many Thais are likely to be affected through job losses, shift to lower-paid jobs (such as
agriculture), or reduced work hours. Because labor adjustments take place through hours worked and
sectoral shifts, drastic changes in unemployment figures are not expected. But household incomes,
for which data is harder to come by, are likely to suffer nonetheless as individuals are forced to
accept lower-paying jobs or work fewer hours.

143.    The outlook for poverty in 2010 is uncertain as a major drought is underway but GDP
growth has started to pick up. Labor has started to shift back from agriculture to higher-paying
manufacturing jobs (Figure 11) and overtime has picked up. Downside risks are significant, however,
as a severe drought is currently affecting 53 out of 76 provinces and has already destroyed over
230 sq. km of agricultural land. While irrigation, higher prices of agricultural goods and public sector
support should partly mitigate the impact of the drought, the situation needs to be carefully
monitored. The continuation of pro-poor policies, especially the pension to the elderly (who are over-
represented among the poor) and free education should support consumption levels in low income
households.

144.   The first stimulus package, while unlikely to have had a large impact on overall GDP,
may have helped limit the impact of the crisis on the poor. Disbursements under the first stimulus
package are estimated at 0.8 percent of GDP between March and September. While the stimulus


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        51
package was not particularly well-targeted towards the poor, it did contain a number of measures that
likely reached vulnerable households. The old-age pension may have been especially effective, since
the elderly are over-represented among the poor and the measure specifically targeted those
individuals not receiving formal pensions.

145.    The institutional framework for delivering anti-poverty programs including through
the stimulus is stronger than after the Asian financial crisis. A number of institutions were put in
place over the course of the last decade that will allow anti-poverty programs to reach those in need.
The most important of these are the Universal Coverage (UC) Scheme for health insurance and the S-
M-L community development program, now known as the Sufficiency Economy Fund. As workers
faced the prospect of falling out of the formal social security system, the UC scheme is an important
buffer. Secondly, the Sufficiency Economy program makes it possible to disburse funds at the
village level for community infrastructure, and this scheme has now reached all villages. While both
programs, and particularly the Sufficiency Economy program face implementation challenges, they
do provide a vehicle for reaching a large portion of the population.

146.   The proposed operation contributes to poverty reduction in two main ways: (i) by
supporting the implementation of the fiscal stimulus without which the contraction in GDP
growth and increase in the poverty rate would be greater; and (ii) by supporting the
improvements effectiveness of fiscal policy through improvements in public financial
management. Without the fiscal stimulus the contraction in GDP growth may have exceeded 3
percent in 2009, with an even greater increase in poverty. Further, since the fiscal stimulus is
moderately pro-poor, the impact on the poor will be greater. The proposed operation also supports
the more effective use of all public sector resources at a time that the impact of fiscal policy needs to
be maximized to prevent further deterioration in the growth rates, which as argued above are the
main drivers of poverty in Thailand.

B.      Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
147.    The Government launched the implementation of reforms in the PSRDPL through a
high level implementation and monitoring structure. The Government established a "Policy
Steering Committee" to oversee and coordinate the implementation of the reform program, largely
based on the findings of the PEFA assessment. This Policy Steering Committee was led by the
Deputy Permanent Secretary of the MOF and comprised senior management from eight central line
agencies; the PDMO, Fiscal Policy Office, CGD, Bureau of the Budget, the National Economic and
Social Development Board, the Revenue Department, the OCSC, and the OPSDC. This policy
steering committee was responsible for ensuring that all prior actions for the proposed operation were
implemented. Implementation of projected policy actions in the medium term has now been
delegated directly to the individual agencies. Progress on the reform program has been reported on a
periodic basis by the individual agencies. The structure of the committee helped inter-agency
coordination on key cross-cutting issues and provided momentum for reforms during a difficult
period politically. For example, during the preparatory meetings, the OCSC presented its plans for
the upcoming broad-banding of the civil service structure. That presentation generated positive
discussions across the range of further relevant issues. Therefore, in addition to directly
implementing policy reforms, such an implementation structure will also provide a forum for cross-
sectoral discussions across different agencies and help to reduce the silo working style of agencies,
and thereby increase efficacy of policy reform.




                                                   52
148.    Country capacity for monitoring will be strengthened through the ongoing country
development partnerships (which includes CDPs on governance and public sector reform, poverty
analysis monitoring, financial and corporate competitiveness, infrastructure, social protection,
education, health, and environment), especially the CDP on Governance and Public Sector Reform,
which is in its third phase on implementation. Bank staff will continuously provide technical
assistance for implementing the policy reforms and also monitor implementation of the reforms
specified in the program matrix of the proposed and any subsequent DPLs.

149.    The results measurement and monitoring framework will be closely monitored. The
PEFA assessment for 2009 has established baseline scores across its 28 component indicators on
performance of the public financial management system. The on-going Public Expenditure Review is
providing policy advice and implementation support on issues relating to service delivery at the
central and local level. The public financial management reforms supported under the DPL are
expected to have a positive impact on the indicators relating to medium term budget planning, and
access to key fiscal information. Specific aspects relating to the relevant PEFA indicator have been
included in the Annex 3 ­ "Results and Outcomes Indicator" column. The impact of the reforms on
outcomes on the performance of the PFM system will be monitored by the Bank team together with
respective agencies over time, and documented when the next PEFA assessment is conducted in
2012. On the results based management reforms, the World Bank team will discuss with the
respective agencies on the outcomes from the reform under the CDP-G umbrella, and capture
outcomes within the DPL's Implementation Completion Report.

C.     Fiduciary Aspects, Disbursement and Auditing
150.    Borrower and Credit Amount: The borrower is the Kingdom of Thailand and this
operation is a single-tranche loan of US$1 billion that would be made available upon loan
effectiveness, as all policy actions supported by the loan would have been completed prior to Board
presentation.

151.     Disbursement Arrangements and Use of Funds: The loan disbursement will follow the
standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending as provided in OP/BP 8.6. The loan
amount will be disbursed, through a single or multiple withdrawals prior to the Closing Date, in
US Dollars into a bank account managed by the central bank, BOT that forms part of Thailand's
official foreign exchange reserves. An equivalent amount in Baht will immediately be transferred in
to the Treasury Reserve Account of the Borrower that is used to finance budget expenditures. The
Borrower intends to use loan proceeds for expenditures with high import content, and may disburse
the loan through multiple withdrawals as part of its standard debt management operations. The
Borrower would provide to the Bank a written confirmation that this transfer (transfers) have been
completed, and provide to the Bank any other relevant information relating to these matters that the
Bank may reasonably request.

152.    With regards to fiduciary risk, it was assessed to be low-to-moderate as: (i) GFMIS
provides real time information with adequate core internal checks and balances; (ii) independent and
well functioning of accountability mechanisms (see paragraph 160 onwards) exist to audit and
monitor budget implementation. Therefore no additional FM requirements are being proposed for
this operation.

153.  Disbursements of the loan will not be linked to any specific purchases, except that the
Borrower is required to comply with the standard negative list of excluded items that may not be

                                                53
financed with Bank loan proceeds. Prior to disbursement, the Borrower would provide to the Bank a
copy of written instructions issued to the Bank of Thailand for conversion of the foreign exchange
amount of the loan into local currency and that an equivalent amount be credited to an account of the
Government available to finance budgeted expenditures.

D.     Risks and Risk Mitigation
(i) Political Risks

154.    The political situation remains subject to significant risk. As noted above, a coalition of
opposition groups, the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), staged large protests
in Bangkok in April and May that culminated in violence that led to nearly 100 deaths and more than
1,000 injured. The ruling coalition is working on a national reconciliation agenda, which may involve
an early dissolution of parliament. While relative calm has followed the end of the protests, the
underlying political divisions remain. The Government's parliamentary majority was unaffected, and
Parliament has approved the FY2011 budget and financing plan in August 2010. The financing plan
includes borrowing from the ADB and JICA in addition to borrowing from the World Bank.
Although plans to borrow from international financial institutions (IFIs) were approved in parliament
by a wide margin, the vote was largely along party lines and there is a risk that borrowing from IFIs
may be politicized, and that these institutions are seen as supporting the ruling coalition. Several
factors mitigate this risk: (i) the loan is being submitted to the World Bank Board only after
Parliamentary approval has been received; (ii) the loan received votes from opposition MPs, as well
as broad support by the Senate; (iii) the MOF has carried out public consultations on the operation
and solicited comments on its website; (iv) the loan was originally requested by a finance minister
currently in the opposition; and (v) designing the operation as a standalone operation rather than a
programmatic one helps Government manage the political risk.

(ii) Implementation Risks

155.     Notwithstanding the political instability, the public sector reform agenda has been
maintained under different political administrations. This has been the case over the past twelve
months as the reform program has been sustained despite the political turmoil. This is because the
underlying reform program has broad support across the political spectrum and is owned by senior
civil servants in respective agencies. Therefore the risk to reform program implementation is modest.
Inevitably, continued political turmoil will have some impact on the implementation of the program,
and especially through delays in passage of needed legislation

156.     The reform program itself is non-partisan, and has broad private sector as well as
public sector support. On the fiscal front, the constituency for fiscal reform is wide and vocal and
very influential and a change in government is unlikely to result in deep reversals in the fiscal
program as this will be detrimental to the economy as the whole. Thailand has already demonstrated
steady reform implementation through successive governments. This is because there is broad
political support across the political spectrum towards improving public sector management, and the
details of the program are part of the each department's core operations which are spearheaded by the
bureaucracy ­ which does not experience wholesale reshuffles in wake of changes in the political
administration.




                                                 54
(iii) Macro-Economic and External Risks

157.    Thailand is recovering strongly from the global financial crisis, with year-on-year GDP
growth coming in at 10.6 percent in the first half of 2010 and projected to reach over 6 percent for
the year as a whole. However, growth remains largely dependent on external demand conditions,
and a new contraction in world trade would have a substantive negative impact on Thailand's
economy, including posing a threat to debt sustainability. A track record of prudent macroeconomic
management and conservative banking practice means that the likelihood of a balance of payments or
banking crises is relatively low. Given the strong macroeconomic fundamentals, markets have
reacted fairly calmly to political events, although a renewed escalation in violence may lead to
market reappraisal.

158.     A significant deterioration in the political situation would further jeopardize Thailand's
growth prospects. A new escalation or increased frequency of politically-motivated violence could
lead to a weakening of economic conditions through a slowdown in investment, a significant
reduction in tourism, and possible disruptions to export-oriented manufacturing activity.
Nevertheless, the situation has been relatively calm since May and, reflecting the team's view on the
most likely scenario, the projections in this document assume ongoing and elevated risks of political
instability, but not renewed violence.

(iv) Fiduciary and Reputational Risks

159.    A detailed assessment of the PFM framework in Thailand carried out as part of project
preparation points to overall low-to-moderate fiduciary risks. Since 2003, Thailand has
significantly improved the core public financial management systems. The GFMIS (2005) has been
deployed nationwide to execute expenditures in real time via the consolidated Treasury Reserve
Account at the BOT. The GFMIS incorporates all the core internal checks and balances to ensure that
there is an undeletable audit trail for all expenditures. In addition, the revenue department has also
developed an eRevenue system for electronic filing of taxes. The GFMIS automatically cross-checks
tax collections reported via the eRevenue system, with the amount banked at the Treasury Reserve
Account.

160.   External accountability mechanisms are independent, adequately resourced, and have
appropriate capacity to ensure that the executive branch of government can be held accountable for
any issues arising. Coupled with the vibrant civil society and free media, the overall external
accountability framework is reasonably robust.

161.    Progress on improving the legislative framework governing public procurement has
been slow. A new Procurement Act has been approved by the Cabinet and is pending consideration
with the State Council. The World Bank will assist the Government in effective implementation of
this new Procurement Act once the same is promulgated. The government has already developed an
e-Procurement system that is a central repository of all procurement related information across the
entire procurement process for capital procurements.

162.     Broad consultation, especially in the context of a parallel Interim Strategy Note has
facilitated broad ownership of the World Bank's country program. This work, and
accompanying technical assistance in key areas, will ensure that the underlying analytics for the
PSRDPL program are well understood and articulated. The monitoring framework for the DPL


                                                 55
provides an opportunity for these results to be shared and for any issues or slippages to be brought to
the attention of senior policymakers in a timely fashion. Moreover, the process of parliamentary
consultation and approvals has enabled the participation of opposition and civil society in reviewing
this operation.

E.      Environmental and Social Aspects
163.    While the prior actions for this operation are not likely to have a significant
environmental effect, the environmental effect of ongoing projects will need to be managed. The
proposed operation does not directly support any specific policy actions that could have negative
effects on environmental, forests and other natural resource aspects. The FY2009 stimulus package
that is covered by a prior action does support small-scale infrastructure. However, this is only
5 percent of the stimulus package (which itself is 1.6 percent of GDP), spread out over many projects
all over the country. A further 10 percent of the stimulus package consists of transfers averaging
THB 195,000 (US$5,560) to 78,358 villages which may be spent amongst other things on micro-
infrastructure. Even taken together these are unlikely to have a significant environmental effect
especially when economic activity has slowed significantly. By supporting better integration of key
performance indicators with budgetary performance management, there will be likely some positive
second order benefits by improving service delivery and management of revenues. At this time it is
not possible to quantify these second order impacts, and these may not be significant but the team
will continue to assess positive externalities and report appropriately in the Implementation Status
and Results report for the operation.

164.    Thailand has adequate environmental controls in place. Thailand has well established
governmental and nongovernmental institutions. Collectively, they have supported development of
policies related to the protection and sustainable use of the country natural resources and
environmental management, over the last two decades. There is a legal framework governing the
Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) that applies to
projects. In particular, the large infrastructure projects that will be a large share of the fiscal stimulus
in 2010-12 will be covered by requirements for EIA16. Smaller projects that do not anticipate much
environmental impact and projects in special governing zones needs to conduct IEEs following the
guidelines for various types of projects (e.g. irrigation, health, transportation) as set forth by the
National Environment Board, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE). The
new Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand B.E.2550 (2007) also provides right to public
participation in the prevention and elimination of any actions that deteriorate natural resources and
pollute the environment.

165.    There is still room for improvement in environmental management. Further
strengthening and improvements regarding public education, civil participation, effective
implementation of environmental laws; stronger institutional capacity, both national and local; and
increased investments in pollution prevention and control, with private sector participation are
needed. The actual implementation of environmental protection sometimes does not keep up with
laws as seen recently in the Map Tha Put industrial estate. The Government has prepared a


16
   Section 46 of the Enhancement and Conservation of Nation of National Environmental Quality Act 1992: The
MONRE with the approval of the National Environmental Board (NEB) have the power to issue the notification
prescribing the categories and magnitude of 22 types of projects of government agency, state enterprise or private
organization, which are required to submit the EIA report to the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning and
the Expert Review Committee for review and approval before proceeding.

                                                       56
comprehensive Climate Investment Plan, which has been approved by the Clean Technology Fund
(CTF) committee for concessional financing for introducing clean technologies to promote low-
carbon sustainable growth. New operations promoting energy efficiency and greater use of
renewable energy sources are now under preparation for support by IFC and IBRD. As only large
public investment projects are required to undertake EIAs and integrated natural resources
management (especially in the context of river basin management) is a key for forging effective
involvement of local stakeholders it would be useful to engage with the government to discuss
inclusion of the environment and social performance indicators, including integration measures, in
the KPIs established by the OPDC. In the long-term, KPI may be linked with the Budgeting Process.

166.    Implementation of the stimulus package will be the prior action that has the most direct
social impact. The stimulus package was intended to address the social impact of the crisis which
most directly affected the urban informal sector. As discussed in more detail in Section V.A, the
stimulus could have been better targeted to this group. Effective targeting was constrained by the
existing social protection system which mostly reached the formal sector. Nevertheless, our
estimates are that the stimulus package for 2009 was moderately pro-poor, with almost 10 percent of
the beneficiaries being poor, compared to 8.5 percent of the population being poor. This is because
the stimulus package also explicitly targeted rural areas where most of Thailand's poor live
(Section VII.A). The second phase of the stimulus package (which is not a prior action) is likely to
be less targeted to the poor because of the emphasis on urban infrastructure although there has been
attention paid to geographic distribution. Nevertheless, it is funding small-scale irrigation projects as
well as the government's new farm income support scheme, which has benefited about three million
farming households.

167.    The other prior actions are likely to have a positive social impact. Over time these
reforms should lead to better service delivery in the public sector, including for the poor. Thus, prior
actions to improve fiduciary controls and accountability in public financial management, enhance the
policy focus of budget formulation, reduce rigidities in the civil service and strengthen the oversight
of public agencies should lead to efficiency and accountability in the delivery of public services.
None of these measures are expected to have negative consequences for the poor. The Civil Service
Reform explicitly ensures that the changes do not lead any civil servant worse off relative to before
the reform.

              Annex 2. Application of Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

The design of this Development Policy Loan has drawn extensively on the lessons learned by the World
Bank on application of conditionality and the Public SRL. The following are the key good practice
principles and lessons learned, and as they have been applied to this DPL.
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The DPL supports policy and institutional reforms in line with the government's priorities. The reform
program being supported by the DPL has been developed by the government and implemented already for
many years. Policy actions on the public financial management stem from on-going the laws and
institutional arrangements already put in place by the Government, and have been jointly identified as the
key ones where the World Bank can provide implementation support for assisting in the reform
implementation. The policy actions on public administration and service delivery, likewise, stems from
the Royal Decree on Good Governance 2003 and the Civil Service Act of 2008 and are already under
implementation by respective government agencies.
Principle 2: Agree up front with government and partners on a coordinated accountability framework
The policy matrix represents an agreed framework with government, based on the government's own on-
going public sector reform program. This DPL has been discussed with Japan and ADB, the two major
development partners also considering budget support loans at this stage. The policy matrix also sets out
the medium term outcome indicators with targets to be achieved by the government's public sector reform
program. The short and medium term reform focus will be adjusted as the program evolves.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The policy matrix comprises a subset of reform measures that are part of the government's broader
development program. It does not pretend to capture the totality of reforms being implemented, nor to
raise issues that are key to growth or poverty alleviation but that, for various reasons, may be
counterproductive if part of a high profile program, such as the DPL. Hence, although the World Bank is
engaged in a dialogue across a number of sensitive policy areas, many policy actions are left outside the
scope of the DPL to take into account country circumstances and the political economy.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The actions supported by the operation are based on joint analytical work and technical discussions with
the authorities, and focus on issues central for achieving results on performance based public sectors that
the authorities are already focusing. The medium term focus also remains on key policy reforms that are
important for achieving results and on the governments' reform agenda.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent reviews conducive to predictable and performance based financial
support
The preparation of this operation has centrally been aligned with the governments' request and needs for
financial support, and based on a process of preannounced reviews of the public finance management and
service delivery reforms. Given the decentralized Bank program, discussions with government
counterparts and development partners are done on a regular basis in-country.
