                         The Government's stimulus package helped bolster domestic consumption and investment, thereby cushioning the negative affect of the global financial crisis on the Thai economy.
                         GDP growth rate in 2010 registered at 7.8 percent. Progress with the public sector reform program was also sustained. Linkages between budgeting and planning were improved and
                         the difference between the bottom-up and top-down MTEF narrowed to less than 5 percent, the government obtained certification from the Office of the Auditor General for 2007/08
                         financial statements and there was a reduction in reconciliation errors within GFMIS. Government agencies published budget and actual report on respective websites of the Ministry
                         of Finance and the Bureau of the Budget. On improving service delivery government agencies reduced costs by more than 5 percent as compared with 2009. There was also broad
                         improvement in the results based management systems as the Bureau of the Budget, the Office of the Public Sector Development Commission and the Office of the Civil Service
                         Commission harmonized the key performance indicator forms and the Government approved the integration of fragmented results based systems into a comprehensive Government
                         Evaluation System. The Government also implemented performance pay across the bureaucracy and in 2011, pay increases were based on the new performance management
                         system rather than the previous step-wise general increase. Staff deployment across agencies based on specialization also increased.
