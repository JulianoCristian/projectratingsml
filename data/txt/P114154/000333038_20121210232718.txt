     THAILAND PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                              (PSRDPL)
                               P114154
                              77230-TH
                         Restructuring Paper



1.     The closing date for the Thailand Public Sector Reform Development Policy Loan
[77230-TH], [P114154] will be extended from December 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013.

2.       The objectives of the PSRDPL are to assist the Royal Thai Government (RTG) in its
response to the financial crisis and to support institutional development in the public sector by:
(i) improving the effectiveness of the public financial management framework through better
governance and accountability; (ii) enhancing the skills and performance of the civil service; and
(iii) improving quality and timeliness of service delivery. The prior actions corresponding to
each objective were met since the loan was negotiated in May 2009. Further progress have been
made since then as outlined in Annex 3 Development Policy Matrix of the PSRDPL program
document.

3.      The Royal Thai Government (RTG) has so far withdrawn USD100 million and intends to
withdraw the remaining USD900 million in support of the implementation of their FY2013
budget; in particular, the extension will enable the withdrawals to be more aligned with the
implementation of the RTG’s investment plans for FY2013 (October 2012-September 2013)
which will mostly be in the first half of 2013.

4.       The proposed extension will also be helpful in lowering the cost of swapping the
PSRDPL proceeds from US dollars to Thai Baht for the RTG. The baht swap market is quite thin
and is therefore volatile. The proposed extension of the PSRDPL closing date to June 2013 will
make it difficult for speculative investors to predict when the MOF will make the swaps and how
much each time. The extension will also allow the MOF to make swaps in smaller amounts at a
time – which will not swing the swap market by too much which is undesirable by (and may hurt)
other non-speculative clients in the swap market (e.g. exporters).

5.      This will be the second extension of the project, and a cumulative extension of 9 months.
