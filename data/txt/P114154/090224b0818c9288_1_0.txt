                         The objectives of the PSRDPL are to assist the Royal Thai Government (RTG) in its response to the financial crisis and to support institutional development in the public
                         sector by: (i) improving the effectiveness of the public financial management framework through better governance and accountability; (ii) enhancing the skills and
                         performance of the civil service; and (iii) improving quality and timeliness of service delivery. The prior actions corresponding to each objective were met since the loan
                         was negotiated in May 2009. Further progress have been made since then as outlined in Annex 3 Development Policy Matrix of the PSRDPL program document.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         The Loan was signed in May 2012. To date, the Royal Thai Government (RTG) has disbursed USD100 million and submitted a withdrawal application for USD100 million to be
                         disbursed on January 23rd, 2013. At this time the RTG aims to draw down the full amount. Based on a request from RTG, the closing date for the DPL has been extended to June
                         2013.

                         Progress towards achieving the program development objectives has been satisfactory. To improve the quality and timeliness of service delivery, the Office of the Public Sector
                         Development Commission continues to monitor the time taken by each agency to deliver public services (as part of the agencies agreed key performance indicators). In 2012, for
                         example, the Business Development Department in collaboration with other agencies established a one-stop service for business registration in different locations across the country.
                         This has reduced business registration time and procedure which is reflected in the latest Doing Business 2013 report.

                         The Government's stimulus package helped bolster domestic consumption and investment, thereby cushioning the negative affect of the global financial crisis on the Thai economy.
                         GDP growth rate in 2010 registered at 7.8 percent. Progress with the public sector reform program was also sustained. Linkages between budgeting and planning were improved and
                         the difference between the bottom-up and top-down MTEF narrowed to less than 5 percent, the government obtained certification from the Office of the Auditor General for 2007/08

                         of Finance and the Bureau of the Budget. On improving service delivery government agencies reduced costs by more than 5 percent as compared with 2009. There was also broad
                         improvement in the results based management systems as the Bureau of the Budget, the Office of the Public Sector Development Commission and the Office of the Civil Service
                         Commission harmonized the key performance indicator forms and the Government approved the integration of fragmented results based systems into a comprehensive Government

                         Evaluation System. The Government also implemented performance pay across the bureaucracy and in 2011, pay increases were based on the new performance management
                         system rather than the previous step-wise general increase. Staff deployment across agencies based on specialization also increased.
