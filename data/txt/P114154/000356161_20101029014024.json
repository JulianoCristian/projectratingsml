Sector\n            Reform Development Policy Loan (PSRDPL) are to assist the\n            Royal Thai Government (RTG) in its response to the financial\n            crisis and to support institutional development in the\n            public sector by: 1) improving the effectiveness of the\n            public financial management framework through better\n            governance and accountability; 2) enhancing the skills and\n            performance of the civil service; and 3) improving quality\n            and timeliness of service delivery. The RTG is requesting\n            this US$1 billion PSRDPL to sustain economic recovery from\n            the global financial crisis. During loan preparation in late\n            2008 and early 2009, Thailand became one of the countries in\n            Asia most affected by the global financial crisis making\n            more urgent the need for resources. Around this time, the\n            political climate also deteriorated significantly. The loan\n            was negotiated in May 2009, but the government did not\n            submit it to Parliament as the political situation did not\n            allow parliamentary discussion as required by the\n            Constitution. The economy began to recover in late 2009, and\n            there has been a period of relative political calm since\n            June 2010. As a result, the government initiated the process\n            for parliamentary discussion of the loan, Parliament\n            approved the loan in August, and the Government has now\n            requested the Bank for final approval. The delay in\n            Parliamentary approval meant a relatively long gap between\n            negotiations and final board consideration. During this\n            period, the government continued to make significant\n            progress in implementation of the forward-looking reform\n            program discussed during negotiations, in addition to the\n            standard consideration of implementation of the prior actions."}, "docdt": "2010-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
