of the Public Sector\n            Development Policy Project for Thailand was satisfactory.\n            The risk to development outcome was moderate; the\n            Bank's performance was moderately satisfactory; and the\n            borrower's performance was satisfactory. The original\n            project development objective was not revised. The reason\n            for the restructuring enables the withdrawals to be more\n            aligned with the implementation of the Royal Thai\n            Government's (RTG) investment plans for FY2013. The\n            extension also helps lower the cost of swapping the project\n            proceeds from US dollars to Thai Baht for the RTG. The baht\n            swap market is quite thin and is therefore volatile. Lessons\n            learned included, 1) reforms with wide support can be\n            implemented and maintained even during periods of\n            substantial political turmoil; 2) while it is common to\n            observe that political turmoil and/or political transitions\n            can affect the pace of DPL program implementation, the Thai\n            case shows something different: these problems can also\n            substantially delay loan utilization well past the date of\n            Board approval even when the macroeconomic framework is\n            acceptable; 3) Sustained engagement with the Thai\n            authorities over many years, despite the lack of a borrowing\n            program since 1999, allowed Bank to quickly respond to the\n            emerging global financial crisis and recession; and 4) it is\n            important to avoid using outcome indicators that are not\n            under the full control of the authorities. This is evident\n            in from the lack of a second Public Expenditure and\n            Financial Accountability exercise which would have yielded\n            the data needed for some of the outcome indicators."}, "docdt": "2014-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
