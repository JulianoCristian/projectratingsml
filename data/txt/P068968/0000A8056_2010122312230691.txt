                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to improve road transitability and accessibility through the rehabilitation of key segments of the national and secondary
                         road networks and the strengthening of the country's capacity to manage road assets. At a broader level, the project seeks to preserve economic development
                         along key road links of the national network and facilitate the social and economic integration of the regions and communities in the area of influence of those
                         links.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project which aims at improving road transitability in Bolivia, has financed some 30 contracts for the rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of key segments of the primary and

                         secondary road network. To date, about 530 km of roads have been rehabilitated (81% of the expected target), periodic maintenance works have been completed over 1,185 km
                         (80% of the total length contracted) and routine maintenance activities have been carried out on a yearly basis over the total length of the primary network. Currently about78% of the
                         loan proceeds have been disbursed (SDR48.0 million). Some additional SDR7.5 million are already committed (works/studiesunder execution), which would bring the level of actual
                         and committed expenditures to about 88% of the loan amount. After having confronted several issues that affected its performance and implementation pace, disbursement rates
                         are starting to pick-up again.Despite some shortfalls, the Project is coming to an end with specific achievements in most of its key components.
