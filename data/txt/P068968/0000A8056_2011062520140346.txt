                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to improve road transitability and accessibility through the rehabilitation of key segments of the national and secondary
                         road networks and the strengthening of the country's capacity to manage road assets. At a broader level, the project seeks to preserve economic development
                         along key road links of the national network and facilitate the social and economic integration of the regions and communities in the area of influence of those
                         links.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project which aims at improving road transitability in Bolivia, has financed some 30 contracts for the rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of key segments of the primary and

                         secondary road network. To date, about 530 km of roads have been rehabilitated (81% of the expected target), periodic maintenance works have been completed over 1,185 km
                         (80% of the total length contracted) and routine maintenance activities have been carried out on a yearly basis over the total length of the primary network.
                         Even though the Project improved its disbursements during the last semester, not all remaining funds could be disbursed before the closing date. As a result, on March 2011, the
                         GoB requested a cancellation of 6.05 million SDR, which were reallocated towards the "National Roads and Airport Infrastructure Project" (project approved by the Board on May 5,
                         2011). To date, nearly 80% of the Credit has been disbursed, 10% has been canceled, and 10% remains undisbursed (but mainly committed).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As agreed in the past, ABC requested a project restructuring to reallocate proceeds among disbursement categories. In addition, and as noted above, the GoB cancelled part of credit
                         proceeds, which were reallocated to the new transport project approved by the board on May 2011.
