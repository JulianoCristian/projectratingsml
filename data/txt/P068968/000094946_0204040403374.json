the national, and secondary road network, and will as well\n            strengthen the capacity to manage road assets. Project\n            components will: 1) prioritize segments rehabilitation of\n            the national road network, based on an in-depth government\n            analysis of rehabilitation alternatives, confirmed against\n            results of the Transport Master Plan. Construction works\n            will take place within the existing right-of-way, with no\n            displacement foreseen; 2) pilot secondary roads\n            rehabilitation, based on eligibility criteria, linking road\n            segments to main economic corridors, thus facilitating road\n            transport, and accessibility. Maximum rehabilitation costs\n            per Km will be specified, and institutional requirements\n            completed on road investment planning, financing, and\n            programming, and, socioeconomic and environmental criteria\n            shall comply with established safeguards; 3) fund a road\n            maintenance national account on a yearly declining basis, as\n            the financing source for the 2002-2006 routine maintenance,\n            and resurfacing program of the road network, in strict\n            compliance with environmental regulations; 4) provide\n            technical assistance for, development of road safety\n            initiatives, strengthening capacities, pre-investment road\n            studies, supervising rehabilitation works, and carrying out\n            performance audits of resources allocation, and independent\n            opinions on trunk-road conditions, including impact\n            evaluations on local livelihoods; and, 5) strengthen\n            institutional development, by consolidating sector reforms,\n            developing alternative mechanisms for road maintenance\n            activities, and setting information management systems to\n            strengthen financial accountability, which includes training."}, "docdt": "2002-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
