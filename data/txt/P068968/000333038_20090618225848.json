The delays and issues faced during\n            project implementation are primarily due to the convergence\n            of the following factors: (i) a highly politicized\n            institutional restructuring process following the\n            change-over of the administration in 2006, that generated\n            great uncertainty, hindered decision making, and resulted in\n            several months of inactivity; (ii) unexpected external\n            factors (mostly country-related) plaguing the implementation\n            of a relatively straightforward resurfacing component; (iii)\n            longer than expected preparatory timeframes required for the\n            secondary roads component lingering its implementation; (iv)\n            emerging technical problems in the rehabilitation works of\n            some segments of the Boyuibe-Yacuiba corridor requiring a\n            special technical audit to establish causes and possible\n            solutions; and most lately; and (v) the aftermath of the\n            floods that affected the country in early 2007, demanding\n            the redirection of the implementing agency's efforts to\n            attend under emergency response, the most vulnerable roads.\n            The changes are: 1) modify schedule one of the credit\n            agreement to include a new category for the rehabilitation\n            works in the Beni region; 2) modify the project's\n            description with regards to Part A in schedule two to\n            reflect the additional 180 km rehabilitation works in the\n            Beni region; and 3) reallocate SDR 3.7 million from category\n            one (c) to finance up to 65 percent of the rehabilitation\n            works in the Beni region and SDR 1.57 million from category\n            four to category two (a) to finance additional supervision activities."}, "docdt": "2007-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
