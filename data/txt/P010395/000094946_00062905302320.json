satisfactory, and sustainability is likely. The project\n            was well designed, addressed key educational issues, with\n            relevant, and clearly defined objectives, and had a direct\n            link to the Government's medium-term plans in the\n            sector. The lessons address: 1) Quality, which can be\n            achieved by focusing on the acquisition of basic learning\n            skills, and introducing an integrated approach at the school\n            level, to promote student learning, teacher performance, and\n            school development. Although the project did succeed in\n            improving the delivery of quality of education, it did not\n            however improve substantial learning, and achievement of\n            students. Hence, the following operation is designed to\n            adapt, and expand the school cluster model, to improve\n            teaching, and learning, and will strengthen curriculum\n            implementation. 2) Access, which can be improved through\n            strategies targeting the neediest, to increase participation\n            in education, and, interventions to increase girls, and\n            out-of-school children enrollment. Further improvements\n            would come through the appointment of female teachers,\n            provision of textbooks, and scholarships, in addition to\n            literacy programs, and strengthened support for teachers. 3)\n            Institutional development, should be integrated into the\n            education system, by reinforcing stability of staff,\n            technical capacity building, and professional accountability."}, "docdt": "2000-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
