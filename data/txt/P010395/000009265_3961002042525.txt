BASIC AND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrowers      The Kingdom of Nepal
Amounts        SDR 21.8 million (US$30.6 million)
Termos         Standard with 40 years maturity
Cofinancieras  Grant financing on a parallel basis will be provided bys the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) approximately US$10.8
million; the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
approximately US$7.0 million, the Danish Agency for
International Aid (DANIDA) approximately US$10.0 million, and
the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)
approximately US$15.0 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has provided parallel financing equivalent to US$20.2 million.
Each will administer its portion of the project, and follow its
own guidelines for procurement and employment of consultants.
Prolect
Description:   The seven-year project will continue the work begun in the
first Primary Education Project, Credit 1463-NEP, expanding its
scope from six of 75 districts to the entire Kingdom. The
project will improve the quality of basic and primary education
by simplifying the primary curriculum, rewriting textbooks and
training teachers. The project will increase access to primary
schooling by increasing non-fommal primary education clauses,
and by refurbishing existing schools and constructing now ones.
The implementation capacity of the subsector will be improved
by strengthening the Ministry of Education's management,
planning and monitoring activities.
Benefits and
Riskos         The major benefit of the project will be the creation of a more
efficient delivery system to provide higher quality instruction
in basic education at the primary level. However, because of
the time it takes to institutionalize significant change in the
education sector, most of the direct and visible benefits will
occur after completion of the project. The cost of educating a
primary school graduate will begin to be c.duced because of
lower dropout and higher retention rates. The curriculum will
be simplified, and textbooks revised. Teaching skills and
teacher morale will be improved. Girls, the very poor and
those in remote areae will have increased opportunity to
receive a basic education. The proportion of female primary
school teachers will rise from 12.5 of the work force to
approximately 19? by the year 2000. A second, and more
immediate, benefit of the project will be increased
effectiveness in the utilization of domestic and foreign
resources. The process of planning the project for the

subsector has already resulted in the integration of inputs
financed by six foreign donors. The project will integrate the
grade-by-grade improvements in curriculum and textbooks with
the teacher training program. The major risks to the project
would be inadequate management and delays in counterpart
funding. MOEC is mitigating the first risk by strengthening
its management (the Division of Program Management) and
administrative (the National Center for Educational
Development) units. While the delays in the release of funds
are, for the most part, the result of HHG financial control
mechanisms outside MOEC's management, the risk will be somewhat
mitigated by the strengthened program management enabling MOEC
to anticipate funding delays and possibly head them off.

NEPAL
BASIC AND PRIMARY EDUCATi)N PROJECT
I. SECTOR CONTEXT
A. Sector Development Issues
1.1       Nepal is extremely poor, with almost all indicators of social
deprivation among the very lowest in the worlds between 40Z and 60Z of the
population live at income levels below that estimated to be required for a
minimum caloric intake; averagelife expectancy (52 years) and infant mortality
(115 per 1,000) are similar to levels found in the poorest parts of sub-
Saharan Africa; and a majority of the population suffer from the effects of
malnutrition and/or debilitating diseases.
1.2       The country is afflicted with a serious poverty of human resources.
Only about 35Z are literate (182 of females), and it is estimated that less
than 8% of the post-school age population have completed secondary education.
Lack of education on this scale severely limits the capacity to develop the
economic base, or to make progress in other areas (e.g., hygiene or fertility
behavior). At the same time, Nepal is already overcrowded relative to the
existing resource base, and without a major population control effort,
population will double by about 2015, and double again in the following 28
years. There is little or no prospect of significant development taking place
until these problems are overcome.
1.3       The overall thrust of Government development strategy has been to
concentrate on the expansion of agriculture and on the provision of the basic
infrastructure needed to sustain longer term development. Within this
context, the social sectors have been accorded a relatively lower priority,
although the importance of developing human capital has been recognized with
continuing expansion of a universal education system. Rapid expansion of
educational opportunities in Nepal was inaugurated by His Majesty's Government
of Nepal (HMG) in 1951. Widespread education of the people had been
discouraged during the previous regime with only 321 primary schools, 11
secondary schools, one small college and a technical school, existing in 1951.
By 1989 there were more than 15,800 primary schools. At the secondary school
level, the number of schools increased from a total of 11 in 1951 to 5,732 in
1989. Since the establishment of Tribhuvan University in 1960, very high
enrollment growth rates have also taken place in post-secondary education.
Universal Primary Education (UPE) by the year 2000 has been a stated goal of
HMG since 1987. Despite these impressive gains, three major issues remains
(a) access to educational services remains low and inequitably
distributed;
(b) the education provided is of poor quality; and
(c) severe budgetary limitations have constrained growth and quality.



-2-
Access to Basic Education
1.4       The internal efficiency of the system is very low.  High drop-out
and repetition rates are pervasive national problems. The majority of primary
school age children still do not regularly attend school. With approximately
one half of boys and one third of the girls between the ages of 6 and 10
actually enrolled, of those who do enroll, only 40% complete the first year
and proceed to Grade II, and over 702 drop out before completing the five
grades of primary education, with the drop-out rate of girls being much worse
than that of boys. Annex 1 contains a description of the structure of the
education system.
The Quality of Education
1.5       The major issue of the subsector is poor educational quality.  As
experience has shown, a high demand for basic education has resulted in a
rapid growth of schools and increased access. However, because the overall
quality of the physical facilities, teaching staff and educational materials
is inadequate, the internal efficiency of the system is low and unit costs
unacceptably high. There are large numbers of repeaters; many students drop
out because of discouragement with the quality of the system; and a large
number are forced out by teacher attitudes or by urnreliable student assessment
methods.
1.6       HMG has recognized the need to improve  the quality of the primary
school system. With the aid of a number of donors, a start has been made on
improving the curricula, textbooks and teaching mvterials, initial and
recurrent teacher training, and the management of the system. However,
quality improvement in education is a slow process, involving not only
improved inputs such as curricula and textbooks, but also improved knowledge
and more positive attitudes toward teaching of a large, poorly trained and
geographically dispersed teaching staff. The technical and social change
necessary to provide a system of reasonable quality will require a minimum of
some 15 years of steady investment before quality improvements are fully
institutionalized. Because Nepal is at the early stages of this process,
there are few signs of improvement at the classroom level. An encouraging
start has been made through pilot projects (para. 1.25) and is currently
enhanced through support for project preparation from a Japanese Grant (paras.
1.28 and 1.29).
1.7       The Primary School Curriculum.  The  Curriculum, Textbook,
Supervision and Development Center (CTSDC) is the agency of the Ministry of
Education and Culture (MOEC) responsible for the development of a more
effective primary school curricuium. Supported by The United Nations
Children's Fund  UPNICEF), the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) and
the International Development Association (IDA), CTSDC has begun to
systematically improve the primary school curriculum. While the work in
progress is at an early stage, it is expected that CTSDC could complete a
first revision of the whole primary school curriculum and materials in the
next five to seven years, and with project assistance, field test new
textbooks and train teachers in their use.



-3 -
1.8       The problems CTSDC has been addressing are formidable.  The
existing primary school curriculum is overly complex, badly organized and
sequenced, and has little relevance to the daily lives of most pupils. The
objectives of the curriculum are very general and too imprecise to be used to
guide teaching and learning, or to assess pupil performance. The curriculum
is taught predominantly on a rote learning basis. Grade I readers are
burdened with a mass of new vocabulary, much of which occurs only once and is
unlikely to be used by most children. Competencies and subjects have yet to
be worked out for the curriculum as a whole and for individual grades: and the
syllabus pays no attention to the need to engage children in their own
learning and to foster their creativity. Curricula and textbook content has
been developed without sufficient regard to appropriate roles for women in the
economic and social development of the Kingdom, with the result that serious
gender bias exists in primary school instructional materials. The rich and
varied heritage of Nepalese culture in music, dance, literature and the visual
arts is largely ignored.
1.9       Primary School Examinations.  The examination system in primary
schools is a disincentive to learning and attendance, with low validity and
reliability, and with emphasis on recall of often inaccurate material.
Examinations for Grades I to IV are set and marked either at an individual
school level or a clu -ter or schools, with no outside assistance. No item
analysis takes place, and teachers have no training in the setting, marking
and moderating of examinations. In Grade V, the terminal examination is set
by an examinations committee, convened by the District Educatlon Officer
(DEO). The committee frequently comprises persons who have no experience or
qualifications in primary education. Parents are asked to pay for their
children's entry to examinations each year sometimes as much as Rs. 10, which,
together with fees for the transportation of textbooks and school fund,
provide a disincentive to those with several children, particularly girls.
Those fees are, however, one of the few sources of funds for the upkeep of che
schools.
1.10      The CTSDC is developing a method of continuous student assessment
that can be used more effectively by teachers. Instead of using examinations
to make decisions solely about who is promoted and who must repeat their
grade, the new approach will train teachers in diagnosis and remedial help for
those who are falling behind. This process of Continuous Pupil Assessment
will be closely tied to curriculum objectives for each subject in each grade.
1.11      Textbooks.  Textbooks are currently provided free to all girls in
primary schools and to boys through Grade III (except in remote areas where
boys also get free books through Grade V). This generous and important policy
of HMG is hampered in its effectiveness because of the low quality of the
textbooks. Most of the textbooks are outdated (some are as much as 15 to 20
years old and have had few revisions). There is no internal organization of
the textbook material which imposes a methodology or learning strategy on
either pupils or teachers. The books lend themselves to rote learning
techniques and the wholesale copying of text into the pupils' notebooks.
There are no teacher's guides for the use of the textbooks and almost no
supplementary reading material in school classrooms. There are no



- 4 -
professional design, lay-out, production control, financial control and
publishing management skills in either the CTSDC or in the Janak Educational
Materials Center, the Government-owned textbook printing house. Textbook
durability is very poor, and while surveys are not yet complete, it seems that
production specifications are too low for sustained use of the textbooks in
the classroom. One mission review of 12 schools in early 1991 found that
after just three months of use, 93Z of the textbooks in Grade I were in
unacceptable physical condition.
1.12      Additionally, the current method of distribution adds to
educational expense. The books are not well packed for shipment, badly
handled in transportation, stored inappropriately (especially at the DEO's
headquarters). Expenses are further increased because HMG utilizes two poorly
managed duplicative systems of distribution.
1.13      Teacher Training.  Central to the delivery of the revised primary
school curriculum, materials and textbooks is the development of an effective
training system to introduce that curriculum into the primary classroom. The
new curriculum will require teachers to learn new content and approaches which
cannot be learned on a one-shot basis. Thus, a training system is required
which is capable of continually updating teachers' knowledge and skills as the
momentum of curriculum development increases. Moreover, to be effective the
system has to be developed in concert with the phasing of the new curriculum,
textbooks and materials. Because it is in the classroom that the three
elements of new curriculum, revised textbooks and recurrent training come
together, the training is more effective when it is school-focused and
practice-based, with opportunities for teachers from the same school and area
to consider together the implications of the changes for their professional
practice. If the overall aim is to improve the quality of primary education
nationwide, the system has to be capable of implementation nationwide at an
affordable cost. Improved quality in primary education is essential to the
eradication of wasteful repetition and dropout and to the achievement of a
more cost-effective provision of primary education and the expansion of the
system. Thus, the recurrent training system needs to be capable of speedy
implementation, if UPE is to be achieved.
1.14      Currently, a small minority of teachers is reached through such a
system in the form of the cluster models organized as part of two projects:
the Primary Education Project (PEP), Credit 1463-NEP, and the Education for
Rural Development Project, better known as the SETI Project. In 1991-92, for
example, the CTSDC will deliver approximately 130,000 teacher days of training
to 5,000 teachers as part of the PEP project. This model is primary school
focused, and assumes a cluster of approximately 10 to 15 primary schools,
whose needs are served by a resource person or cluster leader, who, in turn is
trained centrally along with other resource persons. The cluster centers are
located in primary schools and are supervised by a field coordinator. Each
cluster appoints a committee under the chairmanship of one of the local head
teachers. The system also affords the opportunity for recurrent training of
teachers to take place either in the cluster or, together with the appropriate
head teacher, in the home-base school. The advantage of this system is that
small groups of teachers, who live and work together closely, can be taught in



an exemplary manner, sharply fucused on the new material, teaching methods and
curricula, as those emerge from the curriculum development process. The
system also affords facilities for out-of-school and non-formal education.
1.15      Female Teachers.  Not only do female teachers currently represent a
small proportion of the teaching force (12.52), but it is becoming more
difficult to recruit an adequate number of female primary school teachers
because of the small numbers of female students who pass the examinations for
the School Leaving Certificate. Since there is growing evidence that female
teachers in primary schools are an important determinant of attendance of
girls, this problem will make it difficult for MOEC to meet its policy
objective of increasing girls attendance, unless special efforts are made to
recruit more women.
1.16      Schools Development.  To respond to the planned growth in the
number of primary school places during the coming decade, a major program of
classroom construction and upgrading will be required. The present stock of
primary school classrooms, estimated at 68,000, would need to rise rapidly to
85,000 over the next seven to eight years if HKG were to reach UPE by year
2000. With relatively few exceptions, the present primary schools have been
built by the communities without the benefit of financial or technical inputs
from outside the community. The schools therefore tend to follow the scale of
the domestic buildings In the communities and employ similar materials and
construction techniques. This unfortunately results in many facilities that
are of low durability and very often poorly suited to their education
function. Little systematic maintenance is performed, and as a result school
buildings deteriorate rapidly, necessitating costly building rehabilitation
which communities can ill afford. Few primary school buildings offer
resistance to even moderate earthquakes and, as recent experience showed in
1988 in Eastern and Central Nepal, destructior. can be widespread, the cost to
communities great, and the educational loss from severe to permanent. The
physical condition of existing schools is, therefore, a problem almost as
pressing as the need to expand classroom space. Recent experience in the
Earthquake Schools Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2047-NEP) has demonstrated that
an effective schools rehabilitation program can be delivered by the Ministry
of Housing and Physical Planning (MHPP).
1.17      MOEC currently has neither the staff nor a monitoring system to
maintain data on the physical condition of the schools. While there is much
anecdotal evidence that schools are in poor condition, few facts are
available. Effective facilities planning is not possible at this time.
On-going school mapping in 31 districts will gradually provide some much
needed information. At this time MOEC does not have the technical staff or
organizational structure to carry out any geographically widespread and large
scale construction or upgrading of schools. MOEC also is not staffed to guide
or operate a large-scale school maintenance program, and at the present time
this activity is not budgeted for by the Ministry.
1.18      Sectoral Management.  As noted above, the operational units of MOEC
have management deficiencies which must continue to be addressed if a new
curriculum is to be developed, textbooks efficiently produced and distributed,



- 6 -
teachers trained, and school buildings properly constructed 'and maintained.
Additionally, the pclicy--making, planning and monitoring capacity of MOEC
will need strengthening if it is to manage a subsectoral development activity
of the scope needed. The core staff of the Ministry is housed in quarters of
dubious safety. Financial planning is minimal as most budgets are incremental
and development has been for the most part donor-driven. There is no system
in place to assess the effectiveness of existing programs.
1.19      The management problems of MOEC are exacerbated by the system of
project management used for development projects. Donors (including IDA) have
insisted upon Project Implementation Uniits (PIUs) to better assure that the
projects they are financing are well managed. Despite the addition of
implementation specialists, local and foreign consultants, additional pay and
benefits, there is little evidence that PIUs have been effective (although
occasionally talented project managers have made short-term improvements).
Most foreign-aided projects are behind schedule, under-financed by HMG, and
unable to meet their design objectives. Additionally, the development of PIUs
may have worsened the morale within MOEC, as non-project staff have little or
no access to foreign or local training, modern equipment or improved personal
benefits.
1.20      Some of the management issues are being addressed.  Using financing
from the Japanese Grant Fund of Japan's Policy and Human Resources Development
Fund (para. 1.28), Ministry officials have begun a self-study of reforms
needed. Over the past five years, with support from the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID), MOEC has begun to put in place a data
collection system which will provide basic enrollment, attendance and other
school level data. This system will provide decision-makers with more
reliable statistics, and the opportunity to measure some aspects of
educational change at the school level.
Budgetary Constraints
1.21      Budgetary Limitations.  One of the more severe problems facing the
educational system in Nepal is its financial constraints. Up until the early
1980s, public expenditure in education accounted for only 1.0-1.5Z of Nepal's
Gross Domestic Product (GDP). From 1984/85 to 1990/91 education as a share of
GDP fluctuated at around 2.OZ-2.2Z and represented on average l0.5Z of the
total Government budget. Overall, spending in education in Nepal is lower
than in other countries in the region as well as in other low income countries
elsewhere. An analysis of S MRC 1/ countries during the period 1965-198!
indicates that total education expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been
about 2.42 and that these countries have spent 112 of their total expenditure
in education. During the same period, low-income countries were spending an
average of 3.02 of GDP and about 12.32 of their government total budget in

include Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.



- 7 -
education.2/ Lower middle-income countries were reported to spend an
average of 15.4Z in education as a percentage of total expenditure.
1.22      Despite the increasing number of enrolled students at all
educational levels, public expenditures in education have not expanded as fast
as total Government expenditures. From 1984/85 to 1990/91 total public
expenditure increased at an average annual rate of 8.8Z in real terms while
expenditures in education grew at only 4.9Z. Recent figures indicate that the
financial constraints of the sector have been growing: in 1988/89, the actual
share of education in the total budget was only 9.7Z, falling to 9.12 in
1989/90 and to 8.6Z estimated for 1990/91. The newly elected Government has
allocated a total of Rs 3.2 billion to the education sector in the FY1991/92
budget, or 12.02 of the Government expenditures. It remains to be seen
however, whether this year's performance fits the historical pattern where
"actual" (final) education spending has been about two percentage points below
the "allocated" (budgeted) share.
1.23      Expenditure on Primary Education.  Expenditure on primary education
has grown steadily from about 36Z in 1986/87 to close to 50Z of the total
education expenditure in 1991/92. During the same period, the secondary and
higher education levels received an average of 14X and 24Z of the education
budget respectively. Despite the priority given by the Government to UPE and
the sharp increase in primary enrollments, insufficient resources have been
allocated to effect quality improvements. More than 80? of the total amount
allocated to the primary subsector consists of operational expenditures for
primary schools in the form of grants-in-aid for teachers' salaries, with
investments in quality and efficiency rarely receiving any resources at all.
It is clear that the level of resources needs to be expanded further and
invested in quality components which will improve the internal efficiency of
the subsector.
1.24      Two recent planning exercises 3/ have calculated the magnitude of
the resources needed to strengthen and expand the existing primary education
sector which will result in: (a) UPE by the year 2000 4/; (b) an increase
in the quality and relevance of primary education; and (c) a substantial
reduction in the cost of producing a literate Nepali. Both exercises propose
a series of similar objectives and activities and conclude that, if these

age by the year 2000.



investments were to be made, the share of education in the total budget will
need to increase to 16Z during the decade. In other words, Nepal would
require a 50Z inc:aase from the current level of spending of the primary
subsector of NRs 1.6 billion million (US$37.0 million) to an average level of
about NRs 2.4 billion (US$55.0 million) per year during the next 10 years.
B. Sectoral Objectives and Priorities
1.25      During the last six years the Govermnent has experimented mainly
with two primary education pilot projects designed to address some of the
sector needs.5/ The PEP project has supported the construction of resource
centers and k,\e rehabilitation of more than one thousand schools in six
districts. In addition, five thousand teachers, resource persons and field
coordinators have received training, 150,000 students have participated in the
non-formal programs and new education materials, supplementary readers,
teachers' guides and teacher's aids have been developed and distributed to
project schools. Despite country-wide weak infrastructure and institutions
which contributed to project delays, several evaluations have shown
significant project achievements. All targets have been met or exceeded with
the exception of technical assistance where HMG preferred to use grant
financing. Exchange rate fluctuations have contributed to large savings and
by completion the project will only be about 602 disbursed. Studies to assess
the effectiveness of the in-service teacher training program were carried out
on: (a) repetition, promotion and dropout rates; (b) teachers' knowledge; (c)
teachers' class behavior; and (d) students' achievement. The studies found
that even after only a short time PEP schools have in fact achieved
significant improvements in the rates of promotion, repetition and dropout as
compared to similar non-PEP districts. The percentage of repeaters in grades
1-5 is 24.6Z in PEP schools versus 32.6Z in non-project schools; dropout rates
are higher in the non-project schools by 8.4 percentage points and the
promotion rates (students passing the final examination) of all classes in the
project schools are greater by 12.9 percentage points than those observed at
the non-project schools. Another study conducted on a sample of 17? of the
total number of teachers in four PEP and non-PEP school districts aimed at
testing the teachers' professional knowledge, found that the average pre-test
score of a PEP teacher (33?) compared favorably to the non-PEP teacher (26Z)
and that, after the PEP in-service teacher training, the average score of a
PEP teacher increased to 59?, or a 79Z gain. Class observation and formal
discussions were used to assess teachers' behavior in the classroom in
activities such as lesson preparation, teaching methods, use of educational
materials, student participation, class management and so on. The scores on
PEP teachers' behavior were consistently much higher that the scores on the
non-PEP teachers. Finally, a study to determine students' achievement at
primary level in curriculum subjects (Nepali, Mathematics, etc.) compared a
total of 50 PEP and non-PEP schools. Pre-tests were administered in February
and post-tests in November 1990. The data revealed that while the achievement
5/ One of these was the SETI Project. The other, the IDA-supported Primary
Education Project (PEP), Credit 1463-NEP, finances a pilot project in six,
less remote and more typical, districts of the country.



levels in both PEP and non-PEP districts increased between the pre- and post-
test, the overall pre- and post-test difference achievement data show that the
performance level of the PEP students was three times higher when compared to
the non-PEP students.
1.26      In 1987 the National Development Council endorsed a Basic Needs
Program, which called for UPE by the year 2000. This would have required (by
Bank staff estimates) an increase in primary school enrollments from
approximately 2.5 million in 1990-91 to 3.4 million in the year 2000.
Correspondingly, the number of primary schools would have needed to increase
from approximately 15,000 to 18,600, and the number of primary school teachers
from 68,000 to 85,000. The strategy included measures to increase female
enrollment, to improve adult literacy, to establish a school inspection system
and to improve training, selection and career opportunities for primary
teachers. Although HMG has committed to providing five years of primary
education for all children by the year 2000 and the initial training of all
primary teachers, the current economic constraints make the realization of
this goal difficult (Annex 2).
1.27      In 1990 MOEC commissioned a master plan for the basic and primary
education subsector. A number of important studies (financed and carried out
by donors) had been completed, but this was the first time MOEC took its own
look at the options open to it. The master plan exercise was encouraged by
successive IDA missions, financed by UNDP, and undertaken by a task force of
leading Nepali educators. The result is a medium-term plan for the subsector
(to the year 2000) providing the Government with a set of options under three
different financial scenarios. The plan is playing a significant part in
guiding MOEC decision making, especially as the new Government wrestles with
the difficult issues of providing adequate financing to the sector from its
own and from donor resources.
1.28      A Japanese Grant Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal and IDA was
signed in March of 1991 to assist MOEC preparations for the forthcoming
project.  Building upon the knowledge and insights gained from the PEP and
SITI project, 232.4 million yen (approximately US$1.65 million) are being
invested in financing technical assistance and training of MOEC personnel in
curriculum and textbook development, teacher training, planning and statistics
and research.
1.29      The technical assistance package provides specific support to the
preparation and launch of the Basic and Primary Education Project and the
implementation of the Government's program bys
(a) strengthening very weak managerial and development capacity of the
primary school system;
(b) developing the specialist expertise necessary to reform and
disseminate a new, simplified, primary school curriculum;
(c) supporting and retraining personnel to adopt new approaches to
primary school textbook design and production; and



- 10 -
(d) developing the MOEC's capacity to evaluate and monitor the
performance of the primary school system, by supporting its
statistical, planning and policy-making capacity.
C. External Financing of the Subsector
1.30      Until the start of the current Primary Education Project (Cr. 1463-
NEP) in 1984, the major interventions in the primary sector had been financed
by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), UNICEF and
UNDP. USAID was the major donor during Nepal's first efforts to modernize and
establish a national school system. Through a series of projects, USAID
contributed to the creation and expansioni of primary, secondary and vocational
education systems, and it was also instrumental in developing radio delivery
of education, including radio education teacher training. Since 1969 Nepal
has launched several programs to address low female literacy and enrollments
with the financial and technical assistance of UNICEF. UNDP and UNICEF have
jointly financed the on-going Education for Rural Development Project (SETI)
in the Far Western region, which has aimed to support quality improvements in
primary schools, to improve adult literacy through adult education programs
and to provide basic rural skills training.
D. IDA's Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.31      IDA's initial involvement in the education sector was designed to
increase the supply of technical manpower in engineering and agriculture
through three projects to improve engineering education and one in agriculture
education. However, sector work in the early 1980's also pointed to the need
to improve the access to and the quality of basic and primary education.
IDA's first project in the subsector was the Primary Education Project, Credit
1463-NEP, cofinanced by UNICEF (1984). The project was experimental in
nature, focusing on innovative methods to improve quality and access in basic
and primary education in six districts. After a devastating earthquake in
1988 which extensively damaged primary schools in Eastern Nepal, IDA responded
with the Earthquake Schools Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2047-NEP). Under the
direction of the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning, this project is
building about 13,000 low-cost earthquake resistant classrooms and has already
provided valuable experience in the organization and management of a widely
dispersed school building program under difficult conditions.
1.32      IDA's continuing investigation of social and economic conditions in
Nepal further underscored the essential nature of basic and primary education.
The "Nepal Social Sector Strategy Review" identified the lack of a basic
education as "severely limiting the capacity (of Nepal) to develop (its)
economic base, or make progress in other areas (e.g. hygiene or family
planning behavior)."61 In addition, there was a growing worldwide
consensus, reflected in the 1990 "World Conference on Education for All" in
Jomtiem, Thailand, that universal primary education was a necessary
6/ "Nepal Social Strategy Review", Volume 1, page iv, April 19, 1989.



precondition to economic and social development. As a result of this concern
to improve access to primary education, and based on specific studies of the
condition of primary education in Nepal,7/ IDA and a coalition of five
cofinanciers began a dialogue with HMG in 1989, which has led to the proposed
subsectoral program. Furthermore, research is currently being conducted into
methods of improving equitable access for women in teaching. A US$20,000
grant from World Bank Research Funds has enabled IDA to support a researcher
in the field to help those involved in the project better understand the
determninants of female participation in teaching and in teacher training.
1.33      The lessons learned in the subsector have been substantial.
Because of the recent pilot programs in primary education in Nepal and
neighboring countries, it is now reasonable to expect that the quality of
primary education can be improved by providing such inputs as increased
teacher training and supervision, especially when combined with clusters of
primary schools and resource centers. When more frequent teacher training and
supervision combined with a regular supply of high quality teaching/learning
materials, noticeable improvements result in student achievement, reduced
student repetition and drop-out, as well as increased professional
satisfaction among teachers (para. 1.25). However, as important as these
inputs are to increased quality, there are but limited results unless the
management system is capable of delivering these inputs effectively. To
zimprove sectoral management in Nepal, experience indicates that a number of
changes should take place. First, the leadership of the educational,
financial and planning establishment and the donor community must agree on
priorities, goals and programs (para. 1.27). Second, a more efficient use of
scarce resources needs to be obtained through the coordination of donor-
supported activities in the subsector to integrate the foreign-aided
activities (paras. 1.19-1.20). Third, in addition to the need for a well
staffed, experienced and organized management system, the success of a project
has been directly associated with the qualities of the senior manager of the
program indicating that more time and attention needs to be paid to the
recruitment and training of top staff (para. 1.19). Finally, in programs to
improve the physical quality of schools in Nepal, it has been learned that
primary school construction and classroom rehabilitation can be effectively
delivered by utilizing the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning's
nationwide technical and supervisory experience and encouraging community
support and participation in the program (para. 1.16).
71 One of the most influential of these was the IEES (1988) "Nepal Education
and Human Resources Sector Assessment", Tallahassee, Florida, USA,
Education Efficiency Clearinghouse.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Background
2.1       In preparing its plan for the Eighth Five-Year Plan Period (FY93-
97), MOEC is moving from the geographically scattered, donor-financed, pilot
programs that characterized the 1980s to an integrated, nationwide basic and
primary education program. The financing of this program, developed from the
insights of the master plan (para. 1.27), is being finalized as MOEC completes
negotiations with the remaining four of the six cofinanciers of the program
(para. 3.6). The project described below represents the projected activities
and costs of the basic and primary education program as agreed to during
negotiations. The project will have a five-year implementation phase to keep
it coterminous with the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, but disbursements could
continue for seven years (para. 3.12). During negotiations project costs were
reduced from the pre-negotiations figure of US$186.1 million to US$136.5
million. These reductions were made by: (a) shortening the implementation
period; (b) reducing selected sub-component inputs to fit donor financing
pledged for these sub-components; and (c) reducing the implementation targets
in selected sub-components to increase the likelihood of effective
implementation.
2.2       The major thrust of the proposed project is to improve the quality
and internal efficiency of the subsector. A project of the recommended scope
will not allow HMG to achieve UPE by the year 2000, but it will provide a
strong foundation for later expansion. If the economic climate improves and
HMG is able to devote increased financial and management resources to the
sector, IDA could consider supplementing the financing proposed for this
project through an Education Sector Credit planned for FY95 and/or providing a
second tranche under a follow-on project for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(FY98-2002).
B. Project Objectives and Description
2.3       The project will support EMG's program for the formal and non-
formal primary education subsector. Specifically, the project will:
(a) improve the quality of primary education; (b) increase equitable access to
primary schooling; and (c) strengthen the management of the formal and non-
formal primary education delivery system. The project will increase the
guality of primary schooling by simplifying and making more relevant the
curriculum of the primary schools; providing improved instructional materials,
textbooks and supplementary materials; and institutionalizing a teacher
supervision, support, and training system. The project will improve access to
primary schooling by strengthening the non-formal primary education and
literacy programs. The project will support a number of initiatives to
increase participation of girls in schooling; and renovate and construct
additional classroom facilities for primary schools. The project will improve
the management of the subsector by strengthening MOEC's capacity to plan,
manage and monitor its formal and non-formal primary education programs;
assisting in the development of capacity to coordinate and manage donor-aided



- 13 -
projects; and improving the capacity to plan and monitor physical facilities
development and maintenance.
C. Project Components 8/
Improving the Quality of Primary Education (US$61.4 million)
2.4       Almost one-half of the proposed IDA financing will be in support of
this component (US$14.7 million) which will build on experience gained through
the Primary Education Project, where the impact of improved teaching/learning
materials, supervision and in-service teacher-training has resulted in
improved student achievement, student retention and teacher satisfaction.
However, significant efficiency gains may only materialize fully after the
implementation period of the project when, supported by a follow-on project,
well-trained teachers will be supported by effective supervision and provided
with improved teaching materials.
2.5       Curriculum Development (US$4.6 million).  Project activities under
this sub-component will result in the:
(a) identification of the national goals and objectives of primary
.education;
(b) determination of the essential learning outcomes at the end of a
primary education;
(c) evolution of a revised and simplified curriculum; and
(d) coordination of these activities with a grade by grade introduction
of revised textbooks and the in-service training necessary to
introduce the revised curriculum and textbooks.
2.6       The potential of the above activities to improve quality has been
well tested in the neighboring countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan and India and
through the Primary Education Project in Nepal on a pilot basis in six
districts (para 1.25). By providing a simplified curriculum that is more
relevant to the students, it is expected that regular student attendance will
increase as parents become more convinced of the value of the education their
children are receiving. Teachers will be able to teach more effectively, as
they will have a clearer idea of the desired learning outcomes for each grade.
The revised textbooks, teacher's manuals and workbooks to be developed as a
result of the overall reform in curriculum will help assure the
institutionalization of the new curriculum. The successive rounds of in-
service training will further support teacher understanding and use of the
revised curriculum.
2.7       The preparation of a new primary school curriculum is well
advanced. Not only has the support of UNICEF and IDA through the Primary
8/ All component costs include contingencies.



14 -
Education Project resulted in a strengthened CTSDC, but the addition of
Japanese Grant financing is providing further training of essential personnel
in preparation for the project. It is expected that the new curriculum can be
introduced beginning in January of 1993 and be fully introduced in all primary
grades by 1997.
2.8       Financing for this sub-component will come from UNICEF and IDA.
UNICEF has indicated that it will provide approximately US$5.7 million to
support a coordinated program of curriculum and textbook reform and associated
teacher training. UNDP has also indicated its interest in supporting these
reforms in a coordinated financing scheme with UNICEF and IDA (para. 3.6).
IDA will finance US$0.6 million for civil works for curriculum center offices,
furniture, equipment and vehicles, as well as salaries for additional staff on
a declining basis.
2.9       Textbook Development (US$13.9 million).  Project activities under
this sub-component will result in:
(a) revised textbooks, teacher's guides and supplementary readers as
the new curriculum is introduced;
(b) field-testing of a textbook reuse plan; and
(c) a more efficient storage and distribution system.
2.10      As the curriculum for Grades. I through V is revised, the CTSDC will
be developing textbooks that will help teachers and students implement the new
curriculum in the classroom.  The development cc teacher's guides to assist
the inadequately trained teachers in their use of the textbooks will also be
part of the project. In addition, the project will produce supplementary
readers for all schools. This extra resource for the classroom is designed to
encourage genuine literacy and the development of inquiry. CTSDC has been
developing its capacity during the Primary Education Project. Further
assistance to CTSDC staff is being provided by the Japanese Grant. It is
expected that new textbooks, guides and readers for Grade I will be ready for
printing by credit effectiveness.
2.11      Improvements to manufacturing standards and capacity are essential
if textbooks are to be more efficiently utilized in the primary schools. The
appraisal mission estimated that the cost of textbooks could be reduced in a
range from 27Z to 45Z of current costs depending upon the reuse policy adopted
by the MOEC and improvements in printing standards. MOEC plans to conduct a
pilot test of a book reuse scheme in 2,000 schools by January 1, 1993. The
test will utilize upgraded textbooks which will be secured through
international tender. The Government policy on textbook reuse will be decided
by April 15, 1993. Decisions regarding the possible factory upgrading of the
Janak printing facilities will not be made until after the study and policy
decision.
2.12      As there are currently no professional publishing skills available
in Nepal to undertake the major new program of textbook development, the



- 15 -
project will support the development of a Publishing Unit within the CTSDC.
This unit will be staffed and trained to undertake quality book development
and publishing services on behalf of the Curriculum Wing of the CTSDC.
2.13      Wastage in the system will be reduced during the project by
improvements in the storage and distribution systems, including construction
of book storage at the district level. Initial packing of the books will be
improved. Increased training and supervision of those responsible for the
transportation of the books will also be instituted, and students and teachers
will be trained in the physical care of books. Storage at the district and
school levels will be improved.
2.14      Major financing for this sub-component will be provided by UNICEF.
The details of the financing are being negotiated with HMG, and may include
some support from UNDP (para. 3.6). The Japanese Tnternational Cooperation
Agency (JICA) has expressed interest in providing high quality printing press
facilities to Janak if HMG wishes to upgrade these printing facilities to
improve textbook quality. IDA will provide financing of US$1.1 million for
the civil works for the new Publishing Unit at CTSDC, and the book storage
facilities at District Education Offices.
2.15      In-Service Teacher Training (US$42.9 million).  Project activities
under this sub-component will result in:
(a) expansion of the primary school cluster and resource center system;
(b) the provision of yearly recurrent training for all primary school
teachers;
(c) training focused on improved classroom practice, utilizing t'lie new
curriculum and teaching materials; and
(d) an increase in the proportion of female primary school teachers
from 12.52 of primary teachers to approximately 18.8Z by the year
2000.
2.16      The project will support the development of the school cluster and
resource center system throughout the Kingdom. This will require an estimated
total of about 1,300 resource centers and clusters, served by approximately
650 resource persons (one to each two clusters). During the life of the
project it is expected that 500 resource centers will be constructed in
addition to the 133 financed and being completed during the PEP project. A
follow-on project during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period will be required to
meet the resource center needs. However, the introduction of the new
curriculum, which will be nationwide,.will require training in all 75
districts during the project period. Since the majority of districts will not
have their full complement of resource centers, MOEC will need to provide
training by using mobile teams and district personnel. During negotiations
MOEC indicated it will complete a plan by June 1, 1992 to integrate curriculum
development and dissemination, in-service teacher training and the phasing of



- 16 -
cluster development in light of the shortened project Implementation period
and reduced the number of resource centers to be constructed.
2.17      The structure of a pre-service and in-service training system for
primary school teachers will be completed during the project period. HMG has
signed a loan agreement with ADB which will provide the financing for eight of
nine Primary Teacher Training Centers (one has been constructed). These
centers will, by the end of the decade, be the regional centers for pre-
service education of primary school teachers.  Because of the backlog of
untrained primary school teachers, the centers will be used until 1998 to
provide a short course of initial training for untrained teachers.  ADB-
financed activities will also train education managers and non-teaching staff
of MOEC. The resource centers and clusters will supplement this initial
training and provide in-service teacher training at the school level. MOEC
indicated during negotiations that it will establish a National Center for
Educational Development (NCED) to coordinate primary school curriculum
development, textbook design and publishing with teacher training program to
be delivered through the ADB-financed Primary Teacher Training Centers and the
in-service training and curriculum dissemination through the IDA/DANIDA-
financed resource centers.
2.18      The in-service training to be provided through the resource centers
in the clusters of primary schools will reduce the need for the relatively
expensive institution-based training at the Primary Teacher Training Centers
and provide a method of rapidly diffusing the new curricula and
teaching/learning materials throughout the system. Additionally, the program
will allow teachers to focus on actual classroom practice, with their local
peers, and to adapt the curriculum and teaching materials to the needs of the
local schools.
2.19      It is expected that each resource center will be an integral part
of the host primary school.  It is expected to utilize community cost sharing
procedures for the construction of these units, particularly if the center is
available for school and community use and is built concurrently with a
recipient cluster school upgrading and/or expansion.  DANIDA financing will
assist with the development of demonstration models, for replication under the
project.
2.20      During negotiations it was agreed that MOEC will, in accordance
with a plan satisfactory to the Association, increase the number of female
primary school teachers (para. 7.1(a)). MOEC has committed itself to
establishing a unit within the Ministry which will develop programs designed
to increase female participation in the basic and primary education subsector.
The unit will develop programs to increase the number of female teachers in
the primary system, examining the feasibility of creating the category of
assistant female teachers. In addition it will develop a scholarship program
to assist girls reach SLC qualification. It will establish a priority progr&m
to upgrade under-qualified (less than SLC qualification) female teachers
presently within the system to full qualification. It will ensure that the
curriculum incorporates the views and concerns of females, and it will provide
policy advice to the Secretary, MOEC. Each year MOEC will provide to IDA and



- 17 .
cofinanciers of the project a report indicating progress made in the past year
and plans for the next. The report will specify school and district
distribution of female teachers, the number of female teachers hired in the
past year and the number to be recruited in the next. Methods by which MOEC
will increase the number of female teachers (such as training programs,
scholarships and better information regarding employment opportunities, will
be specified. In addition, the report will address WID issues more broadly,
including, but not limited to methods to improve the status of women in the
curriculum and textbooks of the schools, restructuring of data collection to
assure gender related statistics are collected and used, such as other
affirmative action programs as will provide increased employment for women in
the sector. The number of new female teachers to be hired will, at a minimum,
reflect the following targets: 300 in FY94, 850 in FY95, 1,600 in FY96, 2,400
in FY97, or a total of additional female teachers of 5,150 (Annex 5, p. 2). A
condition of effectiveness is that the Borrower has furnished to the
Associction a program for the appointment of female teachers in FY93
(para. 7.2(a)).
2.21      Financing for teacher training will be provided by ADB, UNICEF,
UNDP, DANIDA and IDA. ADB will finance the construction of eight of the
Primary Teacher Training Centers, their furniture, equipment staffing and
training program through the ADB proposed Primary Education Development
Project. ADB will provide a loan of US$20.2 million, which will also support
construction of primary schools (para. 2.29) and training for education
managers (para. 2.17).  UNICEF will support an integrated program of
curriculum and textbook reform with teacher training. DANIDA will finance the
design and construction of 20 prototype resources centers in order to develop
the most effective designs. IDA will provide sub-component financing of
US$13.1 million to finance: (a) approximately 500 resource centers (US$2.1
million); (b) the recruitment, scholarships and salaries (on a declining
basis) of approximately 5,100 female primary school teachers (US$2.1 million);
and (c) the in-service training costs for the stock of teachers, including
vehicles, equipment and the salaries (on a declining basis) of the training
staff (US$8.9 million).
Access to Educational Resources (US$61.1 million)
2.22      Access to Non-Formal Primary Education (US$8.2 million).  Project
activities under this sub-component will result ins
(a) provision of literacy and numeracy training to adults, especially
women, who have not benefitted from the formal education system;
(b) outreach to primary-school-age children, especially girls, who
cannot utilize the formal system;
(c) provision of post-literacy materials to strengthen the literacy
skills of the newly literate; and



- 18 -
(d) development of early childhood education that will, in the medium
term, reduce the load of younger siblings now crowding Grade I, and
provide opportunities for early nutritional supplementation.
2.23      Non-formal education could potentially be delivered to about
733,000 adults and 220,000 out-of-school children during the project period.
Previously developed curricula and materials will be used to deliver
approximately 46,000 siA- or nine-month courses throughout the country through
approximately 11,500 facilitators. Lower inputs by the donors may result in
reaching a lower percentage of the illiterate population and the difficulty of
reaching remote mountain areas may in itself curb the ability of the
Government to achieve its targets.
2.24      The program will finance teacher salaries, training expenses,
textbooks, teachers' manuals, and instructional materials. Facilitators will
be provided with training through existing local trainers; in turn, they will
be trained by the MOEC's master trainers. A network of district and local
supervisors will be utilized to improve the quality of all non-formal
education programs. One district-level supervisor will be based in each
district education office to manage all NFE activities in his/her district.
Wherever possible, existing district education office formal school
supervisors will be assigned to NFE. Local-level supervisors will be
responsible for the recruitment of facilitators in their areas and the
provision of professional support to them on a regular basis. Each local
supervisor will oversee up to 20 courses. District- and local-level
supervisors will receive a three-day training course each year.
2.25      As more girls enroll in primary schools, early childhood education
will assume an increasingly important role. Several donors are studying the
feasibility of successful models world-wide, and MOEC is committed to the
development of a program in the medium term. IDA will finance building space
for the administrative personnel who will oversee the program that will be
developed by MOEC and donors. UNICEF will provide financing of approximately
US$5.1 million for a five-year period for the entire non-formal education
program, including early childhood education. DANIDA will finance quality
inputs in selected districts where resource centers exist or will be built, as
well as any materials that will be developed (such as additional post-literacy
materials).
2.26      IDA will not finance direct instructional delivery costs in the
proposed non-formal sub-component of the project. IDA resources will be
concentrated on the management and administrative support that will enable the
Government to deliver a program of the proposed magnitude. Specifically, IDA
will provide component financing of US$0.3 million for: salaries of the non-
formal education training staff upon completion of IDA's Primary Education
Project in June 1992; refurbishment, furniture, and equipment for the adult
education unit and for the Primary Education Project non-formal training staff
that will be relocated in MOEC; and vehicles.



- 19 -
2.27      Primary School Construction (US$52.9 million).  MOEC will improve
the quality of education and increase access by developing clusters of schools
for training and supervision of teachers (para. 2.16), construct a resource
center for each cluster, and at the same time refurbish and add to classrooms
in the schools of the cluster. In the absence of data on existing school
facilities or school mapping data, it is necessary to adopt a program approach
to this part of the subsector, i.e., annual construction targets with the
details of school priority lists for upgrading and expansion being prepared
for IDA review and agreed with MOEC annually on the basis of district level
surveys. With assistance from DANIDA, three districts are being surveyed by
MOEC prior to the start of the project. MOEC will conduct surveys in at least
seven districts per annum thereafter (para. 2.37). Construction will be
limited to those clusters where a systematic survey has been undertaken.
2.28      Project activities under this sub-component will result ins
(a) school improvements through expansion and replacement of about
19,000 classrooms, plus essential repairs to about 6,0GO others;
(b) new educational facilities being built to acceptable minimum
earthquake resistance standards; and
(d) communities continuing to demonstrate significant willingness to
assist in the development of their schools, recognizing the
limiting factor of very low levels of financial inputs available
from communities and building on the ability of communities to
provide labor in lieu of cash.
2.29      Financing for the school construction program will be provided by
ADB, which will finance approximately 2,000 replacement classrooms (US$5.0
million), and by IDA which will provide component financing of US$12.0 million
to finance approximately 7,000 new and replacement classrooms and essential
major repairs to 1,100 classrooms. In addition, DANIDA is likely to finance
essential major repairs to a significant number of classrooms (DANIDA will
appraise its project during the fourth quarter of FY92). JICA is discussing
with HMG the likely provision of materials and supplies for school renovation
and construction (on a yearly grant basis which, over the life of the project,
could be worth up to US$15 million) should JICA agree to finance school
construction (para. 3.6).
Institutional Development of the Subsector (US$14.0 million)
2.30      Program Management MOEC (US$5.3 million).  Project activities under
this sub-component will result in:
(a) improved policy-making, planning and monitoring capacity in MOEC;
and
(b) coordination of donor-aided activities.



- 20 -
2.31      MOEC has completed an organizational assessment financed by the
Japanese Grant. While there was clear recognition of the problems facing MOEC
management (para 1.18), the participants in the self study recommended that it
will be imprudent to abandon the donor-financed Project Implementation Units
(PIUs) too quickly. Although there was support for the necessary
strengthening of the policy-making, planning and monitoring capacity of the
Ministry, it was felt that it will take several years before the Ministry
could handle the full range of its program without PIUs. Therefore the
Government will organize a transition over the life of the project from
separate PIUs to a fully integrated system as described below.
2.32      MOEC will coordinate closely the activities to be undertaken in the
subsector, including the necessity to control and direct the resources,
foreign and domestic, required for the program. As a first step in achieving
this important goal, the Ministry will make structural changes by establishing
a Division of Program Management for Basic and Primary Education (subject to
confirmation by the Administrative Reform Commission). This division will
coordinate the activities of all donors in the subsector, and advise on the
timing of inputs. To assure that there will be an effective start-up to the
project, MOEC will transfer essential positions from the current PEP project
(which will close as the new project begins) to the Basic and Primary
Education Project to serve as a temporary program management unit until such
time as the new program management structure is in place. Retroactive
financing of US$200,000 has been provided by IDA to allow for additional
staff, goods or services tor the temporary program management unit that might
be needed prior to effectiveness. A condition of effectiveness of the credit
agreement is that the Borrower hae established with staff, resources and
powers satisfactory to the Association a unit responsible for the
implementation of the project (para. 7.2(b)(i)). The Ministry has appointed a
task force to draft detailed terms of reference and staffing for the ultimate
structure of the program management unit. During negotiations it was agreed
that the Borrower will, by December 31, 1993, complete administrative
arrangements with staff, resources and powers satisfactory to the Association,
for the efficient management of foreign-aided education programs (para.
7.1(b)), and will carry out the project in accordance with a management plan
satisfactory to the Association (para. 7.1(c)).
2.33      The almost century-old structure that houses the bulk of MOEC
professionals will be provided with long-deferred maintenance. This will
include a new roof and the upgrading of the electrical system.
2.34      A technical assistance project for the program management sub-
component is being developed by UNDP. To complement this technical
assistance, IDA will provide financing on a declining basis for the personnel
in the new division (US$0.2 million), furniture (US$0.01 million) and the cost
of the deferred maintenance of the MOEC central office (US$0.3 million). IDA
will also provide financing for studies related to the preparation of future
Basic and Primary Education projects.
2.35      Development of Primary School Design Capacity -- (MOEC) -- (US$1.6
million). Project activities under this sub-component will result in:



- 21 -
(a) physical facilities surveys of primary schools in about half of the
districts in Nepal;
(b) the preparation of a computerized data base of facilities;
(c) identification and prioritization of the level of intervention
required at each cluster of schools in terms of maintenance,
rehabilitation or new construction;
(d) preparation of annual and medium-term implementation plans
including budgetary requirements on the basis of (c) above,
financing availability;
(e) the monitoring and evaluation of annual programs in collaboration
with the executing agency; and
(f) development of appropriate guidelines for primary school
construction and maintenance in conjunction with the technical
ministry.
2.36      Capacity to undertake physical facilities planning including
primary schools should be a regular line function of MOEC. A Physical
Planning Unit will be established within a reorganized Planning Division of
MOEC. Such a unit will institutionalize the functions currently carried out
on a small scale by project units within MOEC, e.g., PEP, SETI, and Royal
Norwegian Development Cooperation (NORAD). An important line function of the
Physical Planning Unit will be to develop maintenance parameters and programs
for schools facilities provided under the project. At negotiations MOEC
provided IDA its plan for the establishment and staffing of the Physical
Planning Unit. A condition of effectiveness is the staffing of a unit
responsible for planning of physical facilities for primary schools and
resource centers (para. 7.2(b)(ii)).
2.37      DANIDA will, at the beginning of the project period, provide
financing for initial school surveys in three to five districts, as well as
financing for the development of 20 prototype resource centers. In addition,
DANIDA will provide technical assistance through foreign and local
consultants, fellowships, as well as equipment, vehicles and furniture.
2.38      School Facilities Construction Program Management (US$2.5 million).
Project activities under this sub-component will result in:
(a) the development of capacity to carry out school building on the
required scale;
(b) the development and adoption of earthquake resistant standards for
schools;
(c) improved technical supervision and management of school
construction; and



- 22 -
(d) the availability of technical advice on school facilities
development in communities.
2.39      MOEC has no regular technical or institutional capacity to
undertake construction on the scale anticipated under the project, although,
limited capacity temporary project units do exist within the Ministry. A
recent Cabinet decision requires that Government Ministries channel their
building programs through the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning
(MHPP). This Ministry also has a national network of engineering and
technical staff through its District Engineering Offices. Currently the
workload on the district staff is low and they represent a source of
technical manpower required for a national or multi-district approach to
facilities development of the type anticipated. During project discussions,
the MHPP confirmed that they are in a position to carry out the proposed
building program. The outline management plan submitted to IDA during
negotiations will form the basis for inter-ministerial cooperation between
MOEC and MHPP and for development of a detailed management and staffing plan
for construction to be submitted to IDA. An interministerial working group
has been formed for this purpose. It is a condition of effectiveness that the
Borrower establish with staff, resources and powers satisfactory to the
Association a unit responsible for construction and rehabilitation under the
project (para. 7.2(b)(iii)).
2.40      Any effective construction program on the scale envisaged will
require unusually careful planning, management control and monitoring of the
many inputs in terms of personnel, construction standards, building materials
and community mobilization. The interests of MOEC in ensuring that any
building program can be coordinated with educational targets must be fully
considered in a construction management structure. Allocation of such a
function to a dedicated construction unit responding adequately to MOEC is
proposed. As the technical Ministry, MHPP will be requested by MOEC to set up
a Schools Rehabilitation and Construction Unit (SRCU) within MHPP for the
project, but with MOEC as client Ministry maintaining close communication with
the SRCU for planning and operational purposes. The unit will be responsible
for the development of designs and implementation of project facilities.
Schools and resource centers will conform to space and function guidelines
that will be prepared by the Physical Planning Unit of MOEC. During
negotiations HMG confirmed that draft guidelines for educational facilities,
facilities designs and cost estimates will be pilot tested during year one of
the project in consultation with IDA before full-scale implementation. HMG
also confirmed that all facilities constructed under the project will be
designed with appropriate resistance to earthquake forces as recommernted by
UNESCO and the Earthquake Emergency Schools Rehabilitation Project of MHPP.
During negotiations it was agreed that the Borrower shall cause construction
and renovation of buildings under the Project, to be carried in accordance
with design and engineering standards satisfactory to the Association (para.
7.1(d).
2.41      The quality of the relationship between the central SRCU and the
MHPP Department of Buildings offices at the District level will be critical.
The SRCU should have appropriate autonomy in terms of the technical aspects of



- 23 -
construction program management, but be directly responsive to MOEC in terms
of planning and prioritization of construction of educational facilities. The
SRCU will respond to an executive board for construction. In turn, the
Executive Board will come under a high-level Steering Committee for the
project comprising representatives of MOEC, MHPP, MOF and other involved
agencies. The organizational framework as well as the staffing structure and
procedures for Accounting, Procurement, Budgeting, Training, Monitoring and
MOEC-MHPP interface will be carefully considered in the required management
plan.
2.42      Financing for the SRCU will be provided by DANIDA and IDA.  DANIDA
will finance foreign and local, consultants, staff training, monitoring and
evaluation. IDA will provide financing for office refurbishing, furniture,
equipment, and vehicles totaling US$1.5 million.

3.2       Basis of Cost Estimates.  These are based upon HMG and mission
estimates, and whenever possible reflect experience with recent bids under
ongoing education projects in Nepal. The costs of civil works for primary
schools and resource centers are based on the use of standard designs and the
employment of communities to undertake construction in accordance with
accepted procedures, and reflect recent project experience in Nepal with local
and international procurement of building materials and typical community
contributions of labor and locally available materials. Other construction
estimates are based upon prevailing construction rates in Nepal which are low.
Costs of vehicles, equipment, and furniture, are derived from local market
prices or CIF unit price. Costs of printing and distribution of textbooks are
based on local rates. Costs of local and foreign consultants reflect local,
donor and international rates as applicable. Overseas fellowshAips are based
upon typical United Nations and project cofinancier rates for this activity.
Costs of salaries and allowances, including training, project, and field
allowances are based on current Government rates.
3.3       Customs Duties and Taxes.  All imported goods are subject to
customs, duties and taxes. Project costs (US$136.5 million) include import
duties and taxes estimated at US$2.9 million.
3.4       Contingencies and Allowances.  Estimated project costs include
physical contingencies (US$6.2 million) estimated at 52 of base costs of all
project components (102 of civil works, vehicles, and books and journals, and
52 of furniture and equipment). Price contingencies (US$11.9 million) are
estimated for local costs at 102 for FY93, 7Z for FY94, 6.5Z for FY95, and 62
thereafter. Escalation of foreign costs is estimated at 3.42 for PY93, 3.9Z
for FY94-95, and 3.8% thereafter.
3.5       Foreign Exchange Component.  As shown in Table 3.1, above, the
estimated foreign exchange component (US$44.9) million, including
contingencies) represents 332 of total project costs. It has been calculated
as follows: (a) construction - 402; (b) furniture - 2.22; (c) equipment -
87Z; (d) vehicles - 96Z; (e) books and journals - 58Z; (f) foreign consultants
and fellowships - 842; (g) studies - 362; (h) vehicles operations and
maintenance - 30Z; and (i) consumable materials - 202.
B. Financing
Overview
3.6       During negotiations it was agreed that the Borrower shall carry out
the Project in accordance with a financing plan satisfactory to the
Association. Such plan shall include estimates of the funds, from the
Borrower's own as well as other sources, required to carry out the Project for
the following fiscal year. The estimate for the following fiscal year shall
be furnished by the Borrower to Association by March 31 of each year (para.
7.1(e)). In addition, it was agreed the Borrower shall by June 15 of each
year furnish an assurance to the Association that adequate funds are available
to carry out the project in the following fiscal year (para. 7.1(f)). It is a
condition of effectiveness that the Association has received assurances from



- 26 -
the Borrower that adequate funds are available to carry out the project in
fiscal year 1993 (para. 7.2(c)). In order to permit MOEC to hire local
specialists who may be needed to further prepare for a timely project start-
up, retroactive financing of US$200,000 has been included. Retroactive
financing will be limited to expenditures incurred prior to loan signing, but
after December 31, 1991. HMG has been assured of grant and loan financing
sufficient to implement the project. During negotiations HMG indicated that
donors were completing their detailed plans for participation in the project.
HMG has signed a loan agreement with ADB which will provide US$20.2 million
equivalent for eight Primary Teacher Training Centers and associated teacher
training programs, for the training of non-teaching staff and for the
construction of about 2,000 replacement classrooms. DANIDA will provide a
grant equivalent to about US$10.0 million to assist MOEC in its programs of
non-formal and special education, school design, rehabilitation and
maintenance. UNICEF will provide a grant equivalent to about US$10.8 million
for non-formal education, and to improve the quality of textbooks, curriculum
and teacher training. UNDP will provide a grant equivalent to about US$7.0
million to assist in institutional strengthening, teacher training, non-formal
education and literacy programs. JICA's grant financing for the subsector has
not been determined but could be in an amount equivalent to about US$15.0
million to assist in the renovation of schools.

3.9       Civil works (US$11.9 million).  The elements of the construction
program under the IDA-financed portion of the project consist principally of:
(a)  the construction 500 two-roomed resource centers;
(b)  the construction of about 7,000 primary school classrooms and
limited support for repairs to 1,100 classrooms;
(c)  the construction of 20 District Education offices and DEO book
storage; and
(d)  minor construction and upgrading at MOEC and CTSDC.
Previous experience with primary school building in Nepal has shown that due
to the small scale and general difficulty of site access, regular contracting
procedures are costly and bids often not forthcoming. Therefore, a variety of
procurement methods for construction will be followed. Community based
building procedures developed over two ongoing education projects will be
adapted as appropriate for resource center and classroom construction and will
include cost sharing with the communities wherever possible (US$9.5 million).
Where community based construction is undertaken, communities will be
mobilized to carry out construction works on the basis of agreements with the
respective school management committees (SMC's). The agreements will specify:
the extent and type of construction works to be undertaken; cost estimates;
cost sharing where applicable; materials to be supplied; as well as the roles
and responsibilities of the SMC and the SRCU. Agreements for schools and
resource centers will be signed by Government and the recipient SMC. It was
agreed during negotiations that the Borrower shall by December 31, 1992
furnish to the Association for approval, a model contract for the construction
and renovation of classrooms by agreement with School Management Committees
(para. 7.1(g)), and by December 31, 1992 furnish to the Association for
approval, a model contract for the construction of resource centers by
agreement with School Management Committees (para. 7.1(h)). Where it is cost
effective to do so (for example in the case of roofing sheets and roof
trusses) building materials will be procured centrally by ICB and LCB (see
below). Local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to IDA will be
followed for other construction works (US$2.4 million).
3.10      Building materials (US$3.3 million), equipment and furniture
(US$2.3 million) and vehicles (US$1.1 million) will be grouped into packages
of US$100,000 or more and will be procured through International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA Guidelines. Local manufacturers will be
accorded a preference of 15Z or the applicable duties and taxes whichever is
lower. For contract packages of less than $100,000, locally advertised
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to IDA may be followed except as
follows: (a) contracts under $50,000 (up to an aggregate of $500,000) for
urgently needed items, may be procured under prudent international or local
shopping with price quotation from at least three suppliers; and (b) furniture
for resource centers and primary schools will be procured directlv by the
communities from manufacturers in their areas according to standard designs
and procedures to be agreed with the SRCU. These will be subject to IDA
review and approval. Notwithstanding the above, building materials will be
procured as follows: construction roofing sheets (US$1.5 million) will be
procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with



- 30 -
IDA guidelines. In addition, locally advertised competitive bidding may be
followed to procure items such as roof trusses and possibly other steel
building elements such as doors and window frames (US$1.8 million) as
procurement of these articles is not likely to exceed US$0.5 million in any
year. Local fabricators are competitive and it is unlikely that foreign
fabricators will be interested due to high transportation and distribution
costs, although any foreign firm interested in bidding will be allowed to
participate. Steel fabricators will be prequalified to ensure adequate
technical and fisnancial capacity. To the extent practicable, contracts shall
be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or
more. All draft bid documents and bid packaging for building materials will
be subject to prior review by IDA.
3.11      Technical assistance and consultants services as well as training
and fellowships (US$15.8 million) will be provided in accordance with the
guidelines of the various cofinancing agencies. Any IDA financed consultants
will be selected in accordance with IDA Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
Standardized documents will be developed for LCB for construction, equipment,
furniture, building materials to be procured under the project. Draft
standard bidding documents will be submitted by HMG for IDA review prior to
bidding for construction, goods or services. Civil works, furniture,
equipment, materials and supplies contracts over US$100,000, under IDA's
purview, will be reviewed by IDA prior to award. This will cover about 80X by
value of such contracts.
D. Disbursement
3.12      The proposed Credit will finance about 25Z of the total project
costs, net of customs duties and taxes, and will be disbursed at the following
percentages: (a) 702 of expenditures on civil works undertaken through
community self-help construction, and 902 of expenditures on civil works
undertaken through other regular and community based contracts; (b) 100Z of
professional fees; (c) 100Z of foreign and local ex-factory expenditures and
75Z for other purchases of building materials, equipment, furniture, vehicles,
books and journals; and (d) 95Z of local training costs. Incremental salaries
will be disbursed at the following rates: 1002 in FY93-95, 85Z in FY96-98 and
70Z thereafter. Disbursements will be made over a seven-year period. The
closing date of the project will be December 31, 1999.
3.13      Disbursements against contracts for goods, and civil works below
US$100,000 equivalent and all incremental salaries and operation and
maintenance costs will be made against itemized statements of expenditure.
Documentation supporting these statements of expenditure will be retained by
the implementing agency for review by IDA missions. All other expenditures
will be fully documented. A Special Account will be established at Nepal
Rastra Bank to facilitate payment of eligible small expenditures. This
Account will be maintained in US Dollars with an authorized allocation of
US$500,000. The Account will be used for both local and foreign expenditures
of less than US$50,000 equivalent, under all categories. All other
expenditures above US$50,000 equivalent could be submitted directly to IDA for
payment.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPERVISION
A. Project Organization and Management
4.1       The project represents MOEC's first effort at a national program in
basic and primary education that coordinates the financing of multiple donors.
One of the three components of the project will provide for the institutional
strengthening of the Ministry. MOEC will improve its planning and management
systems by creating a Division of Program Management to coordinate the
subs?2toral program and financing (para. 2.30), it will provide a primary
school design capacity in MOEC (para. 2.35), and the project will finance a
school facilities construction program management capacity in MHPP (para.
2.38). During negotiations MOEC indicated its interest in utilizing a greater
proportion of the remaining Japanese Grant financing for training in project
management.
4.2       Maintenance.  Currently MOEC does not have a formal schools
maintenance program or staffing capacity to oversee schools maintenance in
Nepal and this function is therefore technically the responsibility of the
communities through the respective school management committees. However, in
practice, little maintenance is carried out and severe deterioration of school
buildings often takes place before a community is obliged to rebuild. This
results in extensive and wasteful expenditure of scarce materials and
community resources. In conjunction with the development of a physical
facilities planning capacity in MOEC (paras. 2,36,2,38), DANIDA will finance
the costs of: local and external consultants services for MOEC to develop a
plan for community based maintenance. This will include: the training of key
local personnel; the preparation of training materials; the testing of survey
questionnaires; and a limited program of maintenance at selected schools.
HMG has sought DANIDA assistance for development of community-based schools
maintenance.
B. Monitoring and Supervision
4.3       Project Monitoring and Mid-Term Review.  Because of the complex
nature of the proposed project, and because of the large number of donors,
improved project monitoring will be developed in a strengthened Planning
Division of MOEC. The Division of Program Management will establish a
monitoring plan with the Planning Division which will provide the regular
reviews needed by MOEC as well as by donors. During negotiations it was
agreed that the Borrower shall by December 31, 1994 conduct a comprehensive
mid-term review with the AssociatioD. with regard to actions taken pursuant to
the carrying out of the project (para. 7.1(i)).
4.4       Supervision.  Supervision of the IDA-finahced sub-components of the
project will require additional staff weeks beyond the normal coefficients for
project supervision. This is due to: (a) the complex interdependencies of
textbooks, curriculum and teacher training which will require regular
supervision by an experienced primary education specialist; (b) the national
scope of the project, which requires extensive internal travel over difficult



- 32 -
terrain; and (c) the complexity of the financing plan which involves five
cofinanciers operating in parallel. The time required for IDA supervision may
be somewhat reduced if the proposed management plan for MOEC is implemented
effectively. However, at a minimum, the project will require biannual visits
of a primary educator, and an architect to review technical progress in
addition to a generalist experienced in supervision of multi-donor subsectoral
programs (Annex 8).
C. Accounts and Auditing
4.5       MOEC has in place an accounting system to monitor its capital
development and recurrent expenditures. This and the project accounting
systems already in place have been reviewed by IDA and found satisfactory.
HMG will maintain the project accounts in accordance with sound accounting
practices. Accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year will be
prepared and audited by the Office of the Auditor General, or by independent
auditors a,ceptable to IDA.  Certified copies of the audited accounts  and
financial statements, together with the auditor's report and auditor's
opinions on the operations of the Special Account and on Statements of
Expenditure, will be furnished to the Association as soon as possible, but not
later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year.
V. PROGRAMS OF SPECIAL EMPHASIS
A. Environmental Protection
5.1       The construction of schools and resource centers will have little
adverse effect upon the environment. The construction and repair of latrines
in the schools, the greatly decreased use of scarce forest products in
construction, and the increased emphasis given to health and environmental
issues in the curriculum and textbooks should have a positive effect.
B. Women in Development
5.2       A range of interventions designed to improve the social and
economic condition of women has been planned with MOEC for inclusion in the
project (para. 2.20). The project will focus on two areas of special concernt
women's increased employment in the sector and the identification and
elimination of various forms of discrimination in the education system bys
(a) giving priority to recruiting female primary school teachers;
(b) supporting programs which educate girls to the SLC level;
(c) restructuring data collection methods to assure that essential
gender related statistics are collected and analyzed;
(d) revising curricula and textbooks to eliminate gender bias and to
affirm positive roles for girls and women;



_ 33 -
(e) establishing a Women in Development unit;
(f) greatly expanding non-formal primary school and literacy training
for girls and women;
(g)  providing preschool programs to free girls from their care of their
younger siblings to allow them greater opportunities to attend
primary school; and
(h)  con6tructing proper toilet and other facilities for students and
teachers in the schools and institutions assisted by the project.
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
6.1       The major benefit of the project will be the creation of a more
efficient delivery system to provide higher quality instruction in basic
education at the primary level. However, because of the time it takes to
institution&lize significant change in the education sector, most of the
direct and visible benefits will occur after completion of the project. The
cost of educating a primary school graduate will begin to be reduced because
of lower dropout and higher retention rates. The curriculum will be
simplified, and textbooks revised. Teaching skills and teacher morale will be
improved. Girls, the very poor and those in remote areas will have increased
opportunity to receive a basic education. The proportion of female primary
school teachers will rise from 12.52 of the work force to approximately 19Z by
the year 2000. A second, and more immediate, benefit of the project will be
increased effectiveness in the utilization of domestic and foreign resources.
The process of planning the project for the subsector has already resulted in
the integration of inputs financed by six foreign donors. The project will
integrate the grade-by-grade improvements in curriculum and textbooks with the
teacher training program.
B. Risks
6.2       The major risks to the project would be inadequate management and
delays in counterpart funding. HOEC is mitigating the first risk by
strengthening its management (the Division of Program Management) and
administrative (the National Center for Educational Development) units. Whlle
the delays in the release of funds are, for the most part, the result of HMG
financial control mechanisms outside MOEC's management, the risk will be
somewhat mitigated by the strengthened program management enabling MOEC to
anticipate funding delays and pnssibly head them off.



- 34 _
C. Project Sustainability
6.3       The emphasis of this project will be upon building the foundation
of an efficient delivery system for higher quality primary education. This
project will finance the foundation of a nationwide quality enhancement
program. The completion of such a program is likely to take some 15 years of
consistent investment in improved curricula and teaching materials, and in
greatly strengthened training and supervision of teachers. Therefore the
potential gains will not be fully realized without a series of follow-on
projects. However, both HMG and the donors have expressed their commitment to
a series of projects in the subsector. The costs will be substantial and they
will require an increase in the allocation of resources to the primary
subsector coupled with cost-saving measures. Beyond the life of the project,
when project inputs are institutionalized throughout the Kingdom, efficiency
gains would be considerable. Reduction in drop-out and repeater rates and
more efficient teacher deployment could reduce the cost of producing a
literate completer of the primary schools by 30%. Cost savings in textbooks
could be as much as 40Z through wastage reduction and reuse of books.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION

the Project (para. 2.39); and
(c) The Association will receive assurances from the Borrower that
adequate funds are available to carry out the Project in fiscal
year 1993 (para. 3.6).
7.3       Subject to the above conditions, the project will be suitable for
an IDA credit of SDR 21.8 million (US$30.6 million equivalent) to the Kingdom
of Nepal on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity.

NEPAL
BASIC AND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
The Education Sector
1.    The Formal Education System.  Nepal's formal primary and secondary
education system provides for five years of primary education (Grades I-V for
pupils 6 to 10 years old), two years of lower secondary education (Grades VI
and VII for pupils 11 and 12 years old), and three years of upper secondary
education (Grades VIII to X for pupils 13 to 15 years old). Students who pass
the School Leaving Certificate (SLC) examination after Grade X are eligible to
enter the higher education system, which up until now has provided Grades XI
and XII. A reform of the system is under consideration and these upper grades
may be separated from the higher education system.
2.    The higher education system is unusual in several ways.  Virtually all
higher education is provided by one university, Tribhuvan University. The
only other public university is Mahendra Sanskrit University, and it offers
only the study of Sanskrit to a very restricted student group. There are no
private universities. Tertiary education includes Grades XI and XII, which
constitute secondary education in almost all other countries. As a result,
until the planned shift of the Grades XI and XII to the secondary sub-sector
is made, significant university resources will continue to be expended on the
upper secondary grades at tertiary level urnit costs. Approximately 60Z of TU
students are not studying at what would be considered university level.
Additionally, the university is physically dispersed with 148 campuses
throughout the country. Finally, the enrollment is very high, approaching
100,000 and increasingly rapidly.l/
3.    The Non-Formal Education System.  Increased literacy has long been
regarded as a critical need in Nepal. There is a small but successful non-
formal education system which includes several initiatives to reach adults and
out-of-school children to provide functional literacy skills. The non-formal
sector has been successful in developing new approaches, curricula and
innovative teaching materials. In 1987 the Ministry of Education and Culture
(MOEC), with assistance from the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), began to develop a systematic approach to adult
education. The resulting package of materials is being used by 41 Government
and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). More targeted approaches to the
needs of women and for out-of-school children were later developed with UNICEF
1/ See Basic Data, p. iii, for enrollment data in the formal education
system.

and UNDP assistance.  Despite the clear need for increased investment in
literacy programs, the non-formal program is small. As the present capacity
does not exceed 75,000 adults and 5,000 children per year, a major issue to be
addressed is the expansion of the delivery system to meet the backlog of
illiterate youth and adults.

NEPAL
BASIC AND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
Financing the Basic and Primary Education Subsector
Expenditures in Primary and Basic Education
1.        Since the early 1950's Nepal has achieved a remarkable expansion of
its primary education system. During 1977-1989 (the 12-year period for which
dependable statistics are available), primary school enrollments increased at
an average of 9.0Z per year, from 900,000 to 2.5 million. Over the same
period, the number of primary teachers increased at an average annual rate of
8.9Z and the number of schools grew from 9,067 to 15,834 at an average annual
growth of 4.8Z. As a proportion of total Government expenditures, primary
subsector spending increased from 2.7Z in 1977/78 to 5.7Z in 1990/91.
Expenditures in primary education expanded at an average annual rate in
constant prices of about 152 from 1984/85 to 1990/91, three times the average
growth experienced by the overall education sector.  As a result, the share of
primary education in the education budget grew from about 23Z in 1974/75 to
35Z in 1984/85 and to about 502 in 1990/91.
2.        Increased resources for primary and basic education have largely
come from the Government. External assistance to the subsector has been low.
From 1985/86 to 1990/91 external donors financed only 8.5Z of the primary
education expenditures. In the FY91/92 education budget, primary education
obtained 18Z (equivalent to 7.5Z of the primary expenditures) and higher
education captured 69? of the total donors' assistance to the education
sector. Though primary education is notionally free in Nepal, private
contributions through the payment of various fees and materials, e.g.,
exercise books, pencils, etc., range from NRs 2-10 per month in the rural
areas up to NRs 30 per month in urban areas. In addition, communities have
traditionally funded all the cost's of building primary schools by providing
voluntary labor, land and donations. Since the 1980s, some donors have
assisted a limited number of communities by meeting about 40-70Z of these
costs.
3.        Despite the strong growth and public support to the subsector,
government expenditure in basic and primary education remains at only 1% of
GDP, which is not sufficient to continue progress in increasing enrollments
and improving quality. Enrollment rates show that a large proportion of the
6-10 year old children are still outside the school system. Figures from the
1986/87 Demographic Sample Survey 1/ indicate that only 51Z of the 6-10 year
old boys and 29Z of the 6-10 year old girls are enrolled in primary school.
1/   HMG National Planning Secretariat, Central Bureau of Statistics,
Demographic Sample Survey 1986/87, First Report, Kathmandu, 1987.



- 39 -
Annex 2
Page 2 of 6
There is also evidence that the rate of increase in enrollments has been
falling in recent years. Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) figures
indicate that the annual growth in total primary enrollments (male and female)
declined from approximately 10.1% during the period 1978-83 to 7.8% during
1984-89.
4.        In terms of quality improvements, investment of additional resources
in the subsector require a more efficient utilization. As much as 86% of the
total amount currently allocated to primary education in the FY91/92 budget
consists of teachers salaries. Investment in teachers' training, curriculum
reform and training materials is minimal and has been practically confined to
the IDA-financed Primary Education Project (PEP) and the UNICEF/UNDP-financed
SETI project. High dropout and repetition rates illustrate the wastage of
resources, as it takes an average of 9-12 school years to produce one primary
school graduate. It is clear that current resource utilization only permits
to enroll less than half of the school-age population and to produce a small
minority of graduates.
5.        The newly elected Government has allocated a total of NRs 3.2
billion to the education sector in the FY1991/92 budget or 12% of the
Government expenditures. Fifty percent will go to primary education, 14Z to
the secondary subRector and 282 will go to the university. However, the new
Government has promised to expand programs in various education subsectors
(including a new policy of free secondary education) and it remains to be seen
whether, at present allocation levels, all this could be accomplished.
Basically, all the subsectors are suffering and neither subsectoral
reallocations nor termination of projects would be sufficient to generate the
needed amount of funds to increase quality and opportunities for enrollment.
Level of Resources Needed for Improvements in Quality and A.ccess
6.        MOEC's "Plans and Programs Pertaining to the Fulfillment of the
Basic Needs in the Education Sector" (1988) identified primary education as
one of the basic needs of the people to be fulfilled by the Year 2000. The
proposed plans were an attempt to expand enrollments and less attention was
paid to increases in efficiency. The more recent "Basic and Primary Education
Master Plan 1991-2000" focuses on improving the quality of primary education
and assesses carefully the costs to HMG of: (a) achieving Universal Primary
Education (UPE) by the year 2000; (b) increasing the quality and relevance of
primary education; and (c) reducing the cost of producing a literate Nepali.
Gains in efficiency would be achieved through selected investments in teacher
training, curriculum and primary textbooks reform, promotion of girls
enrollment and non-formal education activities.
7.        The Master Plan document shows that a very high level of resources
would be required to achieve the above goals fully. The allocations to the
education sector would need to increase to 16% of the total Government
expenditures over the next two consecutive five-year plans from about 10.5?
during the Seventh Plan. In addition, the basic and primary subsector would
need to obtain 572 of the total education budget. In a similar exercise, the



- 40 -
Annex 2
Page 3 of 6
IDA preappraisal mission calculated the costs of a national basic and primary
education program which would be cost-effective, achieve UPE by the Year 2000
and increase equity. The results concurred in terms of objectives and
activities as well as in the need for similar substantial increases in the
budgetary allocation for the basic and primary subsector.
Affordability of Investments in Primary Education: Impact of the Project in
Nepal's Education Expenditures
8.        The Basic and Primary Education (BPEP) Project was conceived as the
first tranche of a national, long term primary education program designed to
achieve increased quality and efficiency in the primary subsector and
continued progress toward universal primary education. The BPEP Project is
aimed at ensuring that the objectives of the Master Plan and the MOEC
proposals for the national primary education program are accomplished to the
maximum level possible. In this regard, the project would finance a slower,
albeit more realistic, enrollment growth rather than attempt to reach UPE by
the Year 2000. Although the primary age population is expected to increase at
over 2.5Z per annum, the average annual enrollment growth rate is projected at
less than 2.0% and the average annual increase in the number of teachers would
not exceed 1.6Z. The formulation of the proposed project has taken into
account the difficult fiscal situation faced by the Government, the
constraints in the absorptive capacity manifested in previous projects and the
need to ensure that Nepal is able to sustain the additional costs generated by
the project. Therefore, jointly with HMG and other donors, IDA will support a
project that would be affordable and implementable in a 5-7 year time frame.
However, the proposed sector spending levels would, as shown below, still have
to increase significantly during the present decade.
9.        Table 1 provides projections in 1992 prices of the Government's
expenditures on education over BPEP Project life. Column (2) represents the
cost of the existing basic and primary education program calculated on the
basis of the current stock of primary teachers which is assumed will undergo
an attrition of about 2.12 per annum over the period. Beginning in 1992/93,
all additional primary teachers (male and female) are counted as part of the
Basic and Primary Education Project (BPEP) expenditure estimates which are
displayed in column (3). BPEP figures were projected taking into account the
disbursement schedule quoted in footnote 2 in Table 1. As shown in column
(4), during the next five years (1993-1997), HMG total expenditures in primary
education (with the project) would need to grow at an average of 12.52. This
is below the 15Z average annual growth rate experienced by the primary sector
from 1984/85 to 1990/91, which led to a rise in the share of primary education
in the overall education budget from 352 in 1984/85 to about 50Z in 1990/91.
Assuming that the expenditures on non-primary education grow at 4.9Z, total
HMG expenditures in the education sector will need to grow by about 8.9Z per
annum during the next five years.  The result is that the Government will need
an average level of resources of about 132 of its total spending for the

foreign financing for primary and basic education would rise from the 1991/92
level of 7.5? to an average of about 30? of the subsector expenditures during

Savings and Economic Benefits Resulting from the Basic and Primary Education
ProJect
10.       Cost Savings.  In the medium to long term, the investment in
quality, greater access and improved delivery of education would lead to
substantial savings in unit costs of education. Some examples are:
(a) Cycle costs savings: Students would not repeat grades or drop out of
school as often as they do now and therefore there will be a reduction
in the average number of school years that it takes to produce a
primary school graduate. Recent studies in Nepal evaluating the
internal efficiency in the primary system indicate that, instead of 5
years, it takes approximately 12 years to produce one graduate. Data
from several impact studies carried out on the pilot IDA-financed
Primary Education Project (PEP) indicate that similar project inputs
to those proposed under the new project have contributed significantly
to students academic quality, achievement and attendance. 4/ In
particular, the studies show that the students repeater rates in
grades 1-5 are 24.6Z in project schools and 32.6? in non-project
schools in adjacent districts. In addition, drop-out rates are higher
in the non-project schools (the drop-out rate within an academic year
is higher by 6.7 percentage points and the drop-out rate between
academic years is higher by 8.4 percentage points in the non-project
schools). Finally, promotion rates (students passing the final
examination) of all classes in the project schools are greater by 12.9
percentage points than those observed at the non-project schools. In
future, the deployment of female teachers is also expected to
contribute to a reduction in the drop-out and repetition rates,
particularly among girls. Long term gains in efficiency of the
project could save as much as 30% in cycle costs.
(b) Teacher savings: Savings in teacher costs would occur as a result of
the introduction of several policies, such as multigrade teaching in
the lower grades and the introduction of classroom teaching versus the
current system of subject teaching (fewer teachers would be needed). A
reform of the grants-in-aid system, which is currently based on
primary school enrollments regardless of attendance, would also

Drop-out Rates; Impact of the Teachers Training on Teachers' Professional
Knowledge in Basic Teaching Skills; Impact of the Teachers Training on
Teachers' Behaviour in the Classroom and An Impact Study of PEP inputs on

Education Project (PEP), Kathmandu, 1991.

contribute to a better utilization and accountability for the scarce
resources.
(c) Textbooks savings: HMG will assess the costs and benefits of a
textbook reuse scheme which could replace the current system of annual
provision of free books. Depending on the policy adopted, this
approach will make possible a reduction of the average annual costs to
the Government of between 27Z and 45Z based on existing textbooks
costs and provision.
11.     Economic Benefits.  Evidence of the contribution of education to
economic growth and agricultural output has been documented in Nepal during
the past two decades and it is consistent with findings from other
countries.5/ During the 1970s, several studies dealing with the effects of
education on productivity in agriculture showed that education made a
positive contribution to agricultural output with higher returns in
modernizing farms than in traditional farms. During the early 1980s,
Pudasaini studied the relationship between education and farm revenue. modern
input use and child mortality.6t His estimates showed that an increase in
the average education of a farmer by one year expanded output by 10.7Z in the
terai and 10.5Z in the hill region. The study also concluded that in a
traditional environment, education enhanced the farmers' capacity to allocate
available limited resources more productively. The latest estimates on the
contribution of education to economic growth are found in the Education and
Human Resources Sector Assessment, in which the social rate of return to
primary education in Nepal is calculated at above 10OZ.7/
12.     Enhanced primary education, and especially girls education, also
contributes to the improvement of health, fertility behavior and increased
life expectancy. Increased investments in the sector could contribute to the
provision of educational opportunities to a larger share of the population,
thus also improving equity. Poverty reduction would result as a consequence
of both increased agricultural output and greater equality.

NOTES:
1/ Populatlon projections are based on Medium Variant Scenario in World Bank's
SOCIAL SECTOR STRATEGY REVIEW (1989)
2/ Flow model enrolltment projections assuming: ti) higher repetition and dropout
rates for females and (fi) qualitative improvenents in the system parameters
(dropout, repetition and promotion rates) starting by 1997.
3/ over-age and under-age new entrants are assumed to decline and therefore the
Gross Enrollment Ratio and the Net Enrollment Ratio will tend to converge by
the year 2001.
