The project consists of\n            three components.  The first component, designed to increase\n            the quality of primary education, will:  (a) simplify the\n            primary school curriculum and make it more relevant; (b)\n            provide improved teacher instructional materials, textbooks\n            and supplementary materials; and (c) institutionalize a\n            teacher supervision, support and training system.  The\n            second component, designed to improve access to educational\n            resources, will: (a) strengthen the non-formal primary\n            education and literacy programs; (b) offer an increased\n            opportunity to receive a basic education to girls, the very\n            poor, and those in remote areas; and (c) construct and/or\n            renovate primary school classrooms to accommodate the\n            increase in enrollment.  The third component, designed to\n            improve the institutional development of the subsector,\n            will:  (a) strengthen the Ministry of Education's\n            capacity to plan, manage and monitor its formal and\n            non-formal primary education program; (b) assist in the\n            development of its capacity to coordinate and manage\n            donor-aided projects; and (c) improve the design of\n            efficient classroom facilities."}, "docdt": "1992-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
