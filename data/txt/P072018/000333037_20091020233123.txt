F. Results Framework Analysis


Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

Support the Federal Government of Nigeria's (FGN) overall program of power sector reform and
privatization by addressing the requirements of the transmission and dispatch sub-sectors,
specifically through:


   (i)     facilitating National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) unbundling;
                                                v
   (ii)    establishing a transparently-regulated, financially-viable, commercially-operated
           Transmission and System Operation Company (TransysCo) with private
           participation;
   (iii)   removing transmission network and system operation constraints on provision of
           reliable power supply;
   (iv)    facilitating development of an efficient wholesale power market to improve the long-
           term performance of the power sector; and
   (v)     support FGN's overall program of power sector reform (inferred).

H. Restructuring (if any)

The Project was restructured in 2005 to include a pilot implementation of "Commercial
Reorientation of the Electricity Sector Toolkit (CREST)" in selected cluster(s) to establish its
effectiveness in improving distribution efficiency. No change in PDOs was involved as the
original PDOs included removal of system operation constraints. This change was approved by
the Vice President for the Africa Region.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1         Context at Appraisal

1.     The Transmission Development Project (TDP) was the first engagement by the Bank in
Nigeria's power sector after almost a decade. Improvement in power supply was perceived by
the Nigerian public as a major part of the "democracy dividend" when the new democratic
leadership took over in 1999. The Project was developed in response to an urgent request from
the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) for Bank assistance to the power sector.

2.      At the time the TDP was prepared, the power sector in Nigeria suffered from problems in
all areas, viz., generation, transmission, and distribution. Insufficient generation of power, low
technical efficiency of transmission and distribution system, and high energy losses (30-35%
from generation to billing) restricted electricity access to only about 36% of the total population.
Frequent outages and voltage fluctuations were common. The system was characterized by poor
collection rates (75-80%) and together with inadequate tariffs, resulted in a poor financial
condition of the power sector.

3.     These characteristics of the sector forced the power utility, National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA)1, to be heavily dependent on subsidies from FGN for operational and capital
expenditure As shown in Table 1 below, FGN budget support for NEPA and later the Power
Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) from 2000-2008 varied between 0.20% and 1.36%
(average of about 0.52%) of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Even this level of support was
grossly inadequate to ensure orderly operations and maintenance.

4.      Although all areas of the sector faced serious problems, the rehabilitation of the
transmission system was agreed in discussions with the Government as the most appropriate
starting point for Bank's sector support. The proposed support would have addressed the most

                                                                   1
critical constraints in delivery of available power to consumers as well as helped policy and
institutional reform process in the power sector. The Bank's technical and investment support
was aimed at reducing transmission losses, improving system reliability, and removing critical
bottlenecks in transmission capacity for dispatch of available power. This was considered the
most optimal use of the limited International Development Association (IDA) resources, and a
"quick win" compared to investments in rehabilitating existing power generating plants or
establishing new capacity. Regarding rehabilitation of existing assets, the technical and
economic feasibility of rehabilitation had not been established and the process of rehabilitation,
even if considered feasible, would have been time-consuming and complex. Regarding
establishing new capacity, the available IDA funding was only a fraction of the funding required
for building a power generating plant of a reasonably efficient size.2 It was agreed that TDP
would allocate funds for developing an appropriate strategy for the rehabilitation of existing
plants and create an environment conducive to private participation in new power generation.

1.2         Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

5.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) as stated in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) was to support FGN's overall program of power sector reform and privatization by
addressing the requirements of the transmission and dispatch sub-sectors, specifically through:

      I. facilitating NEPA unbundling;
     II. establishing a transparently-regulated, financially-viable, commercially-operated
         Transmission and System Operation Company (TransysCo) with private participation;
    III. removing transmission network and system operation constraints on provision of reliable
         power supply; and
    IV. facilitating development of an efficient wholesale power market to improve the long-term
         performance of the power sector.

The PDO, though quite broad, reflected a vision shared with FGN which it could own and
execute.

6.       The PDOs as stated in the PAD (indicated above) were similar but not identical to those
stated in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). However, the statement in the DCA is
legally binding and was: "The objectives of the Project are to improve the long-term
performance of the power sector in the Borrower's territory through: (i) increasing transmission
capacity and the provision of reliable power supply; (ii) reducing transmission losses; and (iii)
facilitating competition through development of an efficient wholesale power market and
creation of TransysCo."

7.      But the DCA statement does not clearly express some of the goals stated in or reflected
by the PAD PDO or the Key Performance Indicators. Consequently, given the "changes and
benefits that the operation was expected to achieve," the ICRR inferred a fifth PDO along with

  Given the US$100 m available for this first power sector loan to Nigeria, barely 100 MW of new generation capacity could have been
supported against a shortfall of nearly 3000 MW at the time.



                                                                      2
the PDOs explicitly stated in the PAD: "Support FGN's overall program of power sector
reform":3 This fifth PDO is listed here because the overarching goal of this project, as
mentioned in the appraisal document, was to support the newly elected government in its efforts
to initiate broad based reform in a key sector that was both central to the economy's growth and
was badly in need of reforms. The Bank hoped that the approval and implementation of this
project would help both to establish a role for the Bank in its policy dialogue in the power sector
and enable progress in sector reforms. While no key indicators or specific outcomes were
specified in the appraisal document, a full assessment of this project nevertheless encompasses
the extent to which the Bank was able to establish a policy dialogue and achieve progress in
sector reforms.

8.        The Key Performance Indicators in the PAD were:

     a. TransysCo is established and is financially viable and able to attract commercial
        financing.
     b. Open access to, and use of transmission systems for generators, distributors and large
        industrial consumers.
     c. Electricity wholesale settlement system developed and operational.
     d. Increased transmission reliability (unplanned interruption hours per 100 km per year
        reduced from 80 to 42 at 330 kV, and from 210 to 120 at 132 kV).
     e. Reduced transmission losses (from 10.7% to 4.0% at 330 kV and from 12.0% to 8.0% at
        132 kV).
     f. The Environment Resettlement and Social Unit (ERSU) is established and fully
        operational within the TransysCo.

9.      The Project also had the following three intermediate outcomes: (a) development and
operationalization of Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition (SCADA) system; (b) preparation
of and implementation of TransysCo Business Plan; and (c) rehabilitation of parts of the
Transmission system.

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

10.     The Project was restructured in 2005 and a distribution component was added to enhance
the efficiency of the system, which would further support PDO (iii). As such, PDOs were not
revised. Two key indicators were, however, added to reflect the new component as well as to
strengthen the existing results framework. These were: (a) Distribution consumer-end voltage
improved in selected clusters; and (b) Increased transmission reliability as reflected in reduced
number of total system collapses, particularly due to transmission faults.

                                                                      3
1.4    Main Beneficiaries (original and revised)

11.     The main beneficiaries were all consumers of electricity in Nigeria, including
households, businesses/commercial enterprises, industry and the government. They were all
intended to benefit from fewer outages and better system stability, with households able to use
more electrical appliances, while fewer firms would need diesel generators, reducing their costs.

1.5    Original Components Supported by the Project

12.     The Project originally comprised the following three components: (a) Investment
Component for enhancing transmission and system capacity (about US$86 million, 86% of the
total Credit); (b) Technical Assistance (TA) Component for establishing and developing
TransysCo (about US$12 million, 12% of the total Credit); and (c) Social and Environmental
Component for developing environmental institutions (about US$2 million, 2% of the total
Credit). Details of sub-components, planned cost and the actual disbursement against each are
given in Annex 1.

1.6    Revised Components

13.     TDP was restructured in 2005 and a new Component D was added. This component
aimed to introduce distribution efficiency improvement practices in the sector given that
distribution improvement is at the heart of the sector's performance - both in terms of financial
and service delivery parameters. These efficiency improvements were sought to be introduced
through a comprehensive program called CREST - Commercial Reorientation of Electricity
Sector Toolkit. The allocation for this component at US$12.35 million was to finance
distribution efficiency improvement investments in selected clusters in one or more of the eight
Distribution Business Units (DBUs) where some earlier CREST pilot interventions produced
excellent results with regard to loss reduction, energy accounting, commercial improvements,
and customer service enhancements. The new component was aimed at a comprehensive use of
CREST in the selected cluster(s) to further demonstrate the benefits of CREST and facilitate its
wider replication by FGN. Annex 2 describes the key features of the CREST program and
summarizes results achieved in pilot areas.

1.7    Other significant changes

14.     The closing date of the Credit was extended from December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2008,
and a second time by six months to December 31, 2008 to allow additional time for the
completion of all components, especially the newly added distribution component, and for the
full achievement of the project development objectives.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

15.     Project preparation: The project implementation got off to a slow start. This was
mainly due to inadequate readiness for implementation. The Project was prepared in a relatively
short time with appraisal taking place six months after the Concept review, and Board approval
within four months of appraisal. Implementation remained slow until 2003, but once the PMU
was fully functional, implementation and disbursements accelerated from 2004 onwards.

16.     While the project was not fully ready for implementation (in terms of the PMU staffing;
procurement documents; government decisions; and sectoral organization), and quality at entry
thereby suffered from the relatively fast preparation, appraisal, and approval schedule, this was
offset by the mutual sense of urgency felt by both the FGN and the Bank to demonstrate the
commitment to power sector reforms and the need to build stakeholders' confidence in the
process. The relatively speedy Board approval of this first power sector project proved useful in
establishing a sector reform policy dialogue with government and stakeholders.

17.     Project design. The PDOs appear overly ambitious given the scope and size of the
Project and the fact that the Project addresses primarily the transmission sub-sector. The Project,
together with the Bank engagement and dialogue, however, was a useful signaling mechanism
for the Government to emphasize its commitment to sector reform and stimulating changes
towards a more commercial and private sector orientation. There was thus a mutually
reinforcing framework. The Bank's investment support and global knowledge could contribute
to the realization of the newly elected democratic leadership's bold push for reforms.

2.2    Implementation

18.     The Project was implemented fully and closed on the extended closing date, i.e.,
December 31, 2008, with almost full disbursement of the Credit amount. The Project financed
all components and sub-components, except two studies. One of these studies - on transmission
pricing - was undertaken by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) from its
own funds, thus not requiring Project funds. The second study - TA for market development and
operation - was determined to be not needed given the adequate build-up of capacity in the unit.
(For details, see Project costs by component in Annex 1).

19.     Four factors adversely affected implementation: (a) Government's decision-making
process due to TDP being the first reform project in a key sector after a long hiatus; (b) time
taken to build implementation capacity within Project Management Unit (PMU); (c) initial
setbacks caused by delayed effectiveness and expiration of Project Preparation Facility (PPF);
and (d) continuing power demand-supply gap. These are discussed in detail below.

20.     Government decision-making. The power sector reforms, undertaken after a long period
of military rule and involving major institutional changes and privatization, were difficult.
Decisions by Government and parastatals were often delayed due to caution, uncertainty,
skepticism, and lack of experience. This contributed to initial delays in TDP implementation.


                                                 5
21.      PMU capacity. Implementation was also affected by poor capacity of the PMU at the
start of the Project and virtual absence of capacity within PHCN to deal with the Bank Projects.
The Project helped build capacity in PMU and that helped improve speed of implementation.
Owing to the circumstances at project approval, much of the work around the preparation of
procurement packages was undertaken in parallel with capacity building of the PMU.

22.     Initial setback. As a result of delayed effectiveness and expiration of the PPF, two major
consultancy contracts were halted slowing the preparation of bidding documents. Project
implementation remained slow until 2004, when the necessary implementation capacity had been
put in place and disbursements started to accelerate.

23.     Continuing power shortage. Continuing power shortages resulted in inadequate
revenues. This caused substantially reduced financing for even routine maintenance, resulting in
further deterioration of existing assets and ever-increasing public complaints on service quality.
This led to more attention being given to day-to-day problems rather than implementation of
investment and TA components for the stated gains.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

24.      Design: Targets pertaining to transmission reliability (transmission system collapse,
outage and interface voltage) and improvement in distribution system performance (reduction of
losses and restoration of proper end-user voltage levels in selected distribution clusters) were
quite realistic and appropriate in light of the planned investments. It was, however, obvious that
improvements could have taken place only in those parts of the transmission and distribution
system where investments were made and as such indicators for the transmission and distribution
system pertained only to selected clusters where investments were finally made, and not the
entire transmission and distribution system, whether explicitly stated or not. The PDOs
pertaining to the development of open access and wholesale market, and TransysCo becoming
financially viable during the project period itself were also relevant, although difficult to achieve
as discussed in section 2.1.

25.     Implementation and utilization: M & E data used by the Borrower was picked up from
the following sources: (i) PHCN data base for operations, revenue, failures, collapses of the
transmission system, losses, and overall system working; (ii) PMU data base maintained for
Project components and cluster-based performance; (iii) other government ministries and
agencies for specific data. In the judgment of the ICR Team, the quality and reliability of data
used was good and is stated to have been verified by the Bank Supervision Teams, including
through site visits. The same data has been used by the ICR team in assessing various outcomes
and the Project performance.

26.     While the indicators were defined, no clear system of responsibility for collecting or
reporting on them was defined at appraisal. As a result, use of the indicators was inadequate.
For some indicators, improvements were expected to be realized only at completion of the
proposed investments. Therefore, more attention was paid to intermediate outcome indicators to
develop mid-course corrections. Some of the data (more specifically at the cluster level) was not
collected and maintained by PHCN and later TransysCo as part of its regular operations. Hence,
TransysCo had to collect this data for the Project implementation purposes only. This also
                                                 6
contributed to reporting delays and information gaps. These issues notwithstanding, the
opportunity to utilize indicators to inform and improve project design and/or implementation was
not fully realized.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

27.     There are no issues on safeguards, as the project design involved minimum potential
social or environmental impacts. The ERSU, established as designed, oversaw preparation of
environmental assessments and audits for the Project-funded expansions and improvements at
five transmission substations to meet Bank OP 4.01 requirements. ERSU helped prepare some
Environment Management Plans (EMPs) as well as the corporate environmental policy. In
collaboration with National Action Committee on AIDS (NACA), the project succeeded in
establishing the PHCN Aids Control Team (PACT) under the ERSU to design, monitor, and
supervise program for HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness. The impact of setting up of ESRU
has been quite positive and has favorably affected the follow-on projects, NEDP and NEGIP.
The next stage of decentralizing ERSU and establishing units at the regional level has to be
accelerated now.

2.5    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

28.     Successor projects to the TDP are the National Energy Development Project (NEDP),
approved in July 2005, and the Nigeria Electricity and Gas Improvement Project (NEGIP),
approved in June 2009. Both these projects continue the reform dialogue and support covering
generation, gas sector policies, and regulation among others. They include investments in
transmission and distribution (in particular, the CREST initiative) that build upon the base
established under the TDP, in particular: (a) some materials purchased under TDP for the
CREST initiatives were installed and commissioned under NEDP; (b) SCADA, which has
become operational under TDP, is being refined and activities being undertaken under NEDP
will make it more effective ; (c) capacity building of key institutions established during TDP
period - NERC, Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and Market Operator - will be continued
under NEDP as well as NEGIP; and (d) both NEDP and NEGIP have provision for coordinating
efforts to improve the performance of the unbundled companies. While NEDP scales up support
for sector reform, transmission and distribution support, NEGIP aims to supplement both TDP
and NEDP by seeking to improve power generation by addressing fuel supply issues. NEGIP
also continues the Bank's support to transmission and distribution sectors as well as to
Government's sector reform efforts. The Bank has also facilitated a Public-Private Infrastructure
Advisory Facility (PPIAF) grant for the Ministry of Power for finalization of the performance
contracts between the unbundled companies and the Government.

29.     Apart from these interventions the Bank also engaged in two AAAs. The first activity
was conducted in parallel with implementation of the TDP in the form of a sector leaders'
workshop which helped mentor the reform process and build consensus among various
stakeholders on various reform actions. This was rated very high by the Bank's QAG and its
significant contribution to the reform processes - in particular the enactment of the Electric
Power Sector Reform Act, the establishment of the regulatory commission as well as the
unbundling of NEPA - is widely recognized by Nigerian counterparts.


                                                7
30.     The second AAA is comprehensive Economic and Sector Work (ESW) to inform the
government's sector review and further refine the power sector strategy. The ESW comprises
detailed papers on financial and economic analysis of the sector, corporate and sector governance,
political economy surrounding the power sector, and the role of reliable data bases in
formulating strategy for the sector. The Bank is in the process of completing this work.

31.    Apart from these activities, the Bank supported the sector reform work and preparatory
work for privatization of the unbundled companies through the Privatization Support Project
which was implemented in parallel with the TDP and is slated to close by December 2009. The
Bank is also supporting rehabilitation of hydro generation facilities in Nigeria through the Niger
River Basin Development Project. All these projects supplement the interventions made under
the TDP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

32.     Objectives. The five original (including one inferred) PDOs and the eight outcome and
three intermediate outcome indicators, were, and remain, substantially relevant since they
comprise the building blocks for the revitalization of the power sector. The PDOs were focused
on improvement of reliability and efficiency of the Transmission and Distribution systems as
well as facilitating significant policy and institutional reform. The PDOs are consistent with the
National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) program, the
Government's Seven Point Agenda (2007), and fully aligned with the previous Interim Strategy,
its successor, the 2005 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), and the current CPS for 2009-2013.

33.      Design and implementation. The Project focus on the transmission system was relevant
because improvement in reliability of the transmission system was the quickest and most cost-
effective way to ensure delivery of available power to users and also reflected the most optimal
utilization of limited resources (see paragraph 4). The restructuring of the Project and allocation
of funds for full-fledged CREST pilot(s) was and continues to remain relevant today, as the
future solution for majority of the problems of the power sector. The usefulness of CREST is
clear from the fact that successor projects to the TDP have included extensive support for the
program and FGN is considering making this a standard for all future investments in the
distribution sub-sector. Addition of the CREST program enhanced TDP's relevance as this
reflected a sound diagnosis of the sector and its current and potential needs. The TA component
was also carefully designed to facilitate capacity building of key institutions as a way to
progressively accelerate the pace and quality of reforms. The full implementation of the Project
has laid the foundation for improved implementation of successor projects through
demonstration of the effectiveness of the technological solutions and lessons learnt.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

34.    Achievement of each of the five PDOs is discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.

35.     NEPA Unbundling. The objective has been fully achieved and NEPA stands unbundled
into 18 incorporated companies ­ 6 generation, one transmission, and 11 distribution. The
                                                 8
companies are autonomous, have their own CEOs, and make their own decisions. Asset
allocation among the unbundled companies is almost complete. A Market Operator has been
established to allocate revenues to various entities on the basis of agreed rules. The holding
company, PHCN, exists to coordinate common matters and resolve pending issues. The
Government has established an interim Board of Directors at PHCN to coordinate efforts to
improve corporate governance of these companies. The unbundled distribution companies have
by and large doubled gross revenues despite no increases in power tariffs since 2002 and
crippling power supply shortages. Other constraints to their performance include imbalance of
skills in different categories, theft of power, deteriorating and obsolete infrastructure, insufficient
inventory of spare parts for carrying out even urgent repairs, and non-payment or delayed
payment of bills by users, most notably by government departments themselves.

36.      Actions are needed for improving long-term performance of these companies, including
the following: (a) eventual private sector involvement in the management of the companies; (b)
signing of performance contracts between the companies and the Government; (c) increase in
tariff as per the Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO); (d) implementation of measures for increasing
gas supply to power; (e) substantial investment in the sector to update technology and replace
assets that have outlived their useful life; and (f) implementation of detailed actions for
improving sector and corporate governance which will also be reflected partly in the
performance contracts.

37.     The Bank's contribution to this outcome has been through: (i) carrying out an intense
dialogue with the Government and the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), providing extensive
comments and suggestions on the EPSR Act, the framework of unbundling, need for
performance contracts, and other relevant documents; and (ii) US$4.0 million worth of TA and
training for capacity building of various institutions including specific TA for change
management. If the unbundling had been followed by a process of privatization or performance
contracts, the achievement of the PDO could have been rated highly satisfactory, but considering
the present status, it is rated as "satisfactory".

38.    Establishing a transparently-regulated, financially viable, and commercially operated
TransysCo with private participation. The Transmission Business Unit, or TransysCo, started
functioning on April 2, 2004. A business plan has also been implemented for TransysCo with
TDP support. TransysCo staff have received training in the management, technical, and financial
aspects of business planning. SCADA has been installed and is operational but some
refinements are required, financed through NEDP. The refinement of SCADA will transform
TransysCo's operations and allow the company to be more responsive to real-time information.

39.     TransysCo is independently regulated by NERC. The latter was created consequent to the
enactment of EPSR Act to regulate the entire power sector. NERC has established performance
norms for TransysCo to be used in the MYTO model, to determine the annual revenue
requirement and the subsidy requirement if cost reflective tariffs are not established, and is
monitoring the trend of these indicators. NERC has also held consultative meetings with users -
consumer associations, industry representatives, and all other stakeholders - in all the provinces
of Nigeria, to underscore the problems of transmission to be specifically monitored and to
identify aspects for regulation.

                                                  9
40.     However, TransysCo cannot be considered as financially viable or commercially
operated. TransysCo has had to function under policies that have adversely affected its financial
health. The Government has kept the price of electricity at nearly the same level,
US$0.032/kWh, for the entire period of the project4, though it is expected to increase under
MYTO issued in 2008. In the interim, the government is providing TransysCo with a subsidy.
The firm's 2008 profit and loss statement shows that the TransysCo subsidy is 87% of the
company's total 2008 revenue. TransysCo has no influence over its tariffs and consequently its
revenues, and also suffers financially from an absence of adequate power to transmit. The PDO
was initially introduced and maintained, even during the restructuring of the Project, because
increase in tariffs and power supply were expected, thereby improving TransysCo's financial
situation; these increases have not yet occurred. In retrospect, cost efficiency targets such as
working or operating ratios would have been more appropriate.

41.     Increased and stable power supply is necessary for the commercial operations of
TransysCo. Several power generation projects, including the public sector NIPP and private
sector IPPs are in the process of being commissioned. Once these plants come on-line, the
TransysCo would need to play its appropriate commercial and business role to efficiently
dispatch and deliver this power to bulk customers and distribution companies. The existing
regulatory framework for third party access, infrastructure and market mechanisms established
under the Project would enable TransysCo to discharge this role effectively.

42.    Attempts at private participation, which proceeded almost to the point of finalizing an
Operations and Management (O & M) contract with a competitively selected international firm,
were stalled due to transition of political leadership.

43.     In spite of the continuing problems of TransysCo, the fact that the Government did agree
to establish an autonomous company is an important first step forward. The company is able to
chart its own operational and financial strategy, develop its own organization and management
structure, and take speedier decisions. As more power plants, public or private, use the
transmission infrastructure, demands for improving its performance will grow. Signing of a
"performance contract" between TransysCo and the Government will also contribute to
enhanced performance. The emphasis on upgrading the capacity and modernization of the
network under TDP, including the SCADA, and the successor Projects should lead to reduced
losses, increased reliability, and better management, and thus yield increased revenues.
Measures on the cost side such as staff rationalization and staff training would further promote
improved financial viability. TDP has enabled this important journey to commence with the
autonomous operation of TransysCo and go some way towards realization of key reform
milestones in the sector.

44.    The Bank's contribution to this outcome has been through (a) TA for preparing the
Business Plan for TransysCo; (b) training of staff; and (c) US$40 million investment towards



4
 The weighted average tariff is around half the cost of supply and the long run marginal cost (about US$0.065/
kWh).

                                                        10
installation of a complex Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA), and
energy management and communications system.

45.     Overall, while TransysCo has been established and is transparently regulated, it is not
financially viable or commercially operated. There are also no early prospects of a management
contract or any other form of private participation in order to improve the management of
TransysCo. Achievement against this objective is, therefore, rated as `moderately
unsatisfactory'.

46.     Removing transmission network and system operation constraints to provision of
reliable power supply. This PDO has been monitored through four PDO indicators (4-7) as
follows:

     a. Transmission system reliability as measured by incidence of total system collapse due
        to transmission problems: Incidence of total system collapse of 330 kV grid due to
        transmission problems in year 2000 was 15. In 2008, this came down to 5 system
        collapses due to transmission problems. However, other total system collapses due to
        gas shortages and generation problem were 26 in all. While total system collapses due
        to transmission problems have declined, other system collapses mainly due to
        generation shortages continue. Due to the significant decline in total system collapses
        due to transmission problems, the indicator is rated as "satisfactory".

     b. Increased transmission reliability as measured by unplanned interruption hours per 100
        km per year at 330 kV and 132 kV levels: The TDP objective was to reduce unplanned
        interruption hours to less than 42 hours/100 km/year for the 330 kV system, and to less
        than 120 hours/100 km/year for the 132 kV system. The actuals for 2008 were: 11.62
        hours/100 km for the 330 kV system and 102 hours/100 km for the 132 kV system.
        The indicator is rated as "highly satisfactory".

     c. Transmission losses in terms of percentage of energy input: Transmission losses in the
        designated clusters showed a decline from 11% to 8% in 2007 but have again gone up
        to a little more than 9% in 2008, probably due to inadequate maintenance and increase
        in energy handled by the system. This indicator is rated as "moderately satisfactory".

     d. Increase in user voltage in supported clusters: The user voltage in Karu (a supported
        cluster) has increased to 220 volts. The losses in the designated clusters in the
        distribution system have declined from close to 40% to only 7%. The indicator
        achievement is rated as "highly satisfactory".

47.     On the basis of the ratings of the four indicators, the overall achievement of the PDO is
rated as "satisfactory".

48.     Facilitating development of an efficient wholesale power market. The essential
elements for establishing a wholesale market, such as the Market Operator (institutional
infrastructure) and SCADA (technical infrastructure), have been put in place. In terms of legal
and regulatory reform and preconditions for development of a wholesale power market, steady

                                                11
progress was made during the project period. Providing the legal framework, the EPSR Act was
approved by Parliament in 2005. The Act provided for a market-oriented industry structure and
commercial operation of the sector. NERC, an independent regulatory agency, was set up under
the EPSR Act and was officially inaugurated on October 31, 2005. The Commission is
mandated to carry out monitoring and regulation of the electricity industry, issue licenses to
market participants, and ensure compliance with market rules and operating guidelines5. The
Commission introduced financial performance targets for new business units in 2007.

49.     While the project was successful in developing the institutional and technical
infrastructure of a wholesale power market along with the necessary legal framework, the market
is not operational owing to power generation shortages. Development of a wholesale market will
have to await further improvements in the power generation. Achievement against this objective
is therefore rated `moderately unsatisfactory'.

50.     Support for FGN's overall program of power sector reform. Power sector reform got
off to an encouraging start with the enactment of EPSR Act and the quick subsequent unbundling
of NEPA, establishment of a regulatory body, and preparation for the privatization of the
unbundled companies. In this effort, the Bank Team played a key role in terms of consultations
with stakeholders, sharing international experience and developments, facilitating leaders'
workshops, commenting on various drafts of the Act, building consensus, and providing timely
TA either through TDP or PSP.

51.     During implementation and consolidation of the reform process, the Bank has maintained
a vigorous dialogue with all stakeholders and concerned parties ­ Ministers, directors, and other
key officials of the ministries of power and finance, NERC, top management of PHCN and the
unbundled companies, potential gas suppliers and power producers, main user groups, advisor to
the President, and the representatives of civil society. More specific involvement of and support
by the Bank included: (a) along with DfID, prepared papers on sector and corporate governance
identifying key actions to be taken both by Government and the companies; (b) facilitated a
PPIAF grant to be used for engaging consultants to help develop "performance contracts"
between the Government and the unbundled companies; and (c) arranged and financed an
intensive training of top management staff of the companies and other institutions at the Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University, in the United States.

52.     The Government has made tremendous efforts in taking the reform agenda forward and
these efforts combined with the initiatives outlined above have led to significant results,
particularly the following:

a) actions are being taken to prepare the companies for privatization through a transparent
   competitive process (although the process of privatization has been postponed);

                                                         12
b) a renewed focus on improving the performance of unbundled companies on key parameters of
   efficiency, quantity and quality of power; as these parameters are a part of the MYTO model
   and are factors in the computation of subsidy;
c) power purchase agreements have been designed to be based on robust principles of equitable
   risk allocation and positive incentives and should lead to operationalization of licenses issued
   to independent power producers;
d) a model-based method of computing tariffs has replaced ad hoc changes and the model has
   been designed by taking macro, corporate and sectoral factors into account; although the
   model needs further refinement, this marks a big step forward; and
e) a comprehensive set of measures for substantially increasing supply of gas to power and other
   domestic uses as well as reducing the amount of gas flaring. Gas policy also aims at
   progressively opening the gas sector to market-based transactions. Implementation will be
   supported by Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG)6 to be offered by the Bank under NEGIP.

53.     The broad and deep reforms that have been initiated and pursued in Nigeria's power
sector are testimony to the continuous efforts by the Bank at supporting these reforms, under the
umbrella initially of TDP. These achievements, accompanied by an on-going dialogue that
revolves around entirely new market-based concepts and terminology for Nigeria (access
expansion and intensification, modernization, SCADA, CREST, pre-paid metering, pole
mounted metering, open access, and wholesale market) can be attributed in large part to the
TDP's setting the stage for the policy dialogue and ensuing reforms that the government has
undertaken.

54.       Achievement against this PDO is rated `highly satisfactory'.

55.    Taking a comprehensive view of the different PDOs and their ratings, the overall
outcome of TDP is rated `satisfactory'. The justification for this rating is discussed further
below in section 3.4.

3.3       Efficiency

56.      Improving the efficiency of power supply and customer services. Achievement under
this is rated as "satisfactory". By the end of 2004, the DBUs had commenced operations as
profit centers with substantial devolution of authority and accountability. This was associated
with commercial and customer service improvements. The Team's engagement with NEPA on
knowledge activities led to the development and piloting of CREST program in 8 DBUs (specific
elements but not the whole program) with NEPA's own funds. Partly because of this, the share
of metered customers increased from 40 percent in 2002 to 67 percent of total customers in 2006
for the country as a whole. As a result there was a substantial increase in revenues. Collections
rose from 4.8 billion Naira per month in 2003 to 7.0 billion Naira per month in 2007. The
success of these pilots led to the proposal for a scale up of all elements of CREST in these DBUs
and TDP was accordingly revised/amended. CREST has been fully implemented in Karu in


6
 PRG are offered by the Bank to back-stop the payment obligations of the public power utility, PHCN under its proposed Gas Supply and
Aggregation Agreements (GSAAs) with the gas suppliers.



                                                                    13
Abuja Distribution Company, and for other DBUs, materials for some of the CREST application
have been procured under TDP and installation is in progress under the successor NEDP. In
addition, components not requiring investment are being put to use.

57.     Efficiency of Investments. Investment in transmission and distribution components of
TDP is computed to be financially viable, achieving a Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR)
of 16.8% and Financial Net Present Value (FNPV) of US$22.2 million over an 18-year period.
Major investment in the system comprised replacement of age-expired transformers at five
substations resulting in substantial reduction in breakdowns and, consequently, increased
capacity to transmit the available power, estimated conservatively at 15% of the overall
transformer capacity or 442 GWh per annum. While the net power supply and consequent
revenue will increase, incremental operating cost will be restricted to operation and maintenance
of the new investment (assumed as 5% of cumulative investment) as the infrastructure and staff
for transmission and distribution of this power already exists. In computing the IRR, the impact
of CREST has been ignored, being limited to one area with limited number of customers.

58.     Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Economic Net Present Value (ENPV) are
respectively estimated at 29.2% and US$79.6 million for the same 18-year period. EIRR has
been computed on the assumption that in a "without Project" situation, the private individuals
and firms will be forced to use their private generators more to the extent of the additional power
available as a result of the investments under TDP. With the Project, these costs, roughly
US$.14/kWh will be avoided (however, a conservative figure of US$0.10/kWh has been used in
the computations). The incremental cost of the additional power as indicated above is very small.
In determining the EIRR, the impact of shadow price of diesel oil used by private producers has
not been considered as the EIRR is already much above the hurdle rate. This is a "slightly better
outcome" in economic terms compared to the original projections in PAD (EIRR of 26.6% and
ENPV of US$60.7 million at the same 12% discount rate) due to adjustment in the disbursement
profile. (see Annex 4 for detailed computations).

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

59.    As per the detailed assessment in section 3.2, the ratings of the five PDOs are
summarized in the table below. Based on these ratings, the overall outcome rating for the
Project is "satisfactory".

5        Support for FGN's overall program of power sector reform.            Highly satisfactory


3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.    While improvements resulting from TDP should have a positive impact on poverty
reduction, there was no direct action aimed at poverty reduction and impact on gender aspects.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

61.     Intensive dialogue and consultations with the stakeholders and support for policy reforms
contributed significantly to institutional change and strengthening in the power sector. The
power sector in 2009 presents a completely different picture when compared to 2000, i.e., before
the Project (more details under the assessment of inferred PDO (v) above).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

62.    There were no unintended positive or negative impacts under this project.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

63.     While no formal beneficiary survey was done, several beneficiary interactions were held
to assess the results and outcomes of interventions under TDP. These interactions yielded highly
positive responses from beneficiaries on the results achieved by the Project, especially with
regard to customer satisfaction and system loss reduction (details are in Annex 5). In addition, a
series of Power Sector Leaders' workshops was held during implementation of this Project. This
series of workshops was very successful in charting the course of reform in the power sector, in
defining the role and accountability of various stakeholders with regard to various activities in
the sector that included implementation of the TDP and the PSP. Thus this series substituted the
Stakeholder Workshop. The series of Power Sector Leaders' workshops were rated highly
satisfactory by QAG in an assessment of the related ESW that supported funding and execution
of the workshops (Annex 6).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

64.      The rating of risk to development outcome is assessed as "Moderate". The ICR is of the
view that the Borrower is making progress. Subsequent to the passage of the EPSR Act (2005)
and the unbundling of NEPA, and creation of the regulatory institution NERC, the Government
has approved NERC-developed MYTO and agreed to pay subsidies in the interim (i.e. as the
tariff is gradually increased to full cost-reflective level) as computed and verified by NERC. The
Government has also announced measures for increasing supply of gas to power and other
domestic uses, and instituted a Board of Directors to coordinate efforts to improve performance
of the unbundled companies. The investments on completion have been handed over to
TransysCo and the respective distribution companies who have the responsibility, capacity, and
expertise to operate these investments efficiently and effectively. Provided that adequate
revenues are generated and sufficient funds allocated for maintenance, the investments should
continue to be optimally used.

65.     However, the pace of progress is slower than originally envisaged, and there are some
risks in terms of sustaining the outcomes as indicated below. The QAG Panel also took a
cautiously optimistic view of the continuation of the reform process.

   a. Uncertainty with regard to power generation and the risk that rehabilitation of existing
      power plants and commissioning of new power plants will be delayed. To partly mitigate
      the risk, a covenant in the recently-approved NEGIP, received from FGN prior to Board
      approval, requires the Government to implement the proposed plan for the rehabilitation
      of power plants.
   b. Power and gas prices may not be increased as per plans. In the case that anticipated tariff
      adjustments do not occur, the Government will have to increase the level of its subsidy
      support. This fiscal pressure will influence government policy to achieve cost-reflective
      pricing. Furthermore, the formation of the Stakeholders' Forum (the establishment of
      which is a condition of effectiveness under NEGIP) and its frequent meetings will also
      influence responsible policy-making.
   c. PHCN may not respond effectively to customer complaints. Regular meetings of the
      Stakeholders' Forum discussed above should maintain the pressure. In addition, the risk
      will be mitigated to some extent, if FGN does accept the suggestion of entering into
      performance contracts with entities and highlights this aspect.
   d. Sufficient steps may not be taken to improve the performance of the unbundled
      companies. To partly mitigate the risk, the Bank has facilitated a PPIAF grant to provide
      TA for developing performance contracts between the companies and the Government to
      bind the parties to specific actions.
   e. The Government may not take any action towards rightsizing staff and streamlining
      pension arrangements and that could delay privatization. The opening of the sector to
      commercial contracts for supply of gas and power are likely to bring urgency to the issue.
      The Bank will also maintain a dialogue with the Government to expedite action in this
      regard.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

66.     The Bank's performance in ensuring Quality at Entry is rated "moderately satisfactory".
for two main reasons: (a) Considerable time was lost in commencing implementation after Board
approval due to inadequacy of preparation; and (b) many targets were unrealistic. It is
recognized that there was a need to accelerate the finalization of the Project to build confidence
and credibility in the Bank's involvement and support for Nigeria after a decade long hiatus;
PMU capacity was weak and there was benefit in building capacity through the Project, and a
visionary PDO allowed the government to keep on track its reform agenda for the power sector.
Even so, a long period of inaction after Board approval can weaken the Bank's credibility in the
sector even as early approval was establishing it, and hence the rating.

(b) Bank Performance in Quality of Supervision

67.     The overall rating in quality of supervision is assessed as "satisfactory". Positive aspects
of supervision included strong focus of supervision on long-term development goals and
technology solutions, accelerated implementation performance after initial slow disbursement,
intense and quality dialogue with government and utilities on energy reform, independent power
production, benchmarking of power purchase agreements, cost-reflective tariffs, privatization,
and other policy issues, close involvement in portfolio reviews, site visits, and in-between
supervision contacts through phone, e-mails, and video conferences. The Bank was quite
sensitive to emerging technologies and persuaded the government to restructure the Project to
commence pilot applications of the very promising CREST. The implementation was rated as
"unsatisfactory" in 2002 as well as a "problem" project due to almost nil disbursement for the
first two years as discussed in detail in section 2. The Bank Team, however, acted swiftly to put
the implementation back on track and within five months the implementation was again rated
satisfactory. Composition of the Bank team for project preparation and supervision, and the
intensity of effort, is provided in Annex 7.

68.    The initial slow progress of implementation and problems resulting from inadequate
preparedness of the Project as discussed in the section on "quality at entry" were actually
resolved during supervision. However, the reporting and documentation in ISRs could have
been much better.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

69.     The Bank Performance is rated as "satisfactory". As indicated in section 5.2 (b), the
Bank performance in supervision was very strong but a highly satisfactory rating could not be
given because of all the PDOs not being achieved. On the other hand, "the quality at entry" has
been rated as moderately satisfactory though there were compelling reasons for expediting the
Board approval. The rating in view of ICR was just a little short of "satisfactory". On balance,
therefore, the Bank performance is rated as "satisfactory".


                                                17
5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

70.     In spite of formidable challenges during the project implementation period, FGN enacted
the EPSR Act, established NERC, REA, and Market Operator, unbundled NEPA, adopted
MYTO aimed at gradually increasing the tariff to cost-reflective levels between 2009 and 2012
and agreed to provide budgetary subsidy as determined by NERC according to a formula under
MYTO, announced a Gas Policy and enunciated measures to increase gas supply for power. It
has introduced the Petroleum Industry Bill to place the industry on firm legal foundations,
developed the Gas Master Plan, and is taking measures to adopt a commercial framework for gas
supply for power generation. The Government's resolve to divest the power sector, however,
slowed down with postponement of privatization of unbundled companies. However,
privatization and private-sector participation remain the corner-stone of the Government policy
although it is more cautious in their implementation. This approach and caution is considered
appropriate given that FGN has decided to embark on divestment once operating performance of
power utilities has perceptibly improved, generation shortfalls are overcome to some extent,
labor issues have been resolved, and public consultation and support are secured. On balance,
Government performance is rated "satisfactory".

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

71.     The performance of the implementing agency (PMU, as representative of NEPA, now
PHCN) is rated as "satisfactory". PHCN-PMU was effective in implementing the project and
monitoring the progress of various components, intermediate outcome indicators, and key
outcome indicators. Though there was delay in project implementation initially, once the PMU
attained capacity and maturity, project implementation became streamlined. The PHCN-PMU
has helped in achieving the project objectives through extensive collaboration with the BPE and
NERC aimed at reform of the power sector. The success of PMU in implementing the project
has caused it to be given more responsibility to implement additional projects such as NEDP and
NEGIP.

72.     A review of the PHCN-PMU's fiduciary and safeguards capacity has indicated that: (a)
PHCN-PMU continues to have adequate capacity for implementation; (b) reporting and project
management in PMU has progressively improved and plans are underway to implement a more
efficient Project MIS. This System will facilitate timely follow up of the procurement,
implementation, and disbursement status for necessary corrective actions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

73.     On balance, Borrower performance is rated "satisfactory". This rating has been arrived
at considering that the performance of both the FGN and the implementing agency has been
rated as "satisfactory".




                                              18
6. Lessons Learned

74.      It is important to properly assess the time, resources and commitment required to
implement deep reforms and to define the objectives, outcome indicators, and targets realistically.
For complex reforms such as "privatization", development of open access and wholesale market,
it is pertinent to identify stages that can be realistically completed and reach a firm agreement
with the borrower on achieving those PDOs. This is not to say that bold targets should be
avoided. On the contrary, some funds must be maintained as "contingency" to be utilized in case
performance is higher than the assessment. It is also important to maintain a distinction between
the real commitment towards a reform which can prove difficult or controversial and a concept
used as a strategy to appear reform-minded. It is also necessary to ensure that the terminology is
understood in the same way by all concerned. "Privatization" of TransysCo is a valid example.
The Government did not wish to privatize the transmission infrastructure in the way
"privatization" is understood. The Government only wanted to involve the private sector in a
limited way for improving the management of TransysCo such as through a management
contract. That could have been defined more specifically.

75.      The focus of the Project should not be limited to the efficiency of the proposed
investments and completion of the physical components and the associated outcomes. It is
important to maintain a vigorous dialogue with the Government on broader policy issues and
long-term strategy for the growth of the sector. However, this focus should not be at the cost of
achieving what the Project set out to do. In the case of TDP, even though not explicitly
mentioned, the dialogue on the key issues such as power tariff, measures for improving gas to
power supply, power purchase agreements to facilitate private sector involvement in the sector,
staff rightsizing, sector and corporate governance etc. was maintained and facilitated broadening
the scope of successor projects, i.e., NEDP and NEGIP and gradual acceptance of the need for
urgency to move forward on these key initiatives.

76.      In a complex sector, such as the power sector in Nigeria with many serious problems and
huge investment requirements, it is important to identify the most critical constraints to efficient
delivery of services and address those first in order to get the maximum impact from limited
resources as well as limited implementation capacity. TDP was designed to address the most
critical transmission and dispatch system problems, and the later projects (NEDP and NEGIP)
are focusing more on system efficiencies and increasing gas to power supply in order to
maximize utilization of the existing operable generating capacity.

77.     The indicators of Project outcomes should be few but fully reflective of the PDOs. These
indicators should be backed by an appropriate model or a set of equations for computing the
indicators with clear identification of controlling and exogenous variables and their impact. This
should facilitate improved monitoring by the implementing authorities, unambiguous evaluation
of performance at every stage, and identification of corrective action. An example relating to
TDP pertains to the TransysCo's financial viability. Viability was not defined and the
controlling and exogenous variables were not identified. That gave rise to varying
interpretations at different stages of evaluation.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

78.     Borrower/implementing agencies. The Borrowers' report at Annex 8 is very positive in
terms of achievement of the stated objectives and has described the physical achievements and
some non-achievements in detail. Some minor issues with the report are as follows: (a) non-
achievement of objectives pertaining to open access, wholesale market, and financial viability of
TransysCo have been referred to in the report without much discussion; (b) the credit amount
reported in paragraph 1, i.e., 113.35 Million USD (100.00 million SDR) is not exactly correct as
the actual credit was SDR 78.6 million (US$100 million equivalent); (c) Project objectives,
though stated as per PAD in paragraph 1, have been summarized slightly differently in sub-
paragraph 2(d) in paragraph 15; (d) the report states that PMU could be converted to a service
company though this issue has not been discussed with the Bank Team; and (e) the report does
not provide any reasons for the initial delay in implementation.

79.     The Borrower's report at Annex 8 (paragraph 13) indicates that staff rightsizing was not
implemented. The point raised by the borrower is significant in that it acknowledges the need
for staff rightsizing. Necessary action could not perhaps be taken by the Government for many
reasons including the non-resolution of issues raised by staff unions, large funds requirement,
and probably inadequate political will to address the complex issue. Even though staff
rightsizing was not an explicit PDO of TDP, the Bank team did make efforts to assess the
complexity of the issue and suggest plans and funding requirements for rightsizing the various
companies in a gradual manner and also urged the Government to take timely action in order to
make the unbundled companies more efficient and attractive to private operators/investors.
Assessment was also made of the funding requirement and the issues with regard to the
companies joining designated private pension schemes as per the Government directive.

80.    Co-financiers. There were no co-financiers in this project (see Annex 9).

81.    Other partners and stakeholders. There were no other partners.

                  Annex 2. The CREST Program: Features and Benefits
The program seeks to introduce efficiency in electricity distribution management through
introduction of some or all of the following key technological and commercial elements:

Technological:
 Metering of all customers.
 Remote reading of major customers to eliminate fraud in meter reading and collusion
   between unscrupulous staff and customers.
 High voltage distribution systems to reduce theft and losses.
 Internet based customer records for greater transparency and information.
 Asset and facilities management.
 Database and data mining initiatives including Geographical Information System
   (GIS)/Global Positioning System (GPS) techniques.
 Electronic and spot-billing of customers, including provision of printed bills and collection of
   bills `on-the-spot'.

Commercial:
 Distribution business outsourcing (either in ring-fenced distribution zones/clusters or in retail
  pockets such as housing estates, markets, and industrial areas) on bulk service to customers.
 Distribution function outsourcing.
 Rationalizing bill estimation in the interim.
 Payment through cash cards (cashless transactions).
 Energy audit of distribution feeders.
 Customer service centers for improving utility-customer interface.
 Rapid response mobile customer service units.
 Focusing on collecting government receivables.
 Performance measurement and monitoring.

CREST framework is anchored on the following principles:

   Right incentives for distribution business to be a net cash generator for: (i) supply of quality
   power; and (ii) gradual elimination of the need for Government support.
   Operational philosophy to change from that of a service provider to that of retail trader in
   electricity.
   Re-engineering business processes with innovative technology adaptations, leveraging
   Information - Technology for efficiency, energy balancing, and performance monitoring.
   Reorienting the market with introduction of competition, well-established regulation,
   standards of service, retail outsourcing, and developing technical and human skills within the
   local market, for sustainable private sector participation.

To date, CREST has yielded encouraging results in targeted clusters with losses going down
from an average of 40% to around 7% and improvement in quality of supply from 180 volts to
220 volts.

                         Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.    The key assumptions used in the calculation of the Financial Internal Rate of Return
(FIRR) are:

          a) The actual investment in the transmission and distribution systems in each of the
             Project years (as per the disbursement of Credit funds) has been considered and
             amounts to US$109.57 million equivalent (Source: Annex 1).
          b) Investments under TA and the institutional components have not been considered
             as their benefits have also not been considered.
          c) 30 MVA injection substation supplies an average of 367.2 MWh per day (source:
             TransysCo records).
          d) Total capacity installed under this Project is 660 MVA (Source: Annex 3).
          e) The extra energy made available by the investment is about 15% of total energy
             injected resulting from fewer breakdowns subsequent to replacement of life-
             expired transformers with new transformers (source: PHCN's actual figures of
             breakdowns but assuming a conservative figure).
          f) Estimated Revenue in US$ per year = [(367.2 MWh * (660/30) *365* 15% *
             Tariff in Naira)/(Exchange rate * 1000)]
          g) Annual O & M Cost is assumed to be 5% of Investment Cost. Normally, in this
             case the incremental operating cost will be close to zero as infrastructure, other
             assets, and staffing exists for much larger capacity. However, the cost has been
             assumed to cater for unforeseen costs.
          h) Retail tariff is adjusted in accordance with MYTO model up to 2012, increasing
             to 10 Naira per kWh from 6 Naira/kWh in 2006, thereafter maintained, being
             assumed as the cost-reflective tariff. In fact, cost-reflective tariff should have
             been assumed since 2002 but there is no reliable estimate of the cost-reflective
             tariff for the years between 2002 and 2008.
          i) Exchange rate of 125 Naira/US$ has been used, the exchange rate existing at the
             beginning of the Project in 2002 as all prices and costs are in terms of 2003 prices
             without adjustment for inflation or foreign exchange rate; and
          j) A discount rate of 12% has been used to calculate net present value.

2.    Additional assumptions used in the calculation of Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR) are:

          a) Average marginal cost of self-generated electricity through private generators is
             conservatively estimated at US$0.10 per kWh. The basis for this assumption
             follows: From the Tractebel National Load Demand Studies, the marginal cost of
             self-generation for large customers is 18 N/kWh (i.e., US$0.16 /kWh) leaving
             capital costs aside. The inference is based on the survey of 42 customers in Abuja
             disco having a connection to the network larger or equal to 1 MVA, which
             together have a total installed capacity of 75 MVA and average monthly
             consumed fuel of 30,000 liters per month. The study assumes a specific diesel
             consumption of 220g/kWh or 0.3 liter/kWh which corresponds to a genset rated
             around 500 kVA in the climatic condition of Nigeria, and takes the official diesel

                                              25
              price in Nigeria of 60.15 naira/liter. For smaller industrial, commercial and
              residential customers using diesel units of 5-10 kW, fuel efficiency is lower, and
              therefore their cost of electricity is in the 30-36 N/kWh (i.e., US$0.26-0.31/kWh)
              range. This is similar to the benchmarks in WB projects (the typical value for
              diesel-based electricity consumed by small users is US$0.35 - US$0.50 inclusive
              of equipment costs) and reflects the high level of diesel prices. Capital costs for
              diesel generators of all sizes are taken to be US$0.03/ kWh. For less affluent
              households relying on kerosene and batteries, the analysis assumes that the
              willingness to pay is US$0.10/kWh. The weighted average estimate of the unit
              cost of replacement electric power based on existing customer breakdown is
              calculated to be US$0.17/kWh, implying an operating cost of US$0.14/ kWh.

4.   The analysis shows that:

        a) The investment in transmission and distribution components of TDP is financially
           viable, achieving a FIRR of 16.8% and FNPV of US$22.2 million. The delay in
           project implementation has impacted the financial rate of return adversely
           compared to the estimates in PAD.
        b) EIRR and ENPV are respectively 29.2% and US$79.6 million.
        c) The project economics are slightly better than that in the PAD (EIRR estimated at
           26.6% and ENPV at US$ 60.71 million at the 12% discount rate) due to
           adjustment of the disbursement profile.

                             Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      While no formal beneficiary survey was done, several beneficiary interactions were held
to assess the results and outcomes of interventions under TDP. Visits by the Finance and Power
Ministers of Nigeria, various sector officials, Bank teams led by Regional Vice President,
Country Director, Sector Manager and AFTEG staff assessed the impact of these interventions
on various missions. The President of the Bank also visited a project area and interacted with the
beneficiaries in June 2005. All these interactions yielded positive responses from beneficiaries
on the results achieved by the Project activities in Ikeja, Lagos, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, and Abuja.


2.     The following are some of the interesting changes taking place in the sector:
           a. High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) pilots (a key component of CREST)
              have stabilized voltages (source: actual measurement and customer interviews).

           b. Prepaid meters (a key component of CREST) installed in Abuja under a non-Bank
              Project are improving the discipline of power consumption.

           c. The Lagos zone is piloting an initiative to send customer bills through the SMS
              facility using the GSM network (which is likely to improve collections).

           d. Ibaadan zone has initiated new measures in customer service improvement.

           e. At a CREST pilot location in Ikeja, a welder informed the mission that due to
              consequent improvement in voltage, he is able to conduct his business better.

           f. A community elder in Ibaadan informed that the quality of life has improved for
              the local community due to better supply conditions.

           g. In Abuja, the mission learnt that the COO of the distribution business unit has
              written a letter to the Finance ministry and other important government
              organizations, asking them to pay their electricity bills on time, informing them
              that he is directly accountable for the revenues to be collected for power
              distributed. Since the Government is a major defaulter and contributor to
              overdues, this is a step in the right direction.

                    Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


1.      There was no Stakeholder Workshop organized under this project. However, a series of
Power Sector Leaders' workshops were held along with and during implementation of this
Project. This series of workshops was very successful in charting the course of reform in the
power sector, in defining the role and accountability of various stakeholders with regard to
various activities in the sector that included implementation of the TDP and the PSP. Thus this
series has substituted the Stakeholder Workshop and there was no need for separate Project
related workshops. The series of Power Sector Leaders' workshops have been rated very high by
QAG.

I      Credit Overview

1.     The project was designed to support the Federal Government of Nigeria in implementing
an overall program of Power Sector Reform and Privatization by addressing the requirement of
Transmission dispatch sub-sector especially through facilitation of the then NEPA but now
PHCN unbundling; establishment of transparently-regulated, financially-viable, commercially-
operated Transmission and System Operation Company (TransysCo) with private participation;
removing transmission network and system operation constraints on provision of reliable power
supply; and facilitating development of an efficient wholesale power market to improve the long-
term performance of the power sector. The Project was financed from the IDA Credit No. 3559-
UNI. The initial value of the entire Project expressed in USD amounted to 113.35 Million USD
(100.00 million SDR). The World Bank contribution is in the amount of 103 Million USD while
the Federal Republic of Nigeria was to contribute 10.35 Million USD.

2.     The Project was expected to help achieve the following results:

           a.   restructure, reform, and privatize the Power sector;
           b.   provide short term improvement in electricity supply;
           c.   increase system control;
           d.   increase financial viability of the sector; and
           e.   provide increased access to electricity.

II     Components

3.      The financial support for the project was aimed at three components which were
connected to reform and privatization of the Power sector. The components are as follows: (i)
investment on capital project to redress certain deficiencies and operational constraints of the
Nigerian Power transmission system; (ii) Technical assistance towards the establishment and
running of the new TransysCo and development of transmission and system operation; (iii)
Establishment of Social and Environmental structures for the Power sector.

4.    All technical, administrative, and financial capacities were available for Project
implementation.

Investment on capital project (Transmission and Distribution)

5.     The following sub components have been successfully implemented:

           a. Reinforcement of Grid substation: with the augmentation of 150 MVA 330/132
              kV transformer capacity each in Oshogbo, Kano, Onitsha and Alaoji with
              associated 330 and 132 kV bays; and two 45/60 MVA 132/33 kV transformer in
              Benin with associated equipment. This should result in the addition of 660 MVA
              capacity of Power transformers to the grid for the transmission of electricity.

                                                32
                Presently, a total of 510 MVA capacity has been commissioned with an
                outstanding 150 MVA yet to be completed in Kano. The transformer failed
                during commissioning and a replacement is expected to be commissioned by
                December 2009.
           b.   Supply and installation of Grid System metering: In the area of the grid
                system metering, a total of 300 No 132 kV current transformers, 300 No 132 kV
                Capacitive Voltage Transformers and 165 energy meters have been installed at
                the 132 kV bays of the 330/132 kV transformers at various grid substations. This
                has enhanced accuracy in measurement of power supplied to various transmission
                grid substations. In addition, system stability and flexibility has improved due to
                replacement of obsolete and faulty current transformers and capacitive voltage
                transformers.
           c.   Establishment of a new National Control Centre (NCC) with SCADA/EMS
                facilities and associated communications requirements: The aim of the
                inclusion of this component is to handle generation dispatch and transmission
                system operations, to maintain system security and quality of power supply.
           d.   Replacement of Grid Distance Protection Relays: This component is designed
                to improve transmission system reliability. Replacement of 44 No grid distance
                protection relays in 330 kV Substations in Akangba, Oshogbo, Benin, Ajaokuta,
                Jebba, Kaduna and Aja; and five generation stations in Shiroro, Jebba, Egbin,
                Kainji and Sapele has been successfully completed.
           e.   Commercial Reorientation of Electricity Sector Toolkit (CREST): The High
                Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) and High Tension Metering Panels
                initiatives implemented under CREST pilot scheme funded by the Bank under the
                Transmission Development Project (TDP) recorded huge success in the area of
                revenue loss reduction, preventing theft of power, tail-end voltage improvement,
                and efficiency improvement. Based on the success achieved through the
                implementation of the scheme, the Federal Government of Nigeria is investing
                over US$250 million under the National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) for full
                implementation of CREST type HVDS system nation-wide.
           f.   Supply and installation of a Management Information System (MIS) for
                TransysCo: As a result of restructuring of this project, this sub-component is
                being implemented under NEDP.

Technical Assistance

6.     In the area of Technical Assistance, the project in its course of implementation has
supported the following sub-components:

           a. Change Management: All the associated activities like legal, economic,
              financial and management structure relating to the establishment of the TransysCo
              have been successfully completed. However, the implementation of this
              component could not address the issue of right-sizing of PHCN. This is mainly
              due to labor-related issues.
           b. Preparation and implementation of Business Plan for the TransysCo: The
              Business Plan for the TransysCo has been prepared to provide adequate

                                                33
                information on the required staffing and skills, training program and also the
                design and specifications for a Management Information System (MIS). Under
                this, the project was able to finance the consultancy for the preparation of the
                Business Plan and also an International Workshop on Business Plan. The
                implementation of the Business Plan has commenced.
           c.   Transmission Pricing: The component was not implemented due to project
                restructuring.
           d.   Engineering Services: Under this sub-component, the Project has successfully
                funded the consultancy services on Network System study and Planning,
                SCADA/EMS Communication systems, Reactive Power Compensation, whose
                implementation is now being financed through the NEDP, and engineering
                supervision of various contracts.
           e.   Institutional Capacity Building: Training program for capacity building of
                TransysCo staff in the area of managerial, legal, technical, and financial
                capabilities was carried out in this sub component. Other trainings were
                subsequently organized to provide adequate knowledge for TransysCo staff on
                social/environmental issues, public outreach, and technical training on
                transmission maintenance and system operation.
           f.   Power Market development and Operation: The component was not done
                under the project. However all the structures like the Market Operator and
                shadow trading have been established. In addition, Electric Power Sector Reform
                Act has been enacted to enable open access.

Social and Environmental component

7.     Environment, Resettlement and Social Unit (ERSU) in TransysCo was established. This
Unit was first established as a department in the Project Management Unit of the Power Holding
Company of Nigeria prior to the establishment of this unit in TransysCo.

8.      The ERSU as a unit has performed several tasks in monitoring and evaluation of project-
related environment and social activities, and also preparation of EIA, EMP and Resettlement
Assessments and Action Plans for projects that are presently being executed.

9.     In collaboration with National Action Committee on AIDS (NACA), the project
succeeded in establishing the PHCN Aids Control Team (PACT) under the ERSU to design,
monitor, and supervise program for HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness.

III    Conclusion

10.    All the Contracts were awarded by April 2006 while majority of the project activities
were realized by the end of 2007 and greater proportion of disbursement was also done in 2007.
All funds for the project were expended.

11.     The Project was extended twice, for a total period of two years, due mainly to youth
restiveness in the Niger Delta area; vandalisation of optic fibres; delay in the completion of new
NCC and RCC buildings and inclusion of CREST component.

                                                34
12.     This project started the use of `Report-Based Disbursement' in Nigeria in 2004. The
project's FMR was used as training material by the World Bank.

Main Objectives

13.    In the process of implementing the Project, the main objectives were achieved except for
some goals like the right-sizing of PHCN and retraining program to facilitate the hiring of
retrenched NEPA workers by private sector firms that provide services to TransysCo. These
goals could not be achieved because of labor-related issues. The MIS (Supply and Installation of
Management Information System), which could not be implemented in TDP is now being funded
through NEDP.

14.    The PHCN-PMU has also helped in achieving the project objectives through extensive
collaboration with the Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE) and National Electricity Regulatory
Commission (NERC) aimed at reform of the power sector.

Future Activities

15.    Due to the effectiveness in implementing the project, PHCN-PMU was given more
responsibility to implement additional projects such as NEDP and WRDSEM. Transformation
of PHCN-PMU into Service Agency to provide services to Power Industry is in the pipeline.

Cooperation between Project Partners and Project Evaluation

16.     The project partners were the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), IDA as the
financier, and Federal Government of Nigeria as the Borrower. The cooperation among the
participants was successful. Cooperation was carried out at all levels, from the physical
implementation of the Project to the implementation and control of business plan and key
indicators. The Bank's Project team always endeavored to understand and address the problems
which arose in the course of Project implementation and supported PHCN's plans and proposals
at the Government level.

17.    The relationship among project partners was, from the very beginning, open and
transparent. The Bank's project team was always ready to cooperate and aid both PHCN and
government in terms of advice and support. To execute tasks efficiently, members of PHCN-
PMU took courses in World Bank Procedures. The actual implementation of the project enabled
the acquisition of knowledge, skills and experience which will certainly increase the efficiency
of employees and have an effect on the future success of PHCN-PMU activities.

18.    Finally, we evaluate this Project as satisfactory and cooperation with the World Bank as
very successful.
