Development Project\n            will add new transformers and associated facilities at five\n            existing substations located at Oshogbo, Kano, Onitsha,\n            Benin, and Alaoji. This Environmental Policy Framework\n            Evaluation (EPFE) examines the potential issues arising from\n            construction of new facilities: a) impact to biological\n            resources; b) impacts to human resources arising from\n            construction of new facilities; c) noise related to\n            construction and operation of large transformers; d) public\n            and workplace health and safety associated with past\n            management practices at existing substations, including the\n            use and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)\n            containing transformer oils; and e) contamination issues\n            associated with ongoing management of facilities. The five\n            existing locations all have sufficient land within existing\n            perimeters to accommodate the proposed facilities, and no\n            biological or social land use impacts are therefore\n            anticipated. No residence or sensitive receptors were noted\n            in close proximity to the substation sites, and so noise is\n            not considered an issue. Leakage and uncontrolled disposal\n            of PCB-containing oils has occurred at two existing\n            facilities, which may present a risk to workers at the\n            sites. To mitigate this, PCB tests will be conducted in all\n            facilities initially. If the presence of PCB is confirmed, a\n            Phase II audit will be conducted to develop new construction\n            plans for minimizing contamination and human exposure."}, "docdt": "2001-02-05T00:00:00Z"}
