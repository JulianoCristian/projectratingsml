supply and installation of grid\n            system metering to enable the measurement of power supplied\n            to unbundled distribution companies; and, the establishment\n            of a new National Control Center with Supervisory Control\n            and Data Acquisition (SCADA), and Energy Management System\n            (EMS) facilities, including associated communications\n            requirements. Grid distance protection relays will be\n            replaced, to be specifically determined following the power\n            system planning study, and, a management information system\n            for the Transmission and System Operation Company\n            (TransysCo), will be supplied and installed; 2) technical\n            assistance, designed to establish, and operate the new\n            TransysCo, will develop transmission, and system operations\n            related to secondary regulations. Additionally, the\n            operation of a wholesale power market will be established.\n            Training programs will enhance managerial, legal, technical,\n            and financial capabilities, covering the areas of sector\n            regulation, financial management, social, and environmental\n            issues, and technical aspects on transmission maintenance,\n            and system operation; and, 3) the establishment of an\n            environment, resettlement, and social unit, funded to\n            support monitoring, and evaluation of project related\n            environmental, and social issues, including the program for\n            HIV/AIDS prevention."}, "docdt": "2001-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
