Re:

List of Participating Countries
Excellency:
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the Agreement) of even date 
herewith between the Federal Republic of Nigeria (the Borrower) and the International 
Development Association (the Association) and, more particularly, to the definition of 
"Participating Countries" to be found in Section 1.01 (a) thereof.
We have to inform you that, for purposes of the Agreement, the following 
countries are not "Participating Countries" and, therefore, not eligible to supply 
goods and services under the Credit: The Bahamas, Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Cyprus, 
Oman, Qatar, Singapore and United Arab Emirates.  This list of ineligible countries is 
in addition to the list of ineligible countries under paragraphs 1.6 and 1.8 of the 
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in 
January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999 
(the Guidelines).
In accordance with the operational policies of the Association, the term 
"ineligible countries" applies both to the nationality of bidders, and to the source 
of goods and services provided.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing the enclosed copy of 
this letter and returning it to us for our records.
Sincerely yours,
