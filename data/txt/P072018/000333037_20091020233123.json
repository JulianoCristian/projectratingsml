development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the focus of the project should not be limited to\n            the efficiency of the investments and completion of the\n            physical components and the associated outcomes. It is\n            important to maintain a vigorous dialogue with the\n            Government on broader policy issues and long-term strategy\n            for the growth of the sector. In a complex sector, such as\n            the power sector in Nigeria with many serious problems and\n            huge investment requirements, it is important to identify\n            the most critical constraints to efficient delivery of\n            services and address those first in order to get the maximum\n            impact from limited resources as well as limited\n            implementation capacity. TDP was designed to address the\n            most critical transmission and dispatch system problems, and\n            the later projects are focusing more on system efficiencies\n            and increasing gas to power supply in order to maximize\n            utilization of the existing operable generating capacity.\n            The indicators of project outcomes should be few but fully\n            reflective of the project development objectives (PDOs).\n            These indicators should be backed by an appropriate model or\n            a set of equations for computing the indicators with clear\n            identification of controlling and exogenous variables and\n            their impact. This should facilitate improved monitoring by\n            the implementing authorities, unambiguous evaluation of\n            performance at every stage, and identification of corrective action."}, "docdt": "2009-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
