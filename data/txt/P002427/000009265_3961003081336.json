The project comprises\n            emergency-type measures that need to be carried out as a\n            first step in addressing the most pressing constraints to\n            the effective implementation of the government's\n            program of reforms.  It:  (a) focuses on agencies\n            responsible for fiscal management:  (i) the Department of\n            Finance, Development and Planning to strengthen budgeting,\n            expenditure control, aid coordination, procurement and\n            policy analysis; (ii) Accountant General's Office and\n            Auditor General's Department to strengthen accounting,\n            auditing, and control; and (iii) the establishment of\n            capability in the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) to supervise\n            disbursement of donor program support funds and strengthen\n            BSL accounting capacity; (b) provides institutional support\n            to:  (i) civil service reform to restore efficiency and\n            capacity for delivery of services; (ii) public enterprise\n            reform to reduce government ownership of public enterprises\n            and improve the efficiency of those remaining in the public\n            sector; (iii) build a capacity for supervision and\n            regulation of the petroleum industry; and (iv) develop plans\n            and work programs to address urgent social policy and\n            poverty issues."}, "docdt": "1992-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
