institutional development impact\n            as modest, Bank performance as unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance as unsatisfactory. The economic situation and\n            political instability from 1993 to 1997 affected the\n            implementation of the project. The key lessons learned from\n            this project are: The project design should be simple. The\n            components should reflect only the highest priorities of the\n            Government and not lump together all desirable public sector\n            issues to be resolved in one project in a country where\n            implementation capacity is weak. There is a need for a\n            review and revision of project design midstream by taking\n            into consideration external circumstances. In a very weak\n            institutional setting, it is important to limit the number\n            of studies in a project because of inadequate capacity to\n            implement the studies. It is also important to provide\n            support to building capacity of local training institutions\n            for the continuous training of the public service. In a\n            post-conflict situation, the benefits can be large from not\n            closing down completely a project that is supporting reform\n            in public sector institutions, but leaving some modest\n            amount of funds available to enable some state institutions\n            to perform basic and vital functions in critical areas in\n            order to minimize state failure."}, "docdt": "2002-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
