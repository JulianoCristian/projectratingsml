MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO BURMA FOR THE
GAS DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed Development Credit to the
Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma (GOB) for SDR48.3 million
(US$63.0 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms is submitted for
approval. The proposed Credit would be relent to the Myanma Oil Corporation
(HOC), with the Government bearing the foreign exchange risk. The Credit
would help finance a project to develop and use natural gas from the Payagon
field and to provide technical assistance and training. The United Nations
Development Program would also provide US$2.5 million equivalent for the
latter component.
Background
2.       Burma has substantial energy resources, including hydropower, natural
gas, crude oil, biomass, and coal. Despite large petroleum reserves, oil
production has been low and continuously falling; with gas development also
at an early stage, the country has been experiencing serious energy shortages,
thus hindering economic growth. While Burma has successfully exploited its
petroleum resources on its own over the past twenty years, that process has
become increasingly difficult due to the scarcity in financial resources, as
well as the Lack of modern petroleum technology to meet adverse conditions
confronting oil production and the natural productivity decline of the oil-
fields. An introduction of modern petroleum engineering techniques could have
a significant beneficial impact on oil production. At the same time,
accelerated development and utilization of Burma's onshore Payagon gas
reserves provide an immediate, least-cost supply option.
3.       Burma's commercial energy consumption is among the lowest in the
world at 33 kilograms of oil equivalent per capita. It is estimated that as
much as 86% of total energy requirements are met from traditional, biomass
sources. COB's policy is not to trade in petroleum, and commercial energy is
supplied almost entirely from domestic resources. Petroleum products dominate
the consumption mix, accounting for over 60% of total primary commercial
energy supplies. The largest commercial energy consumer is the transport
sector (53Z), followed by industry (42%) and households (5%). The minor share
of consuimption by the household sector is a reflection of its limited access
to electricity and suppressed demand for kerosene as a cooking fuel.
Commercial energy demand is projected to at least double by the year 2000. In
the absence of further investments in the petroleum subsector, in which there
is sizeable potential to increase suppLies, current energy shortages are
expected to worsen.
4.       In particular, increasing the role of Burma's sizeable natural gas
resources as a major force driving economic growth has become one of the key
opportunities available to the country. The Government has just begun
exploiting the Payagon onshore gas reserves by encouraging gas substitution in
power and industry. The Government has also identified as a high priority
investment, the Payagon Gas Development Program (PGDP), to deliver additional
gas to Rangoon and to extend gas deliveries to southern Burma. The proposed



project corresponds to Phase I of PCDP. Given the high productivity of the
Payagon fieLd, low production costs, and assured nearby markets, Payagon gas
is a competitive energy source even at low international oil prices. The
proposed project would be a critical step in accelerating the utilization of
Payagon gas, by supporting the development of the known reserves, the
appraisal of additional reserves, as well as the expansion of the delivery
system to Rangoon.
Project Objectives
5.       The main objective of the project is to help alleviate the chronic
shortages of petroleum by developing further the onshore Payagon gas fieLd as
well as by introducing modern petroleum engineering techniques to improve oil
recovery. To achieve these objectives, the project will support: development
drilling to increase production from the Payagon gas field by about 1 miLlion
cubic meters (35 million cubic feet) per day; appraisal drilling to establish
sufficient reserves to meet projected gas demand beyond the early 1990s;
expansion and upgrading of the transmission facilities from Payagon to
Rangoon; design of a basic distribution network for Rangoon; and technical
assistance and training for MOC. In addition, the proposed project will
support sector policy objectives of introducing gas pricing reform based on
full cost recovery as a minimum, initiating steps to improve MOC's finances,
and strengLhening GOB's capabilities for gas subsector investment planning.
Project Description
6.       The project, which corresponds to Phase I of the Payagon Gas
Development Program, consists of three main components: (i) gas field
development (12 wells), appraisal drilling (5 wells), and upgrading of seismic
field equipment; (ii) installation of an 18-inch diameter gas transmission
pipeline from the Payagon field to Rangoon (103 kilometers or 64 miles);
expansion and upgrading of the Rangoon city gate station; design of the basic
Rangoon distribution system and construction of its main elements; cathodic
protection for the existing 10-inch diameter transmission pipeline; and Ciii)
implementation of a training and technical assistance program, a Financial
Viability Study for MOC, a Gas Utilization Study, two Enhanced Oil Recovery
Studies, and a liquefied petroleum gas/compressed natural gas (LPG/CNG) pilot
operation. The total project cost is estimated at US$100 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$65.5 million, of wnich IDA would
finance US$63.0 million. A breakdown of costs and the f5nancing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and method of procurement, as well as the dis-
bursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key events in
project processing is provided in Schedule C, and the status of IDA operations
in Schedule D. ALso attached is a map showing the project area. The staff
appraisal report (Report No. 6672-BA) dated May 21, 1987 is also attached.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
7.       The project is the first IDA operation in the petroleum sector.  It
establishes the framework for: Ci) pursuing IDA's sector policy
recommendations resulting from the Joint World Bank/UNDP Energy Assessment of
June 1985; and (ii) building further on the petroleum sector dialogue that
has so far resulted in positive shifts in the Government's development poLicy
for the sector. IDA's involvement would support gas pricing policy reform



- 3 -
based on full cost recovery as a minimum, promote the financial strengthening
of MOC, develop gas investment planning capability, and promote gas
utilization while establishing an optimal sequence of medium-term invest-
ments. In addition, the project would facilitate a gradual introduction of
modern petroleum technology while, in the longer term, encouraging the
preliminary interest shown by the Government towards oil industry involvement
in the sector. IDA's presence in the sector would also make available to
Burma the extensive experience in technology transfer and policy formulation,
which the World Bank group has gained in other countries in the area of
natural gas development.
Agreed Actions
8.       The Government has already taken the following actions:  Ci)
increased the price of Payagon gas to K7.50 (US$1.13) per thousand cubic feet,
a level that would more than cover the long-run marginal cost and make the
development of the Payagon field a financially viable operation for MOC; (ii)
established a Project Implementation Unit and appointed a Project Director;
and (iii) agreed on the final terms of reference for the MOC Financial
Viability Study, the Gas Utilization Study, the Enhanced Oil Recovery Studies,
and the related consultancy services and the training program. COB and HOC
have also agreed to take the following actions: (i) establish an inter-
ministerial working group prior to Board presentation to carry out a study to
identify measures for improving MOC's financial viability; and review with IDA
the preliminary and final results of this study within 18 and 24 months,
respectively, of Credit effectiveness; (ii) review with IDA the progress and
results of the Gas Utilization Study and Enhanced Oil Recovery Studies; and
(iii) prepare a detailed implementation plan for the LPG/CNG pilot operation
for IDA review and comment within 3 months of Credit effectiveness.
Ratification of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between COB and MOC, satisfactory
to IDA, is a condition of Credit effectiveness.
Justification
9.       The project would enable Burma, where a severe shortage of commercial
energy has emerged, to rapidly develop and deliver additional gas supplies to
assured markets at a cost that is significantly lower than the border price
values of the liquid fuels (diesel and fuel oil) displaced. The project would
yield economy-wide benefits by improving commercial energy availability. The
project's economic rate of return is 72X and that of the Payagon Gas
Development Program is 59%; even if the gas is valued, in energy equivalent
terms, at the lowest liquid fuels prices realized during the past ten years,
the economic rate of return of the project would still be 46%. The project
would also identify options for improving oil recovery as well as strengthen
technical and planning capabilities.
Risks
10.      The economic risks are limited.  Technical risks related to gas
reserves are low and would be further minimized by adequate seismic work done
before or in conjunction with drilling in order to minimize the number of dry
delineation wells. The risk of slow project implementation is low, given the
high importance attached by the Government to this project, the proven ability
of MOC to undertake this type of project, and the proposed technical
assistance package.
