five-year time-slice (July 1981 - June 1986) of the\n            development of two major irrigation schemes in Madhya\n            Pradesh: the Mahanadi Reservoir Project (MRP) and the Hasdeo\n            Bango Project (HB). Construction of the planned storage\n            reservoirs, needed to develop available water resources, is\n            already underway and would be continued. Canal capacities\n            would be enlarged to meet peak water requirements, and\n            sufficient control structures would be provided so that the\n            canal systems can respond to changing seasonal and annual\n            water demands. All channels would be extended down to 40-ha\n            outlets, and the conveyance system would be extended down to\n            8-ha outlets. The project would further provide surveys and\n            investigations for the future Arpa Irrigation Scheme and\n            improve the implementation and management capabilities of\n            MP's Irrigation Department. The project would increase\n            agricultural production and the standard of living of the\n            farmers in MP. Possible risks under the proposed project are\n            those normally associated with irrigation projects in India."}, "docdt": "1981-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
