                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.      Guinea’s economy has witnessed major shocks after the Coup d’Etat in 2008. The
drastic suspension of donor aid has contributed to a significant debt burden. Inflation is
estimated at 20.9 percent and is adversely affecting people’s purchasing power. Poverty
rates have increased during the crisis, impacting more severely vulnerable groups who
have limited access to basic services.

2.      The civil service in Guinea has been plagued with significant discrepancies
amongst payroll, personnel and census data, pointing to the existence of potential abuse
and irregularities in pay as well as to the lack of control over pay and personnel issues.
This is not a recent phenomenon. A number of efforts to reduce these irregularities have
been tried in the past including more recently in the education sector but with little lasting
gains due to a lack of political will. Pay increases of 50 percent in 2010 have led to an
increase of the civil service wage bill by 20 percent, which now represents 37 percent of
fiscal revenues (2010). The World Bank’s public sector team estimates that over the past
year, the number of civil servants has increased from 72,000 to about 124,000, partially
as a result of the movement of contractual staff to civil servant status. In 2008, the
government abolished its cost-saving policy and is no longer recruiting contract staff as
all new recruits are hired as civil servants. This is impacting the education sector
particularly, which has the largest share of personnel. Before undertaking more structural
reforms, the Ministry of Civil Service has recently started to clean up the current database
from ghost workers, double-dippers and retired civil servants.

3.     A first democratically elected government and the willingness to engage in
important reforms, including public financial management and public sector efficiency,
provides an important opportunity to bring about change. That said, the Bank stopped
disbursements as a result of the December 2008 coup and then formally suspended
operations in November 2009, when Guinea fell into arrears with IDA. The dialogue
between the Bank and the Government resumed in January 2011 and the operations
picked up again upon Guinea clearing its arrears with the Bank in April 2011.

4.      The new Government has laid out its one-year vision in an interim poverty
strategy note (2011-2012). The three priority axes are: (a) improving governance and
strengthening institutional and human capacity; (b) accelerating economic growth and
increasing opportunities of jobs for all; and (c) improving access to quality basic services.

5.      The original Credit in the amount of SDR 55.7 million (US$70 million
equivalent) was approved on July 24, 2001 and became effective on January 8, 2002. The
Project closing date has been extended three times. An additional financing (AF) in the
                                              1
form of a grant was provided in 2008 in the amount of SDR 6.4 million (US$10 million
equivalent). The closing date of the Credit and the AF has recently been extended to June
30, 2013. The project has almost fully disbursed the original Credit with an undisbursed
amount equal to SDR 1,105.67 (about US$1,783.91 equivalent), while the AF has
disbursed SDR 3.1 million (about US$4.5 million equivalent). Due to exchange rate
fluctuations, the disbursed amount in US$ exceeds the original allocation in US$. As of
August 3, 2011, about US$310,000 from the first disbursement under the Additional
Financing remains in the special account located at the Central Bank (BCRG). In a letter
dated, August 3, 2011, the government requested that the amount be transferred to the
special account in a commercial bank and managed by the CN/PSE. Of the US$310,000,
about US$195,000 would be used to cover maintenance costs of the recently completed 7
collèges or lower secondary schools under the Credit and about US$114,000 for pending
payments of consultants (audits carried out under the Additional Financing in the amount
of US$50,000, and two consultancies already completed under the Credit in the amount
of US$64,000).

6.      In the two-year interim since the AF was approved and began disbursing, the
Government of Guinea (GOG) has adjusted its priorities and objectives. The GOG
specifically asked for technical support to improve the human resource management in
education. The proposed restructuring is an attempt to respond to the double challenge
facing Guinea at this time by supporting the Government in addressing public spending
efficiency and entrenching reform for improving personnel management in education.
While the restructured project would support the first interim strategy priority
(governance), an additional project, the Education for All Fast Track Initiative Catalytic
Fund (EFA FTI CF, TF) recently restructured through the pooled fund is supporting the
other two priorities (economic growth and quality basic services).

7.      The proposed changes are: (a) revision of the Project Development Objective
(PDO) to take account of the revised priorities in the education sector; (b) revision of
component three to be aligned with the revised PDO and including the activities to be
financed under the AF; (c) revision of component one to include the maintenance costs
of the lower secondary schools (collèges); (d) revision of cost estimates per component;
(e) revision of the implementation arrangement in alignment with those from the EFA
FTI Catalytic Fund; and (f) reallocation of grant proceeds. The proposed restructuring
will ensure the positive impact of new investments in the sector, including the US$40
million grant from the EFA FTI CF. The overall results framework will be clarified and
revised for both the Credit and the AF.

B. PROJECT STATUS

8.     The EFA Project has three components and consists of the following activities:

Component 1: Expanding access to education (US$19.71 million equivalent)

9.     This component aims to increase the number of students in primary school with a
focus on grade 1 enrollments as well as ―neighborhood‖ collèges. All localities were to
develop enrollment targets and participate in school mapping processes. Priority would
                                            2
be given to underserved regions and populations. Support would also be given to improve
access to early childhood initiatives, secondary, vocational and higher education, and
literacy programs. This component has achieved the following outcomes over the course
of the Project: More than 1100 primary classrooms were constructed contributing to the
increase in gross enrollment in primary from 62 percent in 2001 to 77 percent in 2009,
although some stagnation occurred since 2006. In lower secondary education, the project
contributed to the construction of 7 collèges, which were a new introduction under the
program and for which maintenance costs need to be covered under the restructured
project. The increase in enrollment benefited all social classes, although some equity
concerns remain as the poor in rural areas, particularly girls, have enrollment rates below
the national average. The increase in access to education resulted from an expansion of
public and private provisions of education, with the latter being more prevalent in urban
and peri-urban areas. The project also supported the construction of five teacher training
institutes, six university libraries and 70 early childhood development community
centers.

Component 2: Improving quality of education (US$41.17 million equivalent)

10.     This component comprises support to teachers, schools, and community groups
with classroom and school-level initiatives aimed at ensuring that the teaching team has
the authority, knowledge, support, and learning materials to make meaningful decisions
about how to improve learning for all. This component has achieved the following
outcomes: over the course of the first phase of the Project, around 10,000 new teachers
were successfully trained and an independent evaluation has shown that their level of
proficiency was superior to that of the teachers trained before the introduction of the
reform; about 5 million textbooks were procured and delivered to the schools increasing
the student-textbook ration to 1:3 ; and significant technical support was provided to
strengthen the development of reliable national assessments to evaluate learning results in
primary education. Standardized tests carried out in 2006 and 2007 on a representative
sample of second graders and fourth graders have shown that scores have slightly
improved in French, primarily for the lowest quintile, and more significantly in math,
compared with similar standardized tests conducted in 1997 and 1998. More recently, it
seems that teachers continue to struggle with both content knowledge and pedagogic
weaknesses which will be addressed in the EFA FTI CF project.

Component 3: Strengthening capacity for decentralized management (US$19.12
million equivalent)

11.     The third component aims to improve overall management of the education
system, increasing responsibilities and resource availability at schools. Better support was
provided to school personnel, reversing top-to-bottom flows of information in ways that
would improve capacity for delivering high quality education services. The traditional
areas of support have been education planning, budgeting and programming, statistics
and management information systems. The management culture in the sector remains
centralized, with a top-down approach. To mitigate a lack of real decentralization, donors



                                             3
have, when possible, transferred resources1 directly to primary schools through school
grants. These efforts have been successful in creating and bolstering strong community
participation in education, with communities often taking direct responsibility for school
management, but have not contributed positively to enhancing the administrative,
budgetary and planning capacity of the education sector. Efforts were made to give
greater autonomy to school and sub-district education offices (préfectures) to tackle
educational issues on the ground. Technical assistance and grants were provided directly
to schools to help them develop school development plans which serve as the foundation
to benefit from school grants. It is too early to evaluate the impact of these school grants
on teaching and learning. Continued support for the decentralization of education services
will be provided under the EFA FTI CF.

12. The AF was linked to this third component and directed towards improving human
resource management in the education sector while helping the Government reduce its
budget deficit related to teachers’ salaries and incentives. The AF disbursed US$4.5
million equivalent to cover one month of teachers’ salaries. In exchange, the
Government was going to embark upon a more coherent personnel management system
and has requested assistance from the Bank to carry out the necessary actions. The
Government’s position has changed since 2008 and it has agreed to take over all
payments of salaries for teachers and has therefore requested that the remaining
undisbursed be used to help strengthen its human resource management system.

13.     The recent audit report of teacher salaries conducted by Ernst and Young
identified a number of issues (unaccounted for deaths of teachers, double payments,
teachers no longer in posts, and over payments). These irregularities led to ineligible
expenditures incurred under the first disbursement of the AF in the amount of GNF
1,652,013,810 or US$215,949.50 equivalent. These have all been reimbursed to the
Bank. The proposed restructuring proposes mitigation measures to prevent these systemic
issues from reappearing in the future.

14.     The PDO is currently rated Moderately Satisfactory as most of the PDO indicators
have been met. Implementation performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory mainly
due to the political crisis as well as the suspension which led to a halt in disbursement for
about two years. The fiduciary performance has been satisfactory for the most part
although the issues described above with regard to the audit findings led to a
downgrading of the rating. This reinforces the need to reorient the remaining funds from
salary payments, proven to be very risky, towards the strengthening of human resource
management, which will have important implications for the sector as well efficiency in
spending. Current issues related to personnel management in the sector include (i)
organizational management, (ii) management procedures (recruitment, training,
integration, and (iii) information systems. More specifically, in the area of organizational
management, there are multiple management centers and discrepancies in personnel data;
uncoordinated and disconnected initiatives amongst the various actors involved in the
management of human resources; an insufficient evaluation of personnel needs and
1
 Primary schools have received funding from donors in most cases to lead and implement small school
improvement projects aimed at improving education through the provision of basic school supplies and/or
small pedagogic interventions for teachers and pupils.
                                                   4
multi-annual planning of the personnel to be recruited; a planning function which exists
structurally but is not used or implemented. Within the area of management procedures,
control and regulatory functions remain to be developed and systematized, procedures
and responsibilities within the institutions are well defined but often not followed or
adhered to; integration of graduates from teacher training institutes is not aligned with
budget availability; and prior re-deployment possibilities of personnel are not considered.
Lastly, with regard to information Systems, information applications are obsolete or
dysfunctional; there is an absence of maintenance of equipment; and there are multiple
databases (human resources/planning) and capacity building/support efforts/initiatives
that are disconnected from each other.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

15.      During preparation of the AF in 2008, the PDO was revised as follows: to assist
the Recipient in its efforts to improve the conditions for teaching and learning in its
territory, through (i) expanded access to education, (ii) enhanced quality of learning, and
(iii) strengthened capacity for decentralized management of the sector. Given that most
of the PDO indicators under the Project were achieved in 2008 and that there now exists a
renewed focus on strengthening human resource management, it is proposed to revise the
PDO again. The PDO would be further revised as follows: to assist the Recipient in its
efforts to improve the conditions for teaching and learning in its territory, through (i)
expanded access to education, (ii) enhanced quality of learning, and (iii) strengthened
human resource management.

Results/indicators: The revised results framework is available in Annex 1.

16.      Components: In order to finance the college maintenance costs in the amount of
US$200,000 under component 1 of the Credit, a revision to the project description is
required under the AF to enable the financing of such activity. In order to carry out
activities pertaining to the strengthening of human resource management and related to
the revised PDO, it is proposed to add additional activities under the first and third
components, as follows:

   Original Component/ Subcomponent               Revised Component/Subcomponent
   Part A.2 Component 1: Expanding                Part A.2 Component 1: Expanding access
   access to education                            to education
   Improve access to secondary education          Improve access to secondary education
   through the construction of                    through the construction (and
   approximately eight (8) new secondary          maintenance) of approximately eight (8)
   schools (equivalent to approximately 96        new secondary schools (equivalent to
   classrooms)                                    approximately 96 classrooms)
   Component 3: Strengthening capacity            Component 3: Improved human resource
   for decentralized management                   management in the education sector
   Subcomponent 3(a): Provision of                Completed for one month of salaries. The
   resources for the payment of salaries of       month of December 2008 will be
   primary and secondary public school            removed and will no longer be paid out.
                                              5
      personnel for the months of: (i)
      November 2008; and (ii) December 2008
      Subcomponent 3(b) Provision of            Dropped
      financial incentives to primary and
      secondary public school teachers
      working in challenging and remote areas
      for the months of: (i) November 2008;
      and (ii) December 2008.
      Subcomponent 3(c): Project                Continued
      management/monitoring and
      evaluation/audit
                                                Subcomponent 3 (d):Enforcement of
                                                legal texts and review of recruitment,
                                                allocation and (re) deployment
                                                procedures
                                                Subcomponent 3(e) Implementation of a
                                                coherent data information system and
                                                introduction of merit- and performance-
                                                based incentives

17.      The third component of the project will be revised and two new sub-components
will be added to capture the reforms supporting human resource management. The
activities will be implemented based on a schedule set forth in an action plan.

Sub-component 3 (c): Project management/monitoring and evaluation/project audit

18.     Unlike the original AF which used government systems to pay the teachers’
salaries, the revised AF will use the national coordination of the Education Sector Plan
(CN/PSE) currently in place to carry out the procurement and financial management
responsibilities under the EFA FTI Catalytic Fund. The performance of the CN/PSE has
been evaluated and their capacity found satisfactory to coordinate this project. The
project will finance the operating costs of the coordination unit including external annual
audits of project performance. The CN/PSE comprises a National Coordinator
(nominated by Presidential decree), supported by two specialists in infrastructure and in
pedagogy, a financial and accounting unit; a procurement unit; and a monitoring and
evaluation unit.

Sub-component 3(d): Enforcement of legal texts and review of recruitment,
allocation and (re) deployment procedures

19.      The objectives of this sub-component will be to:

Review the legal texts related to HR/personnel management in the education sector (in
close coordination with the public sector), improve their internal coherence and ensure
their application; make the recruitment and deployment of new teachers related to real
needs.

                                            6
      The surplus of teachers is identified within all structures and some objective
       streamlined and equitable criteria are defined and applied to their re-deployment;
      A personnel movement scale (defined and weighted based on individual and
       professional criteria are taken into account for the movement of personnel) is
       developed and implemented; procedures and appeal mechanisms are defined and
       communicated to teachers as a way to file a complaint (in the event the scale is
       not used properly);
      New recruits are integrated progressively into the system according to real needs
       and the positions being made available in the budget;
      Decisions at the national level to move teachers are finalized in June of each year
       to allow teachers to be present at their respective posts within 15 days of the start
       of the new school year;
      The schools and central departments are restructured and the surplus personnel
       within the newly restructured design are re-deployed to the classroom;
      The quota of one teacher per class has been achieved while keeping with the
       norms of the pedagogic group. The deficit in secondary education teachers is
       filled while respecting the required hours per teacher.

Strengthen the recruitment into the teacher training institutes through the establishment
of an entry and exit examination including the introduction of a bursary system that is
merit-based; improve the monitoring of human resources management.

      The coordination between the departments in charge of human resource
       management is strengthened and streamlined;
      The circulation of information between the departments in charge of human
       resource management has improved; that is, a) the human resource management
       structures have increased responsibilities and are strengthened; and b) the civil
       society is better informed and is participating in the control of human resource
       management;
      Regular audits led by an inter-ministerial committee and an independent
       consultant are being conducted on a semi-annual basis to determine the presence
       of the teachers in the classroom;
      Civil society is trained in conducting the technical controls;

Activities supported under the project

20.     The project will finance the support of logistics for the control/verification of
human resources at all levels. This will include the semi-annual audits to verify the
presence of teachers in the classrooms; workshops; field trips; purchase of goods,
including a vehicle, mobile phones and scratch cards to introduce social accountability
measures; and consultants’ services. With regard to social accountability, the project will
integrate the use of new ICT to help improve the quality and speed with which feedback
is provided and responded and will design citizen feedback mechanism that are efficient
and allow for a tight feedback loop between service providers and users. Specifically,
this will include capacity building on the use of mobile technology as a citizen feedback
mechanism and working with civil society to pilot the use of mobile technology as tool to

                                             7
enable citizen feedback on access to education, the quality of education and human
resource management.

21.     The project will also finance an operational manual for the application of the
scale, consultants to assist with the development of the personnel movement scale and
training, external audit to control the application of the scale, and sensitization
campaigns.

22.     The project will finance the development of a policy for higher education; a
review of the selection methods for entrance into higher education institutions, including
the modalities of quotas within each institution of higher education and teacher training
institutes (with linkages to the labor market); and the development of accompanying
merit-based measures (criteria for obtaining and keeping of scholarships).

23.     Lastly, the project will strengthen the capacity of the statistical unit (DGPSDE) to
collect and analyze data at the central, regional, and school level to identify the needs in
the number of teachers to recruit after re-deployment has taken place. The costs will
entail: purchase of goods, including laptops and computers, solar panels, photocopy
machine, video projector, motorcycles for the regional education staff to conduct site
visits and a vehicle for the statistical unit; consultants’ services to assist with the technical
work described above; workshops for consultations and operating costs (per diems, fuel,
internet access and consumables such as pens and paper).

Sub-component 3(e): Development of a unified information system and introduction
of a merit-based performance system

24.       The objectives of this sub-component will be to:

Support the development of a coherent and unified information system amongst the
various databases

         Personnel data is collected and analyzed for all positions (schools, prefectures
          (districts), and regions, and central departments) and indicators for the human
          resource management are available. Reliable and updated data is received on a
          regular basis;
         The human resource database within the human resource unit (DRH) is
          operational and decentralized to the regions and linked to other databases in the
          sector as well as other databases from civil service and finance.

Introduce a merit-based performance system through a rigorous and prospective impact
evaluation

         A system of rewards (monetary and non-monetary) based on results is introduced
          to improve teachers’ effort and, as a result, learning outcomes.




                                               8
Activities supported under the project

25.     The project will finance the development of tools to collect personnel data,
training of facilitators, national directors and heads of central departments in the usage of
tools. It will finance the purchase of goods (laptops and desktops, photocopy machine,
projector, office furniture, solar panels, a car, and motorcycles) for HR staff (DRH) and
the representatives of HR in deconcentrated structures; consultants’ services to strengthen
the HR unit, training of HR staff and assistant managers at the central, deconcentrated,
and prefecture levels on the usage of the database, the harmonization of the databases
between the HR and Planning and Statistics Departments and broadening of the Ministry
of Pre-University Education to other databases in the sector, a study tour, sensitization
campaigns and operating costs (per diems, fuel, program maintenance, internet access
and consumables such as pens and paper).

26.     The project will also finance an impact evaluation of a performance-based
teacher incentives pilot. The pilot will target teachers in 3rd and 4th grades of a nationally
representative sample of primary schools. Among these teachers, the scheme will reward
those that show improvements in their students’ learning and in their inspection scores on
an annual basis. The two indicators will be measured in a standardized manner and their
impartiality levels will be verified. Furthermore, special dispositions will be taken to
minimize the likelihood of strategic behaviors (distortions) as a result of the program.
The evaluation will make use of a randomized control trial approach which will allow
comparing different design options. In particular, the relative effectiveness of using
monetary (cash) and non-monetary (recognition) type of incentives and the impact of
combining each of these approaches with a short content-focused in-service training will
be assessed. To measure impact, data will be collected at several points in time on
schools, teachers, and students through standardized tests, classroom observations,
attendance tracking, and questionnaires. The major costs will entail the payment of the
incentives, recruitment of consultants with expertise in impact evaluation methodology
and assessment, design of survey instruments, data collection including operating costs
such as transportation, fuel, per diems, accommodation, data analysis, and workshops.
See Annex 3 for further details about the impact evaluation.

Financing: Since the original credit can be considered as fully disbursed, the table below
reflects the revisions of the additional financing project. The other partners supporting
the program through parallel financing and documented under the original credit have
completed their support to the sector. Thus, their respective amounts are no longer
captured in the revised financing plan.

Financial management
27.     Unlike the original Additional Financing which used country systems to pay the
teachers’ salaries, the restructured project will follow the financial arrangements of the
existing national coordination of the ESP (CN/PSE) as the risk involved in country
systems is high. A recent assessment of the ESP’s financial arrangements concludes to
their adequacy for carrying out the financial management responsibilities. The CN/PSE
has track records and satisfactory performance in implementing World Bank financial
procedures.

Procurement
28.     The restructured project will use the existing CN/PSE to carry out the
procurement responsibilities. The CN/PSE is well versed in World Bank procedures and
therefore the risks will be minimal. The CN/PSE has consistently shown satisfactory
performance in this area.

Implementation arrangements
29.     Given the proposed changes in activities, the project would be implemented over
the next two years. The revised implementation schedule is needed to account for the
two-year lapse in implementation during the political crisis. An inter-ministerial
committee will be established to monitor the implementation for the national strategy of
personnel management in the education sector. The committee will have the following
responsibilities: a) ensure the application of the structural reforms to decrease the
multiplicity of sources of data related to personnel in education and measure of control of
this personnel; b) support the development of an information system that allows national
and sectoral levels to manage their personnel and wage bills; c) monitor the re-
deployment of teachers that are in exceeding numbers in urban areas to benefit the areas
                                            11
that are under-staffed; and d) ensure, in accordance with the civil service, the
development of rules, procedures, and institutional responsibilities in the movement and
allocation of teachers.

30.     A team will also be set up to monitor the implementation of the action plan of the
national strategy for personnel management in the education sector, which will be led by
the Permanent Secretary (Secrétaire Général). A team of five staff will be nominated by
the PS to take the responsibility for one component of the action plan. The team will
carry out the following responsibilities: a) ensure that the semi-annual action plan
isimplemented; b) provide assistance and mobilize the actors responsible for the
implementation of the activities identified in the action plan to ensure that their tasks are
achieved; c) evaluate and measure the performance indicators; d) participate in regular
meetings, and e) develop a monthly report describing the implementation of activities and
submit it to the CN/PSE as well as the PS. The CN/PSE, currently functioning under the
EFA FTI Catalytic Fund, will be responsible to carry out the fiduciary responsibility
(financial management, overall coordination and procurement). As of now, members of
this implementation team and inter-ministerial committee have been nominated and roles
defined. Creation of this team and committee will be completed by October 31, 2011 and
a dated covenant has been added to the legal agreement to this effect.


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

Economic and financial analysis
31.     Education is one of the major determinants of a country’s economic and
democratic success and the recent political crisis has not helped Guinea in making
progress towards achieving the MDGs by 2015 including those for education and health.
Government expenditures in education remain low at 1.7% of GDP with the wage bill
accounting for the largest share. A recent audit conducted by Ernst & Young has
highlighted deficiencies in the management of Guinean teachers. Properly managing such
a labor force is a difficult but key task to improve the quality of Guinean schools and thus
the human capital and future productivity and welfare of Guinean children. This program
will help Guinea in this respect by putting in place a modern, rigorous and fair
management of teachers.

32.      Education has an impact on a wide range of outcomes, from health and civic
behaviour to labor market success. Compared to non educated people, primary school
completers increase future income by 40% while those that graduate from secondary
school double their future wage. This investment is still worth making in Guinea once
foregone income and education cost are taken into account. Guinea is thus no exception
to the wide array of evidence that education matters for one’s individual personal
wellbeing and one’s country success. These benefits of education are mostly the
consequence of skills acquisition, whose process is directly related to school quality. As a
result, improving school quality would also increase Guinea’s future labor force.

33.     The set of measures that will be implemented through this project is intended to
put in place a modern management of teachers and should indeed affect schooling quality
                                             12
more than average access rate. Its main intention is to do better with the same resources
leading to short and long term gains without necessarily expanding the resource base.

Technical
34.      The restructured project design has benefited from extensive consultations with
all entities involved in personnel management in education including education, finance,
civil service and representatives from the teacher unions. It takes into account lessons
from previous reform attempts in Guinea as well as from international experience relating
to teacher performance.

35.     Recent education research emphasizes the importance of teachers in realizing
student learning. However, it also shows that it is particularly difficult to link differences
in teacher quality to teacher characteristics for which data is typically available (Rivkin et
al. 2005, Aaronson et al. 2007). These results generated increased interest in the study of
mechanisms that may raise achievement through teachers such as the strengthening of
teacher incentives. The incentive pilot proposed in the context of the restructured project
in Guinea, namely the pilot of performance-based incentive schemes, follows this line of
thought in trying to improve education service delivery through better performing
teachers and in proposing to rigorously assess the impact of the scheme.

Environment
36.     There are no changes to the safeguards as part of this restructuring. The original
project was classified as Category B (with the Additional Financing as Category C). As
this Restructuring involves activities in the original project with potential environmental
and social impacts, the safeguards category is Category B and any changes introduced to
the project are still covered under the Environmental and Social Management Framework
that was prepared, consulted upon, and disclosed for the EFA FTI project in 2008. A
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was also prepared, consulted upon, and disclosed
for the EFA FTI project in 2008. A number of classrooms and schools have been
constructed since the project was started; the ESMF has provided guidance on
appropriate mitigation measures. During project implementation, a safeguards specialist
will accompany the project team to follow up on environmental and social impacts and
provide guidance on any remaining mitigation measures, as necessary. Environmental
and Social Management Plans and/or Resettlement Action Plans will be prepared as and
when necessary.

Risks
37.     The shifting from salary payment to the provision of technical assistance to
strengthen human resource and personnel management in education reduces the risk of
fund mismanagement. Nevertheless, the risk level is still high within a very complex
country context. Keeping the same arrangements in terms of project management as in
the original project facilitates the implementation of the project. The project
management, financial management and procurement arrangements have been
consistently rated satisfactory over the past ten years. Involving the key stakeholders,
including the Ministries of Finance, Education, and Civil Service, as well as teacher
unions in the reforms since the beginning provides ownership and buy-in. The
government’s commitment to public reforms is currently strong but remains fragile and
                                             13
may waiver as a result of a changing political environment. As a result, the introduction
of social accountability mechanisms is key to involve grassroots’ levels and to put
pressure on central levels as necessary. The project disbursement will take place on a
quarterly basis and after each quarter the political commitment will be assessed.

  1.     This annex includes an overview of macroeconomic conditions in Guinea, an
  analysis of the global features of the educational system and a literature review about the
  potential impact of the program.

  2.      Macroeconomic conditions have worsened in the recent years. Between 2005 and
  2007, GDP growth was just high enough to offset population growth and maintain GDP
  per capita constant. GDP growth was higher in 2008 but the political crisis that happened
  in 2009 wiped out this improvement. As a result, Guinean people are not better off in
  2010 than they were in 2005. Some efforts have been made with respect to inflation even
  though it remains in the 2 digits range as of 2010. Government revenue remains stable at
  16% of GDP while debt fell below 90% of GDP. All in all, Guinea has not managed to
  get out of the poverty trap.

3.      The evolution of the Guinean educational system is in line with its economy.
While the number of pupils in primary schools kept growing until 2008, this expansion
followed the population growth and the gross enrollment rate (GER) at primary level
remained constant at 77% over the last couple of years. A similar phenomenon took place
for secondary schools.

4.      The economic crisis hit the school system badly, flows of foreign aids were
stopped and the MDG targets of 100% primary school completion and gender parity are
now unfortunately out of reach for 2015. In 2006, education public spending was 1.7% of
GDP. This is equivalent to what better achieving neighboring countries spend on primary
education alone. To maintain schools, parents contribute to school budgets through their
association. This burden is proportionally much more important for poor families. In
such a context it is essential to achieve efficiency gains and fight inequality of access in
order to make the best of resource constraints.

C) Potential impact

5.      Education has an impact on a wide range of outcomes, from health and civic
behaviour to labor market success. Using the 2002 household survey, some analysis has
been carried out. Compared to non educated people, completing primary school increase
future income by 40% while those that graduate from secondary school double their
future wage. This investment is still worth making in Guinea once foregone income and
education cost are taken into account. Guinea is thus no exception to the wide array of
evidence that education matters for one’s individual personal wellbeing and one’s
country success. These benefits of education are mostly the consequence of skills
acquisition, whose process is directly related to school quality. As a result, improving
school quality would also increase Guinea’s future labor force.

6.      The set of measures that would be implemented through this project is intended to
put in place a modern management of teachers and should indeed affect schooling quality
more than average access rate. Its main intention is to do better with the same resources
leading to short and long term gains without necessarily expanding the resource base.

7.      One of the main consequences of this program is that incentives framing the work
of teachers would change. Economics of education literature states clearly that teachers
react to properly designed incentives. As an example, a paper by Duflo and Hanna7
shows that monitoring Indian teachers can drastically reduce absenteeism and thus
improve children attainments. Even if the reorganization of teacher management is in the
same spirit than the school level monitoring policies studied by Duflo and Hanna, it is
difficult to know how much teacher incentives would be affected and it is worth noting

that the proper implementation of the measures is of prime importance for the success of
this reorganization. Changing teachers’ ethics and behaviour is indeed only possible
when transparency and fairness is beyond reproach by their managers. If so, we can
expect that more controls and better defined responsibilities could develop teacher
commitment to their work. This could trigger two channels that would improve teaching
quality. Teachers would be less absent, increasing proportionally class time and thus
pupils’ achievement. Secondly, once their work is more recognized, they would give it
more value and increase their effort. If these efficiency gains are high enough to reduce
repetition rate (10% in the first year of primary school in 2005/2006), a second order
effect would happen thanks to a decrease in class size.

8.      While there is a lack of quantitative studies about the impact of incentives on
teacher management, some recent papers have analyzed teacher performance pay in
developed countries. Lavy8 found a high impact of such a policy on teacher efforts and
pupil’s achievement in Israel while Fryer’s evaluation of a different scheme in the US9
concluded that it was fruitless. As the efficiency of such a system seems to depend
heavily on its design, the randomized experiment that is to be implemented in order to
evaluate and decide on its introduction in Guinea is a sound investment and could set an
example for other countries. This change in incentives is also intended to make the
teaching position a better and more attractive employment in the long run. As a result, the
enforcement of a proper evaluation to select and evaluate teacher trainees’ competencies
at the completion of their training would allow the recruitment of better skilled and
competent teachers into the civil service.

9.     Finally, the most direct and observable impact of this program would be the
planned redeployment of teachers. It should soften unequal repartition of educational
resources across the country and thus decrease inequality of access. This impact would be
maintained in the long run by properly allocating new teachers. The success of this
measure would be a good sign for the longer term effects of a general change in teacher
management.

                        GUINEA: EDUCATION FOR ALL PROJECT

                     ANNEX 3: Impact Evaluation of teacher incentives

1.      Recent education research emphasizes the importance of teachers in realizing
student learning. However, it also shows that it is particularly difficult to link differences
in teacher quality to teacher characteristics on which data is typically available (Rivkin et
al. 2005, Aaronson et al. 2007). These results generated increased interest in the study of
mechanisms that may raise achievement through teachers such as the strengthening of
teacher incentives. The incentive pilot proposed in the context of the restructured project
in Guinea, namely a pilot of performance-based incentive scheme, follows this line of
thought in trying to improve education service delivery through better performing
teachers and in proposing to rigorously assess the impact of the scheme.

2.      Although the evaluation literature is relatively slim and highly diverse in terms of
methodology, targeted populations, and program structure, it is reported that
performance-based incentives almost always work to some extent, sometimes too well by
distorting teacher efforts toward socially unproductive activities such as ―teaching to the
test‖ or increasing inequality through selection effect. However, the evidence is not yet
robust to prescribe how good systems should be designed (e.g., optimal size of bonuses,
monetary or non-monetary nature of the incentives, mix of individual vs. group
incentives, interaction effect with complementary interventions, etc.) and current
knowledge draws heavily on experiences in developed countries and India with almost no
evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa. This therefore calls for more extensive pilot
programs, such as this one, prior to scale up.

3.      Within this project, the Government of Guinea will thus pilot a performance-
based scheme aiming to strengthen the effort and productivity of targeted teachers and, as
a result, to improve student learning outcomes. The pilot will target all 3rd and 4th grade
teachers belonging to a sample of selected schools. To inform a possible scale-up of this
scheme, this pilot will be assessed using rigorous impact evaluation methodology.

4.      Structure of the incentive scheme. Teachers’ performance level and the value of
the incentive will be determined on an individual basis.10 Each year, individual teacher
performance will be calculated on the basis of his/her value-added in student learning and
improvement in the quality of his/her lesson preparation and delivery. Value-added in
student learning will be measured by the annual gain in students’ average score on a
standardized test in Math and French. Within each sampled schools, all students of all 3rd
and 4th grade teachers will take the tests. Improvement in the preparation and delivery of
Math and French lessons will be measured by the gain in the evaluation scores attributed
during inspection visits. The overall performance indicator will be a weighted sum of the
value in the two sub-indicators described above.11 As important incentives will be

   Although this may reduce collaboration among teachers, the GOG considers this approach more relevant
in the Guinean context since it minimizes the likelihood of free riding and conflicts as a result of a school
incentive divided equally among all teachers without accounting for individual performances and because it
has been shown to be more effective than school-level incentives in other contexts (Muralidharan and
Sundararaman (2009).
11
   Weights will be 30% for the gain in inspection score and 70% for the valued-added in student learning)
                                                     27
introduced in the context of this pilot, mitigation measures will be introduced to reduce
the likelihood of potential distortions (i.e. behaviors that run counter to the objectives of
the program) such as teaching to the test, selection of best-performing students to
participate in the test, teacher selective effort in teaching, cheating, and collusion with
inspectors.

5.       The value of the incentive received by an individual teacher, whether monetary
or non-monetary, will depend only on his/her overall performance indicator (rather than
also accounting for other teachers’ performance).12 Above a pre-specified minimum
level, the value of the incentive will be positive and will increase for each additional
percentage point in the indicator. The minimum threshold will vary according to the
school’s socioeconomic context to compensate for environments where factors beyond
the teachers’ control can significantly affect student performance (e.g. low parents'
literacy rate, poor nutrition, etc.). The threshold and progression rate will be calibrated to
ensure the likelihood of receiving an incentive is neither too low nor too high. The
maximum value of the annual monetary award will be approximately of 300% of the
average monthly wage for primary school teachers. Non-monetary rewards will include
display of best-performing teachers name on an honors list posted in the community and
public ceremonies recognizing their contribution.

6.      As the only tangible intervention of such scheme lies in the eligibility to the
incentive, a comprehensive, well-designed, and carefully administered communication
campaign will be implemented at the start of each school year. Detailed information
regarding eligibility, performance indicators, nature and size of the rewards will be
communicated to targeted teachers (and their principals) using several communication
tools (e.g. pamphlets, maps, videos, posters, etc.) adapted to the local context.

7.      Impact Evaluation Design and Data Collection. Using a randomized control
approach, the impact evaluation will assess the effectiveness of the performance-based
incentive scheme in improving teacher effort and student learning and will compare the
appropriateness of the various programmatic options.

8.      Incentive theory and empirical evidence from experiments in private sectors
indicate that performance-based monetary rewards can increase workers productivity.
However, in tasks involving substantial pro-social components (i.e. producing positive
externalities for society) such as education, several studies also suggest that extrinsic
motivation (e.g. monetary rewards) can crowd out intrinsic motivation and thus lead to
reduced, rather than increased, efforts. Evidence to this effect in education are scarce and
thus the impact evaluation will assess the relative effectiveness of monetary and
recognition (aiming to heighten intrinsic motivation) rewards. Furthermore, given the
policy relevance of teacher training and the uncertainty regarding its interaction effect
with a performance-based incentive scheme, impacts of the two types of rewards will be

  This (piecewise) contract approach was selected as opposed to a tournament approach (making payment
relative to other teachers’ performance) because it is more transparent and reduces the temptation to adopt
some strategic behavior (e.g. collusion among teachers in order to share the premium without exerting
maximum effort) that can affect the learning of some students.
                                                    28
evaluated in conjunction with participation in a short content-focused in-service training
program.

9.         For this purpose, six groups of schools will be defined.
     (i)      Control: Teacher in these schools will not be eligible to incentive or in-service
              training.
     (ii)     Monetary incentive only: Teachers in these schools will only be eligible to
              performance-based monetary incentive.
     (iii)    Non-Monetary incentive only: Teachers in these schools will only be eligible
              to performance-based non-monetary (recognition) incentive.
     (iv)     Training: Teachers in these schools will only be eligible for short-term in-
              service training program (if they respond to training criteria).
     (v)      Monetary Incentive and Training: In addition to being eligible to the
              performance-based monetary incentive, teachers in these schools will also be
              eligible for a short-term in-service training program (if they respond to
              training criteria).
     (vi)     Non-monetary Incentive and Training: In addition to being eligible to the
              performance-based non-monetary (recognition) incentive, teachers in these
              schools will also be eligible for a short-term in-service training program.

10.      The sample of pilot schools will be representative of the teaching situation in
primary schools at the national level and allow for the evaluation of the different
programmatic options with sufficient statistical power. It will be drawn randomly,
stratifying on region, from the EMIS database managed by DGPSDE and will comprise
approximately 500 schools. Schools will thereafter be randomly assigned to one of the six
experimental groups to ensure comparability in their observable and unobservable
characteristics.

11.     To inform the evaluation, extensive data on schools (size, resources, interactions
with community, etc.), teachers (socioeconomic characteristics, qualifications and
experience, content and pedagogical knowledge, motivation, lesson preparation,
pedagogical strategies, attendance and in-class behaviors, demand for transfer to hardship
areas etc.) and students (socioeconomic characteristics, absenteeism, repetition rates, etc.)
will be collected in pilot schools through the administration of standardized tests for
students and teachers, questionnaires, classroom observations, and attendance tracking.

12.     Implementation Arrangements. Two committees, one focusing on conceptual
aspects related to the incentive scheme and one technical responsible for the evaluation,
were formed to oversee the implementation of the pilot and the associated impact
evaluation. The committees comprised representative from the IGE (Inspectorate General
of Education), CNCESE (Monitoring and Evaluation unit), DGPSDE (Planning and
Statistical unit), SNFPP (National Training service), and teachers unions. Data collection,
with the exception of inspections which will be managed by the IGE, will be managed by
the CNCESE with support from the DGPSDE. Distribution of the monetary incentive
will be managed by CN/PSE. The information campaign in participating schools will be
carried out by a consulting firm specializing in communication. Short-term in-service
training will be implemented in the context of the EFA FTI CF restructured project
(P111470).
