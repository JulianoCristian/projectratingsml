                         October 2008 jointly with the preparation of an additional financing in the amount of SDR6.4 million, and the second time was part of the restructuring in September 2011 following the
                         Bank’s re-engagement in Guinea after nearly two years of suspension. 100% of the AF grant of US $10 million has been disbursed as well as the full amount of the original credit (US
                         $70 million). The third component of the project was revised during the October 2011 restructuring and two new sub-components were added to support reforms related to human

                         US$37 million has been granted to Guinea to pursue the efforts made in basic education, tackling the issue of out-of-school children, as well as pursuing and deepening the efforts on
                         personnel management reforms, which were supported under this project.
