F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective was to establish a stable framework for good quality
universal primary education. This was to be done by: (i) implementation of specific policy
goals, including the abolition of primary school fees, decentralizing training and
recruitment of teachers, and lengthening of the school year; (ii) testing and reaching

                                                  vii
consensus on program initiatives to be implemented country-wide in subsequent phases
(decentralization of budget management, school-level choice of textbooks, use of national
languages, early childhood development); and (iii) reaching near-universal enrollment of
seven-year-old children in grade one.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
The     revised   project   development      objective    under      the    October     2008
Restructuring/Additional Financing was: to assist the Recipient in its efforts to improve the
conditions for teaching and learning in its territory, through (i) expanded access to
education, (ii) enhanced quality of learning, and (iii) strengthened capacity for
decentralized management of the sector.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal


1.      The Guinea Education for All (EFA) Project (P050046) was originally designed to
provide financing for the first phase of the Government’s Education for All (EFA) Program
(2001-2013). The first phase (of both the Project and the Government Program) was originally
planned for 2001 to 2005, with two subsequent four-year phases (Phases 3 and 4). Ultimately,
the EFA Project provided financing throughout the period from 2001 to 2013 though with
significant interruptions. In this context, the following section provides information on the
underlying country, sector and project context and key outcomes throughout the project life.

Country Background

2.      At the time of project appraisal in 2001, Guinea was considered a Low Income
Country under stress (LICUS) and a fragile state. Per capita income averaged US$540 and an
estimated 40 percent of the population was living below the poverty line. Since its
independence in 1958, Guinea had experienced a number of autocratic regimes characterized
by limited political and economic freedom. The country had a history of macro-economic
instability as well as a highly centralized and interventionist Government. Further, there were
high levels of corruption, many of the country’s instituations were weak and the economy was
highly vulnerable to external shocks given the country’s dependency on mineral exports.

3.      The period in which the EFA program was prepared was characterized by poor macro-
economic management and fiscal deficits, which worsened existing social tensions and
insecurity. In 2002, as a result of this, the country experienced reductions in donor aid and
loss of debt relief under the HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Countries) program. In the priority
social sectors, the Government was unable to meet its targets for spending. This situation had
further deteriorated by the time of the 2003 elections when President Conté was re-elected for
a third term. During this period, as a result of the political and economic instability in the
country, there were major disruptions in social services. In early 2007, the political situation
further deteriorated with major anti-government demonstrations and labor union strikes
(including teachers). This was followed by a military takeover in 2008 which established a 32-
member National Council for Democracy and Development (replacing the Government) and
suspended the country’s constitution as well as all political and union activity. These issues
combined with a loss of loss of control over government revenue and spending, rising inflation
and spiraling debt, contributed to fiscal instability. Education budgets consistently fell below
targets and counterpart funding was delayed, leading to a three-year suspension of engagement
by the Bank and other donors. The overall situation negatively affected the sustainability of
gains made in education, particularly in terms of access to education. 2

    For example, the primary gross enrollment rate stagnated over the period 2008-2010.

                                                          1
4.     After the presidential elections in January 2011, the changes in government provided a
more favorable environment for the donor community to reengage in the country and for the
Government to tackle sector issues, including that of teacher financing. By project closing,
the economic and political climate had improved from what it was at appraisal, although the
Ebola crisis has posed a significant challenge to maintaining the achievements observed in the
education sector.

Sector Background

5.      During the 1990s, in the context of two education sector adjustment programs
(Programme d’adjustement sectorial de l’éducation (PASE) 1 and 2) the Government had
placed a high priority on primary education and sustained growth in primary school
enrollment, particularly among girls. As a result, major improvements were observed in these
areas, although there remained a large gap between boys’ and girls’ enrollment. Substantial
gains were also observed in pre- and in-service teacher education and financing. Moreover, the
availability of textbooks had increased with the textbook: student ratio having increased from
1:20 in the mid-1990s to 1:1 by 1999. In addition, a number of reforms had been introduced
in the higher education sub-sector to enhance cost recovery, increase gender equity and
improve the labor market responsiveness of instructional programs.

6.     Some of the key issues facing the education sector at the time of project appraisal in
2001 included:

•   Access to basic education was still limited and there were significant disparities by
    geographic location (urban vs. rural), gender and socio-economic status.
•   Families faced high direct costs to access basic education, which included school fees and
    the cost of school uniforms and supplies and prevented many children from attending
    school.
•   Quality of education was inadequate reflected by low teacher competency, low student
    scores in learning assessments, and high repetition and dropout rates in primary schools.
•   Public financing of basic education was inadequate and uncertain. Schools did not
    receive any Government funding for operating costs while the plan to eliminate school
    fees risked further impoverishing schools of resources needed to operate.
•   The education sector and system was characterized by weak management and supervision
    capacity. These limitations were largely the result of deficient systems for monitoring
    information and training managers, which, in turn, hampered decision-making and
    accountability.
•   Low quality higher education faced growing pressure of increased enrollment. As enrollment
    rates were increasing at the primary and secondary levels, increased pressure was placed
    on tertiary education.

7.      A number of development partners (DPs) were providing support to the Government in
the education sector. However, this required significant donor coordination. At the time of
Project appraisal, PASE 2 was not yet closed and several parallel projects (notably financed by
the African Development Bank (AfDB), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische
Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID)) were supporting the sector with innovative
programs aimed at increasing girls’ primary enrollment and maintaining improvements in the
quality of teaching and learning at the classroom level. The development of a sector-wide
sustainable EFA strategy aimed to mainstream and coordinate such programs while
establishing quality of learning indicators. This new approach required all donors to
coordinate their efforts together with the Government in order to ensure consistency and
harmonization of activites that would lead to improvements in access to and quality of basic
education.

Project Context

8.      Prior to this Project, the Bank had financed a number of operations to support the
education sector. 3 The Bank’s decision to use an Adaptable Program Lending (APL)
instrument for this project was aligned with the Bank’s larger objective of supporting the EFA
agenda in the country and it was also a common approach used by the Bank at the time. This
project which was planned for the 2001-2005 period constituted what was expected to be the
“first phase” of a three-phase APL and was aligned with the first phase of the Government’s
program. 4 In this way, this Project was instrumental in further developing a sector wide
policy and a financing strategy, pursuing innovative quality enhancing strategies and
strengthening sector management.

9.      As described above, the Project was implemented over the same time period as the
Government’s EFA program (2001-2013) and provided support to the larger EFA program. At
the time, it was common practice within the Bank to embed the Bank-funded project within
the larger sectoral program. The following table provides an overview of some of the major
events which occurred in the country and the activities in the sector during this period.

  At the time of appraisal, several ongoing or recent projects were supporting or had supported improvements in
the quality of teaching and learning (NFQE), with an explicit focus on the development of reading and
communication skills. The Project sought to integrate these initiatives into future strategy to ensure basic literacy
and numeracy and to improve the overall quality of learning as measured by student performance and primary
school completion, in alignment with Millennium Development Goals for universal primary enrollment.
4
  The cover page of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) even indicates that this Project is “in support of the
first phase of the EFA Program”.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

10.     The original project development objective (PDO) as stated in the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) was “to assist the Borrower in its efforts to implement the first phase of its
Program, through the establishment of a sustainable framework for reaching high quality
universal primary education in its territory.” The PDO, as described in the PAD was similar,
to “establish a sustainable framework for good quality universal primary education.” The
PAD further indicates that “these objectives will be achieved by: (i) implementation of
specific policy goals including abolition of primary school fees, decentralized training and
recruitment of teachers, and lengthening of the school year; (ii) testing and reaching concensus
on program initiatives to be implemented country-wide in subsequent phases (decentralization
of budget management, school level choice of textbooks, use of national languages, early
childhood development, new reading programs); and (iii) reaching near-universal primary
enrollment of seven-year-old children in Grade 1”.

11.    There was limited distinction in the PAD or DCA in the identification of PDO- and
intermediate-level indicators. The PDO- and intermediate-level distinction is presented in
Annex 1 of the PAD and reflected in the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). The full list of
indicators as well as baseline values and targets can be found in Annex 10 to this report.

12.    Investments in activities intended to contribute to the attainment of the targets, and
ultimately the PDO, were organized into three component objectives by their expected
contribution to: (a) expanding access to education; (b) improving quality of education; and (c)
strengthening decentralized management. The indicators and associated targets included in the
DCA 5 (organized by project component) were:

Access to education
   • Initial enrollment rate will reach 90 percent by the 2004/05 school year from about 70
       percent in the 2000-01 school year; girls’ overall gross enrollment will increase from
       49 percent to 59 percent for the same periods
   • The number of children for whom the distance to the nearest primary school exceeds 3
       km will be reduced by 25 percent by 2004/2005
   • The percentage of children with access to a primary school offering a full six-grade
       primary school program will increase from 50 percent to 60 percent in urban areas and
       from 25 percent to 40 percent in rural areas in part through increase of multigrade
       schooling
   • The percentage of female students will increase from 10 percent of higher education
       enrollments to 25 percent by 2004/2005




5
  Following common practice, these indicators are taken from the DCA as it is the legally binding document for
the Bank operation. These indicators are referred to as “key performance indicators” with no distinction made
between PDO- and intermediate-level.

                                                       5
Quality of education
  • Textbook ratio reaches 1.5 books per primary school student and 3 per lower
       secondary school student will be reached by 2004/2005
  • Primary school grade repetition will drop from 28 percent in 1999/2000 to 20 percent
       in 2004/2005; the dropout rate will decrease from 8 percent to 6 percent for the same
       periods. For secondary, the repetition rate will drop from 30 percent to 22 percent for
       the same time periods
  • Average class size in primary schools will decrease from 49 in 2000/2001 to 48 by
       2004/2005
  • Average class size in lower secondary schools will decrease from 92 in 2000/2001 to 80
       by 2004/2005

Decentralized education management
   • The actual number of weekly hours taught by full-time lower secondary school
      teachers will increase from about 15 to 17 by 2004/2005
   • Education's share of the total budget will increase from 18.6 percent in 2000 to 21
      percent in 2005. Basic education's share will increase from 44 percent in 2000 to 49
      percent by 2005; secondary education's share, including vocational training, will
      remain onstant at 31 percent while higher education’s share will drop from 23 percent
      in 2000 to 20 percent by 2005
   • Decentralized development plans will be prepared and implemented in 30 prefectures
      by 2004-2005
   • The portion of the Ministry of Pre-University Education and Civic Education’s
      (Ministère de l'Enseignement Pré-Universitaire et de l'Education Civique (MEPU-
      EC)) non-salary operating budget administered by schools will increase to 40 percent
      by 2005

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

Revised PDO

13.     The Education for All (EFA) Project was approved on July 24, 2001 and became
effective on January 8, 2002. Funding was provided by an International Development
Association (IDA) credit (Cr.352-GUI) in the amount of SDR 55.7 (US$70 million
equivalent). 6 The original closing date was December 31, 2005. The Project was restructured
in 2005 (Level 2) following a mid-term review (MTR) and the closing date was extended for
two years to December 31, 2007 and again by one year to December 31, 2008. There was no
change to the PDO under the 2005 Restructuring.

14.    An Additional Financing (AF) grant in the amount of US$10 million was approved by
the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors under streamlined procedures in October 2008 with
an original closing date of December 31, 2009. Just prior to this, the closing date of the
original credit was also extended to close at the end of December 2009. The main purpose of


6
    The original USD equivalent was US$70 million. This change is due to exchange rate gains.

                                                         6
the AF was to provide deficit financing to the Government during a period of macro-economic
crisis. In the absence of a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, and given that this operation
was among the best performing projects in the portfolio, the EFA Project was deemed the
most appropriate project for rapidly channeling resources to help alleviate the fiscal pressure
while at the same time helping to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on teachers (by
providing funding for their salaries). Specifically, the AF would support the payment of
primary and secondary teacher salaries and incentives on time (for a period of two months)
and strengthen capabilities of those responsible for personnel management to effectively
perform their duties. The Ministry of Economy and Finance was the implementing agency for
the AF as payment of salaries fell under their mandate.

15.    At the time of the AF in 2008, a Restructuring was also undertaken which introduced
revisions to the original PDO. The modified PDO was “to assist the Recipient in its efforts to
improve the conditions for teaching and learning in its territory, through expanded access to
education, enhanced quality of learning, and strengthened capacity for decentralized
management of the sector.” The PDO was revised in order to ensure better alignment of stated
project objectives and project activities. More specifically, as activities supported under the
original Project went beyond primary education (and the AF was designed to provide support
to primary and secondary teachers), it was necessary to reflect this change in the PDO.

16.     Following the first tranche disbursement for teacher salary payments in under the AF
in November of 2008, a coup d’état occurred which was followed by a period of suspended
disbursements. During this time, both the original credit and AF closed as scheduled on
December 31, 2009. The Bank was one of the first donors to re-engage in the country in
September 2011 following the inauguration of the president in January of that year. At that
time, in 2011, the EFA Project was retroactively extended (to 2012, followed by an extension
to 2013) and the funds remaining under the original AF (approximately US$5 million) were
reactivated (thus becoming the restructured AF). A restructuring was also undertaken in 2011
(for the third time) and required Board approval under streamlined procedures. The remaining
funds were allocated to support activities to improve teacher management. The role of
implementing agency was returned to the MEPU-EC and the PDO was revised. The modified
PDO was “to assist the Recipient in its efforts to improve the conditions for teaching and
learning in its territory, through (i) expanded access to education, (ii) enhanced quality of
learning, and (iii) strengthened human resource management.” 7 The third sub-objective was
revised to be better aligned with project activities, particularly as the restructured AF focused
on human resource/personnel management.

Revised Key Indicators

17.      Under the three successive restructurings in 2005, 2008 and 2011, changes were
introduced to the Results Framework (RF) of the original EFA Project. 8 See Annex 10 for a
list of PDO-level indicators as revised in 2005, 2008 and 2011. In 2005, modifications to key


7
    The revised PDO is taken from the Amendment Letter to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) (2011).
8
    The fourth restructuring in 2013 did not include any revisions to the Results Framework (RF).

                                                       7
indicators and targets were minor. Revisions mainly aimed to modify target values to be
achieved from 2005 to 2007 and later to 2009, revising a few targets upward (e.g.,
textbook:student ratio) to reflect prioritization and re-allocation decisions following the MTR
and reducing the number of intermediate-level indicators (though a number of these were not
officially dropped until the 2011 Restructuring).

18.     In 2008, the revised RF consisted of some of the indicators of the original EFA Project
with the same targets (but with the expected date of target achievement extended one year, i.e.,
from 2008 to 2009). Some indicators were dropped because: (i) they had never been tracked;
and/or (ii) the target had not been achieved in the way expected. In addition, some targets
were reduced (in particular those related to financing); and a few PDO-level indicators were
added to the RF related to salary and non-salary expenditure that were relevant under the AF.
(See Annexes 2 and 10 for an overview of indicators and targets under the Project). To a
certain extent, the revisions introduced to the PDO under the 2008 Restructuring provided a
broader umbrella for capturing the large scope of activities supported under the original EFA
project which were not exclusively focused on primary education.

19.     Under the 2011 restructuring, a number of indicators were dropped from the RF (as
described in the PAD), primarily, those that had never been measured in ISRs and some
indicators were moved from PDO-level to intermediate-level. For the most part, the original
targets set for 2009 were retained with no further progress expected on targets that had already
been achieved (or were close to being achieved) with indicators relevant to the restructured
AF added to the RF.



1.4 Main Beneficiaries

20.     According to the PAD, the main beneficiaries of the original EFA Project were to be
the poorest prefectures and populations, primary school-aged children nationwide, teachers,
and illiterate adults. The number of beneficiaries targeted by the Project was not provided in
the PAD or DCA. Under the 2011 Restructuring, however, the number of direct beneficiaries
was estimated at 1.45 million which corresponded to the number of children enrolled in
primary education in 2010 in both private (400,000) and public schools (1.05 million).

1.5 Original Components

21.  The original EFA Project had three components and more than 30 related sub-
components as follows:

22.   Component 1: Expanding Access to Education (Appraisal: US$19.7 million; Actual
Expenditure: US$28.1 million 9). This Component aimed to increase enrollment in primary


9
  Actual expenditure for this Component is greater than the amount allocated under the original credit and
additional financing (AF) to exchange rate gains.

                                                     8
and neighborhood middle schools, with a focus on Grade 1 enrollment and with priority given
to under-served regions and hard-to-reach populations. Sub-components included: (a) primary
classroom construction; (b) renovation of primary schools; (c) construction of latrines and
wells; (d) emergency repairs; (e) maintenance; (f) construction and furnishing of
neighborhood middle schools; and (g) reconstruction and renovation of Teacher Training
Colleges (Ecole Normale des Instituteurs – ENIs). The Component also supported expansion
of access to early childhood, secondary, vocational and higher education, and to adult literacy
programs.

23.      Component 2: Improving Quality of Education (Appraisal: US$41.2 million;
Actual Expenditure: US$43.4 million). The objective of the Component was to support the
development and testing of strategies to improve teaching and learning. The focus was on
supporting teachers, schools, and community groups through classroom and school-level
initiatives aimed at ensuring that the teaching team had authority, knowledge, support and
learning materials to make meaningful decisions about how to improve learning for all. Sub-
components were: (a) early childhood development (ECD); (b) primary school improvement
program grants; (c) curriculum innovation and examination reform; (d) textbooks and reading
materials; (e) school health and nutrition program; (f) reduction of repetition and dropout; (g)
special needs education; (h) multi-grade teaching strategies; (i) secondary school improvement
program grants; (j) pre-service secondary school teacher education; (k) teaching of science
and technology; (1) adult literacy and non-formal education; (m) vocational and technical
education testing a dual-training approach; (n) pre- and in-service primary school teacher
education; (o) maintenance program for vocational training; (p) development of a university
central library; (q) higher education curriculum reform; (r) research and innovation facility;
and (s) upgrading of faculty.

24.    Component 3: Strengthening Capacity for Decentralized Management (Appraisal:
US$9.1 million; with Additional Financing: US$19.1 million; Actual Total Expenditure:
US$20.7). This Component aimed to improve management of the education system,
increasing responsibilities and resource availability at the school level to deliver high-quality
education services. Sub-components were: (a) personnel management; (b) policy monitoring,
information, and program evaluation; (c) financial management; and (d) sector administrative
capacity.
1.6 Revised Components

25.    The 2008 Restructuring that accompanied the AF introduced changes to Component 3 of
the EFA Project (Strengthen Capacity for Decentralized Management) in order to cover the
payment of teacher salaries. To this end, the following Sub-components were added to
Component 3: (a) Payment of salaries and incentives for teachers working in remote areas for
primary and secondary education personnel for November and December 2008; (b) Project
management; and (c) Costs of an audit and random spot checks to oversee salary payments.

26.    The 2011 Restructuring changed Component 3 to focus on human resource management.
This new component had two Sub-components: (a) enforcement of legal texts and review of
recruitment allocation and (re) deployment procedures to correspond to real needs; and (b)


                                                 9
implementation of a coherent data information system and introduction of merit/ performance-
based incentives.

1.7 Other significant changes

27.       The major adjustments in the EFA Project under the 2005 Restructuring were:
      •   Resources were strategically redirected from the construction of a central library
          (estimated at US$11.44 million) and the MEPU-EC central administrative building
          (estimated at US$7 million). This decision was based on an assessment that these
          activities were of relative less importance to the achievement of the PDO; and these
          buildings would have taken several years to construct (beyond the life of the Project). In
          place of a new university central library, the Project financed the renovation and
          upgrading of seven existing faculty libraries and the Project also used this reallocation of
          funds to support the provision of textbooks, secondary school constructions, teacher
          training institutions (ENI) constructions and rehabilitation, pre-service training of
          primary school teachers, reform of higher education programs, school health.
      •   Primary classroom construction was reduced by 25 percent due to slow absorptive
          capacity.
      •   Additional resources were allocated to the procurement and distribution of primary
          school textbooks and to the primary school grants program in order to scale up the
          activities and achieve higher targets.
      •   Technical and professional education support was dropped due to the withdrawal of GTZ
          funding and leadership.

28.     Other significant changes included:
      • A change in the implementing agency of the Project. Initially, it was the MEPU-EC.
        Under the AF (2008), it was the Ministry of Economy and Finance. When the Project
        was restructured in 2012, MEPU-EC was again the implementing agency; and
      • In 2011, the remaining AF resources were reallocated from the payment of teacher
        salaries to technical assistance (TA), goods and project management.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation and Design

29.    The Project’s focus on universal access to quality primary education was well-aligned
with key strategies and approaches in the sector. It was consistent with the focus of the CAS
(FY97) as the Project focused on expanding access to primary education, reducing the cost of
primary education to families, and improving the quality of primary education – together
providing important support, particularly to poorer households. The focus of the Project on
decentralizing resources and greater decision-making authority to de-concentrated levels of
management and to primary schools fit well with the country’s PRSP (2003) and the later CAS
(FY04-06) which placed decentralizing resources and decision-making authority to sub-national

                                                  10
levels and front line service providers as a central strategy to improve access to, and quality of,
basic social services (World Bank 2003). The Project’s focus on improving the quality of
education and learning at the primary level were highly relevant and the interventions in primary
education were designed and targeted to address major issues that were identified. Student
assessments prior to the Project had found low learning outcomes and a 2003 household survey
had shown a high level of dissatisfaction (66 percent) with the quality of education services. 10
The Project was also consistent with the MDGs. Moreover, the original EFA project design in
terms of its support of a sector-wide approach (with one plan for the entire education sector, the
Education Sector Plan or ESP) was very forward-thinking. At the same time, it added a level of
complexity to the Project to have each of the different interventions (with the involvement of
many different DPs) channeled through one Project.

30.     Lessons learned from previous projects were incorporated into the Project design. These
lessons, however, could have been explored more carefully and information from existing
evaluations incorporated more fully into the project design. Those lessons that may have been
better incorporated into the design pertained to school construction, textbooks and school health.
In school construction, for example, the previous IDA-financed project had tested a new strategy
using non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as Contract Management Agencies (“NGO-CMA
approach”) which had resulted in higher volume at a lower cost when compared with schools
constructed by the Ministry of Education. However, the ICR for that project pointed to important
weaknesses in coordination, contract management and quality control which needed to be
remedied and was highlighted as a cause of a two-year delay in finalizing the design and
agreeing upon an operational manual for school construction. These difficulties were also
experienced under this Project and delayed implementation after effectiveness. With regards to
textbooks, the same previous operation’s ICR also underscored important problematic issues
faced in the textbook system and noted that student access to textbooks had quickly deteriorated.
While this Project’s PAD did mention procurement and distribution problems, 11 it was assumed
that the delivery of textbooks would be implemented smoothly despite evidence to to the
contrary under the previous operation.

Quality at Entry

31.    The Project team staff had the relevant expertise to prepare and appraise this Project.
Project preparation was characterized by a high level of collaboration between the Bank and the
Government as this working relationship had been developed over the course of the previous
Bank-supported operations. The Project was also well-aligned with Government and Bank
objectives and targeted those issues which had been identified as key challenges. Though the
original project did not have a Quality at Entry review, a Quality of Supervision Assessment
(QSA) conducted in 2006 also assessed the quality of the Project’s design and Quality at Entry. 12
The QSA Panel noted some challenges in the Quality at Entry of the Project including the scope


10
   CWIQ survey 2003.
11
   For example, the PAD states that “the textbook rental system developed has been adopted nation-wide with
general success.” The ICR states that “the textbook rental system did not function” (p. 11)
12
   This ICR draws from and builds on that assessment based on issues encountered during implementation as
reflected in project documentation and information provided through interviews.

                                                     11
and complexity of the Project design and maintained that the project was supporting too many
activities (with too few resources), particularly in light of the weak capacity at the time.
Although the Ministries of Pre-University Education and Higher Education had successfully
implemented previous education projects, the EFA Project was significantly different –
representing a five-fold increase in IDA financing alone and intervening in all types and levels
of education.

32.     The demands placed on the Government, in terms of coordination, were significant as
project implementation required: (i) multi-ministerial collaboration in a context where Ministries
had little history of cross-collaboration; (ii) shared responsibilities (for implementation) across
various actors and levels (e.g., Government, NGOs and schools); and (iii) strong coordination
with and among donor partners) (World Bank 2006). Moreover, nearly all activities supported
under the EFA Project involved either undertaking/scaling up a pilot, or testing new strategies
(and often multiple strategies simultaneously). Such activities are often quite demanding on
capacity, particularly in areas of planning, monitoring and evaluation. Though the approach was
innovative and marked an important shift in assistance – the Project had not adequately prepared
for some of these difficulties. Further, a number of preparatory activities that were required for
smooth project implementation from the beginning (development of operational manuals,
procurement plans, and reporting formats) had not been completed by project effectiveness.
This ultimately posed a significant challenge to the timely implementation of activities during
the early years of the Project. In light of the information provided above, Quality at Entry is
rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

33.     It is useful to consider the EFA Project as having roughly three implementation periods
between calendar years: (i) July 2001- June 2005; (ii) July 2005-October 2008 (following the
MTR); and (iii) November 2008-December 2013. During the first implementation period, after
two years of implementation, 13 percent of the total credit amount had been disbursed. From
2003-2005, implementation picked up considerably and reached approximately 40 percent of the
original credit amount (not including the AF amount). Three factors which contributed to the
challenging start up included: (i) design, concept and project readiness (as described above); (ii)
the rapid turnover of World Bank team leadership (see Section 5.1); and (iii) the country’s fragile
political and economic context which also resulted in high staff turnover on the Government
side. Together, these issues delayed project implementation.

34.     The MTR and subsequent restructuring in 2005, however, contributed to an increase in
the pace of implementation and disbursements. In addition to the restructuring, the increased
staff continuity beginning around this time was fundamental to the observed turn around. During
the period from 2005 to 2009, progress was made on a number of activities, including: provision
of primary school improvement program grants; updating of secondary school curricula;
provision of textbooks to students in Grades 1 through 5; improvements and provision of
material and training in multigrade teaching; and pre-service and in-service primary school
teacher education and training.




                                                12
35.     Despite these achievements, the country’s fragile and shifting political and economic
context had important implications for the timely implementation of the Project as Government
commitment to the project wavered. Early in the project life, the poor macroeconomic
management and fiscal slippages that had begun in late 1999 persisted and in the period leading
up to the 2003 elections, macroeconomic and fiscal management continued to deteriorate. These
issues combined with political, social and security tensions and in turn the cessation of the HIPC
interim debt relief provisions and reductions in donor aid made the situation even more difficult.
Following the military takeover (coup d’état) in 2008, the political situation worsened with a loss
of control over government revenue and spending, rising inflation, spiraling debt, rising
insecurity and social tensions, deterioration of public institutions and infrastructure, and
increasing poverty rates. The macro-economic, political and social context only improved
considerably following the presidential elections in January 2011.

36.     The political and economic situation described above affected Project implementation
and achievement of objectives in the following ways: (i) education budgets fell consistently
below targets and counterpart funding was delayed which extended implementation and
completion of some activities (in particular those related to construction); and (ii) following the
military takeover in 2008 and non payment of arrears, the Bank suspended its operations as did
other donors which, in turn, threatened the sustainability of project achievements. 13 At the same
time, the abovementioned changes in Government in 2011 resulted in a greater willingness
within the Government to and more favorable environment for an increased pace of project
implementation. It also fostered the Government’s willingness to tackle some key issues such as
higher education reform and teacher management issues which had previously struggled to gain
traction.

37.     Despite the difficulties faced, the Project was able to accomplish a number of important
outputs and outcomes in the sector. The Government was able to foster greater coordination
among DPs thus having a positive impact on the sector. Under the Project, among others,
progress was made on the following: modernization of science laboratories; implementation of a
research fund; upgrading of faculty through twinning partnerships; continuing to implement
adult literacy programs with NGOs as operating agencies; and continuing to ensure
implementation of the ECD national strategy and ensuring that community preschool centers
remained operational. Moreover, a new approach for the implementation of primary school
construction (requiring the use of three different methods/approaches) was adopted by the
Government under this Project. Despite significant delays, this approach was essential in
completing the high volume of primary school construction planned under the Project and could
not have been achieved using the traditional method of Ministry-executed construction. Further,
over time and as a result of annual reviews of the implementation of school construction,
implementation issues (that could have been bottlenecks to timely and effective implementation
of the construction program such as irregular site supervision, quality control and contract
management) were identified in a timely manner and measures were put in place to address these
(e.g., strengthening supervision capacity of the concerned Ministry, developing contract
management tools, etc.)



13
     See Footnote 2.

                                                13
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38.     The original RF had a number of strengths, among them: (i) the inclusion of relevant
measures to assess progress in achievement of outputs and outcomes and specifically; and (ii)
the indicators selected could, for the most part, be easily captured by the existing data collection
and processing systems (e.g., learning assessments and the Ministry’s Education Management
Information System (EMIS)). These data collection systems were also further strengthened
under the Project. Despite these strengths, there were some shortcomings wherein the RF did not
fully capture achievements related to project investments across various types and levels of
education (particularly those related to strengthening decentralized management) nor did it
clearly differentiate PDO-level (outcome) indicators from intermediate-level (output) indicators.

39.      The 2005 Restructuring modified the PDO to focus increasingly on supporting the
establishment of a framework for reaching high quality universal primary education. Despite this
important shift, however, the Project and its RF (output and outcome measures) continued to
focus on all levels of the education system. The number of indicators was reduced and the RF
simplified (e.g., looking at a reduction in the average primary school class size instead of a
reduction in both primary and secondary school) as presented in the 2005 Restructuring
documentation (though these indicators were only officially dropped under the 2011
Restructuring). The 2008 Restructuring/AF further simplified the RF and adjusted indicator
baseline values using updated population data and adjusted targets based on an assessment of
what could be realistically accomplished by the Project’s closing date. Additionally, other
indicators despite their limited relevance (and that they were highly influenced by exogenous
variables, i.e. proportion of spending on secondary/TVET remains constant) were maintained in
the RF. It was only, however, under the 2011 Restructuring that the comprehensive RF was
presented, providing rationale for modifications and omission of specific indicators. This may
have reflected a shift in the Bank’s approach to ensure indicators in project documentation (e.g.,
DCA, PAD, ISRs, etc.) were aligned in contrast to an approach where restructuring primarily
focused on addressing and describing any changes needed in PDO-level indicators. Though this
marked a positive shift and provided significant clarification, a number of intermediate-level
indicators that may have been dropped or further modified prior to this time remained in the RF
(e.g., share of education budget indicators). 14

40.     Although the Project’s M&E system relied on Government systems, it did not fully
incorporate/utilize evaluations of key programs and pilots to improve project performance. More
specifically, while the evaluations undertaken were able to identify issues and corrective
measures during implementation, these assessments were not designed to measure the impact or
cost-effectiveness of the interventions on access and learning outcomes to inform decisions
related to scaling-up the intervention or to inform shifts in strategy. This limitation was partially
addressed during implementation on an as-needed basis (e.g., conducting an audit of the textbook
component, spot-checks of the school grants program, and evaluations of specific activities
including school book corners and the adult literacy program). Two interventions that would


14
  Although these indicators are important to track as they provide an indication of the aligment between sector goals
and sector financing, these performance measures are unlikely to be greatly influenced by the interventions and
activities supported under the Project.

                                                        14
have benefited from scale up include the school de-worming and micronutrient pilot and the
school grants program as they could have provided a ready setting for an assessment of impact
on the access outcomes. The school grants were ultimately scaled up in 2009 under the current
Global Partnership for Education Project (formerly called EFA FTI Catalytic Fund) which is
closing on December 31, 2014.

41.     Under the original AF, M&E provisions included a third party audit of teacher salary
payments and social accountability measures involving parents in the verification of teachers
employed at the local school. A third party audit was conducted, and some social accountability
measures were implemented such as the information on teachers paid for a first month under the
AF was made available at the school level. Under the restructured AF, tools were introduced and
operationalized to involve parents and local stakeholders in the monitoring of teacher presence,
as well as the system of managing and tracking of textbooks.

42.     In light of the information provided above, the M&E design/utilization is rated Modest.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Fiduciary Compliance

43.     Fiduciary Compliance under Original Credit. Under the original credit, fiduciary
compliance was largely Satisfactory. There were no major issued related to the accounting
systems use, preparation of financial statements, adherence to auditing requirements,
qualifications of accounting personnel. Only during one period (in 2003/2004) did the FM
performance rating drop to Unsatisfactory due to personnel changes. 15 However, within the
following year, an FM assessment concluded that accounting personnel were sufficiently
qualified and experienced; the accounting software being used was adequate; and training (and
manuals) had been provided to management at the decentralized levels for the management of
funds accessible to them. In addition, the FM assessment envisaged the use of project
management reports–based disbursements in the future. Audit reports were (with one exception)
submitted on time and none were qualified. Beginning in 2005, to monitor implementation,
separate spot checks were conducted on specific project activities, such as textbooks, and school
and decentralized grants. Though minor issues did surface during project implementaiton, they
were addressed promptly. Sustained FM support provided by the Bank contributed significantly
to the overall satisfactory FM performance of this complex project.

44.     Fiduciary Compliance under Additional Financing. Under the 2010 AF, fiduciary
compliance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating is based on the 2009 audit report
which was qualified. The report identified accountability issues and undocumented expenditure
of US$215,000. Further, the Ministry of Economy and Finance was delayed in its response to
this finding. It is important to highlight however that in 2011 the Government refunded this
amount in full when the Bank re-engaged in the country (following a period of suspension of


15
  The radical drop in rating was explained by a change in project management staffing without prior consultation,
uncertainty of Bank staff regarding the qualifications of the new accountants, and delay in implementation of Bank
supervision recommendations.

                                                       15
activities as a result of the fragile political context and non arrears payment to the Bank).
Following the restructuring of the AF in 2011 where FM responsibility was shifted to the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) of the MEPU-EC (which had managed the original credit),
performance was rated Moderately Satisfactory by Bank supervision missions.

Procurement Compliance

45.    Under the original EFA project, procurement compliance varied under the two
implementation periods (pre- vs. post-MTR). During the first two years of the Project, all major
procurement activities were delayed as the Project was not sufficiently ready for
implementation, there was weak procurement capacity, and there was frequent staff turnover.
Although procurement under the Project was considered a moderate risk, the scope and volume
of procurement was significantly greater than that in the previous IDA-financed project. 16 The
procurement activities necessitated more technical expertise which was a challenge given the
limited institutional capacity and required strong coordination of the numerous units and the
three Ministries involved. Further, the processes related to planning, document preparation,
evaluating offers, and systems for contract management were not fully in place and took time
and effort to establish. Multiple changes in Bank TTLs, and insufficient technical support in the
country office, 17 resulted in long delays in terms of providing feedback to the Client and issuing
no-objections. 18 Together, these issues caused significant delays, higher prices than otherwise
would have been obtained, and the use of inappropriate processes and methods triggering
cancellation and re-launching of large procurements of anthelmintic rugs, micro-nutrients and
textbooks. 19

46.     Beginning in late 2004, the Bank took the necessary steps to address these
aforementioned issues by intensifying procurement support and training (e.g., through clinics
offered at the country office) and closely monitored the procurement schedule. Both the Bank
and the Borrower reported on the status of procurement on a monthly basis – a practice that was
maintained for a number of years. The combination of intensive training, support, follow up and
staff continuity significantly boosted capacity, implementation and the quality and reliability of
procurement processes. As a result, from 2006 to project closing, procurement was consistently
rated Moderately Satisfactory. All contracts were awarded in accordance with the FA while
adhering to the processes as laid out in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The


16
   Requirements included, inter alia, the purchase of library books, science kits, and other goods for different levels
of administration and types of education institutions (early childhood centers, primary schools, secondary schools,
technical and vocational schools, higher education each with their own specificities); the purchase and distribution
of millions of primary and secondary textbooks, and teaching and learning materials for literacy classes and early
childhood education; the purchase and delivery of anti-helmith drugs and micro-nutrients; construction of primary
and secondary schools and classrooms through contracts with NGOs, and major civil works projects (a central
university library and Ministry building).
17
   World Bank, 2006.
18
   During transitions among TTLs, several months of procurement documents were lost. In February 2003, the
Minister of Pre-University Education brought the backlog of non-objections to the attention of the Country Director.
19
   The drug and micro-nutrient procurement cancellation was due to major modifications to bid documents after
receipt of the Bank’s non-objection and lack of respect of bidder confidentiality. To address the problem, the Bank
suggested and approved direct purchase from the World Health Organization.


                                                         16
timeliness of the processes and contract management, however, remained somewhat weak
throughout implementation. Though the original AF involved no procurement, the restructured
AF included some procurement activities related to small goods purchases (e.g., computers and
motorcycles) and consultants – required processes in which the Project Coordination Unit had
prior experience and was successful in implementing these. Supervision reports rated
procurement performance as Moderately Satisfactory.

Environmental Safeguards

47.     Given the construction of schools, latrines and water supplies planned under the
operation, the original EFA Project triggered the Environmental Assessment Operational
Policies (OP 4.01) with a Category B rating. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
(ESIA) was carried out to assess the Project’s environmental and social risks and impacts prior
to Board approval. An Environmental and Social safeguards audit conducted in January 2014
concluded that the size and nature of infrastructure works carried out under the Project did not
have any significant negative biophysical or socioeconomic impacts and did not result in the
relocation of populations, loss of livelihood, or access to economic assets of populations.
Additionally, there were no objections or counterclaims related to the allocation of land for
schools during the life of the project. 20

2.3 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

48.     A post-completion IDA-financed operation to support further improvements in access
and quality in basic education or in the form of support for a sector-wide program is not planned
in the CAS for the period from FY14 to FY17. The planned portfolio in education includes the
Stepping Up Skills Project (FY 2015, US$20.0 million) and higher education (FY 2017, US$12
million) projects which are aligned with the CAS objective of strengthening human capital for
growth and youth employability. The absence of IDA financing for basic education reflects a
strategic decision on the part of the Bank as the GPE has agreed to support a US$38 million
project which should become effective in early 2015. Although the Government remains
committed to supporting the education sub-sector, the recent Ebola outbreak has (and is expected
to continue to have) a negative impact on the country’s ability to provide financial and human
resource support to all of the social sectors.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

49.    The PDO of the original project – to establish a sustainable framework for good quality
universal primary education – was relevant to the Guinean context at the time of project
appraisal and the overarching Government strategy for the sub-sector which aimed to improve
access to, and quality of, education in the country. More generally, the Project provided an
important opportunity to strengthen coordination and harmonization among donors committed to
supporting the Government in implementing its Education Sector Plan (ESP) and further


20
     Audit report (2014) prepared for the MEPU-EC.

                                                     17
strengthening its capacity to lead this effort. It was also aligned with Bank strategy for
education in Africa, more generally, and the Bank’s support to Guinea. The PDO was revised in
2008 to explicitly highlight the Project’s aims in terms of improving access, quality and
management capacity in the education sector. The third revision to the PDO in 2011 introduced
a small modification to reflect the Project’s support for human resources management. The
objectives of the project remain highly relevant today as the Government continues to emphasize
the importance of increasing access and quality of education as well as the need for strong
management in the sector.

50.     Although the PDO and the revised PDOs were relevant in the Guinean context – the
original PDO wording was narrower than the large array of activities supported by the Project.
For example, while the original PDO focused on establishing a sustainable framework for
primary education – the Project supported a large number of activities at various levels of the
sector (ranging from early childhood development (ECD) to higher education). Though these
activities went far beyond primary education – the reach of the project was more evident in the
project components than in the PDO itself (the components included: (i) expanding access; (ii)
improving quality; and (iii) strengthening capacity for decentralized management). As such, the
stated PDO was relevant – but the project interventions went beyond primary education. This
approach on the ground was consistent with the Bank’s strategic and corporate objective of
supporting the Government implement its ESP and strengthening harmonization within the
sector. In 2008, though the PDO was revised to explicitly include the objectives of “expanding
access, improving quality and strengthening capacity” – the thrust of the Project (and activities)
became more focused on primary education (while still focusing on elements of secondary and
higher education). When the PDO was revised in 2011, it was adjusted to reflect the increased
focus on human resources management. The relevance of the objectives under the Project is
rated Substantial during the entire life of the Project.

51.     The original project design in support of a sector-wide approach (with one plan for the
entire sector to be supported by all donors to the sector) was highly innovative. However, it did
add some complexity as each intervention in the sector (supported by various partners) was
channeled through this one Project. As a result of this design, donor collaboration was
strengthened, the Government was able to play a stronger leadership role, and harmonization of
activities was strengthened. These achievements still characterize project implementation and
preparation as well as sector dialogue and coordination among DPs today. Although the project
was well-aligned with larger objectives of the Government and other DPs and provided support
to priority areas, the scope and complexity of the original project seems to have been overly
ambitious particularly given the weak and shifting political/economic climate in which the
Project was to be implemented. The original design, for example, presupposed a high level of
inter-Ministerial coordination which had not been tested prior to the implementation of this
Project. Moreover, a large number of activities supported under the Project involved either
undertaking or scaling up a pilot or testing new strategies, all of which take time. In light of this,
the relevance of the original design is rated Modest.

52.     The first restructuring in 2005 extended the life of the Project to allow more time for
completion of project activities, including the construction of classrooms, provision of block
grants and support to ENIs. The 2005 Restructuring also introduced modifications to the PDO as

                                                 18
described above in order to reflect the greater reach of activities under the Project. The AF,
approved in 2008, was relevant and timely given that it was provided quickly and addressed a
major need of the Government at the time. Further, the swift restructuring of the AF allowed for
quick re-engagement of the Bank in the country – making the institution one of the first
responders to the sector in Guinea following this period of disengagement. The design of the
restructured AF (2011) was also appropriate given the Government’s strong commitment at the
time to giving even greater support to capacity building and human resources management.
Some of the components and activities focused on areas which had gained increased importance
in the Government’s strategic agenda, including: introducing more effective methods of
managing teacher recruitment and deployment; establishing information systems and tools; and
providing training. The relevance of the revised design is, therefore, rated Substantial.

53.    Across the life of the Project, its overall project design did not change significantly in
terms of the overarching objectives it sought to achieve. Most of the activities supported under
the Project continue to be prioritized by the Government and donor community today. For
instance, the decentralization of resources and decision-making (e.g., the use of school
management committees (SMCs) in the school management process) is still in practice today.
Some of these project-supported activites have been recognized as good practice. A 2008 World
Bank report on decentralization in Guinea, for instance, has cited the school grants program as a
good approach to empower school-level management and decision-making.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

54.    This section analyzes the achievements of the Project in relation to both the original PDO
and revised PDOs and associated indicators argets. The overall outcome rating is weighted
based on the portion of the net credit amount disbursed during each of the project
implementation periods (Period 1: July 2001- June 2005; Period 2: July 2005- October 2008;
Period 3: November 2008 to December 2013). The third period includes the fourth restructuring
which occurred in June 2013 which extended the project closing date by six months to
December 31, 2013. 21

Period 1: July 2001- June 2005

55.     The Project supported the following activities during the first period of the Project: (i)
provision of textbooks to primary school students; (ii) training and teachers’ guides and learning
materials to teachers; (iii) increased pedagogical support for newly trained primary school
teachers; (iv) decentralization of planning and reinforcement of program coordination
mechanism and policy reforms related to this as well as hiring of contractual teachers; (v)
revisions to curricula; (vi) evaluation of initiatives (including the school improvement project);
(vii) ECD activities; (viii) purchase of medicine and micro-nutrients for primary school children;
(ix) efforts to reduce repetition rates; and (x) the launch of rehabilitation of teacher training
colleges (ENIs)



21
  The last restructuring which was approved on June 24, 2013 did not change the PDO or indicators/targets; it only
extended the project’s closing date.

                                                       19
56.    During the first period of the project (from July 2001 to June 2005), progress made on
each of the PDO-level indicators was as follows 22: (i) the initial enrollment rate for grade 1 had
increased from 70 percent to 86 percent; (ii) girls’ gross enrollment rate had increased from 51
percent to 70 percent; (iii) the average class size of primary schools had decreased from 50 to
42.6 students per class; and (iv) repetition rates in primary education had decreased from 28 to
10 and dropout rates from 8 to 6 percent; and repetition rates in lower secondary had decreased
from 23 to 13.4 percent (the target had been specified for secondary, not lower secondary). The
number of textbooks per primary school student, on the other hand, worsened from 1 to 0.3 and
presented a strong case for more support in this area. The data for the following indicators were
not available: Grade 4 standardized scores in French; average class size in secondary school;
percent of children (percent children in pedagogie convergente classrooms) reading at an
acceptable degree of fluency after 2 years of schooling; and number of decentralized
development plans prepared and implemented.

57.     In terms of intermediate-level indicators, progress on each of the indicators was as
follows: (i) 400 schools had been constructed; (ii) 2,732 schools were offering a full six cycle
program and 1,136 multigrade schools were functioning in rural areas 23; (iii) the number of
female students enrolled in higher education had increased from 10 percent to 14 percent; (iv)
education’s total share of the budget had increased from 18.6 percent to 24.6 percent; (v) basic
education’s share of the education budget had increased from 44 percent to 46 percent; (vi)
secondary education’s share (including vocational training) decreased to 29 percent; (vii) higher
education’s share of the education budget increased from 23 percent to 24 percent; (viii) 2000
PAREEG 24 proposals were approved (and were in various stages of implementation (covering
8,600 teachers); and (ix) 300 DPSPs 25 were trained in administrative and pedagogic leadership.
Data for the following indicators were not available: number of children for whom the distance
from home to the nearest primary schools exceeds 3 km; actual number of weekly hours taught
by full time lower secondary teachers; and portion of MEPU-EC’s non-salary operating budget
administered by schools.

58.      Some progress was achieved in the project activities (i) the abolition of tuition fees in
2001; (ii) the decentralized recruitment of teachers at the sub-regional level based on national
quotas even if the final authorization was granted at the central level by the Education Ministry;
(iii) the decentralized pre-service training at regional level in teacher's colleges (ENIs) with an
increased level of autonomy; (iv) the testing of many program initiatives on teaching and
learning (school management, PAREEG program, reading initiatives, etc.) particularly in
primary education; and (v) the devolution of planning and budgeting functions at the regional
and sub-regional levels.




22
   For indicators (i) and (ii) the baseline values were recalculated under the 2008 Restructuring using updated
population data. As such, the figures reported here are the revised baseline values.
23
   The original indicator is expressed as a percentage; however, in 2005 the value documented was in number of
schools and multi-grade schools.

59.     However, a number of reforms were not enforced because they were not adopted (or
deemed relevant) to the context and needed additional time to build necessary consensus for
their implementation. This was the case in terms of reforms related to the implementation of
school-level decision making related to choice of textbooks, the use of national languages in
schools (the official policy continues to call for the use of French as the language of instruction),
and the lengthening of the school year. Given that some of these aforementioned areas were
explicitly mentioned in the PDO, these shortcomings are quite significant. Further, limited
progress was made in personnel management and decentralization and the impact of the
decentralization of the education budget was also limited due to the overall lack of funding for
non-salary education expenditures. Further, a lack of public financing hampered efforts to
decentralize the budget execution which undermined the actual devolution of planning and
budgeting functions to the local level. In addition, during this period, limited progress was made
on the establishment of a regional personnel database and the preparation of an MTEF.

Period 2: July 2005-October 2008

60.     The Project continued many of the activities launched under the Project’s first period
while it also supported: (i) revisions to the national education policy; (ii) the preparation of an
eduction sector MTEF; (iii) comprehensive student testing in math and French; (iv) technical
assistance and block grants to schools: (v) empowerment of school management committees;
(vi) donor coordination and formal approval of various key documents (manual of procedures
for the ESP, education sector MTEF, matrix of key results indicators); and (vii) efforts to reduce
ghost teachers on payroll. In addition, the Project also supported: (viii) an audit of contract
teachers; (ix) reinforcement of the HR directorate’s logistic capacity (computers and furniture);
(x) establishment of a personnel database for teachers instrumental for the implementation of the
AF; and (xi) training of HR staff abroad.

61.    During the second period of the project (July 2005- October 2008), performance on each
of the PDO-level indicators 26 was as follows: (i) initial enrollment rate had reached 82
percent 27; (ii) girls’ gross enrollment rate had increased from 70 percent to 71 percent; (iii)
primary school completion rate had increased from 36 percent to 52 percent; (iv) Grade 4
standardized scores for French increased from 39 (baseline) to 40.6; (v) textbook ratio in
primary school (textbooks per student) had increased from 0.3 to 4.0; (vi) average class size in
primary school had increased slightly from 42.6 to 44 students; (vii) repetition rate for primary
had decreased from 10 percent to 9.1 percent but had increased for secondary from 13.4 to 18.4;
and (viii) decentralized development plans had been prepared and implemented in 10
prefectures. 28




26
   For indicators (i) and (ii), the baseline values had been adjusted from 60 percent to 70 percent and from 49 percent
to 51 percent, respectively, based on updated population data.
27
   Under the 2008 Restructuring, new population data were used to revise the original baseline value from 60% to
70% and the target was also modified from 90% to 83%.
28
   Data for the indicator on number of children in Grade 4 who could read in French at a satisfactory level as
assessed by student testing deemed acceptable based on international standards for student achievement test were
not available.

                                                         21
62.    Performance under each of the intermediate-level indicators was as follows: (i) 85
percent of children in rural areas had access to a primary school offering a full six-grade
program; (ii) education’s total share of the budget had decreased from 18.6 percent to 16
percent; (iii) basic education’s share of the education budget had decreased from 46 percent to
36.2 percent; (iv) secondary education’s share of education budget was maintained at 31 percent;
and (v) higher education’s share of the education budget had increased from 24 percent to 32.8
percent. 29

Period 3: November 2008 to December 2013

63.      During the third period, the AF became effective. As of early 2009, the large majority of
the original credit financing had been disbursed with most activities completed except for the
construction of seven middle schools. In addition to the activities initiated in the previous two
periods, during this period there was: (i) continued emphasis on addressing payroll issues
(removing ghost teachers); (ii) the introduction of new incentive strategies for teachers; and (iii)
the payment of teachers’ one-month salary. The Project and the AF closed at this time as
scheduled on December 31, 2009 (during the period of the Bank’s formal disengagement). In
2011, the Project was restructured – with both the original credit and AF retroactively extended
to June 30, 2013. Under the restructured project there was an increased focus on human
resources management and efforts were undertaken to: (i) support organizational management;
(ii) strengthen management procedures; and (iii) further fortify IT systems.

64.     During this period, performance on each of the PDO-level indicators was as follows: (i)
the initial enrollment rate for grade 1 increased from 82 percent to 85 percent; (ii) girls’ primary
gross enrollment increased from 71 percent to 75 percent; (iii) primary completion rate had
increased from 52 percent to 59 percent; (iv) grade 4 standardized scores had increased from
40.6 to 41.2; (v) textbook to student ratio reduced from 4 to 3 for primary (new textbooks were
delivered under the GPE project in 2014); (vi) average class size in primary school had increased
from 44 to 46; (vii) 47.6 percent of children could read at least 50 out of 100 as assessed by
student testing on international standards for achievement test 30; (viii) number of decentralized
development plans increased from 10 to 38; (ix) proportion of non-salary recurrent education
expenditure for pre-university education had increased from 10 percent to 15.8 percent; (x) 100
percent of teachers were deployed based on the new personnel movement scale; and (xi) the
number of project beneficiaries reached 1,599,839 (of which 50 percent were female). 31




29
   Data for the following indicators were not available: construction of classrooms; number of children for whom the
distance from home to the nearest primary schools exceeds 3 km; percent of female students enrolled in higher
education; actual number of weekly hours taught by full time lower secondary teachers; portion of MEPU-EC’s non-
salary operating budget administered by schools; approval and implementation of PAREEG proposals (in number
of schools, covering number of teachers); number of teacher candidates graduating from ENI; number of PARPES
proposals approved and in schools; and number of DPSP trained in pedagogic leadership.
30
   Baseline value for this indicator is not available.
31
   Indicator on portion of target primary and secondary education personnel receiving full payment no later than 8
days after the end of each month was introduced in 2008 Restructuring and dropped in the 2011 Restructuring.
Timeliness was no longer an issue.

                                                        22
65.     Also during this period, the progress under each of the intermediate-level indicators was
as follows: (i) 1,120 classrooms had been constructed; (ii) percentage of females enrolled in
higher education was 25.6 percent (as of 2011); (iii) ratio of teachers trained annually versus
annually determined need for additional teachers was 88; (iv) 8,652 teachers were recruited into
the primary education system; (v) 8,704,582 textbooks (of which 7,165,134 were for primary
schools and 1,539,448 were for secondary schools) had been distributed; (vi) education’s share
of the total budget was 19 percent; (vii) basic education’s share of the education budget was 43
percent; (viii) secondary education’s share of the education budget was 23 percent; (ix) higher
education’s share of the education budget was 34 percent; (x) three audits had been conducted to
verify presence of teachers; and (xi) an impact evaluation of teacher incentives had been
completed.

3.3 Efficiency

Efficiency of implementation

66.     Over the life of the Project, implementation was rated Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory, and
Moderately Satisfactory at different points depending on counterparts’ involvement and political
context. The first two years of project implementation were slow. The time needed for
completion of some prerequisites was intially underestimated. After 2003, the implementation
process was accelerated with enhanced Bank involvement and greater commitment on the side
of the Borrower. Implementation arrangements were designed to ensure autonomy for each of
the five Ministries of Education. Over the project period, the school system has gained more
school buildings and textbooks, solid basis for decentralized management, schools involved in
small projects, solid grounds for efficient and transparent teacher management, school data, and
learning outcome assessment. Under the quality component, many actions were undertaken
opening potential opportunities towards reaching higher levels of education quality. The
restructuring of the AF in 2011 is an example of how critical reforms related to personnel
management, for example, can be successfully implemented when guided by strong leadership
and when responsibility is given to existing structures instead of a parallel project
implementation unit (which were more the norm than the exception during the early 2000s).




                                               23
Efficiency

67.     Primary school construction. On average, the cost per classroom built is estimated at
US$11,300, or 26 percent higher than the appraisal estimate of US$9,000. However, this unit
cost for a primary classroom is very much in alignment with the unit cost in other countries, and
is in fact more cost-effective than other countries which have completed classroom construction
during the same time period. The average cost of a primary classroom in Ghana for instance is
estimated to be US$16,651. 32 In Sudan (another conflict-affected country), the average cost of a
primary classroom is estimated to be as high as US$30,000. 33 This fact points to the likelihood
that the original unit cost estimate for classroom construction at appraisal was underestimated –
and these comparable unit costs indicate that the Project was relatively efficient in this
particularly activity.

68.     Primary School Textbooks. Combined, the EFA and AfDB projects financed the
purchase of 8.4 million primary textbooks over the period 2003-2007 which assumed a life span
of three to four years after which time the stock is replaced. The Project provided textbooks at an
average unit cost for primary school core subject in the amount of US$1.4. This is much in line
with projects realized during the same time period in Cote d’Ivoire, Burundi, and Niger where
primary textbooks were acquired for between US$1.1 and US$1.4. For middle schools, the
average unit cost per textbooks was US$1.9. This compares also relatively well with other
countries, which have realized related projects during this period.

External efficiency

69.    Overall, higher levels of education are associated with higher earnings. Estimates from a
2012 household survey show that in wage employment, compared to no education category,
attainment of some primary education increases individual average monthly earnings by 37
percent compared with individuals with no education. The corresponding figures for completed
primary, completed lower secondary, completed upper secondary, and post-secondary education
are 61 percent, 88 percent, 100 percent and 136 percent, respectively (refer to Annex 3).

70.    Household survey results show high the highest private and social rates of return for
primary education. This is in line with other findings in developing countries 34, After primary
education, the rates of return for post-secondary education are the most favorable with at 8.9
percent compared to 7.5 percent of social rates of returns.

   Ghana Education Sector Project (EdSeP) ICR, 2012. The average cost of a 6-classroom school built under the
EdSeP project was estimated to be US$ 99,909. Thus, the cost of one classroom ($99,909/6) is estimated to be
US$16,651.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

73.    The poverty impact of the original EFA project was expected to lie in greater access of
the poorest to primary education, for which a rising share of Government recurrent expenditure
would be required – overall and, particularly to primary education. This would shift the benefit
incidence of public education expenditure more in favor of the poorest quintile. In 2000, it was
estimated that 34 percent of public education expenditure benefitted the wealthiest quintile
mainly due to the relatively higher cost of, and their dominance of tertiary education. The same
holds true today with the two highest quintiles benefiting from the highest share of public
resources (see table below).

74.    Specific programs to boost girl’s primary enrollment were part of the Government’s
Sector Plan. Initiatives were financed by the AfDB, UNICEF and USAID under parallel
projects. Although there remains a large gap between boys and girls enrolment, over the period
2002-2008, the growth in girls’ enrollment significantly outpaced that of boys which increased
the gender parity index (GPI) from only .67 in 2000 to .84 in 2008, and remained at that level in
2012.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

75.      The original EFA project contributed considerably to enhanced planning and information
system capacities through investments in technology and training, including at the
deconcentrated levels. A planning and statistical unit was set up in each ministry. Yearly
statistical books were produced and presented at joint sector reviews, knowledge products
(World Bank/Government) were also produced such as country status reports and public
expenditure reviews (PERs). Capacity building of deconcentrated personnel resulted in more
timely availability of data as well as greater use of the data for local planning and management.
Capacity was also developed in budgeting at all levels – central, regional, prefectoral, and
school. In particular, capacity was strengthened in financial management which enabled the
gradual transfer of budgets and resource management from the central to the deconcentrated
levels. The Project also built capacity of the national structure in charge of exams and
evaluations to carry out learning assessments. These were further strengthened by the recent
impact evaluation of teacher performance incentives supported under the AF. Persistent attention
to donor coordination also contributed substantially to strengthen the capacity of the MEPU-EC
in preparing reports for joint reviews and in assuming greater leadership for donor coordination.

76.     Under the restructured AF, programming and budgeting capacity was strengthened which
led to the development of an MTEF (2013-2015) with the involvement of staff from the
Ministries of education, finance and planing. Strong ownership of HR management has been
cultivated. Important foundations were laid under the AF with strong dialogue with Finance and
Civil Service Ministries, which will be further deepened in the new education strategy and
follow up GPE-funded operation.

 77.     Based on the information discussed above, the Risk to Development Outcome following
 the end of the Project is rated Substantial. The upcoming GPE-funded Project will, however,
 support and scale-up a number of activities originally financed under this Project. Some of these
 activities include: performance based school grants; institutional strengthening activities; teacher
 training; provision of textbooks/learning materials; and support for budget reforms. The

Government has also consistenly paid the salaries of its education personnel and more recently
provides financing for several of these activities, particularly the provision of school grants.
Despite these positive actions and forecasted commitments to the sector, at the time of the
writing of the ICR an Ebola outbreak has occurred – with Guinea being one of the three most
affected countries. Based on recent analysis, this is likely to have a substantial impact on the
economy in the medium-term. As such, there will likely be fluctuations in the resources
available for education as resources are directed to stem the Ebola outbreak.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

78.     The Bank team had the necessary expertise to guide the development and overall design
of the Project. Efforts were made to engage the Government and all active stakeholders in the
design of the operation. The Project design was informed by lessons learned and drew on Bank
experience within the education sector in Guinea. In addition to being one of the largest sector
operations in the country, it was also highly innovative as it was the first to support a sector-
wide approach. This required significant coordination and harmonization with a large number of
stakeholders. Despite these positive features, weaknesses in the original project design and a
lack of readiness for implementation resulted in an extensive period of continued preparation
following credit effectiveness. During the early years of the Project, the Bank and the
Government invested a substantial amount of time developing procedural manuals,
procurements plans, and fund flow arrangements. This early phase of the operation also focused
on clarifying the project concept itself. As a result of this lack of readiness, the Project
experienced significant delays during the early years of the operation. In light of the weaknesses
in design and the lack of readiness for implementation, Bank Performance in ensuring Quality at
Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

79.     A Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA) panel held in 2006 (a few years into project
implementation) highlighted a number of problems with project supervision. 35 Some of the
issues cited were: (i) rapid turnover of the leadership team (with five different task team leaders
(TTLs) within the first three years of the Project) which resulted in discontinuities in technical
support and policy and implementation advice; (ii) limited attention of management to the
seriousness of issues encountered under the Project (paying limited attention to the discrepancies
between the ISR ratings (which were largely Satisfactory) and text descriptions (which
highlighted a number of challenges encountered during implementation); and (iii) delays in
carrying out an MTR earlier which would have ensured a more timely restructuring of the
operation.



35
  A QSA panel in 2006 had assessed the quality of Bank supervision as Moderately Unsatisfactory, with the
exception of supervision of the fiduciary and safeguards aspects of the Project which were considered satisfactory.

                                                        31
80.     Despite these issues, the Bank’s swift re-engagement following the coup d’ état of 2008
and suspension ensured some continuity in terms of support to the education sector. As one of
the first donors to re-engage following the suspension, the Bank was able to provide funding to
the Government during a difficult transitional period and help strengthen the foundation for
reform in key areas such as human resource management. Moreover, it layed the groundwork for
a new collaborative and trusted partnership between the Bank and the new Government. In this
latter period of the operation, project implementation significantly improved. These
improvements were also a result of: (i) increased continuity in TTLs; (ii) the assignment of a
sector staff member to the country office (from 2005 to 2007); (iii) more intense and targeted
supervison missions which aimed to identify and address any bottlenecks which were impeding
timely implementation; (iv) intensified support and training provided to team members in
procurement and financial management; and (v) consistency in terms of technical support to the
Project. The disbursement rate also increased during this time (with an average disbursement of
US$15 million annually). Further, despite the difficult context and limited capacity of the
Government to implement its Education Sector Plan (ESP) (requiring the development of new
systems and tools), the Bank was able to play a prominent role in supporting donor coordination
(with joint supervision missions and joint M&E), 36 budget planning and expenditure analysis.

81.     Despite the challenging and shifting political landscape, the Project was able to achieve
important gains within the education sector. The Bank team demonstrated a creative approach to
problem-solving by, for example, holding supervision missions in Dakar, Senegal during a
period in which Bank missions were not allowed to travel in-country. In addition, the Bank
demonstrated a high level of commitment to supporting the sector by maintaining continued
interaction and dialogue with the Government and key stakeholders despite the Bank’s official
disengagement from the country. Not only did this demonstrate commitment to shared objectives
and long-term goals in the sector, it also allowed the Bank to position itself to be the first
external partner to re-engage in the sector after a long period of disengagement which ensured its
continued and prominent role in supporting the sector. On the basis of this information, Bank
Performance in terms of Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

82.   Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating is based on
the combined rating of Quality of Entry (MU), Quality of Supervision (MS) and Overall
Outcome Rating (MU).

  Such as joint annual reviews, greater sharing of information and developing a basket financing mechanism to
reduce the number of individually financed projects.

                                                     32
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

83.    The twelve-year project life was characterized by a shifting and often unstable economic
and political situation with a period of disengagement of the donor community, including the
Bank. In addition to a coup d’état in 2008, there was a high degree of social tension which
directed the Government’s attention towards addressing the eminent needs while diverting it
away from the specific activities envisaged under this Project. The Government’s financial
commitment to the sector was inconsistent as it was unable to allocate sufficient resources
towards the achievement of the core objectives of its Education Plan and to sustain project
investments.      Persistent delays in counterpart financing also contributed to project
implementation delays.

84.     Despite these difficulties and the challenges faced during the project life, the Government
was able to accomplish a number of important reforms and significant achievements were
observed under the Project. As described above, the Government was willing to undertake an
innovative and ambitious sector-wide approach in its aims to improve access to, and quality of,
education as well as strengthen the management of the education system in the country. The
Government was able to reduce the large number of ghost teachers on its payroll. The
Government was also able to foster a degree of coordination among ministries, directorates and
services that had not previously worked closely together. However, until this level of
coordination was developed, the planning and implementation of programs (e.g., teacher
training) which relied on a high level of collaboration were negatively impacted. In light of the
information provided above, the overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency (ies) Performance

85.     Similar to the World Bank, staff changes were a precipitating cause of delayed
implementation at the outset of the Project. Soon after credit effectiveness all project staff was
replaced along with officials in leadership positions within the education ministries. This
necessitated a long period of clarifying discussions on the objectives and content of the project,
as well as a reassessment of institutional capacities, particularly in procurement and financial
management. Following this period, however, a number of core staff of the PCU remained in
place for the duration of the Project which allowed for important capacity-building within the
Ministry as it also facilitated smoother implementation of the Project. During the period of the
Bank’s disengagement, the PCU was able to continue to function and, to the extent possible,
participate in organized missions to Dakar. This is particularly noteworthy given the difficult
and shifting political and social context which characterized a large portion of the project’s
implemention period. Despite these achievements, some contract management and procurement
challenges were faced, particularly, with regards to the school construction program. While the
objective of paying teachers’ salaries to ensure continuity and service delivery was sound under
the original AF (with the Ministry of Economy and Finance as implementing agency), the
execution of this financing was less successful. As discussed previously, despite the initial
challenges with the original AF, the performance of the implementing agencies significantly
improved following the Bank and Government’s re-engagement. This momentum continued

                                                33
until project closing in 2013 and is still evident today. Based on the information described
above, the implementing agencies’ performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

86.    The overall rating for Borrower Performance is Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating
is based on the combined rating of Government Performance (MU), Implementing Agencies’
Performance (MS) and Overall Outcome Rating (MU).



6. Lessons Learned

87.     Strategic sequencing is critical in ensuring objectives can be achieved. Although
many of the Project’s objectives have been achieved, a number of them might have been
achieved in a timelier and more efficient manner if they had been more carefully selected and
appropriately sequenced. For instance, some key project documents were only prepared after
project effectiveness while these could have been initiated during the preparation phase. As a
result, a number of delays were encountered during the first three years of project
implementation.

88.    Student learning achievement levels which have been evaluated regularly by
national structures, often in collaboration with regional institutions (PASEC 37) or specific
programs (NFQE), can be used to inform policy. Although these evaluations have been
undertaken, the results from these assessments have not been fully utilized to inform policy
making and interventions aimed at improving teaching and learning learning in the classroom or
for developing quality of learning standards that could be generalized and monitored at the
country and regional level.

89.     One of the important building blocks for undertaking difficult reforms (e.g., related
to human resources, budgeting, etc.) is the involvement of institutional staff intimately
familiar with the issues rather than relying on a parallel project unit. Under the restructured
AF, significant emphasis was placed on strengthening public FM and personnel management
systems. Moreover, the sector also collaborated with the Ministries of Finance and Civil Service.
This cross-sectoral collaboration led to increased ownership which was fundamental in moving
the reform agenda forward.

90.     The Bank’s swift engagement in periods following a crisis can bring important
dividends. As one of the first donors to re-engage following the suspension, the Bank was able
to provide funding to the Government during a difficult transitional period following the coup
d’état and help strengthen the foundation for reform in key areas such as human resource
management. The project was also able to ensure that the PCU remained functional despite the
difficult political and economic context. Moreover, the Bank’s strong partnership and continued

attention to the Project and the situation in Guinea lay the groundwork for a collaborative and
trusted partnership between the Bank and the new Government.

91.     While consultancy services and technical assistance (TA) supported under the
Project had a positive impact on achievement of outcomes, the lack of skills transfer to
staff from government institutions could inhibit the development of long-term capacity
within the institutions. In the future, the Government should take steps to capitalize on the
work of experts – both in terms of their guidance and their close collaboration with local
government personnel – to ensure full ownership and skills transfer when a TA has been
completed. Future consultancy contracts should include plans to transfer capacity.

92.     In instances where a Project’s life extends far beyond what was originally
envisaged, in-depth and periodic evaluations may provide the necessary data to effectively
evaluate the Project’s progress towards achievement of the PDO as well as to undertake
measures which further increase the likelihood that the Project will achieve its intended
development goals. As this Project was implemented over a twelve year period, and it has been
several years since a number of the original project activities were completed, it has proven
difficult to fully gather the necessary data to evaluate the project’s implementation and
achievements. More periodic and thorough evaluations would have facilitated this evaluation.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
1.     According to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) (dated August 8, 2001), the
original project development objective (PDO) was to: “assist the Borrower in its efforts to
implement the first phase of its EFA Program, through the establishment of a sustainable
framework for reaching high quality universal primary education in its territory.”
2.      As noted in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the Project was described as a three-
phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL) for the period 2001-2013 in support of Government's
education sector reform program. The Project aimed to establish a sustainable framework for
good quality universal basic education. This would be accomplished by: (i) supporting the
implementation of specific policy related to key objectives (e.g., abolishing primary school fees,
decentralizing training and recruitment of teachers, lengthening the school year); (ii) testing and
reaching consensus on program initiatives to be implemented nationwide in subsequent phases
(e.g., decentralization of budget management, school-level choice of textbooks, use of national
languages, early childhood development (ECD), new reading programs); and (iii) reaching near-
universal enrollment of seven-year-old children in Grade 1.
3.     In the DCA, 13 key performance indicators (KPIs) were listed with no distinction made
between PDO- and intermediate-level. In the PAD, a distinction was made between outcome
(PDO-level) and output (intermediate-level) indicators. Some indicators had two targets with one
presented in brackets. The latter represented an acceptable level of achievement/performance (for
evaluation purposes) by financial partners.

4.     The Project was one of the first in the region which aimed to align donors in their support
to the Government’s Program. As the PAD mentions, the Project aimed to provide funding for
the sector-wide program in which donors supported many activities including: construction,
teacher education, textbooks, school grants, management training, evaluation and other inputs to
improve quality and increase access. Three separate APLs were expected to support each of the
Program’s three phases. The first phase of the Program focused on initiation and
experimentation; the second on adjustment and expansion; and the final phase on consolidation.
In 2008, however, during the preparation of the additional financing (AF), it was agreed that a
phased APL (which had originally been planned) to support each of the three phases was no
longer relevant in the Guinean context and that future assistance would be guided by a sector-
wide approach in alignment with the Paris Declaration which emphasizes donor harmonization.

5.      As described in the main text, the Project was implemented during periods of significant
uncertainty, with the early years characterized by limited ownership by the Government and
coordination challenges among the various Ministries involved as the design relied on a high
level of inter-Ministerial coordination. Later in project implementation, the Government
experienced some important external shocks, including a financial crisis, as well as political
instability.

6.     The PDO was modified twice during the course of project implementation under the
Restructurings in 2008 and 2011. Under the Project’s 2005 Restructuring, the closing date was
extended by two years from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2007 and the scope of the
project (and number of performance indicators) was reduced. Rather than supporting a large

                                                38
number of activities (ranging from early childhood development (ECD) to higher education), the
project’s focus was narrowed to supporting activities for primary education. Under the 2005
Restructuring, some of the activities which were considered high priority included: provision of
school grants; building institutional capacity; scaling up the provision of textbooks; and
improving financial and human resource (HR) management.

7.      In 2008, due to the emergence of a gap in the Government budget, special resources were
made available by IDA through an AF (US$10 million) which was quickly prepared and
approved in October 2008. Under the AF, the revised PDO was “to assist the Recipient in its
efforts to improve the conditions for teaching and learning it is territory, through (i) expanded
access to education, (ii) enhanced quality of learning, and (iii) strengthened capacity for
decentralized management of the sector.” The AF aimed to address a financial gap (of 0.7
percent of GDP) which was associated with the food and oil crisis that had been identified by the
IMF in April 2008. The Bank team decided to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the
AF to restructure the project. Specifically, this restructuring aimed to: (1) better align PDO with
project activities including those under the AF; and (2) refine certain performance indicators to
adjust some of the targets given more recent population estimates to calculate key education
indicators. Following the 2008 Restructuring, a coup d’état followed by a default on an arrears
payment led to the suspension of the Bank program for two years. The first disbursement 38 by
the French Agency for Development (Agence Francaise de Développement – AFD) within the
pooled fund, however, provided sufficient funding to ensure that the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) could remain operational.

8.       When the Bank re-engaged with the country and the sector in 2011, the Bank decided to
retroactively extend the original credit and the AF (as they had closed in December 2009 as
scheduled during the period of non-engagement) to June 30, 2013. Following this extension, the
project was restructured for a third time (requiring Board approval). Given the focus on
strengthening HR management under the AF, the PDO was revised (specifically, the third part of
the PDO). The modified PDO was “to assist the Recipient in its efforts to improve the
conditions for teaching and learning it is territory, through: (i) expanded access to education; (ii)
enhanced quality of learning; and (iii) strengthened HR management.” In addition, the
management of the AF (for which the implementing agency had been the Ministry of Economy
and Finance) was returned to the PCU (MEPU-EC) which had been managing the original credit
(and which was managing the Education for All – Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund Grant
(EFA FTI CF) that had become effective during the same period in 2011 that the grant was
restructured). In addition to these changes, two sub-components were added to Component 3 of
the Project related to: (i) enforcement of legal texts and review of recruitment, allocation, and
(re) deployment procedures; and (ii) implementation of a coherent data information system; and
(iii) introduction of merit and performance based incentives. A number of changes were also
made to the RF under the 2011 Restructuring. The last restructuring was undertaken just prior to
the project closing date in June 2013 and the Project closing date was extended to December 31,
2013. No other changes were made under this final restructuring.

     This first disbursement was provided using AFD funds.

9.     A number of indicators were modified under the first three restructurings. Changes
introduced to the Results Framework (revised, new and dropped indicators) under the Project can
be found in Annex 10 as well as rationale (as available) for these modifications. This annex
describes adjustments made to baseline values and end-of-project targets and provides a brief
description of the level of achievement for each PDO- and intermediate-level indicator.

10.     Progress made under each Project Component is described below.

Overview of Achievements by Component

Component 1: Access to Education (Appraisal: US$19.7 million; Actual Expenditure:
US$28.1 million 39)

11.    The objective of this Component was to increase the number of students in primary and
"neighborhood" middle schools, with a focus on initial Grade 1 enrollments. All localities would
develop enrollment targets and participate in school mapping processes. Priority was given to
under-served regions and populations. Support would also be given to improve access to early
childhood initiatives, secondary, vocational, and higher education, and literacy programs. The
Sub-components included: (a) construction of primary school classrooms; (b) renovation of
primary schools; (c) construction of latrines and wells; (d) emergency repairs; (e) maintenance;
(f) construction and furnishing of neighborhood middle schools; and (g) reconstruction and
renovation of teacher training institutes (Ecole Normale d'Instituteurs – ENIs).

12.     Over the course of the Project, 1,120 primary classrooms were constructed contributing to
an increase in the gross enrollment rate (GER) at the primary level from 62 percent in 2001 to 82
percent in 2013. In lower secondary education, the Project contributed to the construction of
seven middle-schools (collèges), which were a new feature of the program and for which
maintenance costs were to be covered under the project. The Project also supported the
construction of five ENIs, seven university libraries and 70 ECD community centers. The
secondary schools have been a critical issue during project implementation. Some of the
unallocated funds under the AF were used to cover the costs of rehabilitation during the last year
of implementation. Table 1 provides an overview of results and outputs achieved under
Component 1 of the Project (as well as an overview of those which were planned under the
project).

  Actual expenditure for this Component was greater than the amount allocated under the original credit and
additional financing (AF) to exchange rate gains.

Component 2: Improving Quality of Education (Appraisal: US$41.2 million; Actual
Expenditure: US$43.4 million)

13.      The objective of this Component (which received the largest share of financing under the
Project) was to develop and test strategies to improve teaching and learning. The Component
aimed to support teachers, schools, and community groups, with classroom-and school-level
initiatives which sought to ensure that the teaching team had the authority, knowledge, support
and the learning materials to make meaningful decisions about how to improve learning for all.
Sub-components included: (a) early childhood development (ECD); (b) primary school
improvement programs; (c) curriculum innovation/examinations form; (d) textbooks and reading
materials; (e) school health and nutrition program; (f) reduction of repetition and dropout; (g)
special needs education; (h) multi-grade teachings strategies; (i) secondary school improvement
programs; (j) pre-service secondary school teacher education; (k) teaching of science and
technology; (1) adult literacy and non-formal education; (m) vocational and technical education;
(n) pre- and in-service primary school teacher education; (o) maintenance program for vocational
training; (p) development of a university central library; (q) higher education curriculum reform;
(r) research and innovation facility; and (s) upgrading of faculty.

14.    This Component was comprised of a large number of Sub-components implemented by
five ministries: MEPU-EC (Ministry of Pre-university Education and Civic Education), METFP
(Ministry of Technical and Vocational Training), MESRS (Ministry of Higher Education and
Research), MASPFE (Ministry of ECD and Social Affairs), and MAPLN (Ministry of Adult
Literacy) and managed by the three sub-sectors. A significant number of Sub-components were
implemented on a pilot basis and resulted in satisfactory implementation as confirmed by
external evaluations that suggested recommendations for improvement. Some of these initiatives
were continued under the existing Education Sector Program (ESP) (Programme sectorial de
l’éducation – PSE) partially financed by the EFA FTI grant (now called the Global Partnership
for Education (GPE)). Key among these were: small grants to schools and school districts
(DSEE) to offset the school fees paid by parents, literacy programs, and ECD centers. Significant

                                                      41
technical support was also provided to strengthen the development of reliable national
assessments to evaluate learning outcomes in primary education.

15.    A 2006 textbook audit did find several weakness in the system that resulted in
considerable loss, including inter alia: (a) discrepancies in the contract quantities and books
delivered; (b) absence of formal procedures for textbook management at the school levels and
rapid deterioration of books due to lack of appropriate storage and care; (c) a faulty distribution
system that results is loss all along the distribution chain; and (d) books reportedly delivered to
non-identifiable schools. Following this report, the Government prepared a plan to address these
weaknesses, which was required to obtain the Country Director’s approval of further financing of
textbooks under the Project. 40 The plan was appraised as acceptable, and the project financed
additional stocks in 2007 and 2008. It is unclear to what extent the plan helped to control loss.

16.     Over the course of the first phase of the Project, about 11,500 new teachers were
successfully trained and an independent evaluation showed that their level of proficiency was
superior to that of the teachers trained before the introduction of the reform. In addition, the ENIs
were reviewed, the ENIs received documentary resources, a communications campaign was
organized for the recruitment of student-teachers (radio, forums, etc.), and logistical resources
were provided for 100 supervisors. A large number of primary and secondary school textbooks
were procured and delivered (8,704,582 textbooks in total of which 7,165,134 were for primary
schools and 1,539,448 were for secondary schools). As a consequence, the textbook student ratio
improved to 3 for both primary school students and for secondary school students. About 35,000
persons benefited from four different literacy programs executed by 43 non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) acting as operating agencies and 30 NAFA literacy centers received
pedagogical support for professional training. These programs have contributed to the
transformation of the Department of Social Affairs into a Ministry. Staff was recruited at the
regional level to monitor and coordinate with NGOs. Although the higher education activities
have been fairly light, since 2012, the Bank has started its re-engagement in higher education by
providing substantial technical assistance to assist in the development of a tertiary education
strategy including aspects of governance, financing, development of public and private
partnerships, and human resource management. Table 2 provides an overview of results and
outputs achieved/planned under Component 2 of the Project.




40
  Two key elements of the plan were the involvement of the school management committee in verifying receipt of
textbook delivery, and packaging delivery with the procurement of books rather than through separate contracts.

        Component 3: Strengthening Capacity for Decentralized Management (Appraisal: US$9.1
        million; with Additional Financing: US$19.1 million; Actual Total Expenditure: US$20.7)

        17.     The main objective of this Component was to improve the overall management of the
        education system, increasing responsibilities and resource availability at schools. The
        Component aimed to provide better support to school personnel, reversing top-to-bottom flows
        of information in ways that will improve capacity for delivering high-quality education services.
        Sub-components were: (a) personnel management; (b) policy monitoring, information, and
        program evaluation; (c) financial management support; and (d) reinforcement of education sector
        administrative capacity. With the restructuring of the AF, two sub-components were added.
        These were: (e) enforcement of legal texts and review of recruitment, allocation, re


                                                                 46
(deployment) procedures; and (f) development of a unified information system and introduction
of a merit-based performance system.

18.     Between 2001 and 2007 the following activities were also undertaken to support HR
management, including: an audit of contract teachers; reinforcement of the HR directorate
logistic capacity (computers and furniture); set up a personnel database for teachers instrumental
for the implementation of the AF; training abroad of HR staff; a study on the career plan for
contract teachers as part of a study visit in Benin. Restructuring of DPE and IRE (deconcentrated
education structures) for HR management deconcentration–was led by USAID.

19.     Under this Component a 2009 audit which explored the payment of teachers’ salaries
identified a number of problematic issues (e.g., double payments, payments to teachers who were
no longer in posts, and over payments). Considering the considerable challenges in HR
management in the past decades, an amount of US$215,949.50 in terms of ineligible
expenditures out of 4.7 million represents a relatively small portion (less than 5 percent) of the
total amount. However, the Government in 2011 sought TA support from the Bank to
strengthening HR/personnel management and reallocated the remaining funds from payment of
salaries to TA.

20.    Subsequent to 2011, school data collection and analysis progressively improved. A
personnel movement scale was developed and is being used to make informed and objective
decisions to deploy teachers. In 2013, 100 percent of the legal decisions for personnel transfer
were taken according to the scale and introduction of a scholarship as an incentive for student-
teachers to attract a larger number of baccalaureate holders in ENI programs. Teacher
management as defined by the allocation of teachers by number of students for Conakary
increased from 70 to 76 percent showing improved efficiencies in teacher management. Specific
TA was provided to introduce programmatic budgeting (MTEF). A MEPU-EC teaching
personnel database was developed and established at the regional and central levels. The HR
support within the other Ministries was not planned under the existing project. However, the
savings under the AF, as well as demand from these other ministries allowed for the
development of an HR database in the METFP and in the MESRS. A performance-based
incentive scheme for primary teachers was also introduced.

1.     The economic and financial analysis presents the following sections: (i) efficiency
of implementation, (ii) external efficiency, and (iii) fiscal sustainability analysis.

Efficiency of implementation

2.      The initial credit value was US$70 million. With the fluctuation in the exchange
rate over the project, the credit amount led to US$82.6 million. There was a minor cost
change for each component compared to the appraised budget. However, changes within
components were significant in some cases. For example, resources were strategically
redirected from the construction of a central library (estimated at US$11.44 million) and
the MEPU-EC central administrative building (estimated at US$7 million) to the provision
of textbooks, secondary school constructions, teacher training institutions (ENI)
constructions and rehabilitation, pre-service training of primary school teachers, reform of
higher education programs, school health. These revisions reflect the restructuring that took
place in 2005 and seemed to have been a sensible approach as more emphasis was given to
education quality.

3.      Over the 12-year period, project implementation was rated unsatisfactory,
satisfactory, and moderately satisfactory at different points depending on counterparts’
involvement and political context. The first two years of project implementation were slow.
The time needed for completion of some prerequisites was underestimated though
mentioned in the PAD. After 2003, the implementation process was accelerated with
enhanced Bank involvement and greater commitment on the side of the Borrower.
Implementation arrangements were designed to ensure autonomy for each of the five
Ministries of Education (Ministry of Pre-University Education (MEPU-EC), Ministry of
Higher Education, and Ministry of Technical and Vocational Training, Ministry of Social
Affairs, and Ministry of Adult Literacy). Each Ministry had a special account and a project
unit called Secrétariat Technique (ST). The different STs were composed of ministry staff
familiar with Bank procedures. The MEPU-EC reinforced its ST in 2002 with the
appointment of new members including a procurement officer and a financial officer.

4.      Interventions under this Project have drawn the attention of policy makers towards
issues related to teachers as well as education quality. In the past ten years, the school
system has gained more school buildings and textbooks, solid basis for decentralized
management, schools involved in small projects, solid grounds for efficient and transparent
teacher management, school data, and learning outcome assessment. Under the quality
component, many actions were undertaken opening potential opportunities towards
reaching higher levels of education quality. The restructuring of the additional financing in
2011 is an example of how critical reforms such as personnel management can take a good
start with strong leadership, and the provision of responsibility to existing structures instead
of a parallel project implementation unit (which were more the norm than the exception
during the early 2000s).

5.      Primary school construction. On average, the cost per classroom built is estimated
at US$11,300, or 26 percent higher than the appraisal estimate of US$ 9,000. However,
this unit costs for a primary classroom is very much in alignment with the unit cost in other
countries, and are in fact more cost-effective than other countries which have completed
classroom construction during the same time period. The average cost of a primary
classroom in Ghana for instance is estimated to be US$ 16,651. 41 In Sudan, the average
cost of a primary classroom is estimated to be as high as US$ 30,000. 42 This fact points to
the likelihood that the original unit cost estimate for classroom construction at appraisal
was underestimated – and these comparable unit costs indicate that the Project was
relatively efficient in this particularly activity.

6.       Primary School Textbooks. The table below shows the reported quantities, contract
values, and computed unit price of textbooks purchased under the IDA project. Since the
EFA and AfDB projects shared the provision of textbooks to reach a 3 textbook per student
ratio, the table shows the combined quantities.

7.      Combined, the EFA and ADB projects financed the purchase of 8.4 million primary
textbooks over the period 2003-2007, which assumed a life span of three to four years after
which time the stock is replaced. The project provided textbooks at an average unit cost for
primary school core subject in the amount of US$1.4. This is much in line with projects
realized during the same time period in Cote d’Ivoire, Burundi, and Niger where primary
textbooks were acquired for between US$1.1 and US$1.4. For middle schools, the average
unit cost per textbooks was US$1.9. This compares also relatively well with other
countries, which have realized related projects during this period.

8.      On one hand, the competitive bidding process resulted in a reasonable average per
book price of US$0.81. However, the quantities ordered are high relative to the targeted
book: student ratio, implying a substantial loss rate. Sufficient quantities were ordered to
provide each public primary school student with 4 core books (French, math, science and
history/geography). In addition, quantities ordered exceeded the average enrolment over
the period by 66 percent presumably to take into account loss due to wear and tear over
three to four years to maintain a 3:1 ratio, for an assumed average loss rate of 18 percent
per year. Other information suggests that either: (a) the loss rate was significantly higher
due to poor storage, or possible leakage into a parallel sales market, and/or that (b) the
quantities ordered or delivered were substantially lower. Moving forward the Government
plans to place significant emphasis on addressing these identified issues.

   Ghana Education Sector Project (EdSeP) ICR, 2012. The average cost of a 6-classroom school built under
the EdSeP project was estimated to be US$ 99,909. Thus, the cost of one classroom ($99,909/6) is estimated to
be US$ 16,651.

External Efficiency

9.      In human capital theory, many studies argue that participation in education is an
investment made with the expectation of returns later in life. More education, as supported
through the Project, tends to imply improved productivity and income, a healthier and
better-nourished population and greater autonomy for women. Economic development in
turn implies a better quality of life. Moreover, the education of women is important for a
wide range of demographic behavior, as it affects fertility, mortality, and migration. Many
studies used cross-national data sets, both from developed and developing economics, and
confirmed the significant contribution of education to economic growth 43. The current
education spending determines the future education profiles of the working age population
and enhances labor market outcomes including poverty reduction, better earnings and
secures employment opportunities

10.    Estimates from ELEP 2012 shows that Guinea’s labor market clearly signals for
investment in education. Figure 1 shows average simulated annual income by level of
education and age. A higher level of education rewards a higher lifetime earning horizon.

11.     The Mincerian regression coefficient shows that the Guinea’s labor market has a
strong signal for education in wage employment as well as in household income. We first
limit our sample to salaried workers whose earnings information is available based on
earning bracket, and then extend the estimation using household consumption. When
estimating the returns based on household consumption, the education level of the
household head, or that of median or average working adults in the household are used. In
addition, we separately estimate using both measures of education -- years of education
(not shown on graph) and categorical dummies of education level (shown on Figure 2). The
result shows that, among salaried workers, one additional year of education is associated
with an average increase of monthly earnings of 9 percent while income based estimation
hovers around 11 percent increase in household income per additional years of household
head’s education or working household members mean and median years of schooling.

12.     Estimates by level of education also reveals that a higher level of education is
associated with better earnings at all levels of education, both for wage employment and
household income (Figure 2). The other notable aspect regarding the education’s
significant role in poverty reduction is the direct linear relationship between education and
earnings. That means as educational achievement increases, the likelihood of a person to be
poor declines. For example, in wage employment compared to no education category,
attainment of some primary education increases monthly earnings by 37 percent and the
corresponding figures for completed primary, completed lower secondary, completed upper
secondary, and post-secondary education are 61 percent, 88 percent, 100 percent and 136
                                                                    54
percent, respectively. The patterns based on household income for the other three
classifications closely follow the same pattern. Overall, for wage and household head’s
education, higher level of education seems to reward the highest incremental yields, while
for average and median years of household member’s education, primary completion yields
high returns. Therefore, education is the most important factor regarding poverty reduction.

13.     For cost-benefit analysis proxy, we estimate incremental private and social rates of
returns in the conventional manner and compare benefits (net of costs and subjected to
various corrections) of a given educational qualification with those of a relevant preceding
one. On the basis of the simulated incomes above, the rate of returns of the higher level
relative to the lower level is estimated by dividing the difference in wages between the two
by the additional cost supported when pursuing schooling at the higher level. Costs include
direct training as well as the foregone earning (or opportunity cost) which is the income
one would forgo while pursuing further studies at the higher level.




                                                                      55
14.     The foregone earnings for the higher level is estimated by using the expected
income at the lower level. More precisely, the formula below is used to estimate the rates
of returns of higher levels of education level relative to lower levels of education:

                    π k Yk − π k −1Yk −1
 Rk / k -1 =                                          -----------------------------------------------------------------
               N k -1 / k π k −1Yk −1 + N k Ck
------- (2)
          Where      π k is the employment rate (therefore 1- π k is the unemployment rate) of individuals with education
          level k;    Yk   is the simulated income of level k,   N k is the average duration of schooling (years) within level k,
           N k -1/ k is the difference between levels k and k-1 (years of schooling attended) and Ck is the direct training
          cost.

                  a. Since private and social rates of returns involve a markedly different
                     conception of the benefits and costs, the corrections to be made to the
                     benefits and the estimates of costs are different in each case. Social rates of
                     return involve a systematic comparison of the resource costs to the
                     community of educational provision with the resulting increase in national
                     production as reflected in the pre-tax earnings differentials of those
                     receiving this extra education. The values of all parameters shown on the
                     above equation are shown in Table 1 along with the calculated social and
                     private rates of return 44.

15.     The results note that primary education has the highest private and social rates of
return. This is in line with other findings in developing countries 45, After primary
education, the rates of return for post-secondary education are the most favorable with at
8.9 percent compared to 7.5 percent of social rates of returns.

   In particular, the two differ only by the components of the direct training costs and before and after tax
income in a sense that the only component of Ck is the training cost supported by the household for the private
return, and the benefit is after tax, while the public cost is added for the social rerunns but the benefit is based
on gross expected earnings (before tax).

16.    Aside from the private and social benefits of investing in education, the overall
unfavorable human development measures of Guinea demonstrate another reason for
investment in education. In Guinea, about 22 percent of youth (age 15-24) were either
economically inactive or unemployed in 2012 with the highest unemployment rates
amongst the educated population Similar, unemployment rate for the broader youth age
group (age 15-35) is higher than the general adult working age populations (age 15-64). For
example, unemployment rate for youth with TVET was 30.2 percent in 2012 compared to
16.8 percent for the adult population.

Fiscal Sustainability Analysis

17.    The Government seems to have a strong interest in human development and given
the country’s natural resources, if carefully managed, the sustainability of the existing
program is less of a risk, if at all. Public funds spent on education ranged between 2.3
percent of GDP in 2001 to 2.6 in 2012. The share decreased from 4.4 percent in 2010 and
from 3.1 percent in 2011. It is worth highlighting that 2009 and 2010 were particular years
as they took place during the government transition which was characterized by increased
spending across sectors and did not represent a sudden surge in interest in investing in the
education sector. The share of education in all public expenditures in 2012 was 13.3 percent,
again representing a decline from previous years. Capital expenditures varied substantially
during the project period and experienced peeks in 2006, 2007, and 2010 followed by a
decline to 1.9 percent of all public capital expenditures in 2012. Although the current trend
in education spending does not favor education as shown in Table 2, the Government is
committed to increasing its financing to the sector. Moreover donors continue to remain
heavily involved in the contributing important investment expenditures, which reduces the
sustainability risk.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      As part of the ICR, a small survey of beneficiaries was undertaken which aimed to
elicit feedback on various aspects of project design and implementation, achievement of
project objectives as well as the role and contribution of the Bank and the Government.

2.      A majority of survey respondents agreed that the design and activities supported by
the project were appropriate and and thought the project’s implementation arrangements
were efficient. Specifically, a number of respondents thought the overall design of the
project was good and highlighted areas in which the project provided support that were
well-designed, including the construction of primary schools, provision of textbooks, and
innovations introduced in terms of school curricula and pedagogical approaches, etc. There
were, however, some weaknesses in the design identified by a number of survey
respondents including the project’s support to school health, adult literacy and the
establishment of ECD centers.

3.      There was general agreement among respondents that the project had achieved some
of its major objectives including increasing access to primary schools (i.e., increasing the
primary GER (including among girls), however, a number of respondents did not think the
project was successful in some other areas including improving results of skills training tests
for CE2 and in the decentralization of human resources management. A few respondents
indicated that adequate counterpart funding was not provided.

4.       Survey respondents largely agreed that the political or economic climate had a
negative impact on project implementation while there were mixed views on whether the
institutional capacity of relevant ministries and the resources allocated to the sector had a
positive or negative impact on the successful implementation of the project. At the same
time, many of the respondents agreed, however, that the technical assistance (TA) provided
by the Bank had a positive impact on its implementation.

5.      In terms of M&E, a large majority of those surveyed considered the indicators
appropriate, a portion of them thought that the data collection system was adequate and
believed the data were used to inform decision making. A number of those surveyed
indicated, however, that findings from these data were not made available in a timely
manner.

6.     In terms of the roles of the Bank and Government, a majority of respondents
highlighted a number of positive approaches demonstrated by each. In the case of the Bank,
respondents highlighted that the Bank’s supervision was good, the Bank responded in a
timely manner to client requests, and that the Bank worked collaboratively with other
donors. A number of respondents highlighted that the Government played an active role in
project preparation, demonstrated ownership and effectively coordinated interventions
among technical and financial partners while a portion of individuals thought that the
Government did not allocate expected resources to the project.

MINISTERE DE L’ENSEIGNEMENT PRE- UNIVERSITAIRE ET DE
L’ALPHABETISATION

RAPPORT D’ACHEVEMENT DU PROGRAMME EDUCATION POUR TOUS
(PEPT)
(version allégée)

Le PEPT a été un Programme de Prêt Adaptable (PPA) de 3 phases planifiées de 2001 à
2013. Suite au retard dans son démarrage, la première phase (PEPT), couvrant la période
2002-2008, a été la suite logique des Programmes d’Ajustement Sectoriel de l’Education
(PASE I de 1990 à 1993 et PASE II de 1994 à 2002). Cette première phase a visé
l’établissement d’un cadre soutenable pour une éducation de base de qualité à l’horizon 2005.
Le PEPT a couvert les trois ministères en charge de l’éducation et a été exécuté par les
structures pérennes, sous la responsabilité de trois Secrétariats techniques (ST) alignés sur les
ordres d’enseignement : (i) le ST/MEPU-EC pour l’éducation de base, (ii) le ST/MET-FP
pour l’enseignement technique et la formation professionnelle et (iii) le ST/MESRS pour
l’enseignement supérieur et de la recherche scientifique.

Malgré les résultats remarquables des programmes précédents, des défis majeurs restaient à
relever dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre du PEPT. Ces défis se traduisaient par : (i) la faible
qualité de l’enseignement ; (ii) un taux élevé de redoublement ; (iii) un faible et inéquitable
accès à l’éducation de base ; (iv) des frais de scolarité élevés pour les parents ; (v) un
financement inadéquat de l’éducation de base ; (vi) une faible capacité de gestion et de
supervision ; et (vii) une qualité médiocre de l’enseignement supérieur faisant face à une forte
pression d’inscription.

Lors de l’élaboration du programme, les risques identifiés se résumaient comme suit : (i) un
déficit de compétences de la part du Gouvernement pour soutenir les implications financières
du programme et un manque de demande de la part des parents pour la scolarisation; (ii) une
incapacité du Gouvernement à payer les maîtres contractuels de façon régulière et à produire
et distribuer des manuels scolaires de façon à maintenir un bon ratio ; (iii) un échec pour
assurer le financement adéquat au niveau de l’école et pour prendre les décisions clés
concernant la décentralisation; et (iv) une faiblesse du Gouvernement à fournir des services de
qualité peu coûteux.

Le financement total requis du PEPT s’élevait à 420,14 millions de dollars EU. L’IDA, à
travers un accord de Crédit signé avec le Gouvernement guinéen, a contribué à ce
financement à hauteur de 57,000 millions de DTS.

A la faveur des deux restructurations du Crédit IDA en 2005 et 2008, convenues entre le
Gouvernement et la Banque mondiale, la date de clôture du PEPT, initialement fixée au 31
décembre 2005, a été prorogée au 31 décembre 2009. Cette date a été de nouveau repoussée
au 30 juin 2013 suite à l’octroi d’un financement additionnel par la Banque mondiale pour la
mise en place d’une Stratégie de renforcement des capacités de gestion des ressources
humaines du secteur.




                                               64
En 2007, la mise en œuvre du programme a été confrontée à de nombreuses difficultés liées à
une instabilité politique, à des troubles sociaux récurrents et à une forte dégradation des
conditions économiques. Aussi, suite à l’avènement du CNDD au pouvoir en décembre 2008,
la Banque mondiale a suspendu ses interventions en faveur de la Guinée, ce qui a
négativement affecté le programme, justifiant ainsi les reports successifs des dates de clôture.
Le programme restructuré a atteint ses objectifs en termes de taux d’absorption du Crédit sur
l’ensemble de ses composantes, avec un taux de décaissement de 100% à la clôture.

  I.   OBJECTIFS ET COMPOSANTES

Objectif général : L’objectif du programme est le développement à long terme du capital
humain en réduisant la pauvreté à travers la scolarisation universelle au niveau du primaire
d’ici à l’an 2015 et l’alphabétisation des adultes.
Objectifs spécifiques
- Le développement de mécanismes de mise en place des objectifs spécifiques, y compris
l’abolition des frais liés à la scolarité pour le primaire, le recrutement local des enseignants,
et le rallongement de l’année scolaire.
-        L’expérimentation et l’arrivée à un consensus concernant les programmes d’initiatives
devant être mis en place au cours des prochaines phases (décentralisation de la gestion
budgétaire, choix des manuels, accent sur les programmes de lecture)
- L’inscription au primaire de tous les enfants de 7 ans (filles et garçons).

Composantes du programme :

Composante1 : Accès à l’éducation. L’objectif de cette composante est d’accroitre le
nombre d’enfants dans les écoles primaires et secondaires de proximité, avec un accent
particulier sur les inscriptions initiales en première année. Elle aidera toutes les collectivités à
développer des objectifs de scolarisation et à la maîtrise de la carte scolaire. Une attention
particulière sera accordée aux régions et populations défavorisées et aux enfants nécessitant
un besoin d’enseignement spécialisé. Un soutien sera également accordé pour l’amélioration
de l’accès aux initiatives concernant la petite enfance, le secondaire, le professionnel et pour
les programmes d’alphabétisation. Les sous-composantes sont : (a) construction et
équipement des classes au primaire, (b) construction et équipement des classes au collège, (c)

Composante 2 : Qualité de l’Education. L’objectif de cette composante est d’assurer que
tous les enfants aient accès non seulement à une scolarisation, mais aussi à un apprentissage
réel. L’accent est mis sur l’appui individualisé aux enseignants et aux écoles, avec des
différentes initiatives au niveau des salles de classe et de l’école visant à s’assurer que
l’équipe pédagogique ait l’autorité, la connaissance et les matériels didactiques nécessaires
pour prendre des décisions appropriées sur les moyens d’améliorer les apprentissages pour
tous. Les sous-composantes sont : (a) Développement de la petite enfance, (b) programme
d’amélioration des écoles primaires, (c) innovations curriculaires à tous les niveaux et
l’évaluation des apprentissages au primaire, (d) manuels scolaires, livres de lecture et
collection pour les bibliothèques, (e) rénovation et équipement des bibliothèques
universitaires, (f) santé scolaire et nutrition, (g) stratégie d’enseignement multigrade, (h)
alphabétisation des adultes et éducation non formelle.

Composante 3 : Gestion décentralisée. L’objectif principal de cette composante est d’aider
le système à appuyer le personnel scolaire et de s’assurer que l’équipe pédagogique ait accès


                                                65
aux ressources requises d’une façon régulière. Elle vise à améliorer l’accès aux informations
de base de sorte qu’elle renforce la capacité du système à offrir des services éducatifs de
qualité. Les sous-composantes sont : (a) gestion du personnel, (b) suivi des politiques,
information et évaluation, (c) gestion financière, (d) renforcement des capacités physiques et
administratives du secteur éducatif.


 II.    REALISATIONS PAR COMPOSANTE

Composante 1 : Accès à l’éducation

La réalisation sur le financement de la Banque mondiale de (i) 1120 salles de classes dont 700
par des ONG/MOD, 300 par les entreprises tout corps d’état et 120 par l’approche
communautaire (PACV/CRD), (ii) 800 latrines et points d’eau et (iii) 7 collèges (soit 84 salles
de classe équipées) comprenant chacun 12 salles de classe chacun avec 1 bibliothèque, 2
laboratoires, 1 bloc administratif et 1 logement pour le principal.

Dans le sous-secteur de l’enseignement technique/ professionnel, on cite au nombre des
acquis, la construction de 3 écoles normales d’instituteurs respectivement à Faranah, Boké et
Dubréka. À cela s’ajoutent (i) l’extension des ENI de Conakry et de Nzérékoré, (ii)
l’acquisition des équipements complémentaires pour toutes les ENI et (iii) la formation
initiale et continue des maîtres de l’élémentaire qui figure parmi les priorités dans ce sous-
secteur.

Des sous-programmes en alphabétisation initiés par des opérateurs du domaine ont été
financés à hauteur de 1,3 million de dollars américains. 70 centres d’encadrement
communautaire (CEC) ont été construits, 10.000 enfants mobilisés, ainsi que la 140
d’animateurs communautaires formés.

Classes multigrades : La mise en œuvre de la stratégie de multi gradation durant le PEPT 1 a
permis d’améliorer la normalisation des écoles et la rétention scolaire. Même si le nombre de
classes multigrades a diminué sur la période, les effectifs ont sensiblement augmenté, passant
de 939 371 en 2005 à 974 814 en 2007. Les principales activités menées ont conduit aux
résultats suivants : (i) l’élaboration d’un module d’enseignement multigrade; (ii) la validation
et la diffusion de cinq fichiers autocorrectifs pour les classes multigrades; et (iii) la formation
des enseignants à l’utilisation des fichiers autocorrectifs.

(mathématiques, sciences naturelles et français) pour le collège. Soit un total de 9 910 000 manuels
pour un coût de près de 4 929 000 euros. On note également l’acquisition de 26 000 livres pour les
bibliothèques universitaires, 13 000 ouvrages pour les ENI, les matériels de laboratoire.

Réformes curriculaires et innovations : la rénovation des programmes de formation du primaire selon
l’approche par compétences et ceux des Institutions d’enseignement supérieur (IES) avec
l’introduction du système LMD.




                                                   66
Formation initiale des maîtres de l’élémentaire : (i) amélioration des programmes de
formation ; (ii) perfectionnement des formateurs des formateurs (PEN/CPMF) ; (iii) formation
de 8 263 instituteurs contractuels dont 3 752 femmes de 5 cohortes des ENI.

Projet d’Appui à la Rénovation Educative des Ecoles de Guinée (PAREEG) : Depuis le
démarrage du programme en 2002, toutes les écoles de la Guinée ont bénéficié de subventions
de fonctionnement. Aussi, 796 programmes d’écoles de Type A et 6 000 programmes
triennaux de développement de l’école (PTDE) ont été financés. De même, l’ensemble des
Délégations scolaires de l’enseignement élémentaire (DSEE) au nombre de 392 ont reçu des
subventions de fonctionnement et des subventions pour la formation continue des enseignants
dont le montant total se chiffre à 3,3 millions de dollars EU. Les subventions accordées aux
écoles pour la mise en œuvre des PTDE (projet de type C) ont permis d’améliorer: (i) les
enseignements/apprentissages grâce à la formation de proximité que les enseignants ont reçu ;
(ii) les conditions de travail de maîtres et élèves, notamment les travaux de réfection de
mobilier et des locaux d’un côté et de l’autre l’acquisition de manuels et de matériels
didactiques complémentaires ; (iii) la gestion administrative et financière ; (iv) et le
partenariat école-milieu.

Dans le cadre de la redynamisation des DSEE (projet de type D), 16 000 enseignants et leurs
Directeurs/directrices d’écoles ont bénéficié de formations répondant aux besoins qu’ils ont
eux-mêmes exprimés.

Fonds de recherche et d’innovation (FRI) : Entre 2002 et 2007, 120 projets et programmes
de recherches et d’innovation ont été financés pour amener les enseignants, en plus de leurs
cours dans les universités, à s’impliquer dans la recherche scientifique. Un montant total
d’environ 1 859 796 547 GNF ont été dépensés dans ce cadre.

Composante 3 : Gestion décentralisée

3.1. Gestion du personnel : (i) le développement et l’implantation de la base de données du
personnel au niveau des inspections régionales de l’éducation et institutions d’enseignement
supérieur et la formation des assistants gestionnaires à l’utilisation de la base;
(ii)l’assainissement du fichier du personnel du MEPU-EC; (iii) la fonctionnarisation des
contractuels, homologues et lauréats au FGA; (iv) l’autonomie pour les universités dans le
recrutement du personnel; et (v) l’audit des contractuels du MEPU-EC. L’implémentation des
bases de données de gestion des personnels du MEPU-EC et du MESRS a contribué à
l’amélioration du système d’information sur le personnel enseignant. Par contre, les
différentes opérations d’assainissement du fichier des personnels ont abouti à des résultats peu
satisfaisants, du fait de la persistance de difficultés en termes de maîtrise des effectifs et de la
masse salariale. Ces opérations mériteraient d’être poursuivies dans le futur programme. La
fonctionnarisation des contractuels, homologues et lauréats au FGA a permis leur fidélisation
aux postes, la régularité du service d’enseignement et l’arrêt des revendications.


3.2. Suivi des politiques, information et évaluation : (i) la réforme des examens ; (ii) (iv) la
restructuration des services déconcentrés de l’éducation ; (iii) le renforcement des capacités
des cadres des structures centrales et déconcentrées ainsi que des partenaires en planification
de l’éducation; (iv) l’installation de la base de données du primaire dans les structures
déconcentrées de l’éducation, dans les Directions nationales et services centraux ; (v) l’appui
au SSP dans la collecte, traitement et analyse des données ; (vi) la décentralisation du


                                                67
processus d’élaboration et d’actualisation de la carte scolaire ; (v) la finalisation de la base de
données du système d’information et de gestion (SIGEPT) du MET-FP ; (vii) l’amélioration
du pilotage au niveau de l’enseignement supérieur ;et (vi) l’étude sur la mise en place d’une
stratégie de communication au sein du secteur.

3.3. Gestion financière : (i) la budgétisation des programmes aux niveaux central, régional,
préfectoral et à l’école ; (ii) le développement d’un plan détaillé de décentralisation
financière ; (iii) la formation du personnel financier des IRE/DEV et DPE/DCE ; (iv) le
transfert graduel de la responsabilité des budgets de fonctionnement du centre au niveau
décentralisé ; (v) le développement des capacités d’audit dans les régions et préfectures ; et
(vi) la mise en place des régies d’avance des comptes à 90 jours et formation des SAAF des
IRE/DEV à la gestion des crédits aux procédures de l’IDA.

3.4. Renforcement des capacités physiques et administratives du secteur éducatif : (i)
l’élaboration d’une stratégie de renforcement des capacités, sur la base de l’exploitation des
outils du guide proposé par le Secrétariat du FTI avec l’appui technique et financier de la
GTZ ; (ii) l’appui à la mise en œuvre de la politique nationale de formation initiale et continue
des enseignants de l’élémentaire et du secondaire qui a permis la diffusion du document de
politique ; (iii) l’appui au développement des capacités des structures administratives et
scolaires par la construction et l’équipement des sièges des DPE de Télimélé, Lélouma et
Mali dans le cadre du programme EPTG ; (iv) la construction et équipement de six
bibliothèques universitaires de proximité à la place de la bibliothèque universitaire centrale
(BUC) ; (v) le fonctionnement des trois secrétariats techniques pour l’exécution du
programme ; (vi) l’acquisition des moyens logistiques (véhicules, motos et accessoires) et de
matériels informatiques, ainsi que de mobiliers de bureaux ; (vii) la formation des cadres des
structures à l’outil informatique ; (viii) l’organisation de multiples voyages d’études et de
stages de formation à l’étranger à l’intention des cadres à tous les niveaux ; et (ix) l’étude
architecturale du bâtiment administratif devant abriter et les structures techniques en charge
du secteur de l’éducation.

3.5. Préparation du PSE
Le processus de préparation du Programme Sectoriel de l’Education (PSE) a démarré en
2007. A cet effet, des documents stratégiques ont été produits et validés par le
Gouvernement : (i) la Lettre de politique sectorielle ; (ii) le Cadrage financier du secteur de
l’éducation et le Cadre logique du PSE. Il en est de même du Cadre de Dépenses à Moyen
Terme (CDMT) 2008-2010. Deux nouveaux outils de mise en œuvre ont été finalisés : le
Cadre de partenariat et la Lettre d’entente pour le Fonds commun.

Le don par le Secrétariat technique de l’IMOA-EPT en décembre 2007 (117,8 millions de
dollars US) auquel s’ajoutent les financements de l’AfD (12 millions d’Euros) et de la KfW
(32 millions d’Euros) ont constitué le Fonds commun du PSE qui a contribué avec les
ressources nationales à financer l’éducation de base sur la période 2008 à 2010.

III.   FACTEURS MAJEURS AYANT AFFECTE LE DEROULEMENT DU PROJET

L’insuffisance de la coordination et de l’harmonisation des interventions au sein d’un
ministère ou entre les Départements ministériels a réduit l’efficacité de nombreuses
actions du programme. Ce sont les cas de l’application des innovations pédagogiques, de
la formation continue des enseignants et de la formation pratique des élèves maîtres qui
devraient impliquer les services compétents des Ministères de l’enseignement technique,


                                                68
de l’enseignement pré-universitaire de l’enseignement supérieur et de la Fonction
Publique.

Par ailleurs, il n’est pas évident que les mesures incitatives et la rigueur dans la sélection
des candidats pour les ENI et l’ISSEG ainsi que les évaluations jusqu’à la certification
aient été suffisantes et appliquées correctement pour pouvoir rehausser la qualité des
élèves maitres et des élèves professeurs formés dans les institutions spécialisées.

Sur un autre plan, en matière d’évaluation des acquis des élèves et des étudiants, un des
aspects de l’assurance qualité, les avancées ont été perceptibles au niveau de
l’enseignement élémentaire. Toutefois, la difficulté majeure qui se présente est d’ordre
communicationnel et stratégique : elle concerne l’exploitation de résultats des
évaluations réalisées. En effet, il est paradoxal et très inquiétant de constater que les
nombreuses et importantes évaluations initiées par le MENRS avec l’appui constant de
la Banque Mondiale n’aient pas fait l’objet d’exploitation de façon explicite en dépit de
l’intérêt majeur qu’elles suscitent auprès des publics concernés, partenaires financiers,
acteurs clés du système éducatif, partenaires sociaux, etc. A cette situation s’est ajoutée
l’autarcie du système éducatif par rapport aux évaluations standardisées opérées
conjointement par plusieurs pays de la sous-région, notamment le PASEC. Ceci
constitue un facteur limitant les capacités des cadres parce que ne pouvant pas bénéficier
des méthodologies efficaces et avancées d’évaluation utilisées dans le cadre de la
coopération sous régionale d’une part, et l’absence de comparaisons avec les autres
systèmes éducatifs empêchent d’envisager les efforts à accomplir pour hisser la qualité
des apprentissages à un niveau acceptable.

Dans le domaine de la réalisation des infrastructures envisagées, des retards ont été
accusés dans l’exécution des contrats des travaux de construction à cause : de la faible
capacité de certaines entreprises et du suivi irrégulier de chantiers, des fréquentes
pénuries de matériaux essentiels, de l’augmentation intempestive des coûts des
matériaux et autres produits sur le marché, ainsi que des pesanteurs administratives et
financières (exonération des taxes et impôts, lenteurs dans la passation des marchés,
difficulté de mobilisation de la contrepartie nationale). Aussi, les changements
intempestifs de sites de construction et la difficulté de mobiliser la contribution
communautaire au financement des projets qui privilégient cette approche ont-ils
contribué aux retards.

Au niveau de l’enseignement supérieur, la problématique de la qualité est restée toujours
préoccupante au niveau de l’enseignement supérieur qui a connu un triplement de ses
effectifs d’étudiants (de 20 000 en 2001 à environ 60 000 en 2007). Les meilleures
conditions d’enseignement et d’apprentissage n’ont pas suivi cette expansion
quantitative car, les efforts d’amélioration des infrastructures, des équipements et des
ressources humaines ont été relativement modestes, pour ne pas dire en deçà des
exigences de qualité. Il en de même pour la prise d’initiatives en faveur de la formation
des enseignants du supérieur à cause du retard dans le développement des initiatives de
mise en place des études avancées (Master et Doctorat).

Il faut souligner aussi le phénomène d’expansion rapide de l’enseignement supérieur
privé, tant par le nombre d’établissements nouvellement créés que par l’accroissement
des effectifs bénéficiant de subventions publiques (environ 2 500 étudiants en 2007).



                                             69
Face à cette croissance, les problèmes de régulation de flux et d’assurance qualité se
posent avec acuité.

En outre, le recrutement des candidats aptes pour les institutions de formation des
formateurs a été caractérisé par le problème des faux dossiers, un obstacle persistant et a
abouti à l’existence de nombreux enseignants accusant des faiblesses académiques et
professionnelles à la sortie.
Enfin, une autre difficulté persistante a été située au niveau du recrutement et du
paiement à temps de nouveaux enseignants. Comme conséquence, le système éducatif
n’a pas été à mesure de recruter le nombre suffisant d’enseignants qu’il faut et le retard
du paiement des salaires a aussi engendré un taux important d’abandons de postes et un
manque d’attractivité du métier d’enseignant. Très peu de sanctions ont été prises à
l’issue des contrôles physiques de la présence des enseignants et le dispositif
d’implication des partenaires sociaux dans le contrôle des enseignants n’a eu qu’une
faible efficacité.

IV.    ANALYSE DES PERFORMANCES

5.1. Performance de l’emprunteur

Sur le plan de la performance des acteurs, la réalisation d’un programme complexe et
nécessitant des changements de comportements aura été un résultat majeur dénotant
aussi d’une capacité d’adaptation et d’apprentissage dans un processus contraignant sur
le plan de la durée de l’exécution et de la simultanéité des actions.

Un des exemples se rapporte à la mise en œuvre des activités de la stratégie de
renforcement de la gestion des ressources humaines qui ont débuté vers la fin de la
prorogation du PEPT mais a permis en peu de temps d’atteindre des objectifs
stratégiques assignés. Les cadres chargés de gérer les personnels au niveau central et
déconcentré ont pu s’approprier et appliquer de nouvelles procédures de mutations et
des affectations des enseignants en fonction des critères objectifs et équitables. Les
enseignants et autres personnels savent à présent dans quelles conditions leurs demandes
de mutations ou d’affectation sont traitées, satisfaites ou rejetées. Le redéploiement des
enseignants excédentaires opéré selon les critères privilégiant la fonction enseignante, le
respect des charges horaires normales et l’affectation à des groupes pédagogiques sans
maître, est la démonstration d’une volonté de rationaliser l’utilisation des personnels,
nonobstant des insuffisances constatées au niveau de la zone de Conakry où le
redéploiement a été fait de manière assez timide. Le renforcement des capacités a
contribué à l’amélioration des conditions rendement de travail et favorisé le passage de
la gestion manuelle à la gestion informatisée des personnels, grâce à l’utilisation de
l’informatique par les structures de GRH tant niveau central que déconcentrée et à
l’implantation des bases de données et leur mise à jour.

La mise en œuvre des stratégies innovantes en pédagogie et en multi gradation a été une
preuve positive de rehausser le niveau de scolarisation. Ces stratégies sont désormais
inscrites en bonne position parmi les bonnes pratiques d’amélioration de l’éducation
même si elles sont à perfectionner.

En ce qui concerne l’enseignement supérieur, les acteurs ont amorcé des changements
positifs, notamment dans les domaines de l’implantation des programmes rénovés selon


                                            70
l’approche par compétences avec le nouveau régime d’étude LMD, le démarrage des
filières professionnelles pilotes et le démarrage des programmes de licences
professionnelles.

Cependant, malgré les multiples efforts consentis par les acteurs et partenaires,
l’amélioration de la qualité des apprentissages des élèves demeure peu satisfaisante
parce que de nombreux élèves n’ont pas les compétences de base en lecture,
communication orale et écrite ou en calcul. Un certain nombre de raisons expliquent la
faible performance du système éducatif dans ce domaine entre autres : (i) la difficulté
de vulgariser les pédagogies adéquates à cause de l’émiettement des interventions des
services pérennes et des projets sur apports extérieurs ; (ii) la lenteur de la revitalisation
des inspections et suivi rapproché des enseignants et au niveau de la classe ; la
persistance de la difficulté à utiliser efficacement les manuels scolaires par les maîtres
en dispensant les cours ; (iv) l’absence de définition claire et précise des niveaux
acceptables de lecture, de l’écriture et de calcul en particulier et des critère d’école de
qualité de l’école en général.

En matière de financement public en faveur de l’éducation, le diagnostic du système
éducatif effectué, montre que les moyens financiers sont insuffisantes ou diminuent
d’année à alors que la population scolaire croît à un rythme soutenu (13,35 % en 2014,
17,23 % en 2005, 12,25 % en 2006 et 13,14 % en 2007). La nécessité d’inverser cette
tendance s’impose.

D’une façon général, on note : (i) des inadéquations entre différents ordres
d’enseignement ; (ii) la ventilation non optimale entre les catégories des dépenses ; (iii)
la forte centralisation de la gestion des ressources financières et matérielles au niveau
des services financiers centraux ; et (iv) la rareté des ressources au niveau des services
déconcentrés.

Enfin, à l’enseignement supérieur, en dépit du renforcement de l’autonomie de la gestion
financière des institutions de formation, l’essentiel des dépenses de fonctionnement des
établissements sont presqu’entièrement consacrés aux transferts sociaux au détriment
des investissements sur l’amélioration de la capacité d’accueil et de la qualité. Les
mesures de réforme du financement de l’enseignement supérieur n’ont pas changé la
situation parce qu’elles étaient limitées et leurs effets érodés par l’accroissement rapide
des effectifs des étudiants boursiers.
Il a été envisagé de mener des réformes politiques et institutionnelles pour créer un
cadre favorable à l’accélération de la scolarisation à l’amélioration de la qualité et au
renforcement de la gouvernance du système éducatif. La mise en œuvre de ces reformes
exigeait une volonté politique, un leadership et des stratégies de sensibilisation, de
persuasion et de mobilisation sociale, des attitudes et activités pas qui n’ont pas été
uniformément effectives dans tous les domaines.

Dans le cas de l’abolition des frais de scolaires dans les écoles primaires, des mesures
d’interdiction des prélèvements directs ont été prises avec plus ou moins de succès. Car,
les coûts directs et indirects de la scolarité ont continué de peser sur les familles
pauvres.La gratuité des manuels scolaires a allégé les charges des parents. La
privatisation de certaines fonctions de l’INRAP par rapport aux manuels scolaires
(impression, réimpression achat et distribution) a été un autre élément de réussite.




                                             71
La réforme LMD à l’enseignement supérieur a bénéficié de l’adhésion des enseignants
et étudiants grâce aux efforts d’information, de sensibilisation et à l’approche
participative.

Par contre, une certaine inertie des décideurs n’a pas permis de prendre des mesures
adéquates pour rendre possible la décentralisation de la gestion des maîtres, la
suppression de l’examen d’entrée en 7 e année et la réforme du financement de
l’enseignement supérieur (réduction de la part des bourses au profit des intrants
pédagogiques, de la recherche et de la formation ainsi que instauration de mécanismes
de recouvrement des coûts par la participation des bénéficiaires).

Des initiatives de réduction du redoublement ont été introduites (suppression de
redoublement dans les sous cycles du primaire (CP, CE, CM) mais peu appliquées à
cause d’un manque de sensibilisation des enseignants sur les méfaits du redoublement et
de leur formation pour gérer ces sous cycles.

5.2. Performance de la Banque Mondiale

Le PEPT s’inscrit dans la continuité de la coopération entre la Guinée et la Banque
Mondiale dans le secteur de l’éducation à la différence que cette fois ci son intervention
touche les différents ministères en même temps. Les défis d’articulation et de mener de
façon cohérente toutes les actions concernaient aussi bien les acteurs du programme que
l’équipe de supervision de la Banque Mondiale. A terme, les réalisations ont abouti à
faire avancer les progrès de l’éducation dans les différents sous-secteurs et ordre
d’enseignement même si la durée de la mise en œuvre a été plus longue que prévue et
que la restructuration nous a éloigné de certains objectifs initiaux.

Dans l’ensemble, la qualité de la supervision par l’IDA a été satisfaisante à cause de son
timing, de sa pertinence et de sa contribution à la résolution des difficultés rencontrées.
Les appuis conseils prodigués dans le cadre du partenariat technique ont permis de
corriger des lacunes, d’impulser le processus et d’encourager la prise de décisions sur
les questions de reformes.

Grâce à la perspicacité de certains TTL et consultants de l’IDA, des sujet de réforme
jusque-là évités ont été abordés et traités avec l’ambition d’opérer les changements
nécessaires. Il s’agit par exemple du cas des transferts sociaux et du régime académique
dans l’enseignement supérieur. L’expertise de la Banque et celle mobilisée par elle ont
favorisé l’introduction des innovations dans les domaines de la pédagogie et de la
gestion et qui ont eu des impacts positifs sur la qualité, la programmation des ressources
et les méthodes de travail.

Cependant, la supervision par l’IDA a enregistré des changements successifs de Chargés
de projet (TTL) et de leurs équipes, dès fois à des intervalles de temps assez
rapprochées. Cette situation a entraîné des moments d’attentisme et de retard dans la
poursuite des actions. Ces changements de superviseurs expliquent en partie les mesures
visant à rediriger et à redimensionner le projet entraînant même la suppression de
certaines activités majeures telles que la construction du siège administratif des
Ministères de l’éducation, la construction de la Bibliothèque Universitaire Centrale pour
ne citer que celles-là.

     V.    IMPACTS DU PROGRAMME


La mise en œuvre du PEPT a permis d’avoir des impacts visibles dans la scolarisation aux
différents niveaux du système éducatif, dans la formation et la recherche, dans la gestion des
ressources humaines et sur la réduction de la pauvreté. Ces résultats ont été obtenus grâce à la
mobilisation d’acteurs traditionnels et non traditionnels de l’éducation au cours des dernières
décennies. La mise en œuvre projet s’est traduit par l’augmentation significative de la
capacité d’accueil suite à la construction d’infrastructures, d’une amélioration de la qualité par
la fourniture de manuels et de formation des personnels ainsi que l’introduction d’innovations
dans la l’organisation et la gestion pédagogique des classes.

6.1. Au niveau du préscolaire

En plus de vingt centres d’encadrement communautaire (CEC) construits et équipés avant
2007, la capacité d’accueil s’est accrue de 70 nouveaux CEC 46 permettant d’inscrire 4560
nouveaux enfants en 2008. A ce résultat s’ajoute la formation d’éducateurs et éducatrices sur
les méthodes d’éducation parentale. Ces activités auront des impacts positifs sur la demande
de scolarisation particulièrement dans leurs zones d’implantation.

6.2. Au Primaire

La réalisation d’infrastructures a permis d’augmenter de façon significative la capacité
d’accueil en zones rurales et la réduction de la taille des groupes pédagogiques qui ont
favorisé une amélioration substantielle des principaux indicateurs de ce niveau
d’enseignement. Les actions ont porté sur la poursuite et l’achèvement des projets de
construction et d’équipement prenant en compte les zones défavorisées en vue de
l’accélération de la scolarisation des filles et la réduction du nombre d’écoles à cycles
incomplets. Plus significatif est la tendance à généraliser la construction de puits améliorés
pour les points d’eau et de blocs de latrines séparées pour garçons et filles.

Comparés à l’année de base (2001), les indicateurs, notamment ceux de l’accès ont connu une
hausse, même si une tendance à la stagnation s’observe depuis 2008. C’est le cas, notamment
des nouvelles inscriptions en première année (CP1), de la scolarisation des filles ainsi que des
enfants des zones rurales. Pour les Taux bruts de scolarisation (TBS) et les Taux nets de
scolarisation (TNS), la situation a été améliorée de manière significative.

Concernant la multi-gradation, la stratégie a permis la normalisation des écoles et
l’amélioration de la qualité. Il y a eu notamment : (i) l’organisation d’ateliers sur l’élaboration
de modules d’enseignement multigrade; (ii) la validation de fichiers autocorrectifs pour les
classes multigrades ; (iii) la formation des enseignants à l’utilisation des fichiers
autocorrectifs ; ainsi que (iv) l’impression et la distribution de ces fichiers autocorrectifs.

Globalement, l’enseignement primaire privé a évolué de façon significative pour atteindre
24,71% des effectifs du primaire en 2008 contre 20% en 2001. Le nombre d’écoles
communautaires a également enregistré des progrès durant la période. Toutefois, malgré les
efforts fournis par les différents acteurs dans les constructions de salles de classe, la taille des

     20 avec l’UNICEF, 6 avec le CCF Guinée et 17 avec des ONG locales


                                                     73
groupes pédagogiques est restée élevée, notamment à Conakry, dans les capitales régionales
et certaines villes du pays. La réalisation des infrastructures a créé des emplois temporaires
pour les métiers du bâtiment ainsi que des emplois permanents pour les enseignants qui seront
recrutés pour tenir des salles de classe.

6.3. Au Secondaire

La réalisation d’infrastructures (7 collèges modernes de 12 salles de classe chacun dans la
zone spéciale de Conakry et environs) a permis d’augmenter la capacité d’accueil au premier
cycle du secondaire. L’effectif des élèves a connu un accroissement annuel moyen de 4,6%
contre 14,0% au privé. Au niveau du lycée, l’accroissement annuel moyen a été de 6,6%
contre 19,5% au privé. Il se dégage que l’accroissement des effectifs dans le privé a été plus
important que dans le secteur public.

L’expérimentation et la mise en œuvre des projets d’école a montré le potentiel que son
extension représente pour l’amélioration de la qualité des enseignements apprentissages pour
ce niveau d’enseignement. Par ailleurs, le nombre de salles de classe s’est accru globalement
de 12,3 % sur la période. Par contre en dépit des efforts en matière de recrutement de
personnel enseignant, force est de noter que les besoins en enseignants restent importants.

6.4. Au niveau de l’ETF

Dans le sous-secteur de l’enseignement technique/professionnel, le PEPT a permis la
construction de 3 écoles normales d’instituteurs à Faranah, Boké et Dubréka. À cela s’ajoutent
(i) l’extension des ENI de Conakry et de Nzérékoré, (ii) l’acquisition des équipements
complémentaires pour toutes les ENI et (iii) la formation initiale des maîtres de l’élémentaire
qui figure parmi les priorités dans ce sous-secteur. En plus, il y a eu la formation des
professeurs d’école normale (PEN) et des conseillers pédagogiques maîtres formateurs
(CMPF). Ces actions ont créé les conditions pour accroître l’offre de formation du personnel
enseignant de l’élémentaire. Le programme a également contribué à la révision des modules
de formation utilisés par les PEN 47 dans les ENI.

6.5. Au niveau de l’ESRS


Au niveau de l’enseignement supérieur et de la recherche scientifique, des progrès notables
ont été enregistrés. La réforme des programmes d’enseignement des IES, la construction et
l’équipement de 5 bibliothèques de proximité (Boké, Kindia, Conakry, Nzérékoré, Kankan)
ont permis l’implantation du système LMD. Aussi, la mise en place d’un fonds de recherche
et d’innovation (FRI) a permis de créer et de dynamiser des réseaux de chercheurs autour de
thématiques d’intérêt national. Concernant le pilotage, la gestion des étudiants et des
ressources humaines a été améliorée à travers l’implantation d’un logiciel au niveau des
services de scolarité et la mise en place de tableaux de bord. En vue d’aider à la formulation
des politiques et à la rationalisation des systèmes et des procédures, un centre d’analyse
économique et opérationnelle a été créé et rendu fonctionnel.

6.6. Au niveau de l’Alphabétisation et de l’éducation non formelle
En matière d’alphabétisation, la stratégie de faire-faire a été privilégiée. Elle a permis la mise
en place de Réseaux d’ONG spécialisées en alphabétisation (REGA et PAMOJA). Plus de
40 000 membres d’associations et de groupements, de coopératives ont été alphabétisés. Le
financement des activités génératrices de revenus en faveur des groupements féminins a
permis la pérennisation des activités d’alphabétisation et l’augmentation des revenus des
bénéficiaires, contribuant ainsi à la réduction de la pauvreté.

VI.       CONCLUSION

Globalement, au regard de ce qui précède, il ressort clairement que la mise en œuvre des
activités du PEPT a largement contribué aux objectifs d’éducation assignés au programme.
Les acquis se traduisent par (i) l’accroissement de la capacité d’accueil à tous les niveaux, (ii)
l’amélioration de la qualité de la formation initiale et continue des enseignants, (iii)
l’accroissement du ratio manuels/élève, (iv) la rénovation de programmes d’enseignement du
primaire basée sur l’approche par compétences et (v) la construction des bibliothèques
universitaires et la réforme des programmes des IES pour l’implantation du système LMD.
Toutefois, l’atteinte de l’objectif de scolarisation primaire universelle reste tributaire de la
mobilisation davantage de ressources humaines et financière ainsi que de la pérennisation des
expériences réussies.


7.1. Pérennisation des acquis du programme


Il convient de souligner que d’importants acquis ont été obtenus sous le PEPT et
méritent d’être pérennisés pour garantir l’atteinte des objectifs prioritaires du secteur de
l’Education notamment la scolarisation universelle au primaire.

      ⁻   Des approches de construction scolaires (PME, ONG, Communautaire) ont été
          testées pour pouvoir atteindre les objectifs fixés. Chacune des approches a permis
          non seulement de renforcer les capacités des différents intervenants aussi bien du
          privé, de la société civile que ceux communautaires mais aussi d’offrir de
          l’emploi à des milliers de personnes. Les expériences acquises avec ces
          approches méritent d’être capitalisées et poursuivies dans les programmes futurs.

      ⁻   La stratégie du faire-faire en alphabétisation a été utilisée pour alphabétiser plus
          de 40 000 personnes avec les services d’ONG en alpha. Compte tenu du nombre
          important d’analphabètes à toucher dans le futur, la poursuite de cette stratégie
          doit être dynamisée et implémentée dans l’optique de la réduction de la pauvreté
          au niveau notamment des femmes organisées en associations et des jeunes avec le
          couplage de l’alphabétisation aux activités génératrices de revenus (AGR).

      ⁻   L’octroi de subventions aux structures déconcentrées (IRE, DPE/DCE, DSEE et
          aux écoles) a favorisé le fonctionnement de ces structures à travers le
          renforcement des capacités des cadres en gestion d’une part, et en planification,
          programmation et budgétisation, d’autre part. Cette pratique, impliquant la
          communauté et les structures décentralisées, mérite d’être poursuivie en appui
          aux efforts de l’Etat pour offrir des services scolaires de qualité dans la prochaine
          phase du PEPT.



                                               75
   ⁻   Des efforts importants ont été consentis pour l’achat et la distribution gratuite des
       manuels et matériels scolaires durant cette phase. Cette activité a permis de
       rehausser le ratio élève/manuel et de soulager les parents dans la scolarisation de
       leurs enfants. Compte tenu de l’impact du manuel scolaire sur les résultats
       scolaires, du taux non négligeable de déperdition de ces manuels notamment au
       primaire et de la pauvreté des parents, la pérennisation de cette action s’avère
       nécessaire pour l’atteinte des objectifs de l’EPT. Aussi, la conception et
       l’élaboration des manuscrits de manuels par des auteurs nationaux, rendant le
       ministère propriétaire des copyright, méritent d’être poursuives.

7.2. Leçons apprises


1- Si les services de consultants financés par le PEPT ont contribué à plusieurs
   réalisations, l’absence de transferts de compétence aux cadres et équipes guinéens a
   laissé peu de chances à la responsabilisation des services pérennes dans la gestion du
   programme. Pour corriger cette insuffisance, les futurs plans d’actions de
   renforcement des capacités devront comporter l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre des
   plans de transfert de compétences pour tous les services de consultants.

2- Malgré la cohérence du cadre politique (lettre de politique sectorielle) avec la vision
   programme, la coordination et l’articulation des réformes et des activités entre les
   différents services n’ont pas été suffisantes durant la vie du programme. D’où la
   nécessité de renforcer la cohérence entre le cadre institutionnel et opérationnel avec
   l’approche programme. Ce qui suppose le fonctionnement correct et régulier des
   organes et instances sectoriels de pilotage, de coordination et de suivi des actions. La
   prise en compte des indications du CDMT dans la planification et la budgétisation des
   ressources publiques est également une réponse adéquate au divorce entre l’emploi
   des ressources et les priorités sectorielles.

3- La poursuite des efforts de déconcentration et de décentralisation de la gestion de
   l’éducation apparaît davantage comme étant une condition primordiale pour
   l’amélioration des services éducatifs. Développer le partenariat entre les structures
   étatiques d’une part et les organisations de la société civile et les collectivités locales
   de l’autre permet de déléguer des ressources et des responsabilités de plus en plus
   importantes aux ONG et aux communautés dans les constructions scolaires, la gestion
   des ressources humaines, matérielles et financières pour ne citer que celles-là.

4- Pour éviter les problèmes constatés dans le programme de constructions scolaires
   (retard, déficit de qualité), le dispositif de supervision et de contrôle mérite d’être
   renforcé au niveau de tous les modes opératoires (PME, ONG, communautaire).

5- La combinaison de stratégies de formation continue des enseignants permettra de
   surmonter l’efficacité limitée d’une seule approche. Il s’agit de la formation
   présentielle, la formation à distance, la supervision pédagogique du réinvestissement
   des connaissances par les enseignants dans leur pratique de classe ainsi que
   l’encadrement de proximité.
