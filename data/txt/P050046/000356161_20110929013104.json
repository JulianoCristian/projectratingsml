recipient in its efforts to improve the\n            conditions for teaching and learning in its territory,\n            through 1) expanded access to education, 2) enhanced quality\n            of learning, and 3) strengthened capacity for decentralized\n            management of the sector. The changes are: a) revision of\n            the project development objective to take account of the\n            revised priorities in the education sector; b) revision of\n            component three to be aligned with the revised objective and\n            including the activities to be financed under the additional\n            financing; c) revision of component one to include the\n            maintenance costs of the lower secondary schools (colleges);\n            d) revision of cost estimates per component; e) revision of\n            the implementation arrangement in alignment with those from\n            the EFA Fast Track Initiative (FTI) Catalytic Fund (CF); and\n            f) reallocation of grant proceeds. The restructuring will\n            ensure the positive impact of new investments in the sector,\n            including the US$40 million grant from the EFA FTI CF.
