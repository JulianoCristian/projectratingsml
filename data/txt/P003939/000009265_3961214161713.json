the Second Higher Education\n            Development Project in Indonesia are as follows: overall\n            outcome of the project was rated satisfactory, and the\n            performance of the Bank and the Borrower were also rated\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned: 1) project investments are\n            likely to have large and sustained developmental effects,\n            while the operation's positive outcomes and the\n            problems encountered guided the Bank's future strategy\n            in higher education; and 2) little consideration was given\n            during project preparation to how investments were to be\n            utilized and sustained. The project implementation unit was\n            effective in implementing project inputs but had no mandate\n            to assess utilization and impact of project investments. It\n            would have been more efficient if: (a) the project had been\n            financially integrated relying at least in part, on existing\n            sources of finance at the university level, sources that\n            would still be there after the end of the project; (b)\n            planning of the project has been based on specific\n            objectives as spelled out by the universities themselves;\n            and (c) the universities not only had the responsibility of\n            implementing the project but were also responsible for\n            efficiently deploying the investments and routinely\n            reporting on utilization and impact."}, "docdt": "1996-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
