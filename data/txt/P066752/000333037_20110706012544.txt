                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the US$8 million National
System of Protected Areas Project (GEF-SNAP) that was financed by the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) and executed by the World Bank. Two GEF Trust Fund
grants were made: a US$3.7 million GEF grant to the Ministry of the Environment
(Ministerio del Ambiente or MAE) to ensure the conservation and management of
Ecuador’s biodiversity for socially sustainable development by strengthening the national
protected areas system (SNAP for Sistema Nacional de Areas Protegidas); and a US$4.3
million GEF Trust Fund grant to the National Environment Fund (Fondo Ambiental
Nacional or FAN) to create a stable, long-term source of endowment funding to support
SNAP. Total co-financing of MAE and FAN amounted to US$36.6 million comprising,
in addition to GEF’s 22 percent contribution, funds from the Government of Germany
(KfW, US$8.3 million), the Inter-American Development Bank (US$5.0 million), and the
Netherlands (US $2.3 million). Counterpart funds amounted to US$7.3 million. A further
US$5.7 million came as parallel financing from national and international environmental
NGOs. The GEF-SNAP Project was approved by the Bank’s Board on November 26,
2002, but did not become effective until December 16, 2003. The grant closed four years
later on December 31, 2007.

This PPAR was prepared by Richard Carlos Worden, IEG Senior Environmental
Specialist. The peer reviewer was Lauren Kelly and the panel reviewer was John Heath.
The findings are based on a mission in February 2011, which included visits to two
protected areas within SNAP where project activities were conducted (the Cotacacchi-
Cayapas Ecological Reserve and Machalilla National Park). Meetings and interviews
were held with national project implementing agencies, project partners and beneficiaries
in Quito and at the two sites. Mission preparations included reviewing project documents,
and initial planning discussions with Bank project staff and implementing partners.

The IEG team would like to acknowledge the time and assistance provided by the
Government of Ecuador in the MAE, and many dedicated World Bank and park service
staff as well. Special thanks go to Sras. Ana Maria Villaquiran and Gabriela Arcos at the
World Bank office in Ecuador for all the assistance they provided to the mission. In
addition, the time and insights of Sr. Galo Rosales and the staff of Cotacacchi-Cayapas
Ecological Reserve, Sr. Roddy Macías, Fernando Vera and Vincente Alvarez in
Machalilla National Park were also greatly appreciated.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. No comments were
received.

Summary

Ecuador is one of 17 “mega-diverse” countries in the world and one of five in South
America (the others being Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela). Although it
represents only 0.2 percent of world landmass it contains 18 percent of all bird species,
10 percent of amphibians, and 8 percent of mammals. The Galapagos Islands were the
site of the first national park in Ecuador, established by presidential decree in 1936. A
new National System of Protected Areas (SNAP) was inaugurated in 1976. The Ministry
of the Environment (MAE), created in 1999, is charged with the sustainable
management of SNAP, and is required under the new Constitution (Article 405) to
“allocate the financial resources needed to ensure the system’s financial sustainability
and foster the participation of the communities.”

The GEF-SNAP Project addressed many issues left unresolved by its predecessor, the
Biodiversity Conservation Project (1994-2000). These issues included weak institutional
capacity, inadequate financing, flawed operational guidelines, inconsistent practices for
managing protected areas, and inadequate enforcement of existing laws and regulations.

The objective of the project was “to ensure the conservation and management of
Ecuador's biodiversity for socially sustainable development by strengthening the
National System of Protected Areas.” The means to achieve this objective were “through
improving the legal, institutional and financial foundations and capacities for the
integrated, participatory management of protected areas.”

With respect to improving the legal and institutional foundation of the SNAP, project
results were limited. The Biodiversity Strategy was adopted as a ministerial decree by
MAE in 2001 before the start of the project. However, a Biodiversity Law proposed to
Ecuador’s Congress that same year based upon the Strategy has not yet been passed. The
set of legal instruments comprising the “adequate environmental framework” that was
required to be implemented within two years of the date of effectiveness by the Bank as
a condition of approving the grant was passed in July 2006, but since then several of the
seven elements of that framework are not currently active or in effect, such as the
participatory management committees, and re-investment of self-generated fees or
telecommunication infrastructure fees in protected areas. The SNAP Strategic Plan was
adopted by MAE as a Ministerial Decree one month before project closing providing
policy guidance for MAE’s management of the SNAP and a strategic framework for
orienting donor assistance. It was submitted to the President of the Republic, but was
never signed as a Presidential Decree. Components of the complex monitoring and
evaluation system (SIG-SNAP and BMS) that the project supported were not operating
at the time of the IEG mission, and IEG found no evidence that the National
Biodiversity Directorate (DNB) had taken full advantage of project efforts to build its
capacity to plan, control and monitor the management of the SNAP.

On the other hand, the project did realize its goal of creating an improved financial
foundation for SNAP. A Protected Areas Trust Fund (FAP) was created, and the target
of raising US$13.5 million in endowments by project closing was exceeded (FAP now
                                            viii


contains US$19.5 million). Disbursement and cost recovery targets were also exceeded:
11 SNAP reserves and parks were funded (the target was 9); and 15 percent of their
operating costs were covered (compared to the 14 percent target). FAP now disburses 25
percent more than it did in 2007. However, recent government policies regarding entry
fees, concession tariffs, and re-investment of a portion of revenues generated by
protected areas have undermined the system’s financial self-sufficiency.

Finally, in terms of DNB’s capacity to manage the SNAP in an integrated and
participatory manner, the results were modest. The participatory management
commissions (PMC) and concession operations did not work well, and have not become
useful models for replication elsewhere in SNAP. The PMCs set up by the project
stopped operating once project funds ended in 2007, and were inactive at the time of the
IEG assessment mission. The concession services established at the two sites provide
services to tourists. However, contrary to appraisal expectations, they have not generated
significant revenues locally. Nor lightened the workload of SNAP staff because of the
level of supervision they require. Therefore, the achievement of the project’s overall
objective to ensure the conservation and management of Ecuador’s biodiversity by
strengthening SNAP was modest.

Project Ratings
IEG rates Outcome as moderately unsatisfactory. In view of Ecuador’s unique global
status as a repository of species diversity the relevance of the project objective was
substantial, and the relevance of project design was substantial since the project’s
components, activities and inputs in relation to the project’s objectives were
conceptually sound and logical. The efficacy of the project was rated modest because, as
noted above, only one of three intermediate results (creating an endowment fund) was
fully achieved; system-wide institutional strengthening and legal reform as well as
participatory management of the two pilot protected areas were modest. Thus, limited
progress was made toward the overall objective of ensuring the conservation and
management of Ecuador’s biodiversity by strengthening the SNAP. The efficiency of
resource use was also modest for three reasons: first, project outputs were less than
expected without any savings in costs; second, no allowance was made for measuring
the cost effectiveness of protected area management relative to systems in other
countries; and, third, institutional deficiencies led to implementation delays.

Risk to Development Outcome is rated significant. DNB’s long-term management
capacity and the legal and regulatory framework that are an essential underpinning of
future effective management of SNAP remain weak. Although the project exceeded its
outcome targets with respect to sustainable financing of SNAP, there is still a 57 percent
shortfall in covering the basic operating costs of SNAP. No new donations have been
made to the endowment fund since 2008. The recent reduction in park entry fees,
concession tariffs, and retention of a portion of self-generated revenues at individual
sites has further reduced prospects for the long-term financial sustainability of SNAP.

Bank Performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Quality at entry was
compromised by the failure to take sufficient steps to increase the capacity of MAE to
implement the project. During supervision, the Bank acted swiftly to intervene and
                                            ix


secure their replacement when project management staff members performed poorly at
the beginning of the project. In addition, the Bank did successfully support preparation
of a vital system-wide Financial Needs Assessment as well as the SNAP Strategic Plan
and management plans at the two pilot protected areas. However, the Bank was slow to
respond to obvious shortcomings in the PMCs at the two pilot sites, and to the unclear
division of responsibilities between the two implementing agencies, FAN and MAE.

Borrower Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Government met its
counterpart funding obligations and provided the seed money needed to attract more
than US$18 million in matching funds from external donors. But the government was
also responsible for a lack of continuity in policies and leadership that hampered
achievement of the project objective. The two implementing agencies performed very
differently. MAE was unable to effectively carry out the project activities for which it
was responsible. Conversely, FAN successfully discharged its responsibility for creating
and administrating an endowment fund for SNAP.

Lessons Learned
In designing participatory models for protected area management, the Bank needs to
draw upon successful experiences in other countries. The PMCs and private sector
concessions set up at the two pilot SNAP sites did not work well, and did not contribute
to improved management of these protected areas. While the need for input from
stakeholders is indisputable, the manner in which it is integrated into park management
decisions requires further thought and experimentation. Better results may have been
achieved if other successful models had been assessed in terms of Ecuador’s
circumstances during preparation and appraisal, such as the Indigenous Management of
Protected Areas Project in the Peruvian Amazon or the Natural Protected Areas Project
in Mexico.

Support for protected areas needs to be based upon a careful analysis of their revenue
and expenditure streams over time to estimate the minimum amount required for their
sound management as part of the whole system. The Financial Needs Analysis of the
SNAP was very useful by revealing the shortfall between current public expenditures for
the system (US $2.7 million) and the minimum amount required for its operation (US
$6.3 million). An updated financial analysis, coupled with an estimation of the economic
benefits that flow to local and national economies from protected areas (environmental
services, foreign exchange earnings from tourism, etc.), can strengthen the case for
adequately funding protected areas elsewhere.

Non-profit, private sector institutions can serve the public interest by independently
managing endowment funds for protected areas. In this case, a private sector entity
(FAN) administered the Protected Areas Fund (FAP) effectively and efficiently. It
provides an alternative model to public management that might be applied elsewhere in
situations where transparency and freedom from political influence is at a premium.

Effective management of protected area systems requires sustainable financing to
ensure basic operating costs are covered for all of the protected areas within the
system. With the exception of the Galapagos Marine Reserve and National Park which
                                            x


do not share any of the revenues they generate with the rest of Ecuador’s protected areas
system despite raising 4.8 times as much as the other 34 SNAP sites combined, the other
protected areas in Ecuador are “severely and chronically underfunded” below their basic
needs, according to the Financial Needs Analysis conducted by the Ministry, FAN, and a
group of NGOs in 2005. In contrast to the Galapagos, all the other protected areas within
SNAP must remit 100 percent of the revenues they generate to the national treasury and
receive only 30 percent of government fiscal support (the other 70 percent goes to the
Galapagos). Thus, an appropriate revenue-sharing arrangement is not in place nor is the
support provided by the government to SNAP sufficient at this time.

1. Background
1.1     Ecuador is one of 17 “mega-diverse” countries in the world; and one of five in
South America (the others being Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela) in terms of its
biological diversity (biodiversity).1 Although it represents only 0.2 percent of the
world’s land surface, it contains more than 18 percent of the planet’s bird species, 10
percent of its amphibians, and 8 percent of its mammals. This rich biodiversity is now
threatened by expansion of the agricultural frontier, mining, oil exploration and
production, major infrastructure works, commercial shrimp farming and fisheries, and
timber extraction.

1.2    The first national park in Ecuador was created in 1936 by presidential decree to
preserve and protect the Galapagos Islands and surrounding marine area. However,
another 30 years passed before a second protected area, the Geo-Botanical Reserve of
Puluahua, was added to Ecuador’s protected area system by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Over the next 40 years, responsibility for managing these protected areas was poorly
defined, shifting from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Production and then
back again to the Ministry of Agriculture between 1960 and 1975. The regulatory, legal
and policy framework was also weak.

1.3     In 1976, the Ministry of Agriculture, acting with international donor assistance,
proposed a Preliminary Strategy for Conserving the outstanding Wildlands of Ecuador
(Estrategia Preliminar para la Conservación de Areas Silvestres Sobresalientes de
Ecuador). This led to a re-thinking of the role of these areas, shifting the emphasis from
commercial exploitation that had dominated national economic development and
planning processes up to that time to conservation.

1.4    The 1976 Strategy for Protected Areas created six new national parks and seven
new reserves. A new National System of Protected Areas (SNAP) evolved over the
course of the next thirteen years. There are now 33 sites within SNAP, excluding the
Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve, which were given special legal status by
Presidential decree (Ley de Regimen Especial No. 278) in 1996. This decree set it apart
from other units of SNAP administratively and financially, allowing it to retain 95
percent of self-generated revenues, due to its unique ecological and historic and strategic
importance to Ecuador as an international tourist destination.

1.5    An amendment to this Special Law (Ley de Reforma Orgánica del Regimen
Municipal No. 429) in 2004 eliminated the remaining five percent contribution of
revenues that the Galapagos shared with the other sites in SNAP. Thus, as this project
was being designed and appraised, addressing the serious funding shortfall of SNAP and
securing a stable source of long-term financial support for it was of paramount
importance.

1.6    In 1989, a second national strategy was unveiled, placing greater emphasis on
analyzing the representativeness of all the country’s eco-regions within the SNAP, the
contribution of each park to system’s conservation objectives, and the provision of
1
    World Wildlife Fund.
                                                    2


environmental goods and services for society at large. This strategy also promoted
community participation in land-use planning activities and decisions involving the
conservation of protected areas.

1.7     In 1991, the Ecuadorian Institute of Forestry, Natural Areas and Wildlife
(INEFAN) was created within the Ministry of Agriculture. INEFAN became the leading
national authority in the conservation field, helping to build a national consensus that
natural areas should primarily be conserved rather than commercially exploited. The
following year a national environmental commission (CAAM) was formed, leading in
1996 to the creation of a new Ministry of the Environment (MAE), which incorporated
the functions and staff of INEFAN.

1.8     In 1998, Ecuador’s newly approved Constitution declared that SNAP’s purpose
was to “guarantee the conservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of ecological
services in accordance with Ecuador’s obligations under international agreements.”2
The 1999 Strategic Plan expanded the system of protected areas to include regional,
municipal and privately-held protected areas, and involving regional development
cooperatives and the private sector more in their management. It called this system the
National Patrimony of Natural Areas (PANE). It is larger than SNAP and currently
comprises 45 sites, including 11 National Parks, 10 Wildlife Refuges, four Biological
Reserves, National Recreational Areas, and Wildlife Reproductive Areas each, nine
Ecological Reserves, two Marine Reserves, and one Geobotanic Reserves covering
nearly 4.8 million hectares or 17 percent of Ecuador’s land area.

1.9     There are also 44 important buffer zones known as “special areas” or “protective
forests” that act as de facto conservation corridors and are not part of SNAP. There are
three classes of protective forests (medium, high and very high priority), encompassing
over half a million hectares (543,100 ha). The following year MAE presented a new
Strategic Plan for SNAP with assistance provided under the first GEF-supported
Biodiversity Protection Project. Although this proposal was never passed by Ecuador’s
Congress, it served as a reference point for the functioning and operation of SNAP over
the next several years. In 2006, the current Strategic Plan for SNAP was created by
MAE, with assistance from the current GEF-SNAP Project. It also has never been
officially approved as state policy.

1.10 In 2008, the voters of Ecuador approved a new Constitution. Under Article 405,
it states that, “The national system of protected areas shall guarantee the conservation of
biodiversity and the maintenance of ecological functions. The system shall be comprised
of state, decentralized autonomous, community and private subsystems, and it shall be
directed and regulated by the State. The State shall allocate the financial resources
needed to ensure the system’s financial sustainability, and shall foster the participation
of the communities, peoples, and nations who have their ancestral dwelling places in the
protected areas in their administration and management.”3

1.11 Ecuador also has twelve coastal and two marine protected areas (including the
National Park and Marine Reserve of the Galapagos Archipelago), covering over 1.5
million hectares. Of these fourteen sites, eleven are also designated as “wetlands of
international importance,” according to the criteria established by the International
Convention on Wetlands (RAMSAR, 1971). The wetland sites include Machalilla
National Park (MNP), which is located on the central coastline of Ecuador, and was one
of two parks targeted for pilot activities by the project. A map of Ecuador’s National
System of Protected Areas is presented in Figure 1 at the back of the report in Annex C.

Related World Bank and Donor Assistance Projects
1.12 Prior to the project assessed here, the World Bank had gained several years of
experience supervising similar projects in Ecuador and throughout Latin America,
progressively developing its expertise in working with local NGOs and communities to
implement GEF medium- and small-sized projects.

1.13 The most important of these previous projects was the US $8.3 million GEF
grant-supported Biodiversity Protection Project (GEF No. 28700-EC), which became
effective in mid-1994 and closed at the end of March, 2000. This project provided
financial and technical support to strengthen INEFAN (the predecessor to MAE, which
was created in 1996 as part of a government overhaul of the country’s weak
environmental management system). The project sponsored a review of Ecuador’s legal
and regulatory framework, comparing it to other countries. It also supported public
education and outreach activities, and prepared management plans and infrastructure
improvements at the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve, as well as at seven
other SNAP sites. These sites included the two sites that were later targeted to pilot
participatory co-management approaches under this follow-on project: Machalilla
National Park, and the Cotacacchi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve.

2. Ecuador’s Protected Areas System Project
2.1     Much of the rationale for the GEF-SNAP Project was based on addressing
several issues that had been left unresolved by its predecessor, the Biodiversity
Conservation Project of 1994 – 2000. These issues included weak institutional capacity
and the lack of a stable source of SNAP financing, lack of an operational national policy
and consistent practices for managing protected areas, and inadequate enforcement of
existing laws and regulations. The GEF-SNAP Project (henceforth, “the project”) had an
almost identical rationale and set of objectives as its predecessor.

2.2     Bank support of the project sought to address : (i) the continuing threats to
protected areas and biodiversity, (ii) unresolved conflicts with local landowners and
communities over ambiguity of land tenure and boundaries in areas next to or within
protected areas, (iii) lack of enforcement of compatible land-uses in buffer zones, (iv)
weak institutional capacity of MAE, and (v) the lack of sustained financing for MAE to
adequately manage SNAP sites, especially since the new amendment to the Special Law
                                                             4


of the Galapagos Islands had completely cut off the sharing of any revenues (the final 5
percent) from the Galapagos Islands to the other sites within the SNAP. 4

Project Objectives and Design
OBJECTIVES

2.3      The Project's Development Objective (PDO) and Global Environmental
Objective (GEO), as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) are identical: “to ensure the conservation and
management of Ecuador's biodiversity for socially sustainable development by
strengthening the National System of Protected Areas through improving the legal,
institutional and financial foundations and capacities for the integrated, participatory
management of protected areas.”5 The statement of objectives in the GEF Trust Fund
Grant Agreement (TF-051537) was identical, but it did not outline the means by which
the objective would be achieved. It simply stated the objective as: “to ensure the
conservation and management of Ecuador’s biodiversity for socially sustainable
development through the strengthening of SNAP.”

2.4     For the purposes of this evaluation, the following three intermediate outcomes
will be used to assess the project in terms of achieving its project development objective.
Specifically, the project will be assessed in terms of:

          Improving institutional and legal foundation of the SNAP;

          Improving the financial foundation of the SNAP; and

          Improving the capacities for the integrated, participatory management of SNAP.

2.5    The extent to which these three intermediate outcomes were achieved will
determine whether the objective of ensuring the conservation and management of
biodiversity in Ecuador by strengthening the SNAP has been achieved.

COMPONENTS

2.6        The project consisted of the following four components:


4. The Biodiversity Conservation Project actually exacerbated the issue of a lack of sustainable financing for the
SNAP, which it characterized as a positive outcome for the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve while
ignoring the obvious implications for the financial impact on the SANP, when that project catalyzed a public debate
over sharing revenues generated by the Galapagos Islands with the other sites in the SNAP. The ICR for that project
justified this elimination of revenue-sharing by stating that “only a very small fraction returns for the protection of the
Galapagos Islands. This Special Law is a success for Galapagos National Park’s long-term protection.” (p. v) The
ICR for the GEF-SNAP Project characterized this very differently, stating on p. 2 that ” with the promulgation of the
Special Galapagos Law, 95 % of this revenue benefited the Galapagos province, and only 5% was channeled to MAE.
When the project started implementation, a new legal reform eliminated the 5% contribution to MAE, consequently,
the NSPA was facing a serious deficit and the mainland PAs did not receive sufficient financing to ensure their long-
term existence.”

   Component 1: Institutional Strengthening and Legal Development. (Expected
    cost at appraisal, US$6.2 million; actual cost by closing, US$5.8 million) This
    component aimed to consolidate the role of the National Directorate of Biodiversity
    (DNB) within MAE. The intent was to strengthen its planning, control and
    monitoring capacities to ensure the effective management of SNAP. DNB was also
    expected to develop the regulatory framework needed to support participatory
    management and co-management of protected areas, developing a long-term
    strategy that was consistent with the broader policy framework of national policies
    and strategies for sustainable social and economic development.

   Component 2: Participatory Management of Priority Protected Areas
    (Expected cost at appraisal, US$17.6 million; actual cost by closing, US$ 17.2
    million) This component aimed to promote the participatory management of two
    priority protected areas (Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve and Machalilla
    National Park) by developing participatory models according to the specific social
    and political conditions of each area. For this purpose, the project would support the
    creation and strengthening of local participatory management committees (PMC)
    that would represent various stakeholders. Also, the project would finance the
    updating and/or preparation of management plans and the implementation of
    priority activities, as well as the recurrent costs of the Machalilla National Park and
    the Cotacacchi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve. Furthermore, limited support would be
    provided to the Cuyabeno Wildlife Production Reserve during the first year of
    project implementation prior to receiving funding from the Protected Areas Fund.

   Component 3: Sustainable Financing of SNAP. (Expected cost at appraisal,
    US$11.5 million; actual cost by closing, US$11.4 million). This component was
    directed at consolidating the Protected Areas Fund (FAP) managed by the National
    Environmental Fund (Fondo Ambiental Nacional). The FAP was a strategic
    response to a lack of a long-term funding mechanism to support conservation within
    the National Patrimony of Protected Areas (PANE). Its aim was to support a
    percentage of operating costs within nine protected areas of SNAP. Once those
    recurring costs had been covered, additional resources could be used to support
    capital improvement investments in biodiversity conservation efforts at those sites.

   Component 4: Project Monitoring and Evaluation. (Expected cost at appraisal,
    US$1.4 million; actual cost by closing, US$1.9 million) This component financed
    an internet-based electronic management and administrative tracking system
    containing the following elements: (i) Protected Areas Information System; (ii)
    Management Efficiency Monitoring System within the two pilot protected areas;
    (iii) Biodiversity Monitoring System; and (iv) Financial and Administrative
    Management System of project activities.

3. Project Implementation
3.1    There were two implementing agencies for the project. The National Directorate
of Biodiversity and Protected Areas (DNB) within the Ministry of Environment (MAE)
was responsible for the technical implementation of Component 1 (Institutional
                                            6


Strengthening and Legal Development of SNAP), Component 2 (Participatory
Management of Priority Protected Areas), and Component 4 (Project Monitoring and
Evaluation). The National Environment Fund (FAN) was responsible for carrying out
Component 3 (Protected Areas Fund or PAF). FAN acted as both the grant recipient and
implementing agency. It is a non-profit, private-sector entity established in 1996 by
governmental decree with the public purpose of attracting, managing, and disbursing
external sources of financial assistance to support environmental activities within the
various units of the SNAP. It is governed by a seven-member board of directors, headed
by MAE as the government’s representative with three members, one each from
academia, the NGO community and the private sector, with the remaining three
members unanimously approved by the others for their recognized expertise in natural
resources management, financial management, or philanthropic fund-raising.

3.2     The project was approved by the Bank’s Board in December 2002, but did not
become effective until December 16, 2003, due to prolonged negotiations between the
Bank and the borrower over conditionality clauses in the grant agreement stipulating that
Ecuador’s proposed Biodiversity Law would be passed by its Congress within the first
two years of project implementation. The government indicated to the Bank that it could
not commit itself to the approval of the Biodiversity Law given that this decision was
beyond its control and that such a condition was inconsistent with the sovereign rights of
a country to establish its own legal framework. Therefore, the Bank agreed to amend the
agreement, making it a requirement that the government develop an adequate
environmental framework for project implementation. Two weeks later the project
became effective. However, the first disbursement of US $4.08 million was not made
until June 2004. During implementation, GEF grant funds were reallocated in July 2006
and in January 2007: expenditures were increased for infrastructure “works” and
“goods” under the MAE/DNB components (1, 2 and 4) by US $337,250. GEF funding
for “consultant services” was reduced by US $315,000 to US 1.9 million. GEF grant
funds to support MAE’s project management expenses nearly quadrupled from US
$130,000 to $507,000 while GEF funds to pay for recurring operating costs at the two
selected protected areas were reduced by a similar amount.

3.3     The project’s technical team performed unsatisfactorily during the first year of
implementation, due to high staff turnover. At the Bank’s request, the Ministry of
Environment agreed to put a new Project Coordinator and technical team into place, but
there was a lengthy delay in replacing the vacant positions for Legal Specialist,
Financial Strategy Specialist, and Social Specialist. The project closed at the end of
2007, six months later than planned, the delay being necessary to ensure implementation
of the Strategic Plan, improved management of the two selected protected areas, and
achievement of several output targets.

3.4     Safeguard Policies: The Bank’s Environmental Assessment operational policy
(OP 4.01) and three social/cultural policies (OP 4.10 for Indigenous Peoples, OP 4.11
for Physical Cultural Resources, and OP 4.12 for Involuntary Resettlement) were
triggered by the project due to potential restrictions on local indigenous communities’
traditional rights to extract natural resources, such as wood and game, from protected
areas or their buffer zones. There were no significant deviations or waivers from the
                                         7


Bank safeguards during the implementation of the project, which were assessed during
supervision missions.

3.5     Fiduciary Issues: During project appraisal, the Financial Management and
Procurement Capacity Assessments carried out by the Bank concluded that MAE’s
fiduciary capabilities were inadequate to meet the Bank’s financial management
standards and requirements, and it was agreed to transfer fiduciary responsibilities over
to FAN during the first year of implementation. However, there were delays and
confusion caused by this transfer of fiduciary responsibilities, and it was not until
January 2006 that these responsibilities were transferred back to the Ministry from FAN.
However, there continued to be coordination difficulties and misunderstandings by the
Ministry’s financial management staff regarding the application of the Bank’s
procedures as specified in the project’s Operational Manual. Audit reports and interim un-
audited reports were submitted after deadlines, preventing the timely and reliable provision of
information required to manage and monitor the implementation of the project.


4. Achievement of Project Objective
4.1    Project objective: “Ensure the conservation and management of Ecuador's
biodiversity for socially sustainable development by strengthening the National System
of Protected Areas through improving the legal, institutional and financial foundations
and capacities for the integrated, participatory management of protected areas.”

4.2     Achieving the project objective to ensure the conservation and management of
Ecuador's biodiversity depended upon realizing three intermediate results: (i) improving
the institutional and legal foundation of the SNAP; (ii) improving the financial
foundation of the SNAP by establishing a stable, transparent endowment fund; and (iii)
enhancing the capacity to manage the SNAP in an integrated, participatory manner
through pilot initiatives in two protected areas (Cotacacchi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve
and Machalilla National Park).

Improve the Institutional and Legal Foundation of SNAP
4.3      The activities aimed at strengthening the DNB’s planning, control and
monitoring capacities to effectively manage the protected areas system were focused in
the first (Institutional Strengthening and Legal Development) and last (Project
Monitoring and Evaluation) components. Having failed to make passage of the
Biodiversity Law a condition of the grant agreement, the Bank proposed an alternative
strategy requiring the Environment Ministry to develop a set of regulations to
incorporate greater participation by local communities in park management and
increasing the communities’ share of the economic benefits derived from in-park
tourism concessions. These approaches were piloted by the project at the Cotacachi-
Cayapas and Machalilla sites as potential models for replication at other SNAP sites.
The ministerial decree authorizing this new approach was not approved until July 2006,
more than two and a half years after the start of the project, and with only one and a half
years remaining until the project closing date. This decree also contained provisions to
prepare a strategic plan for SNAP and protected area management plans at individual
                                                        8


sites, and allowed them to retain a portion of the revenues they generated to invest in
park capital improvements.

4.4     IEG reviewed the Strategic Plan for SNAP (2007-2016) and park management
plans for Cotacachi-Cayapas and Machalilla. The Strategic Plan contained the 13
policies that guide the management of SNAP, a diagnostic of the system, a review of its
legal and regulatory framework, and an assessment of its current status. Looking
forward, it contained an analysis of alternatives, a section on objectives, goals,
strategies, and priority actions that was clearly and logically laid out, and a well thought-
out chronogram of sequenced actions to be taken over the 10-year lifespan of the Plan.
The budget was based on an independent and credible analysis of SNAP’s financial
needs done for MAE/DNB by a Technical Assistance Group (Grupo Promotor)
comprised of representatives from environmental NGOs, donors (USAID and KfW), and
FAN.

4.5     The Strategic Plan also served as a model for the preparation of the management
plans for Cotacacchi-Cayapas and Machalilla, which included mechanisms for broader
participation by local communities and a greater role for private concessions. The Plan
was adopted by ministerial decree in 2005. It provides policy guidance and a strategic
framework for donor assistance; and was submitted to the President in the hopes that it
would be legalized by means of a presidential decree, but this has not yet occurred.6

4.6     Finally, in terms of reforming the legal and regulatory framework to manage the
protected areas system, the Ministry of Environment had proposed creating an
Environmental Superintendency to assume primary responsibility for policy making,
allowing MAE to focus on technical and managerial activities. However, at the time of
the IEG mission, this proposal had not been acted upon nor had the Biodiversity
Strategy that the Ministry adopted in 2001 been codified and approved as a law.

4.7     Under the project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) component, DNB received
project assistance to strengthen its planning, control and monitoring capacities to
effectively manage the protected areas system. The centerpiece of this assistance was the
electronic, internet-based management and administrative tracking system (SAG-SNAP)
containing the following elements: (i) Protected Areas Information System; (ii)
Management Efficiency Monitoring System; (iii) Biodiversity Monitoring System
within the two pilot protected areas (originally referred to in the PAD as a “Social
Monitoring” system); and (iv) Financial and Administrative Management System to
track project activities. The system design was complex and sophisticated, and it was
unrealistic to assume that the Ministry could implement it across the entire SNAP.

4.8   Before project startup, the Bank had executed the GEF-supported Monitoring the
Galapagos Island Project (1998 - 2002). The objective of this project was to establish a
monitoring system to evaluate conservation of the Galapagos Islands’ eco-region,
6
  ICR for the GEF-SNAP, page 52, June 5, 2008.: The Strategic Plan for SNAP is recognized as a modern
tool that might be the best contribution of the SNAP-GEF Project. It is a complete, published product, but
it has not yet been legalized officially. Due to the national importance of this tool, it is hoped that it will be
legalized by means of an Executive Decree, the text of which has been sent to the President of the
Republic.”
                                             9


monitor key environmental variables, and provide information to local stakeholders and
policy makers regarding management of the Galapagos. The monitoring tools and
methodologies developed under the Galapagos project were used as inputs to design and
develop the M&E tools and system for the GEF-SNAP Project. These proved to be too
demanding and difficult a system for the Ministry to implement.

4.9     At the time of the IEG assessment mission, the electronic management
information system (SAG-SNAP) was being uploaded into a larger government-wide
system that was under construction, and it was not possible to verify its capabilities. The
Ministry and SNAP websites were operating, but were limited to providing only basic
data; most of the links were either missing or not working. The only means of assessing
the system’s capabilities was through a review of project documents. The information
system was supposed to be installed and operated in 10 regional district offices of the
Ministry, and piloted at nine protected areas. While it could not be independently
determined how many regional districts had installed the system, it was not being used
in the two districts visited during the IEG mission, and the survey of beneficiaries
indicated that it was only operational in four pilot sites due to lack of infrastructure and
equipment to connect to the internet. 7

4.10 The Management Efficiency Monitoring System (METT) evaluations were
conducted twice at the two pilot sites in 2005 and 2007. These surveys assessed the
management effectiveness of the two sites from the perspective of Ministry and park
staff as well as among local beneficiaries and stakeholders. The methodology used was
developed by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the World Bank based on the World
Commission on Protected Areas (WCPC)’s “Framework for Assessment.”8

4.11 Its use is now obligatory for GEF-financed, Bank-executed projects as a
relatively quick, replicable, and easily understood means of measuring progress toward
improving the management of protected areas based on the idea that good protected area
management follows a process with six distinct elements. This process begins with
understanding the context of biodiversity values and threats to them, progresses through
planning, allocating resources (inputs), and as a result of management actions
(processes), produces products and services (outputs), that result in impacts or
outcomes. Each one of these six elements has a set of questions associated with it and a
four-point scoring scale from zero to three with a series of four alternative answers
provided for each question to help assessors make a consistent judgment regarding the
most appropriate answer and score. The METT assessment has a maximum total of 99
points.

4.12 The results from both METT evaluations at Cotacacchi-Cayapas and Machalilla
showed a distinct and positive improvement in overall management of the sites between
2005 and 2007, increasing from a baseline overall score of 63 points in 2005 to 76
points two years later in both cases. A METT score above 70 is considered
“satisfactory.” At Cotacacchi-Cayapas, the most noticeable improvements were

“inputs” provided to the ecological reserve by project resources, and the highest score
was for “planning” due in large part to positive feedback regarding the implementation
of the management plan prepared for Cotacacchi-Cayapas with project assistance. A
slightly different picture emerged from the two METT assessments conducted at
Machalilla National Park. The biggest improvement (increasing by 24 points to 77
points) occurred for “processes” to address threats to the parks, maintain facilities and
equipment, and coordination with local stakeholders, such as the coast guard station at
Retén Naval, municipalities located near the park, and tourist operators. The highest
score was for “planning” (88 points), which was perceived as having improved due to
the implementation of the updated management plan (Plan Gerencial). No follow-up
METT assessments have been conducted by MAE since then at either protected area.

4.13 According to the ICR, the Biodiversity Monitoring System had been successfully
implemented at both pilot sites, but this was not confirmed by the IEG mission. There
was no evidence of its use by park staff and both superintendents made no mention of it
when asked during interviews. There was no mention in any project documents
regarding the results of the social monitoring program, of the Social Assessment’s
Process Framework, or the implementation of the Indigenous Peoples Development
Plan. While it was not possible to confirm the operation and utilization of the project’s
management information system, the new government-wide system may be even more
complex and less responsive to meeting the needs of MAE and SNAP. This will depend
largely on the government’s resources and technical capabilities dedicated to updating
information and maintaining the new system.

4.14 Finally, the project attempted to decentralize management decision-making
processes within MAE/DNB itself, but recent actions by the government appear to have
re-focused managerial and fiscal controls at the level of MAE headquarters and the
central government, such as the policy reversal by the central government no longer
allowing parks to retain a portion of self-generated revenues for capital investments.

Enhance the Financial Sustainability of the Protected Areas System
4.15 There are four main sources of funding for Ecuador’s protected areas system:
government budgetary support, donor projects, visitor entry fees and concession fees,
and now with the endowment of the FAP, disbursements to support recurring costs of a
growing number of protected areas. Data are provided in Table 4-1 below at the start of
the project (2003) and the last year for which such data were available (2009).

(FAN), 2011. These figures exclude the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve, which operate under a
separate legal mandate, organizational affiliation, and financial accounting system from the other 34 units of the
SNAP and 43 units of the PANE.


4.16 In 2003, nine percent of SNAP’s revenues came from agreements with the
private sector;9 it is not known what amount that contribution represents now. Revenues
from tourist entry fees and tariffs for telecommunication infrastructure concession rights
paid by the private sector to the government have dropped noticeably over the past few
years due to abrupt changes in government policy regarding them, according to project
staff interviewed during the IEG mission. Although tourist visits had remained stable
over the past several years, revenues had fluctuated as government pricing policies
changed abruptly and without the benefit of market demand or carrying capacity studies.

4.17 In addition, this analysis does not include the budget allocated to the Galapagos
National Park and Marine Reserve (henceforth referred to as “Galapagos”). In 2003, the
total budget for SNAP was US $8.7 million, of which 70 percent (US$6 million) was
disbursed to the Galapagos. The remaining US $2.7 million went to cover the costs of
the other 31 continental sites comprising the SNAP at that time (there are now 34
mainland SNAP sites). Moreover, the Galapagos generated over US $4 million in tourist
entry fees and concession fees in 2003, more than 4.8 times the total revenues generated
by all the rest of the SNAP units combined, but shared only five percent of that revenue
with the rest of the system under a “Special Law” which had passed in 1998.10
Subsequently, this last five percent was eliminated in 2004 by the “Organic Reform Law
to the Municipal Code” (No. 429).11

4.18 In 2005, the project facilitated a joint effort by a consortium of national and
international NGOs (Grupo Promotor) working with the Environment Ministry and
FAN to prepare a Financial Needs Analysis of the protected areas system. This analysis
used the US $2.7 million 2003 SNAP budget as the “baseline,” and estimated two
scenarios of operating costs for the SNAP. First, a “basic” level of funding was

estimated, representing the minimum required to prevent the system from deteriorating
in terms of maintaining a physical presence at all SNAP sites and managing them
adequately. The “basic” funding level was estimated at US $6.3 million annually,
indicating an annual shortfall of US $3.6 million relative to actual funding levels. The
government’s fiscal support of US $950,000 represented just 15 percent of this
estimated “basic” SNAP budget. A second “integrated” scenario was estimated
representing a level of funding that would meet the system’s objectives of supporting
conservation and maintaining social development over the long run. This was estimated
at US$12.2 million, leaving an annual shortfall of US $9.5 million. The Financial Needs
Analysis was done more than six years ago using figures from 2003, and has not been
updated since then. Several persons interviewed during the IEG mission mentioned that
this analysis should be updated using the most recent figures available to develop a
financial sustainability plan that will cover the “basic” funding level required to manage
SNAP in the future.

4.19 In addition to providing support for the Financial Needs Analysis, the project
helped establish the Protected Areas Fund to cover a portion of the recurrent costs of the
protected areas system, which was administered by FAN. The Ecuadorian government
invested US $1 million in seed money in 1999 to attract matching contributions from
donor organizations. By the end of the project, The German government’s foreign aid
organization (KfW) had contributed US $12.5 million in debt-for-nature swaps and the
GEF grant of US $4 million, had brought the FAP’s total endowment to US $17.5
million, surpassing the project goal of US $13.5 million. Today, the FAP’s total
capitalization is US $19.5 million (at the end of 2010). SNAP’s new Strategic Plan for
2006 - 2015 has set a goal of raising the PAF’s endowment to US $35 million.
However, there have not been any additional contributions made by donors since 2008.
See Table 4-2 below for a summary of donations to FAP and its endowment size over
time.

4.20 Under FAN’s auspices, management of the fund has been transparent and
independent. The size of the endowment has increased every year (except once in 2007
during the economic crisis), earning an average return of 6.5 percent annually on its
investments. Ten percent of the revenues generated by the FAP are retained as a
management fee by FAN (except for GEF funds which cannot be used for management
fees), 10 percent is used to recapitalize the fund, and 80 percent is disbursed to SNAP.

4.22 As a percentage of SNAP’s overall operating costs, these FAP disbursements
represent an increase from less than 9 percent of SNAP’s total operating costs in 2003 to
nearly 15 percent in 2010, slightly exceeding the target of 14 percent. FAN projects that
the PAF will disburse over US $1 million before the end of the current SNAP Strategic
Plan period in 2015. However, when one considers the “basic” budget level that was
estimated in the Financial Needs Analysis as the minimum funding required to
effectively manage the SNAP in 2003 (US $6.3 million), the current disbursement in
2010 would meet just 12 percent of that level.
                                             14


4.23 This indicates that the FAP will only meet a relatively small proportion of the
financial needs of the protected areas system in the near future, and will require
continued donor support, government fiscal resources, and greater levels of self-
generated revenues from tourism and concession services in parks and reserves. Self-
generated fees have dropped dramatically in recent years as the government has shifted
its policies regarding entry fees abruptly and without taking into account up-to-date
estimates of tourism potential, or the carrying capacity of the parks (the level of use they
can support without long-term damage). Given the severe funding shortfall of SNAP, it
may be useful to analyze various alternatives to increase and reinvest self-generated
revenues into meeting a larger percentage of protected areas’ operational costs.

4.24 The new administration of President Correa launched a government-wide
initiative in 2010 to improve financial planning and budget control systems, requiring all
SNAP units (except the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve) to return
revenues collected on-site to the central Treasury. This reversed one of the central tenets
of the SNAP Strategic Plan and the Ministry’s 2006 decree allowing parks to retain a
portion of self-generated revenues for capital re-investment. Given the serious deficit in
operating and capital investment funds within SNAP, there appeared to be a case for
increasing non-budgetary revenues at these sites through increased concession fees and
entrance charges. But, unexpectedly, the government reduced the entrance fees charged
to visitors and eliminated or reduced a number of sources of concession fees, such as
those paid for communication transmission lines crossing protected areas.

Improved Capacity for Integrated, Participatory Management of
SNAP at Two Pilot Protected Areas
4.25 The project established two mechanisms by which it intended to improve
MAE/DNB’s capacity to empower local communities in the management of protected
areas and to receive a more equitable share of the benefits generated by them. They
piloted these mechanisms at two SNAP sites (Cotacacchi-Cayapas and Machalilla).

4.26 First, they set up participatory management committees (PMC) at the two pilot
sites to involve local communities and families living in or near the reserves in decisions
affecting them. IEG found that the level of local participation had increased during the
project, but was not commensurate with the time and effort put into them. There was
little evidence, beyond the creation of the PMCs and the number of meetings they held
during the project, to demonstrate any contributions made by them to improved
management of the pilot sites. For example, IEG noted in field visits that several land
tenure and property disputes had been resolved by the project’s interventions of
demarcating property boundaries between private lands and protected areas. However,
the issue of extracting natural resources and game from protected areas was unresolved
due to the conflict between the conservation objectives of the SNAP and the private
gains and needs of local populations. Once project funds to cover the expenses of the
PMCs ceased in 2007, their activities in park management decisions dropped off
sharply. By the time of the IEG visit in 2011, the PMCs were inactive at both sites and
park managers did not consider them to have been successful models.
                                             15


4.27      There were seven PMCs set up in the Cotacacchi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve
(four in the “upper” province of Imbaburá, and three in the “lower” Esmeraldas
province), which covers nearly a quarter million hectares. These PMCs met more than
four dozen times. However, much time was spent squabbling over their perception that
one group or community had captured a comparatively larger share of project resources
than another, or discussing long-standing boundary disputes. These problems were aired
in the Beneficiary Survey and IEG confirmed in interviews with reserve staff that the
PMCs were no longer active. In Machalilla National Park, a single PMC was set up in
the small coastal community of Puerto Lopez, located near the southern section of the
56,000 hectare park. The PMC met regularly during project implementation, but park
staff and local stakeholders felt that the PMC had become a tool for local hotel and
tourism commercial interests with little commitment to sustainable natural resources
management.12 The PMC was found to be inactive by IEG, and a number of site staff
and managers were skeptical about the contribution that the PMC could make to park
management. While no one questioned the value of involving local communities in park
management decisions conceptually, most agreed that more thought and experimentation
was needed before the approach could be replicated at other SNAP sites.

4.28 The other mechanism by which local communities were intended to benefit from
greater participation in park management was through local hiring preferences to
conduct patrolling and surveillance work, and by providing tourist concession services at
the two SNAP sites. The legal process of establishing the concessions took longer than
expected, and left little time to pilot them during project implementation. IEG observed
that, concession services were operating and were being monitored by SNAP staff at
these sites. However, while several of the concession services appeared to be quite
profitable, many others appeared to be providing little revenue. High quality services
and accommodations that would attract higher-spending foreign tourists were lacking.

4.29 At one of the most visited areas of Machalilla National Park (Los Frailes Beach),
local taxi services and concessions stands for food, beverages, and beach apparel were
well-regulated by park staff. Boat trips to the wildlife and shorebird sanctuary of Isla de
la Plata were carefully monitored to control the number of daily vessels and visitors
allowed to visit the island, particularly during the nesting season. “Off-limits” areas
were strictly enforced, and logs of visitor arrivals and departures were kept. Trained
guides introduced visitors to the island and briefed them about its rich wildlife and the
need to protect them. IEG also encountered a local indigenous community running
concession services at the cultural museum and archeological site of Aguas Blancas in
collaboration with park staff, but these appeared to be barely making any money.

4.30 During the site visit to Lake Cuicocha Environmental Interpretation Center in
Cotacacchi-Cayapas, tourist concessions were not operating due to poor weather and
lack of visitors. However, it was evident that the Center’s potential for offering high
quality concession services was not being fully optimized. While the Center’s
educational exhibits and interpretative services were impressive, the spaces provided for
concession services were limited to the periphery of the center. However, a nearby
restaurant and boat service around the lake appeared to be well-run and profitable.

4.31 Overall, the project’s activities to promote participatory management of
protected areas appears to have been modest in terms of the limited contribution made
by the PMCs at the two sites, and the mixed results achieved with concession services at
both sites. There is no dispute about the need to have inclusive, participatory decision-
making processes and local benefit-sharing mechanisms in place to manage protected
areas. However, the manner in which they are integrated into park management requires
further thought and experimentation.

Overall Objective: Ensure the Conservation and Management of
Ecuador’s Biodiversity by Strengthening the SNAP
4.32 The overall effect of the three intermediate results intended to achieve the project
objective of ensuring the conservation and management of Ecuador’s biodiversity by
strengthening the SNAP was modest. First, project activities to reform the legal basis of
SNAP and strengthen the institutional foundations of MAE/DNB had limited results.
The government did not act upon several MAE initiatives, such as creating an
Environmental Secretariat, enacting the Biodiversity Law, or adopting the SNAP
Strategic Plan. Nor was there any evidence to suggest that project activities to strengthen
MAE/DNB’s planning, control and monitoring capacities of the SNAP had been
significantly improved. Second, while the protected areas endowment fund exceeded its
targets, chronic underfunding of the SNAP by the government and recent policy changes
regarding entry fees, concession targets, and retention of self-generated revenues by
protected areas have raised concerns about the financial stability of the system. Third,
the participatory management committees and local concession operations piloted at two
protected areas were problematic and did not serve as a model for replication at other
sites in SNAP.

5. Evaluation Ratings
Relevance of Objectives
5.1     Conserving biodiversity is critical to Ecuador’s sustainable development.
Tourism represents the fourth largest source of foreign exchange for Ecuador’s
economy, constituting 2.3% of Ecuador’s GDP. Forty-two percent (42%) of foreign
tourists visiting the country spend an average of 2.7 days in at least one national park
during their stay.13 In addition to tourism, almost all of the production of the commercial
fishing sector is based in the marine-coastal ecosystems of the country, and the forestry
sector accounts for 2.7% of Ecuador’s GDP with nearly two-thirds of that wood
extracted from native forests.

5.2    The project’s objective was consistent with the Bank's last Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS, 2003 - 2007),14 which has not been updated since then. A new Draft
Concept Note for an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY2012-2013 has been prepared

for discussions between the Bank and the government.15 This ISN includes a pillar to
support the government’s global public goods agenda to “Protect nature’s rights and
promote a healthy and sustainable environment,”16 as part of its new National
Development Plan. However, the statement of objectives was convoluted and confusing
with a series of “for, by, through, and for” prepositions that made it difficult to ascertain
the causal chain of inputs, outputs, and outcomes needed to achieve the project’s
objective. The relevance of objectives is rated substantial.

Relevance of Design
5.3     The relevance of the project’s design was also substantial since the project
components, inputs, and activities were logically connected in the Results Framework to
achieve the project’s objective. The design of the project responded to the institutional,
financial, and regulatory weaknesses that had been highlighted by the first Biodiversity
Conservation Project (1994-2000), and placing the management of the protected areas
fund (FAP) in the hands of an independent entity (FAN) instead of a government entity
turned out to be a key strength of the project.

Efficacy
5.4     Only one of the three means for achieving the project objective was satisfactorily
met: that is, to establish a stable, long-term source of financial support for the protected
areas system. However, even for this intermediate result, recent policy reversals by the
government regarding entry fees, concession tariffs, and re-investment of self-generated
revenues raised at SNAP sites for capital improvements have raised concerns about the
long-term financial sustainability of the SNAP.

5.5      Output targets to reform the legal and regulatory framework and strengthen the
institutional capacity of MAE/DNB were met, such as proposing a Biodiversity Law to
Ecuador’s Congress, updating the Strategic Plan, preparing a Financial Needs Analysis
for SNAP, and developing the management plans and effectiveness evaluations for the
two pilot protected areas. However, while some of the output targets were achieved, the
intended results were not achieved on the whole. For example, the proposed
Biodiversity Strategy was never passed into law, the Strategic Plan has not been
officially approved as a Presidential Decree as sought by MAE, and the Financial Needs
Analysis has not been approved by the government and requires updating. Efforts to
promote participatory co-management with local communities and other stakeholders at
the two pilot protected areas were not successful in achieving their intended purpose,
and more experimentation and refinement with this mechanism is needed before it can
replicated at other sites in the SNAP. Increasing local participation in providing
concession services, while well regulated by park staff, has not reached its full potential
either in terms of serving the parks’ interests of reducing the workload on staff, or in
terms of providing significant additional economic benefits to local communities.

5.6     Thus, the only indirect evidence of the degree to which the project achieved its
global environmental objective of ensuring the conservation and [effective] management
of Ecuador’s biodiversity by strengthening the national system of protected areas was
provided by the METT assessments carried out at the two pilot sites, which showed
significant increases for all six criteria of the METT framework. Overall METT scores
for Machalilla and Cotacachi-Cayapas were 76 and 77 points in 2007, respectively (up
from 63 points for both protected areas two years earlier). This corresponds to a
satisfactory level of management effectiveness for these two pilot protected areas.

5.7     However, there is no indication that this tracking tool will continue to be applied
at the two pilot sites or at other protected areas in SNAP, even though it is simple,
practical and inexpensive to do. Overall, the broader institutional and legal foundations
to ensure the effective conservation and management of Ecuador’s biodiversity by
strengthening the SNAP have not been established. Thus, the efficacy of the project
objective is rated as modest.

Efficiency
5.8     This type of project does not lend itself to estimating rates of return since its
purpose is to conserve a non-market public good. That said, a cost-effectiveness analysis
should have been done to estimate the cost of promoting the participatory co-
management approach and expanded concession services offered at the two protected
areas. There were no estimates done of the costs per hectare at the two pilot sites, against
which to compare them with the average costs of managing other protected areas in
Ecuador, or with those costs in comparable countries. This would have provided useful
information to other park managers and regional office directors regarding whether to
replicate those ideas elsewhere.

5.9     The US $8 million project leveraged more than US $29 million in other donor
co-financing and counterpart contributions, and the project made excellent use of
strategic partnerships with international and Ecuadoran environmental NGOs/CSOs and
foundations to leverage additional in-kind support, taking full advantage of their
technical skills and conservation knowledge.

5.10 On the other hand, there was the one-year delay between Board approval in
December 2002 and the effectiveness date for the project in December 2003.
Implementation of project components 1, 2 and 4 was extremely slow in the first two
years due to deficiencies in the project’s design, and the unsatisfactory performance and
high turnover of the Project Coordination Unit’s technical team. Once these initial start-
up problems were resolved, the project was run more efficiently over the last half of
implementation and closed six months after the estimated date at the end of 2007. Given
the lack of any data that could have been compared to the costs of managing protected
areas in other countries, coupled with the slow implementation of project activities
initially, project efficiency is rated as modest.
                                             19


Outcome
5.11 The project’s objective was substantially relevant to the Bank’s CAS of 2003 and
the country’s priorities in its new Development Plan. The relevance of the project design
was also substantial in terms of having a clear causal chain between the project’s
components, activities, and inputs to achieving its objective. However, the project only
achieved one of three intermediate results and the overall project objective was only
modestly achieved. Efficiency was rated as modest. The resulting outcome rating is thus
moderately unsatisfactory.

Risk to Development
5.12 Institutionally, MAE/DNB’s capabilities to effectively manage the protected
areas system were not significantly strengthened by the project. The evidence given to
support this (participatory co-management and concession services) was inconclusive at
best, and not relevant to the core capabilities that MAE/DNB still needs to develop in
order to become a more effective institution. It needs to fully develop its administration
and management capacities by effectively using an information system (SIG-SNAP)
similar to the one started under the project. The usefulness of the information system
and its replication at other SNAP sites were questioned during the Project Beneficiaries
Workshops. However, an independent assessment of the system could not be three years
later during the IEG mission in 2011because the system was in the process of being
integrated into a government-wide system that was not yet accessible. The extent to
which it will function in the near future as part of this larger system is an open question
at this time.

5.13        The project experienced its greatest successes in creating the FAP under
FAN’s financial stewardship, and the SNAP is now on firmer financial ground. The
endowment fund currently stands at nearly US $20 million. FAP disbursements are
being made to an ever-growing number of SNAP parks and reserves, which now
supports 15 percent of SNAP’s “basic” operating cost needs. However, even here there
are clouds on the horizon. Since the project closed, there have been no new additional
donations made to FAN by international donors or development banks. It was originally
envisioned that the FAP would reach its current goal of having a US $35 million
endowment by 2011;17 that was later revised to coincide with the ending of the current
Financial Sustainability Strategy in 2015. However, that goal is likely not to be met as
new government procedures requiring all international donor funds to pass through a
central Treasury account first before being transferred to the implementing agencies has
apparently stifled new donations to the FAP. In addition, the increase in self-generated
revenues that was expected to arise from higher entry fees, concession permit charges,
and tariffs on telecommunication facilities located inside SNAP units have not
materialized, raising concerns about the system’s future financial sustainability. SNAP
still faces a funding shortfall, aggravated by the loss of revenue from the Galapagos
National Park and Marine Reserve since 2004.

5.14 Finally, the participatory management committees for the two pilot protected
areas and increased concession services to alleviate the workload on park staff have
proven problematic. While the conceptual basis for these initiatives is increasingly
accepted as an indispensable element of park management, the manner in which they
were executed at the pilot sites was problematic and incomplete. Further refinement is
required before they can become models for replication elsewhere in SNAP. These
issues have raised concerns and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the protected
areas system, and the risk to development is considered to be substantial.

Monitoring and Evaluation
5.15 The Environment Ministry managed the M&E system for Component 1
(Institutional Strengthening and Legal Development), Component 2 (Participatory
Management of Priority Protected Areas), and Component 4 (Project M&E); the
National Environment Fund was responsible for Component 3 (Sustainable Financing)
of the Protected Areas Fund. There were two levels of monitoring: first, at the project
performance indicator level, and second, for the indicators developed to manage the two
pilot protected areas. The internet-based electronic information management system
was at the heart of the M&E system. It contained five component parts: (i) the Protected
Areas Information System; (ii) Management Efficiency Monitoring System within the
two pilot protected areas; (iii) Biodiversity Monitoring System (BMS); and (iv)
Financial and Administrative Management System for tracking project activities.

M&E DESIGN

5.16 The M&E design borrowed heavily from previous experience under a GEF
project for the Galapagos Islands (1998 – 2002),18 which introduced a sophisticated
monitoring system requiring strong technical skills and the financial resources needed to
support the high demands of operating and maintaining it. The M&E design for the
project reviewed here was thorough and comprehensive, but it may have been too
complex and sophisticated for the available technical skills and limited financial
resources of the Environment Ministry.

5.17 The results framework lacked any measures directly pertinent to the conservation
of biodiversity or socially sustainable development, such as the numbers of indicator
species or hectares of protected areas under effective management or indices of social
equality in areas proximal to protected areas. In many cases, values for baselines and
indicator targets were either not measurable or present. Some of the indicators focused
more on “outputs,” such as management plans prepared or PMC meetings held, rather
than on “outcomes,” such as the effect of implementing those management plans or the
contribution made by more participatory management approaches in protected areas by
PMCs. There was general consistency between most of the Key Performance Indicators
(KPI) in the PAD and the ICR. These are described in Table 5-1 below.

M&E Implementation

5.18 The Project Coordinators at the Environment Ministry and FAN submitted
annual progress reports that were reviewed by the Bank’s in-country project staff. The
staff was also responsible for preparing the independent mid-term review, organizing a
beneficiary survey workshop held at project closure, and overseeing the application of
the METT assessment framework at the two pilot sites.

5.19 It was difficult to assess implementation of the project’s M&E system because
the system was not accessible during the assessment mission since it was being uploaded
into a new government-wide budget planning and accountability information system that
was under construction. However, the Stakeholders Workshop conducted near project
closing in December 2007 noted that the biological information system was only
functioning in four of the nine SNAP sites where it had been introduced.20 The Mid-
Term Review Report conducted in May 2006 found that “The project’s results and

19
  There was a discrepancy in the amount of the endowment indicated in the PAD from the ICR of US $1
million ($13M vs. $12M), but this inadvertent became a moot point when the capitalization of the FAP
surpassed US $13.5 million in 2007. As of the end of 2010, the FAP stood at over US $19.3 million.

monitoring framework is being applied to assess the impact of the activities under
implementation, to adopt sound methodologies and approaches, and to develop
adaptation strategies to allow the Project’s adequate implementation.”21

M&E UTILIZATION

5.20 The ICR stated that the M&E system “includes a very friendly data collection
and processing of information methodology,”22 and that “given the usefulness of this
tool (that is, the Biological Monitoring System), it was extended to the other seven
protected areas.”23 However, no evidence was presented to back up these claims, and the
results of the beneficiary workshop held at the end of the project stated that the project
information system had only partially been operational due to inadequate equipment and
lack of access to internet services in some of the more remote parks and reserves. No
mention was made of its installation or use at 10 regional MAE offices, and at the one
regional office visited during the IEG mission, the regional director had no knowledge
of it.

5.21       The rating for M&E is modest.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

5.22 Quality at entry is rated as moderately satisfactory. The Bank provided
sufficient resources to ensure adequate preparation and appraisal support. A Social
Assessment was conducted with input provided by over 50 local stakeholders in two
workshops held during project preparation to evaluate the development needs of local
people living in or near protected areas. The project sought to harmonize the needs of
local indigenous residents and communities to access natural resources within the two
pilot protected areas as traditionally practiced with the conservation of biodiversity and
natural habitats. Strategies were established to resolve conflicts over the use of natural
resources within protected areas and boundaries disputes without affecting the rights of
local populations. As a result, a Process Framework was put in place to evaluate the
potential social impacts of specific project tasks or activities once those were defined
during project implementation, and an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan was
prepared.

5.23 Institutional weaknesses were identified in MAE regarding its fiduciary
capabilities. The Bank initiated a remedial program of technical assistance to bring
MAE’s procurement system and financial management controls up to the Bank’s
standards. It was agreed that during the first two years of project implementation,
fiduciary responsibilities would be transferred to FAN.

5.24 Major risk factors and lessons learned from earlier projects in Ecuador were
incorporated into the project’s design. For example, an important decision was made
prior to Board approval to insist that the protected areas endowment fund be managed by
FAN, and not by MAE or another government entity, as the government had requested,
due to poor past performance and lack of financial accounting transparency. However,
lessons from successful Bank experiences in other countries were not adequately
considered and incorporated into the design. This was especially true in terms of
implementing “best practices” for designing participatory management schemes and
concession services to improve the quality of tourists’ visits, and increase local revenues
taken from other countries’ experiences. The risk mitigation measures, especially those
regarding institutional risks, proposed at appraisal turned out to be inadequate to address
the unexpected and abrupt changes in government policies and project management that
occurred, and the Bank miscalculated its ability to strengthen the implementing agency.

5.25 There was a one-year delay between Board approval and the effectiveness date
of the project due to a clause in the Grant Agreement regarding passage of the
Ministry’s Biodiversity Policy into national law that was eventually dropped by the
Bank in favor of a ministerial decree. However, there is little reason to think that this
decision adversely affected the outcome of the project given that the real problem was
lack of implementation capacity or political will on the part of MAE, rather than the lack
of adequate legal authority. For example, the new Constitution of 2008 contains an
article (Article 405) requiring the government to “allocate the financial resources needed
to ensure the system’s financial sustainability and foster the participation of
communities.” Yet despite this constitutional requirement, adequate fiscal support has
not been provided yet, as evidenced by the funding shortfall described earlier in this
report. The Bank’s performance is faulted for not having realized this earlier, and been
more focused instead on minimizing MAE’s institutional risks and shortcomings.

Quality of Supervision
5.26 Supervision quality is rated satisfactory. The Bank’s project team was based in-
country and closely followed the project’s implementation, addressing problems and
delays diligently. For example, when project management staff members performed
poorly at the beginning of the project, the Bank acted swiftly to intervene and secure
their replacement. The new project coordinator and team provided steady stewardship of
the project over the last two and a half years of the project, during which time most of
the outputs were accomplished. However, the Bank was slow to respond to obvious
shortcomings in the PMCs at the two pilot sites, and slow to address the unclear division
of responsibilities between the two implementing agencies, FAN and MAE.

5.27 The Bank’s project staff and the project coordination unit were able to facilitate a
strategic alliance between MAE and a consortium of local and international NGOs
(Grupo Promotor) to produce several important products, such as the Financial Needs
Assessment and Financial Sustainability Strategy for the SNAP, as well as the
management plans and management effectiveness evaluations for the two pilot protected
areas. These products increased the project’s impact by positively influencing public
discourse over the unmet financial needs of protected areas in Ecuador, and have
pressured the government to meet its Constitutional obligations to adequately fund them.
                                                    24


5.28 Supervision missions were conducted regularly and benefited from having Bank
project staff in-country to supervise the implementation of the project and interact with
the implementing agency and government on a regular basis. The 2006 Mid-Term
Review provided some guidance and insights into placing greater emphasis on the use of
strategic alliances by commenting favorably on both the management effectiveness
surveys and the Financial Needs Analysis of SNAP done by MAE, FAN, and local and
international NGOs. Finally, an independent project evaluation was conducted under the
auspices of MAE, and the Bank sponsored the Stakeholders Workshop to provide MAE
staff and project beneficiary testimony of project achievements and failures. These
findings were included in the final project completion report.

5.29       Overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT’S PERFORMANCE

5.30 Government performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The government
initially demonstrated its commitment to the project by providing the original US$1
million donation to the Protected Areas Fund as seed money to attract matching funds
from external donors, such as the GEF and KfW. The government also met its co-
financing obligations by providing nearly US $5 million in counterpart funds to support
project activities in the Environment Ministry (MAE).

5.31 On the other hand, the government has not approved the SNAP Strategic Plan
2007-2016 as official policy, nor has it acted upon the 10-year National Biodiversity
Strategy that was approved by MAE, and presented to the Ecuadoran Congress as a
proposed Biodiversity Law in 2001. The government’s refusal to include passage of the
Biodiversity Law as an effectiveness condition in the GEF Grant Agreement within the
first two years of project implementation was emblematic of its limited commitment to
the project’s objectives, and delayed the start of the project for more than a year.

5.32 Overall government commitment has been “fluctuating and inconsistent”24 as
demonstrated by frequent changes in administration (three different Presidents and seven
ministers of MAE served between the beginning of 2004 and the end of 2007), which
has created instability and a “volatile political atmosphere”25 throughout the
implementation period. There have been abrupt changes in government policies
regarding entry fees, tariffs for private sector concessions, and reinvestment of self-
generated funds by protected areas for capital improvements (with the exception of the
Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve).

Implementing Agency
MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT (MAE)

5.33 The Environment Ministry’s performance as one of the two implementing
agencies in the project is rated moderately unsatisfactory. MAE implemented
Components 1, 2 and 4. It did not achieve either one of the two intermediate results it
was responsible for that would lead toward achieving the overall project objective. Its
initial performance was weak, owing to the poor performance of the original staff in the
project coordination unit, poor procurement management in terms of timeliness and
reliability of reporting, and non-compliance with legal covenants.

5.34 Progress toward the project development objective was rated as “at risk” by the
Bank for the first two years of implementation and supervision ratings in late 2004 and
2005 were unsatisfactory due to lack of progress in implementing the project by MAE
and high turnover of senior ministry managers. It was not able to “make necessary
decisions to make the project work effectively,”26 and project planning and cash flow
management remained weak throughout the project. Audits and non-audited reports
were submitted late, preventing the timely and reliable provision of information required to
manage and monitor the implementation of the project.

NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT FUND (FAN)

5.35 The performance of the National Environment Fund (FAN) is rated highly
satisfactory. FAN implemented Component 3 (Sustainable Financing of the SNAP)
with a US $4.3 million GEF grant (TF-061486). Unlike other donations to the PAF,
none of the revenue generated by GEF trust funds can be used to pay for FAN’s costs of
managing the PAF, and all proceeds must be reinvested to the endowment fund or
disbursed to selected SNAP parks and reserves.

5.36 The FAN has had stable, competent leadership and staffing throughout project
implementation and beyond (although the Executive Director left FAN earlier this year).
It has also avoided becoming embroiled in political controversies, although a recent
proposal to transform FAN into a publicly-run entity was strongly resisted by the two
largest donors to the PAF: the World Bank and the KfW. The FAN’s demonstrated
record of strong performance and institutional credibility has attracted the interest of
other donors and foundations wishing to establish new funds in Ecuador, such as the US
$12.5 million Galapagos Invasive Species Control Fund, the US $3 million CEREPS
Project Fund for Yasuní and Cuyabeno protected areas, the Condor-Kutukú Corridor
Fund, and the ProCuencas Water Fund, all of which are managed by FAN.

5.37        The Borrower’s overall performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
6.1     In designing participatory models for protected area management, the Bank
needs to draw upon successful experiences in other countries. The PMCs and private
sector concessions set up at the two pilot SNAP sites did not work well, and did not
contribute to improved management of these protected areas. While the need for input
from stakeholders is indisputable, the manner in which it is integrated into park
management decisions requires further thought and experimentation. Better results may
have been achieved if other successful models had been assessed in terms of Ecuador’s
circumstances during preparation and appraisal, such as the Indigenous Management of
Protected Areas Project in the Peruvian Amazon or the Natural Protected Areas Project
in Mexico.

6.2     Support for protected areas needs to be based upon a careful analysis of their
revenue and expenditure streams over time to estimate the minimum amount required
for their sound management as part of the whole system. The Financial Needs Analysis
of the SNAP was very useful by revealing the shortfall between current public
expenditures for the system (US $2.7 million) and the minimum amount required for its
operation (US $6.3 million). An updated financial analysis, coupled with an estimation
of the economic benefits that flow to local and national economies from protected areas
(environmental services, foreign exchange earnings from tourism, etc.), can strengthen
the case for adequately funding protected areas elsewhere.

6.3     Non-profit, private sector institutions can serve the public interest by
independently managing endowment funds for protected areas. In this case, the FAN
administered the Protected Areas Fund (FAP) effectively and efficiently. It provided an
alternative model to public management that might be applied elsewhere in situations
where transparency and freedom from political influence is at a premium.

6.4     Effective management of protected area systems requires sustainable financing
to ensure basic operating costs are covered for all of the protected areas within the
system. With the exception of the Galapagos Marine Reserve and National Park which
do not share any of the revenues they generate with the rest of Ecuador’s protected areas
system despite raising 4.8 times as much as the other 34 SNAP sites combined, the other
protected areas in Ecuador are “severely and chronically underfunded” below their basic
needs, according to the Financial Needs Analysis conducted by the Ministry, FAN, and a
group of NGOs in 2005. In contrast to the Galapagos, all the other protected areas within
SNAP must remit 100 percent of the revenues they generate to the national treasury and
receive only 30 percent of government fiscal support (the other 70 percent goes to the
Galapagos). Thus, an appropriate revenue-sharing arrangement is not in place nor is the
support provided by the government to SNAP sufficient at this time.
