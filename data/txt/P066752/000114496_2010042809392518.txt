Re: 
GEF Trust Fund Grant No. TF051537 EC (National System of 
Protected Areas Project - MAE) 
 
Second Amendment to the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement
Excellency: 
 
We refer to the Global Environment Facility (the “GEF”) Trust Fund Agreement 
(National System of Protected Areas Project - MAE), dated April 17, 2003, between the 
Republic of Ecuador (the “Recipient”) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the “Bank”), acting as an Implementing Agency of the GEF (the “Grant 
Agreement”). I further refer to the recent approval by the Executive Directors of the 
Bank, of a proposal to re-denominate each active GEF grant denominated in Special 
Drawing Rights (“SDR”), including the present grant (“the Grant”), to a United States 
Dollars (“USD”) denominated grant, and to denominate all future GEF grants in USD. In 
consideration of this recent approval, we are pleased to inform you that the Bank 
proposes to amend the GEF Grant Agreement as set forth below. 
 
1. 
Section 1.01 (b) is amended by the deletion of clause (i) and the renumbering of the 
remaining clauses accordingly. 
 
2. 
Section 2.01 is amended to read as follows: 
 
“Section 2.01. The Bank agrees to make available to Ecuador, on the terms and conditions set 
forth or referred to in this Agreement, the MAE GEF Trust Fund Grant in an amount equal to 
three million six hundred seventy two thousand U.S. Dollars (USD3,672,000).
 
3.  The Table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the GEF Grant Agreement is amended as 
follows:

account of payments made for expenditures incurred within twelve (12)  months prior to the 
date of this Agreement but after August 15, 2002”. 
 
5.  Paragraph 1 of Annex A to Schedule 1 to the GEF Grant Agreement is amended as 
follows: 
 
“For the purposes of this Annex the term “MAE Authorized Allocation” means an amount of 
$350,000 to be withdrawn form the MAE GEF Trust Fund Grant Account and deposited into 
the MAE Special Account pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Annex; provided however that 
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, the MAE Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an 
amount equal to $175,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals form the MAE GEF 
Trust Fund Grant Account, plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments 
entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall equal or 
exceed $455,000.
