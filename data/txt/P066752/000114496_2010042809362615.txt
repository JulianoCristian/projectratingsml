Re: 
GEF Trust Fund Grant No. TF051486 EC (National System of 
Protected Areas Project - FAN) 
 
First  Amendment to the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement
Dear Sir: 
 
We refer to the Global Environment Facility (the “GEF”) Trust Fund Agreement 
(National System of Protected Areas Project - FAN), dated April 17, 2003, between the 
Fondo Ambiental Nacional
 (the “Recipient”) and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the “Bank”), acting as an Implementing Agency of the 
GEF (the “Grant Agreement”). I further refer to the recent approval by the Executive 
Directors of the Bank, of a proposal to re-denominate each active GEF grant 
denominated in Special Drawing Rights (“SDR”), including the present grant (“the 
Grant”), to a United States Dollars (“USD”) denominated grant, and to denominate all 
future GEF grants in USD. In consideration of this recent approval, we are pleased to 
inform you that the Bank proposes to amend the GEF Grant Agreement as set forth 
below. 
 
1. 
Section 1.01 (b) is amended by the deletion of clause (i) and the renumbering of the 
remaining clauses accordingly. 
 
2. 
Section 2.01 is amended to read as follows: 
 
“Section 2.01. The Bank agrees to make available to FAN, on the terms and conditions set 
forth or referred to in this Agreement, the FAN GEF Trust Fund Grant in an amount equal to 
four million three hundred twenty eight thousand U.S. Dollars (USD4,328,000)”.
 
3.  The Table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the GEF Grant Agreement is amended as 
follows:

4. 
Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to the GEF Grant Agreement is amended as follows: 
 
“Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no withdrawals shall be made in 
respect of payments made for expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement, except that 
withdrawals, in an aggregate amount not exceeding an amount equal to $32,500, may be 
made in respect of Categories (1) through (3) of the table in part A.1 of this Section on 
account of payments made for expenditures incurred within twelve (12) months prior to the 
date of this Agreement. 
 
Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing both originals 
to this letter in the spaces provided and returning one fully countersigned original to us.  The 
provisions set forth in this amendment letter shall become effective upon receipt by the Bank of 
one fully executed original of this amendment letter. 
 
Very truly yours,
