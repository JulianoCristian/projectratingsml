The\n            activities supported by the project for the conservation of\n            biodiversity and tropical forests involve the empowerment of\n            main stakeholders throughout local participation on\n            environmental management and strengthening the national\n            capacity for establishing process of sustainable\n            development. The possibility remains that in order to\n            consolidate and renew protected areas, some activities might\n            affect the current livelihoods of people living within the\n            protected areas or in their buffer zones.
