Although the establishment of research\n            programs, which gave way to new technologies for the\n            development of basic crops was a success, and, the training\n            component resulted in a positive performance, the project\n            however, show negligible achievements in its institutional\n            development and poverty alleviation objectives. In addition,\n            the project's overall achievements do not convey a\n            sustainable likelihood. The key lessons learned show that, a\n            long term commitment by governments should be required, in\n            spite of government changes which may occur, given the long\n            term nature of research programs. Attention should be given\n            to achieve well defined research programs, particularly\n            where critical areas are involved. While management\n            continuity is essential for a successful project\n            implementation, management, and monitoring and evaluation,\n            are considered key elements in project performance. Salary\n            scales ought to be in line with those of other civil service\n            staff, to prevent political interference in agency staff\n            appointments, which could possibly divert attention from\n            professional qualifications. Above all, management and\n            technical staff selection criteria, should be respected.\n            Risk identification at the appraisal stage should be closely\n            monitored, with well defined solutions, should risks occur."}, "docdt": "1999-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
