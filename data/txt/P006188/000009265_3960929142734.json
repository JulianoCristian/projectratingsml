The\n            project will establish a Consejo Nacional de Investigacion y\n            Extension Agropecuaria (CNIEA) to more effectively\n            coordinate research and extension in the country as a whole.\n            The project will also strengthen the national agricultural\n            research agency, the Instituto Boliviano de Tecnologia\n            Agropecuaria (IBTA), and focus its efforts on developing\n            technology suitable for smallholders in the highlands.  The\n            new IBTA will be reorganized on the basis of commodity\n            programs, and be charged with overall responsibility for\n            developing agricultural production, processing and marketing\n            technology, and for demonstrating its technical, economic\n            and social viability within the constraints of the rural\n            conditions.
