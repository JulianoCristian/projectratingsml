Additional Financing for\n            Third National Program for Community Empowerment in Rural\n            Areas Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: community health volunteers\n            and ECED volunteer teachers play a critical role in\n            facilitating the achievement of the \u2018final mile\u2019 of basic\n            service delivery. A key factor underpinning Generasi\u2019s\n            success has been the ability of the Project to provide\n            resources to strengthen ongoing community efforts in the\n            areas of outreach and service provision. These efforts\n            represent a major asset on which local government efforts\n            can build during the implementation of the village law.\n            Specific project interventions increased the level of\n            participation of girls and women in community development\n            initiatives. However, men play a key role in decisions that\n            affect maternal and child welfare, such as directing\n            household expenditures towards health and education services\n            and nutritious foods. Efforts must therefore be made to\n            involve men in health and education awareness raising,\n            decision-making, and project implementation. Generasi was\n            integrated in the national government budget cycle, but only\n            to a limited extent in district budgets. This resulted in\n            the absence of an exit-strategy or sustainable financing\n            strategy at the local level, and limited the opportunity for\n            local governments to build on the project's\n            achievements or optimize the use of the assets invested in\n            by the project."}, "docdt": "2015-06-09T02:56:04Z"}
