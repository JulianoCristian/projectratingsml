                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project (P122032) provided additional financing to PNPM-Rural III (P115052) to support expansion of the PNPM Generasi project from its original pilot coverage of 164 rural
                         kecamatan (sub-districts) to include 205 additional rural kecamatan. PNPM Generasi is being further scaled up to a total of 499 rural kecamatan with support from a follow-on project

                         The project is meeting the outcome results indicator targets that contribute to "improved socio-economic conditions" in project areas. Facilitation support and technical assistance
                         provided through the project is contributing to "improved local governance conditions" by increasing local health and education service provider access to information on community

                         needs, which in turn increased service provider efforts at providing health services, such as the number of hours midwives spend providing maternal health services. The Project
                         successfully increased immunization coverage for 12-23 month olds in the target sub-districts from the baseline of 65% to 75% by 2010, and held that achievement until project
                         closure, and this met the end-of-project target. The project also increased prenatal care visits from the baseline of 71% in 2007 to 82% in 2010, and improved on that achievement by
                         project closure (when measured as increase in total number of prenatal visits), which met the end-of-project target. Finally, the Project increased deliveries assisted by trained
                         professionals from the baseline of 67% in 2007 to 77% in 2010, and improved on that achievement by project closure, thereby meeting the end-of-project target. The randomized
                         impact evaluation found that PNPM Generasi had the largest impacts in kecamatan with low baseline health and education performance. As such, the 205 expansion kecamatan
                         were selected based on poor health and education performance. The trust fund is fully disbursed and should close on December 31, 2014.
