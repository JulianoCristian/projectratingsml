         Implementation Support for PNPM Generasi (P122032, P132585)
                                            November 7, 2014



I.      Introduction	
1.       An Implementation Support Mission (ISM) for PNPM Generasi (P122032, P132585), which
included a health and nutrition thematic review, was conducted by the Government of Indonesia (GoI)
and the World Bank from September 28 to October 5, 2014. Representatives from Ministry of Health
(MoH), Ministry of Finance, BAPPENAS, the Millennium Challenge Account-Indonesia (MCA-I) and
the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) participated. The mission visited three
districts in West Java, five districts in Maluku and two districts in South Sumatera, which is one of the
three provinces where the project was newly introduced in 2014. See Annex II for the complete list of
mission locations and participants.

2.       The project development objective (PDO) of PNPM Generasi is to empower local communities
in poor, rural sub-districts in the project provinces to increase utilization of health and education services.
Over the period from 2010 to 2014, the geographic scope of PNPM Generasi has expanded from the
original 164 pilot sub-districts to 499 poor, rural sub-districts. In June 2013, the MCA-I, the GoI entity
accountable for the execution of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact, signed an
Administrative Agreement with the World Bank which committed US$89 million to the PSF to support
the expansion of PNPM Generasi to a further 130 sub-districts in West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan
and South Sumatra provinces, thereby reaching 499 sub-districts.

3.       PNPM Generasi is implemented by the Directorate for Empowerment of Community Traditional
and Cultural Institutions (Directorate Pemberdayaan Adat dan Sosial Budaya Masyarakat, PMD Sosbud)
at the Directorate General of Community and Village Empowerment (PMD) under the Ministry of Home
Affairs. The program is financed by the GoI with PSF Grant support channeled through two Trust Funds.
TF097410 (P122032) is an Additional Financing to PNPM-Rural III, and is scheduled to close on
December 31, 2014. TF014769 (P132585) was approved on June 4, 2013 and established PNPM Generasi
as a stand-alone project. In order to support the geographic expansion of the project and strengthen its
design, the GoI recently requested an Additional Financing (AF) to TF014769 in the amount of up to
US$151.7 million. See Table 1 below for an overview of PNPM Generasi’s funding and geographic
scope.

4.       Geographic expansion was accompanied by substantial design changes that are being
operationalized in 2014. Three new community target indicators were introduced to incentivize men’s and
women’s participation in nutrition counseling sessions, delivered through community health posts
(Posyandu). In education, community target indicators have been simplified to concentrate community
and provider efforts on expanding education services to children who are hardest to reach, including those
with disabilities (and those who live in households with disabled family members), and on the transition
from primary to junior secondary school enrollment, a period during which many poor children drop out
of school. PNPM Generasi’s demand-side approach is now accompanied by complementary activities
aimed at improving the quality and availability of maternal health and nutrition services implemented by
third parties, including the MCA-I.

5.       Mission objectives. The mission focused on monitoring the implementation of health and
nutrition component that includes a series of complementary supply-side activities, executed by the
MCA-I. The mission assessed the progress of expansion, the coordination mechanism among
stakeholders and lessons learned from the early stage of implementation to improve the scaling up in
other areas. The mission also reviewed the implications of the transition to the Village Law
implementation on PNPM Generasi implementation and institutional arrangements. Specifically the
mission objectives were:

(i)   To review the progress towards the achievement of PNPM Generasi’s Project Development
      Objective;
(ii) To review and identify any adjustments to PNPM Generasi implementation and institutional
      arrangements required in light of the implementation of the Village Law.
(iii) To review the progress of the implementation of complementary supply-side activities implemented
      by the MCA-I and the MoH that include Mother, Infant and Young Child Feeding (MIYCF)
      training for frontline workers, distribution of micronutrient supplements, distribution of
      anthropometry equipment, and hygiene and sanitation activities;
(iv) To review Management Information System (MIS) to identify bottlenecks to prompt, accurate data
      entry;
(v) To review compliance with Implementation Guidelines for Social and Environmental Safeguards in
      PNPM Generasi;
(vi) To assess progress of agreed upon actions to improve financial management and procurement
      practices.

6.     The draft Aide Memoire was discussed at the wrap-up meeting with PMD on October 22, 2014.
The meeting chaired by PMD was participated by representatives from the PSF, Ministry of Finance,
MCA-I, DFAT, the PNPM Generasi National Management Consultant (NMC) and the PNPM Generasi
Program Secretariat.

7.      The PSF would like to thank PMD Sosbud, the PNPM Generasi Secretariat, the NMC, the
Regional Management Consultants (RMCs), Ministry of Health, BAPPENAS, Ministry of Finance, the
MCA-I, provincial, district and sub-district governments and PNPM actors, including project facilitators
and consultant coordinators (provincial and district), facilitators (district and sub-district), members of the
Activity Management Units (UPKs), village heads and community members, for their full support to and
active participation in the ISM.

8.      Progress towards development objective. The progress towards achieving the PDO is rated as
Satisfactory. In 2013, PMD began measuring key performance indicators using data collected from its


                                                      12
Performance Monitoring Survey (PMS). The PMS uses a small cluster sampling methodology that allows
for reporting on how the program is performing on average across all participating villages. The results of
the first survey, delivered in October 2013, show that in 2013, PNPM Generasi met or exceeded
performance targets for five out of seven key performance indicators (KPIs). 91 percent of pregnant
women in targeted villages received four prenatal care visits (against a target of 85%). 89 percent of
deliveries were assisted by trained professionals (against a target of 80%). For education, the junior
secondary enrollment rate was recorded 99 percent, well above its target (75%). 71 percent of community
members involved in project planning and decision-making meetings were women (against a target of
65%). The project fell short in 2013 on involving at least 60 percent of the poorest community members
in project planning and decision-making meetings as the rate stayed at 57 percent. Furthermore,
expansion to the 130 new sub-districts is on track. The next PMS is under preparation and will provide
updates for 2014 KPIs by early 2015.

9.       Relevance of PDO and Government Commitment. Through the introduction of a new PTO in
2014, PNPM Generasi’s design has been adjusted to enable the project to tackle problems that are most
relevant to Government, notably improvements in maternal and child health and nutrition, as per its
commitments under the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement. Government has placed an emphasis on
encouraging behavioral change through interpersonal communication delivered through enhanced
maternal health, nutrition, and parenting classes for women and male caregivers. The project’s continued
relevance to the Government is demonstrated through project expansion to three new provinces with high
levels of childhood stunting and commitment of Government co-financing through 2017.

10.   Component One: PNPM Generasi Kecamatan Grants (TF097410: US$ 60.7 million;
TF014769: US$ 93.6 million). Kecamatan Grants worth US$48.2 million have been budgeted for

                                                    13
execution in 2014, US$28 million of which is financed through TF014769 and US$ 20.2 million through
GoI national budget (Rupiah Murni). Kecamatan Grant execution is on schedule, with US$13.9 million,
or 29 percent of the 2014 Kecamatan Grant allocation disbursed to community collective accounts at the
sub-district level as of September, 2014. The remaining 70 percent is on-track for disbursement by the
end of 2014. The PNPM Generasi annual project cycle begins in May to June with problem diagnosis and
community development planning. Kecamatan Grants therefore disburse slowly during the Q3 of each
CY, and accelerate during CYQ4.

11.      In 2013, communities invested 69 percent of block grants in health activities, with the remaining
31 percent invested in educational activities. This continues a trend observed since 2009 in which a larger
share of block grants tends to be invested in health than in education (see Figure 1). The likely reason for
this trend is that other large-scale programs, such as BOS and Scholarships for the Poor (BSM), provide
demand-side support to poor children, whereas public investments are smaller in comparison. Figures 2
and 3 show the breakdown of health and education activities financed through Kecamatan Grants in 2013.
There is not much change in the percentage share of each activity or the order of priority, with 46 percent
of US$14 million investment in health activities being spent on supplementary feeding and 28 percent of
the US$6.1 million invested in education being spent on in-kind support for poor students.

12.      Data from 2,775 villages (75% of total villages) shows that 3,113,472 women and children
benefit directly from Kecamatan Grant investments in 2013. The number of beneficiaries will increase as
data from the remaining 900 villages is uploaded to the MIS. The MIS shows that over 104,163 cases of
underweight children, or 59 per village, were resolved thanks to the program in 2013. Over 563,441
pregnant women, lactating women, and infants, or 267 per village, received parenting or nutrition
counseling through the program, representing a substantial increase from 2011 and 2012 levels. Over
177,238 children aged 59 months and below, or 78 children per village, received immunizations through
the program. Over 175,435 women, or 77 women per village, received postnatal care through the
program. When measured against intermediate results indicators, the component is on track to achieve its
objectives. On average, villages surpass minimum targets for 10 of the 12 community health and
education indicators. Complete vaccinations for children aged 12 months and below and three postnatal
visits are the indicators that communities have the most difficulties in achieving. Participation by women
and the poorest community members reached 71 percent and 57 precent respectively in 2013, which are
higher than those reported in PNPM-Rural.

13.      Component Two: Facilitation Support (TF097410: US$ 9.96 million; TF014769: US$ 10.78
million). The 2014 costs for district and sub-districts facilitators, training, and workshops are being
financed from TF014769. This component finances district and sub-district facilitator costs, training, and
coordination workshops. US$5.3 million is budgeted for execution in 2014. Execution of this component
is on schedule. Provincial specialists, district consultants and sub-district facilitators in 130 new sub-
districts in three new provinces have been successfully mobilized. Vacant positions are well managed by
the project management unit (PMU) with all vacancies filled within three months of implementation. Four
vacant positions in Jawa Barat identified as of September 23, 2014 were filled in with newly recruited
Facilitators by October 14, 2014.

14.      Component Three: Implementation Support and Technical Assistance (TF097410: US$ 2.4
million; TF014769: US$ 8.96 million). The 2014 costs for implementation support and technical
assistance are being financed from TF014769 and TF 097410. TF 097410 financed the first
Administrative Services Firm (ASF 1) contract to support the national and provincial consultants,
procurement of training of trainer and pre-service training for district consultants and sub-district
facilitators in 130 new sub-districts, and procurement of life vests to support program implementation in
island areas. US$3.5 million from TF 014769 finances the second Administrative Services Firm (ASF 2)
contract. The remainder will finance facilitator refresher training and Project Implementation Unit (PIU—
or Satker in Bahasa Indonesia) incremental operating costs. Execution of this component is on-track as
the ASF 2 contract has been procured and runs through January 2016. Based on recent implementation
support mission findings, PMD plans to issue an addendum to the project operations manual to provide
additional guidance to facilitators on maternal and child nutrition issues in January 2015.

15.      Component Four: Project Management Support (TF097410: US$240,000). This component,
which has been fully disbursed under TF097410, provides technical advisory services and other material
support to the PNPM Generasi program secretariat in PMD. The instruction was issued to establish the
2014 Project Secretariat which is now fully staffed and operational. At the beginning of 2014, PMD
further realigned the PNPM Generasi Secretariat to reduce overlap with the NMC, which has helped
improve the overall quality of project management. While this component is no longer part of the stand-
alone project (P132585 and P147658), challenges remain regarding the coordination between the two
directorates for PNPM Rural and PNPM Generasi implementation. At the provincial level, a lack of
clarity regarding the roles and responsibilities of PNPM Generasi and PNPM Rural actors were observed.

16.    Status of actions agreed in the last Aide Memoire. Since the most recent Aide Memoire (dated
June 25, 2013), progress has been made on the pending implementation issues for PNPM Generasi (see
Annex IV for the status of all the actions agreed in the last Aide Memoire). Provincial specialists, district

                                                     16
consultants and sub-district facilitators in 130 new sub-districts in three new provinces have been
successfully mobilized. Vacancies have been filled by PMU within three months of implementation. The
result of the external audit for 2013 Government fiscal year (equivalent to CY2013) in 16 PNPM
Generasi Districts has been exposed by the BPKP and the follow-up actions will be closely monitored by
the World Bank. PMD has also processed the recruitment of Provincial FM Specialist which will be
mobilized in early 2015.

17.      Key findings and recommendations from the current Aide Memoire. The mission team
identified, despite the progress so far, issues that require further actions, particularly on the coordination
among different stakeholders and scaling up of complementary supply side activities. They are discussed
in detail in the following five main sections: (i) Institutional Arrangements; (ii) Health and Nutrition
Component; (iii) MIS; (iv) Financial Management; (v) Procurement; and (vi) Safeguards.


III.    Institutional	Arrangements	
18.     Multi-sectoral coordination. Given the multi-sector nature of PNPM Generasi, strong multi-
sectoral coordination with clear roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of the actors involved is
essential in ensuring the smooth program implementation to reach the intended goals and objectives. In
particular, PNPM Generasi is part of integrated demand and supply called Community-Based Health and
Nutrition Program or Program Kesehatan dan Gizi Berbasis Masyarakat (PKBM). The mission found
that the multi-sectoral coordination among different stakeholders of PKBM needs to be optimized.
Stakeholders at the national and sub-national levels are often not fully informed and updated on the
progress of the complementary supply-side activities and the expected roles (see Inkley report), which in
turn create obstacles for implementation.

19.      Integration of PNPM Generasi in the village planning process (Musrenbang). The important
lesson learnt from Generasi is that the village level planning (Musrenbang) and facilitation process need
to be strengthened to prioritize health and education issues, and to ensure effective use of village funds for
basic health and education service delivery. The mission found that the planning process of PNPM
Generasi is not integrated with the village planning process that results in the production of village
medium-term development plans (RPJMDes). This is due to the fact that PNPM Generasi planning takes
place in July annually, whereas village development planning takes place in February.

20.      Institutional arrangements during the transition to the Village Law implementation. The
mission was unable to confirm the adjustments to the institutional and implementation arrangements
required. For example, the role and levels of support to UPKs in the absence of a PNPM-Rural block
grant transfer are not yet clear. The PNPM coordination structure is also likely to change given changes to
the Cabinet that took place after the mission was completed. The mission found that that future role of
UPK and the transition towards the Village Law platform is still under discussion [at the national level]
and it is not yet possible to provide more specific recommendations on this issue. Subsequent to the
mission institutional changes began to take place, including the nomination of the Cabinet and the related
reorganization of the relevant ministries, including the Coordinating Ministry for People’s Welfare and
the DG PMD in the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Bank will closely monitor the ongoing institutional
changes and support the Government to introduce changes to PNPM Generasi that may be needed to
ensure smooth, effective implementation.

21.      Recommendations. To strengthen the multi-sector coordination at national and sub-national
levels, the mission recommends the following: (i) conduct the multi-sectoral coordination workshop
facilitated by Bappenas, PMD and the PSF to update on implementation progress and agree on concrete
actions to improve coordination; (ii) conduct regular monthly coordination forum as a mechanism to

                                                     17
discuss implementation issues, potential solutions and knowledge sharing and learning, update activity
plans and joint work plan. For coordination at sub-national level, the mission recommends expediting
recruitment of District Health Facilitators by the MCA-I to facilitate coordination among different
divisions within District Health Office as well as bridging the vertical coordination with MoH and MCA-I
and other stakeholders at the central level. To improve the preparedness for the transition to the Village
Law implementation, the mission recommends: (i) prepare addendum (errata) for the 2015 Technical
Operations Manual (PTO) to explain the role of BKAD and other ad-hoc institutions in the transition
period; (ii) pilot activities to integrate the planning process between PNPM Generasi and the Village Law,
closely coordinating with PNPM Rural.


IV.     Health	and	Nutrition	Component	
22.      The complementary maternal and child health and nutrition interventions aim to improve the
coverage and quality of preventive and promotive health services in PNPM Generasi areas to complement
the increased community demand for health services generated through the block grant. The supply-side
activities consist of: (i) Mother, Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices (MIYCF) or PMBA training
for health providers; (ii) distribution of micronutrient supplements; (iii) national awareness campaign for
stunting reduction; (iv) provision of anthropometric equipment; (v) sanitation and hygiene behavioral
change activities; and (vi) private sector engagement. The mission focused on: (i) the overall progress of
complementary supply-side activities; (ii) assessment of PMBA training progress; (ii) implementation of
nutrition counselling sessions for pregnant and lactating women in relation to achieving Generasi
performance indicators; (iii) community-level behavioral change communication (BCC) activities; (iv)
sanitation and hygiene; and (v) effect of National Health Insurance JKN system implementation on
Generasi performance indicators.

Overall progress of complementary supply-side activities

23.     Of all the supply-side components, PMBA training has progressed the furthest. Since March
2014, 32 Master Trainers and more than 400 health frontline workers (Puskesmas staffs, midwifes
(bidan), and Posyandu cadres) in three districts in West Java (West Bandung, Garut and Sukabumi) have
been trained. The PMBA is currently being rolled out in three provinces (South Sumatera, West
Kalimatan and Central Kalimantan). The target is to complete the training in West Java and these three
provinces by the end of 2014 and in eight other PNPM Generasi provinces by the first quarter of 2015.
Other supply-side components are currently either at the preparation or early roll-out stage. The
socialization and training for sanitation triggering has started in August 2014. Formative research for
national stunting awareness campaign will be completed by the end 2014 and will be followed by
campaign design and implementation. For micronutrient supplementation, the micronutrient market
research is underway to inform the project design, including distribution mechanism, procurement
method, and quality control.

24.     The mission found that the scaling up of complementary supply-side activities needs to be
accelerated. These activities impact the achievement of Generasi performance indicators. For example,
the completion of PMBA training is the pre-requisite for Posyandu cadres to deliver nutrition classes for
pregnant women and mothers of children 0-2 years-old, which in turn influences achievement of two
recently-added Generasi performance indicators, particularly PDO indicator 1.4 (% of pregnant women
participating in pregnancy nutrition classes (kelas ibu hamil) monthly) and 1.5 (% of parents of children
0-2 years-old participates in parenting nutrition classes (kelas balita) monthly). MCA-I has increased the
number of Master Trainers to speed up the PMBA training; however it needs to be reviewed whether the
addition is sufficient to reach target coverage by the first quarter of 2015.


                                                    18
Assessment of PMBA training

25.      The mission observed a number of positive effects of PMBA training on Posyandu cadres in the
location visited. The training has improved cadres’ capacity to conduct group-level and individual
counseling. In one Posyandu, it was observed that the cadres trained in PMBA are demonstrating how to
cook nutritious foods using locally-sourced ingredients. This practice is in line with recommended
practices in PMBA and could be shared with other Posyandu. PMBA training is also expected to have a
positive effect on the quality of health sub-project. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the PMBA training
raises the facilitators’ awareness of the importance of shifting from manufactured supplementary foods
towards locally-sourced foods. Despite these promising findings, the mission identified a number of
issues with regards to the scaling-up of PMBA training and supporting activities to ensure the quality of
training.

26.       Expanding the number of Posyandu cadres trained for PMBA. Currently only two cadres are
trained in each village. Given that each village could have 35-45 cadres, there is a need to expand the
training to cover more cadres. There is no clear funding mechanism for expanding the training. In Garut
district, the local government uses a combination of funding sources to scale up the training: at the district
level, APBD supports the training for midwifes. At the sub-district level, BOK supports the transportation
cost for bidan to come to the village; and at village level, Generasi block grants supports cadres to come
to the training. However, this model cannot be expected to be replicated in all areas. In addition to the
funding mechanism, the scaling-up requires a sufficient number of trainers. Currently, only trained health
workers such as midwives are eligible to conduct training to Posyandu cadres.

27.      Supportive supervision to ensure quality of counseling. The cascade training model such as
PMBA requires good quality control mechanisms at each level. The tiered, supportive supervision
activities (district – Puskesmas – Posyandu cadres) are necessary to ensure the quality of PMBA
counseling activities. MoH and UNICEF have developed supportive supervision modules and the MCA-I
nutrition team has been discussing the possibility to use these modules in the PKBM project.

28.     Recommendations: (i) MCA-I will look into the possibility of adding the number of Posyandu
cadres trained for PMBA. Given that there will be a new funding channeling arrangement with MoH, the
rapid scaling-up of PMBA should be feasible; and (ii) MCA-I will follow up with MoH on rolling out the
supportive supervision training to ensure the quality of PMBA activities.

Implementation of nutrition counseling and parenting classes in relation to achievement of Generasi
indicators

29.      Two new target indicators related to participation of pregnant women and mothers in nutrition
classes (PDO indicators 1.4 and 1.5) were added in 2014 as a proxy to measure community and health
provider efforts at reducing stunting. These new indicators are intended to incentivize communities to
work together with health providers, most notably midwives, nutritionists, and community health
volunteers, to regularly implement nutrition counseling and parenting classes in target villages. These
classes are meant to complement the mandatory nutrition classes for pregnant women (to be attended a
minimum of three times during pregnancy) given by midwives. Recognizing the importance of the
nutrition classes in adopting appropriate nutrition and care practices for stunting reduction, PNPM
Generasi aims to increase the frequency of nutrition classes to a monthly basis. Given midwives’ high
workload, the Posyandu cadres will be conducting these additional classes. Upon completing the PMBA
training, the cadres will become counselors and eligible to conduct these classes.

30.    Implementation issues. Currently, the explanation of the implementation of nutrition classes in
PTO is not clear in terms of who is eligible to deliver the classes. Further discussion will be done with

                                                     19
MoH to clarify the operational definition of “nutrition counseling”. It should be reiterated that Posyandu
cadres are eligible to conduct the nutrition classes upon completing the PMBA training. For parenting
class for mothers and caregivers of children 0-2 years-old, BKKBN has mandated parenting classes for
mothers of children under five. However, these classes are not being delivered on a regular basis.

31.     Recommendations: (i) accelerate the scaling-up of PMBA training in all locations to enable the
implementation of the nutrition and parenting classes.; (ii) clarify the operational definition of “nutrition
counseling” among MoH, MCA-I and PMD.

Community-level behavioral change communication (BCC) activities

32.      BCC activities are limited only to mothers. At the community and household levels, other
actors (e.g. husbands, grandmothers, and religious leaders) play an important role in influencing mothers’
decisions regarding prenatal and child care. One of the main challenges of behavior change is to get
husband/fathers to support and encourage breastfeeding. In some cases, the majority of mothers work
outside of the home so it is the grandmothers and other caregivers who play a key role in child care and
feeding practices. The BCC activities have not explicitly reached out to these caregivers.

33.      Interpersonal communication: For effective behavioral change, international experience shows
that interpersonal communication is essential in influencing mothers to adopt recommended healthy
behaviors. Currently, interpersonal communications (where they take place through home visits) focus on
curative care. Posyandu cadres generally only visit those who are diagnosed as malnourished or those
who do not attend Posyandu session (a process called “sweeping”). This focus on curative care needs to
be augmented by a focus on preventive care.

34.      Recommendations: (i) the community level BCC strategy needs to explicitly reach out to key
caregivers besides mothers. For example, cultural activities that deliver key nutrition messages can
involve husbands and religious leaders in order to increase engagement rates. Lessons learned can be
obtained from PNPM Creative Communities; (ii) made compulsory for husband to attend Posyandu and
nutrition counselling class. This has been done on several locations, although the attendance rate is still
not optimal; (iii) devise innovative peer group mobilization such as through religious gathering to
intensify interpersonal communication for adoption of desired behavioral change.

Effect of (National Health Insurance) JKN implementation

35.      Impact on declining delivery assisted by skilled attendants. Since the roll-out of the National
Health Insurance (JKN) system in 2014, the Health Insurance for Pregnant Women (Jampersal) program
no longer operates, yet many poor mothers are not yet enrolled in JKN. The participation in JKN is still
low due to factors such as limited socialization, payment method, unaffordable premium payment, and
transfer of benefits to JKN. As a result, they have shifted back towards delivery assisted by Traditional
Birth Attendant (Paraji) for financial reason. For example, in Cibalong sub-district, delivery assisted by
skilled attendants was 90 percent by the end of 2013. For 2014, the current figure is only 41 percent, a
change that is likely in part influenced by challenges in implementation the JKN. This affect the
achievement of PNPM Generasi performance indicators, since delivery by skilled attendant is one of
PNPM Generasi indicator.

36.      Recommendations: follow up with the Ministry of Health to ensure smooth transition to JKN and
identification of concrete measures of local government to address this issue (eg using Jamkesda for
deliver costs).

Sanitation and Hygiene component

                                                     20
37.     Sanitation problems are inadequately addressed while environment-borne diseases such as
diarrhea remain high. The communicable disease such as diarrhea plays an important role in reducing
stunting. The mission observed that there were only limited numbers of sanitarian at the health center and
they often do not fully dedicate their time on sanitation issues.

38.      Recommendations: MCC will discuss with the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and the PSF
on how to strengthen the design and implementation of sanitation component. Initiate discussion to
possibly increase the target for Open Defecation Free (ODF) villages for each Puskesmas. Currently the
target of ODF is only 2 villages per health center, and this will be improved.


V.      Management	Information	System	(MIS)	
39.      The current performance of MIS indicates that the completeness of data entry is around 75
percent of 2013 target villages, which is below the target of 80 percent. Moreover, MIS quality assurance
practices continue to require improvement. The mission focused on: (i) issues affecting compliance on
reporting; (ii) adherence to quality control procedures; (iii) human resources capacity, including
incentives; (iv) coordination and supportive supervision from relevant stakeholders. The mission
identified several key issues that require follow up.

40.     Supervision and guidance by District Facilitators (Faskab) of Data Operators. Currently,
Faskabs have not provided adequate guidance to Data Operators on data management and reporting
mechanism which resulted in reporting delay and unsatisfactory data quality. Moreover, Data Operators
are often asked to perform duties outside their ToRs, which further exacerbate this problem. The training
of Faskabs should include in-depth materials on reporting and supervision mechanism to Data Operator to
optimize the role of Faskabs in ensuring the compliance and timeliness of reporting.

41.     Supervision and guidance by Sub-District Facilitators (FK) of Village Facilitators (KPMD).
As the frontline in data collection activity, the KPMDs play a key role in ensuring that all the forms are
completed, data are consistently reported and the MIS data is being used for improvement in program
implementation. Currently, FKs’ supervision and guidance to KMPD is not optimal. This resulted in
incomplete forms and lack of data consistency. The mission revealed an innovative mechanism
implemented by some FKs, whereby they stipulate data reporting completeness as a condition before
moving to the next stage of implementation.

42.     Quality of district monthly reporting. The district monthly report does not include adequate
analysis of the performance achievement and implementation issues at the village level. The report
includes attachments that may not always be relevant for the particular stage of project implementation.
This tends to result in bulky reports and discourages the use of the reports in a meaningful way.

43.     Recommendations: (i) the PSF and NMC will facilitate a workshop to review the M&E system
and develop concrete actions to improve the MIS. This will build on the thorough understanding of the
underlying causes for suboptimal MIS performance and finding innovative ways to improve incentives
for better data quality and usage of information’ (ii) NMC and PMD will consider developing the
performance evaluation mechanism for district and sub-district facilitators that include the completeness
of MIS as one of the criteria for operational cost payment; (iii) finalizing M&E field guidance for
provincial, district and sub-district consultants and facilitators and improve training.




                                                   21
VI.      Financial	Management	
44.      Overall, financial management in the project was rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The mission
noted that the balances of Pokja accounts are continuously monitored; IFR is submitted on time; all BPKP
findings for FY 2012 have been followed up; and most of our previous recommendations from February
2014 have been followed up. However, the mission also found some weaknesses in financial
administration at the UPK level due to poor facilitation and supervision performance of facilitators both at
district and sub-district level. The importance of facilitation and supervision will be heightened with the
significant expansion of locations in which PNPM Generasi operates in FY 2014. Therefore the mission
reminds PMU to ensure that new FM Consultants at Provincial level are be mobilized as scheduled (by
February 28, 2015) to ensure FM monitoring and facilitation needs can be met.

43.     Disbursement. There are two Trust Funds that finance this project – TF097410 and TF014769.
Total grant amount for TF097410 is US$ 73.32 million. As of September 2014, the outstanding amount in
the Designated Account (DA) is US$ 6.15 million. Therefore, the actual disbursement was US$ 67.17
million or 91% of the total grant amount. GoI would like to propose reallocation of this balance funds
from TF097410 to the ongoing Trust Fund (TF014769) but formal actions have yet been taken.

44.     Total grant amount for TF014769 after the additional financing is US$ 113.34 million. Client
Connection data as of September 30, 2014 showed disbursement was US$ 40.16 million and the DA was
US$ 32.96 million. However, the actual balance of the DA was US$ 26.12 million. Therefore, the actual
disbursement was US$ 14.04 million or 12% of the total grant. The IFR as of June 30, 2014 showed the
disbursement forecast for the period of July-December 2014 was US$32.96 million. This grant will be
closed in December 31, 2017. Therefore, the current disbursement rate is in line with the expected
disbursement rate.

45.      Internal Audit. Following up our previous mission recommendation, FasKeu have consistently
submitted internal audit reports to NMC on a quarterly basis. Based on the NMC Internal Audit report as
of June 30, 2014 for audit the Block Grant FY 2013, implementation coverage of internal audit is still
under the sample target. The mission found that NMC did not achieve all sample audit targets due to a
number of activities which were not in the NMC’s work plan, i.e. review and revise the PTO, involve in
recruitment facilitator, develop modules for many workshops and training, and attend training or
workshop as participant or trainer. At the District level, mission inquiries revealed that targets were not
achieved due to inefficient use of District Facilitators’ time. For example, they spent too much time in
reviewing the block grant and attend trainings or meetings. Therefore, the mission recommends that PMU
issue a memo to instruct all Specialists at NMC and District Facilitators to prioritize achievement of
internal audit targets for audit of the Block Grant CY 2014 by April 30, 2015 and ensure training of
District Facilitators reiterates how to efficiently and effectively conduct the audit.

Governance

46.     Financial transparency. Financial transparency and mechanisms for channeling public
complaints need to be improved. The mission observed that the use of information boards as means for
financial transparency needs to be improved. The mission recommends that PMD reformulate the design
of information dissemination to the public. The suggested approach is “information comes to community”
instead of “community comes to information” Some of the examples are leaflets, announcement in
community village group activities, community radio and SMS.

47.     Complaints handling mechanism. The mission observed that the results findings from
supervision and monitoring of issues of misuse of funds, and failure to respect program principles and
procedures have not been optimally recorded in Complaint Handling System (PAPPM application).
Moreover, the communication and follow of these cases by facilitators and relevant program actors need
to be strengthened. There is also inadequate analysis on the underlying causes of the problems, which
often resulted in recurring and unresolved problems. The mission recommends: (i) Satker Pusat/PMD
send out a letter to Satker at province and district level to improve the enforcement protocols for
following up cases found during supervision and monitoring activities by December 31, 2014; (ii) NMC
to conduct a comprehensive review the complaints handling Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to
address the systemic problems in complaints handling and develop concrete actions for improvement by
December 31, 2014.

48.      System for joint sanctions with PNPM-Rural areas. Lack of clarity in enforcement of
sanctions for areas where both PNPM Rural and PNPM Generasi programs exist. In some cases, problems
with corruption and misuse of funds in PNPM Rural program may lead to suspension of PNPM Generasi
activities in the same area. This creates a significant risk for achieving PNPM Generasi performance
indicators and affecting the health and nutrition status of mothers and children in the targeted areas. The
recommendation is not to sanction PNPM Generasi when problems occur under PNPM-Rural that are
unrelated to Generasi funds, actors, or related local institutions. This should be reflected in the errata of
the supplemental PTO PNPM Generasi.


VII.    Procurement	
Procurement arrangements at the community level

49.     The mission carried out community procurement review of selected sub-projects i.e. procurement
of school uniforms, kits and stationery, equipment for mothers and children health clinic, and pipes for
plumbing connections to the school. The mission noted the delays in distribution of printed copies of the

                                                     23
revised PTO of the PNPM-Rural Project at the village level, which shall be also applicable for the PNPM-
Generasi Project. The mission was informed that though the revised PTO of PNPM-Rural Project became
applicable from April 2014, procurement at the village level was still carried out as per the existing PTO
for PNPM-Rural For instance, a price survey comparison was conducted for sub-activities (contract)
valued below Rp. 15 million while bidding process was taken for sub-activity (contract) valued above Rp.
15 million.

50.     No significant issue was observed in procurement of the abovementioned selected contracts
carried out at the visited villages in West Java and Maluku Provinces. The UPK and TPK have also
maintained adequate records of procurement documents. Further review of community procurement of
other selected contracts will be carried out by the Bank during the ex-post review mission, planned in
March 2015.

51.      Upon request from PMD, the mission also observed the arrangements for the nomination and
hiring of teachers, delivery nurses, tutors, and cadres for Posyandu, and also arrangement for supplies of
consumables foods for supplementary feeding activities (PMT) that are specific to PNPM Generasi
program. While, the revised PTO is applicable for all types of community-based goods and services,
including procurement of commodities, the Bank team envisaged that the above mentioned specific
activities shall not be included as community procurement. Detailed arrangements will be further
discussed and agreed between PMD and the Bank.

Procurement arrangements at the national level

52.     Procurement at the national level has been generally carried out as per the Procurement Plan.The
main contract i.e. ASF-2 contract became effective on May 1, 2014 for 21 months contract period and
expected to be completed on January 31, 2016.

53.        Recommendations: (i) PMD shall modify the procurement arrangements at the community level
specified in the PTO of PNPM Generasi to be consistent with the revised arrangements specified in the
revised PTO of PNPM-Rural by December 31, 2014; (ii) As the revised PTO is yet to be distributed by
PMD for implementation by the communities, PMD shall make copies of the revised PTO available up to
the community level at the earliest, and also work out the action plan for socialization so that provisions
of the revised PTO are clearly understood and implemented in all the villages by December 31, 2014; and
(iii) with the guidance of the World Bank team, PMD will develop detailed guidance for procuring for
supplies of consumables foods for supplementary feeding activities (PMT) that are commonly needed for
PNPM Generasi with the aim of safeguarding beneficiaries from any potential social or environmental
risks by December 31, 2014.


VIII. Safeguards	
54.      The mission found no serious adverse environmental or social impacts, and concluded that overall
implementation of safeguards was proceeding well. Infrastructure subprojects funded through PNPM
Generasi are relatively small in number and scale. Most infrastructure subprojects finance rehabilitation
of existing facilities. As such, no land donation cases were found.
55.     Safeguards procedures have been included in the PTO and strengthened via the formulation of
Implementation Guidelines for Social and Environmental Safeguards (IGSES). The IGSES has been
disseminated to PNPM Generasi facilitators, but greater effort is needed to ensure that they are being
understood and applied.



                                                    24
56.     Recommendations: PMD/NMC needs to ensure that all PNPM Generasi actors at all levels have
received the IGSES document by December 31, 2014. This should be followed by training that
strengthens IGSES implementation.
