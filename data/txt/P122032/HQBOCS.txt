Dear Mr. Waluyanto:
Re: Indonesia: Amendment No. 2 to the PNPM Support Facility Trust Fund (PSF) -
PNPM Generasi Project - TFO97410 (Second Additional Financing Amendment)
I refer to the grant agreement ("Original Grant Agreement"), dated August 16, 2010 as
amended through June 6, 2011 (the "First Additional Financing Amendment"), between the Republic
of Indonesia (the "Recipient") and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the
"World Bank") acting as administrator of grant funds under the Support Facility for the National
Program for Community Empowerment ("PSF") (TF070967 and TFO71562), for the PNPM Generasi
Project (the "Project"). The Project provides grant financing for the Recipient's Program for
National Community Empowerment, or Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Mandiri,
("PNPM") related to health and education-related activities under the PNPM Program for a Bright
and Healthy Generation, or PNPM Mandiri Perdesaan Generasi Sehat dan Cerdas) ("PNPM
Generasi"). The Grant Agreement provided for a grant in the amount of ten million two hundred
thousand United States Dollars (US$10,200,000) (the "Original Grant") financed out of PSF
TF070967. The First Additional Financing Amendment provided for an additional grant in the
amount of twenty eight million one hundred twenty three thousand United States Dollars
(US$28,123,000), also financed out of PSF TF070967 (the "First Additional Financing Grant").
I refer also to: (i) the letter from the Ministry of Finance dated June 13, 2012, requesting
additional financing in the amount of thirty five million United States Dollars (US$35,000,000) to be
financed out of PSF TF070967 to support Project activities in the existing Kecamatan and an
additional 50 Kecamatan together with related amendments and an extension of the Closing Date;
and (ii) the endorsement of the PSF Joint Management Committee on April 10, 2012 for the
requested second additional financing.
The World Bank has considered the request, and on the basis of the endorsement of the PSF
Joint Management Committee described above, agrees to amend the Grant Agreement as set out
below (the "Second Additional Financing Amendment").
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Second Additional Financing Amendment have
the meanings given to them in the Grant Agreement, as amended. Except as specifically provided for
in this agreement, all of the terms and conditions set out in the Grant Agreement, as amended by the
First Additional Financing Amendment, shall apply to this Second Additional Financing
