This framework serves as an\n            umbrella guideline for the project to identify, consult and\n            provide mechanisms to address potential positive and\n            negative impacts that subprojects may have on Indigenous\n            Peoples (IPs) or Isolated and Vulnerable Peoples (IVPs). It\n            outlines the procedures put in place to ensure that all\n            project activities are assessed and potential IVP issues are\n            identified and addressed before an activity with the\n            potential to affect IVPs commences. This framework reflects\n            the stated objective. It ensure that indigenous peoples\n            participate in and benefit from the project through a free,\n            prior, and informed consultation; and avoid or minimize\n            potentially adverse effects of the project on indigenous\n            peoples' communities. When avoidance is not feasible,\n            minimize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects. The\n            project design of the PNPM rural series and their\n            predecessor, the Kecamatan Development Project (KDP), is\n            structured to ensure the participation and inclusion of\n            various groups (including women, the poor, and isolated and\n            vulnerable peoples) in local level decision making over\n            resource allocation. Specific measures in the project design\n            include social mapping to identify target beneficiaries;\n            village-level project facilitators and implementing teams\n            elected by their communities; development of sub-village\n            planning units; and verification by teams from outside the\n            village on sub-project appropriateness and compliance with\n            project rules."}, "docdt": "2011-09-12T00:00:00Z"}
