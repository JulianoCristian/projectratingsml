  About this Report
       The Operations EvaluationDepartmentassessesthe programsand activities of the World Bank for two
  purposes: first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank's self-evaluation processand to verify that the Bank's work is
  producingthe expected results, and second, to help develop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough
  the disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, OED annually assessesabout 25 percentof
  the Bank's lending operations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to thosethat are
  innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcoming studies or countryevaluations;those for which
  ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments; and those that are likelyto generate
  importantlessons.The projects,topics, and analytical approachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluation
  studies.
       A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion
  Report (a self-evaluation by the responsibleBank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
  PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
  the borrowing country for onsite discussionswith projectstaff and beneficiaries. The PPARthereby seeks to
  validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
  OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED management approval. Once cleared internally, the
  PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
  Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


 About the OED Rating System
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
 The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
 the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
 current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
 goals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
 Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy:The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
 account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency:The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
 opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
       Sustainability:The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       lnstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
 to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
 better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
 better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
 institutional arrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
 project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance:The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
 supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
 for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance:The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
 quality of preparation and implementation,and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
 achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
 Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

 Summary

         This i s a ProjectPerformance Assessment Report (PPAR) on two education
 projectsinHonduras. The RuralPrimaryEducationManagementproject
 (ADEPRIR) was approved for aUS$4.4 millionloaninMay 1987. After the project was
 restructured in 1993, total project costs were reduced from US$6.9 to US$5.3 million.
 The loan closed on December 31, 1995, anddisbursedalmost fully after extensions
 totaling 18 months; US$0.08 was canceled. The BasicEducationproject (PROMEB), was
 approved for a credit ofUS$30millionon July 12, 1994. The credit closed as scheduledon
 December 31,200 1, anddisbursedfully.

         While eachproject had its own specific objectives, the common goals were to
 increase quality o fprimary education, train teachers, and make the management o f
 education more efficient. The Rural Primary Education Management Project carried out
relatively few activities duringmost of its implementationperiod, was reduced inscope,
 and ultimately didnot fulfill its objectives. The Basic EducationProject succeededin
carrying out most o f its plannedactivities and substantially achieved its objectives.

         The Bank's education sector strategy inHonduras has been relevant to the human
resource development needs o fthe country andthe goals o f the Educationfor All
strategy, Though the projects faced multiplefinancial and implementation problems, they
implementedseveral activities andprovidedinputsto the sector. The educationbudget
has increased steadily. Access to education hasbeen highsince the 1980s and has
improved somewhat, while overall dropout and repetitionhave decreased. Nevertheless,
theprojects had a limitedimpact onthe quality of education, partlybecausethey invested
inareas (such asbuildingsandgeneral teacher education) that are necessarybuthave
beenshownto bear little direct relationto achievement inHonduras. Standardized
achievement test scores show very limitedacquisition o f curricular content, and
internationalcomparisons place Honduras below all other LatinAmerican countries in
this respect. Forvarious reasons, classes are heldabout 60 percent o fthe mandatedtime,
andthepercentageo fchildren completingthe 6th grade (about 70 percent) hasnot
changed significantly since 1994. Thus, achieving universal graduation fromprimary
school under the Education for All Fast-Track Initiative requires that much more school
timebe spent inlearning andearly acquisitionof fast andeffortless reading.

        The outcome o fthe RuralPrimaryEducationManagementProjectis rated
unsatisfactory becauseits management-oriented objectives were not achieved. Institutional
development i s rated modest. Sustainability i s rated likely becausemost o fthe activities
envisaged under this project are beingimplemented 10 years after its completion. Bankand
borrowerperformance are rated unsatisfactory; the design was extremely ambitious given
the US$5.3 millionproject cost, andthe government had little ownership andinterest init.
The outcome o fthe BasicEducationProjectis rated satisfactory, andinstitutional
development i s rated substantial. Sustainability i s rated likely, while Bank andborrower
performance are rated satisfactory.

       Experience with the assessedprojects confirms a number o f OED lessons from
the education sector:

    0  Despite considerable quality-orientedinvestments by both the assessed projects,
      progress instudent performance has been limited.Thus, educational project inputs
       andrisingeducation budgetsdo not translate automatically into increased student
      performance. To increase Performance, teachers and students must use inputs
       effectively and maximizethe instructional time students are engaged inlearning.

    0 Both assessedprojects developed actionplans, but their implementationwas
       limited. Such actions must be feasible within the budget and humanresources
       available, and Government officials must also clearly perceive the need for plans
       and the subsequent actions.

    0 The Basic EducationProject (PROMEB) and its follow-throughproject
      successfully involved the communities inthe management o frural schools.
      Decentralizationo f school management to the community level may mobilize
      local support for the schools and increase pride inachievement by students and
      teachers.

   0  The achievement tests developed through PROMEBprovidedvaluable
      monitoring information to the government, but outcomes were not widely
      disseminated, anduse was limited. The development o f standardized achievement
      tests strengthens the capacity o f institutions to obtain monitoring information. To
      be valuable, however, the informationmustbe disseminated widely at the school
      level ifpossible, and actions must be carried out based on the feedback it
      provides.

 1.        Background

 1.1       Honduras i s a Central American country with a populationo f about 6.3 million
 and a GDP per capita o f $9201that has devoted since the 1990s substantial public
 resources to education. In2001, total public expenditureon education amounted to about
 6.4 percent o f GDP or 23.4 percent o ftotal government expenditure. Between 1990 and
 2000,45 to 50 percent o fthe total education expenditurewas for primary education,
 about 14to 18 percent for secondary education, and 25 to 30 percent for higher
 education.2 The large share o f expenditure on primary education mayhave contributedto
 the provisionof almost universal access to primary education since the late 1980s inboth
 rural and urban areas (106 percent gross and 87.6 percent net enrollmentrate in2000).3

 1.2      To educate ruralpopulations inits mostly mountainous terrain, Honduras has
 followed a strategy o fbuildingsmall, multigrade schools. About 81percent o fthe
 country's schools have fewer than six teachers and are mainly multigrade; 62.1 percent
 have three to six grades inone room4 However, standardized achievement test scores
 show limitedacquisitiono fbasic skills, partlybecause of very low instructional time.
 Schools should function for 200 days, but maybe open for only about 110 days (average
 3 to 4 hours d a i l ~ )Only about 70 percent o f those enrolledingrade 1graduate from
                            . ~
 primaryschool andmost take longerthanthe expected 6 years.6Lowperformancehas
 been to some extent related to centralized decision-making functions o f the Ministryo f
 Education(SE, Secretaria de Educacih). Teachers inthe past got little in-service training
 andcouldnot deal withthe challenges o fteaching the poor. Therefore, the large amounts
 o fmoney that the country inprinciple makes available to the students have not brought
 about commensurate educational benefits.

 1.3      The countryhashad some unusual circumstances. To support guerrillas against
the Sandinista regime inNicaragua, considerable U.S. financing entered the country in
the 1980s, partly inthe form o f aid through USAID. Nevertheless, in 1988 Honduras fell
inarrearswithrespectto repayment ofWorldBankloans, andfrombeinganIBRD
country it eventually started borrowing on IDA terms. A "shock" treatment was
introducedin 1990 along with a social investment fund (FHIS, Fondo Hondurefio de
Inversi6n Social) to deal with the poverty that ensued. Finally, on October 26, 1998,

indicate net enrollmentrates of 78% in 1980and 89% in 1991(Edstats-WorldBankEducational Statistics; education
expendituredata for 2001 from the Ministry of Education.) Grossenrollment refers to all school-agedchildren,
whereasnet enrollmentrefers to the ages that shouldbe ina specific grade.

 o f the country's primary schools that housedmore than 170,000 students (10 percent o f
 the basic education studentpopulation) resultinginfurther interruptionsinservice
 provision. Repair and replacement costs for schools andmaterials, estimated at US$31.2
 million, were largely covered through donor aid.

 Donor Involvementinthe EducationSector ofHonduras

 1.4       Aside from the Bank, several intemationaldonors (USAID, GTZ, Canada,
 Sweden, Japan, Spain, UNICEF, Inter-AmericanDevelopmentBank)have beeninvolved
 inHonduras since the early 1980sandhave supportedits educationbudget.' Themain
 donor i s USAID, which has had long-term technical presence inthe country. It has
 financed textbook development, teacher training and a successful effort to make schools
 more efficient.8 German organizations (KfW and GTZ) have financed constructions o f
 classrooms and district offices, books and classroom libraries, financial management, and
 evaluation. The Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank (IDB) has mainly financed secondary
 and vocational education. Inaddition, the countrybenefits from the presence o f large
 national and intemationalnongovernmental organizations, such as PlanHonduras, Plan
 Intemacional, Visi6n Mundial. These NGOs organize communities to support housing,
 health, school attendance, includingdistance education secondary schooling for rural
 students.

 1.5       According to persons interviewedby the OED mission, the donor community
 supports the same objectives, collaborates well, andmeets frequently. The donors have
 strongly encouraged educational reform to make the system more efficient and seem able
to influence the government's decisions on policy issues. Theyprovided critical and fast
helpafter hurricaneMitchto rebuildschools andprovide materials so that schools would
open on schedule inFebruary 1999. A group o fdonors has agreed to finance the budget
necessary for the Fast-Track Initiative (FTI), which started in2003.' Its goals include
reachinga net enrollment ratio o f 95 percent for primary education, with a 100percent
graduation rate o f those reachinggrade 6 by 2015.

Bank Sector Strategy

 1.6      Since the first World Bank-financedproject in 1974, country dialogue has mainly
focused on quality and administrativeefficiency. All four completed Bankprojects in

amounts are not reported.
8. The USAIDEducationalEfficiency Projectand distance educationincreasedcoverage by 22 percent over the
previousrate, loweredrepetition by26 percent, andreduceddropout by 32 percent inproject areas during
implementation(about 20% of the country). The distanceeducationproject Educatodosimproved test scores
significantly over those of studentsintraditional programs.Another project trained 250 teachers ofmarginal areas in2-
3 monthsoverseas to serve as trainers (Mayen et al., ADEPRIR evaluation, p. 12). In2001 it started the project
`Salvemos el Primer Ciclo' in Comayaguato reduce repetition by helping teachers create curricular calendars and
monitoring performancethrough its own test scores.
9. The fast-track initiative will be implementedby Education Secretariatteams rather than aproject implementation
unit. Very few actionshadtakenplace at the time the mission was in the field, except for a planning exercise to
combine smallerschools.

Honduras (including the projects evaluated inthis report; see Table l), to strengthen
                                                                                    tried
primary education, even at a time when vocational and secondary education were
considered priorities by the Bank. They supported teacher training and improved
infrastructure, primarily inmultigrade schools: about 2,500 primary classrooms were
built andmorethan 2,500 repaired.

 1.7      The FirstEducation Project" focused on teacher training at the primary,
secondary, agricultural, and vocational level. Itbuilt or supported 25 institutions,
including four primary teacher training schools and a secondary teachers' college that
became the UniversidadPedag6gicaNacional. Inthe first few years, enrollments inthe
training centers were only 70 percent o fplanned capacity (that is, 802 secondary-level
teachers instead o f the planned 1,400), but eventually capacity increased to double the
estimates produced at appraisal. The Second EducationProject" built about 550 rural
primary schools and upgradedprimary-school teachers as well as staff inteacher training
colleges. It also supported agricultural and forestry schools, though these had enrollment
shortfalls andhighunit costs. The PPAR mentions that educational quality had improved.
Aside from implementingtwo moreprojects (the subjects o fthisreport), the Bank has
also financed three Social Investment FundProjects (Credits 2212-HO, 2401-HO, Cr.
2766-HO, approved in 1991, 1992, and 1995, respectively); they have devoted some
resources to school construction. Ultimately, the implementing agency (Fondo
Hondureiio de InversionSocial -FHIS) was selected by the government as the financial
intermediary for investmentsinschool construction. The project that currently supports
ruralprimary schools i s the Community Based EducationProject (PROHECO," Table 1).
PROHECO i s continuing the drive to make education accessible to the more remote areas
while improving school-level management.

1.8       Sector work has been financed by various donors with extensive government
participation. GTZ financed sectoral research in 1997. The Bankand USAID have
carried out analytical and sector work on specific issues, such as research on the
determinants o f improvedperformance andreduced repetition. l3               The extent to which
findingshavebeenusedto improve sector strategy is unknown.

2.2       RuralPrimary EducationManagementProject (ADEPRIR). Thisproject o f
US$6.9 millionwas to strengthenthe technical capacity o f the Secretariat o f Education,
evaluate its administrativeorganization, conduct studies on decentralization policies, and
train and support staff. Through a three-phase process ineach school district o f six out o f
12selected departments, action plans for physical facilities, teacher training, and school
managementhpervision would be developed as well as operationalplans that would
integrate all the planso f the six departments(inAtlantida, Colbn, CortCs, Gracias a Dios,
Islas de laBahia, Yoro). Theproposed action planswould thenbe appliedthrough a pilot
subproject in 12 school districts. Through improvedplanning, the activities were to teach
critical skills and to create a new attitude o fthe studentstoward themselves and the
teachers." It was unclear how the activities were meant to accomplish the goals.

Nevertheless, components included (a) institutional strengthening and (b) regional
planningandmanagement. (See Annex A Table 1for specific activities andtargets).

2.3      BasicEducation Project (PROMEB). Incontrast to the earlier projects,
PROMEBwas large, with acost ofUS$50million, includingparallelfinancing from
KfWofUS$13 million. Itwas to continue theactivitiesoftheUSAID educational
efficiency project (1993-96) and emphasized learning achievement. Components
included (a) improving the quality o fbasic education (US$38.2 million) and (b)
institutional strengthening (US$14.9 million; see Annex A Table 2 for specific activities
and targets). Coverage extended inprincipleto rural andremote areas o fthe entire
country. A teacher performance incentiveplanwas replaced soon after effectiveness by a
community-based integrated approach to retrain and improve the performance o f
teachers.


3.       ImplementationoftheAssessed Projects

RuralPrimaryEducationManagementProject(ADEPRIR; Ln.2804-HO; FY87-95)

3.1      Shortly after the loanbecame effective inApril 1988, all operations inHonduras
were suspendedfor 18months due to the country's repayment arrearsto the Bank
(December 1988- June 1990). Work continueduntilthe available tranche o f funds was
exhausted in 1989. The project was reactivated in 1991, but the government accorded
some of these objectives a lower priority and didnot allocate sufficient counterpart funds.
At the same time, projects ofother donors werebeingimplemented(USAID, Japan,
UNESCO, Holland, and Germany), some with similar components. In1993, the project
was amended. Objectives were not changed, but the regional planning and management
components were scaled down; though the loan amount remained the same, project size
was reduced to US$5.3 million and only 2 o f the 12 school districts originally proposed
for the project benefited(the municipalities o f Choloma inCortks and Olanchito in
Yoro). Project funds were used to build rural schools andprovide textbooks inthese
districts, as well as prepare PROMEB, the follow-on project. To carry out these new
activities, the completion date was extended three times for a total o f 18 months. The
government's project evaluation report expresses concern about a lack o f follow-up and
sustainability.l6

BasicEducationProject(PROMEB; Cr. 2694-HO; FY95-02)

3.2     Soon after effectiveness, the project became almost inactive anddisbursed rather
slowly untilthe time o fhurricane MitchinOctober 1998. At that time, the credit was
quickly amended to include a 100-day recovery plan for the Secretariat, which had lost
most o f its equipment, files, and vehicles, as well as to repair 2,800 damaged classrooms.
Expeditedprocurement procedures were approved. Thereafter implementationpicked
up, almost allplannedactivities were carried out, andtheproject disbursed completely.

 ImplementationExperience

  3.3      The two projects had some common activities andimplementationproblems,
 which are described inthis section along with achievement o f specific targets.

 3.4       Political economy. The projects were subject to extensive political influence that
 hampered implementation.l7DuringADEPRlR implementation, all the project staffwere
 fired after each o ftwo govemment changes. Ministersalso changed frequently. These
 constant changes disruptedproject operations, underminedmorale, andprevented the
 development o f an institutionalmemory. PROMEB faced problems with competing
 personalities, and the project implementationunit (PIU) had six directors duringthe life
 oftheproject. The large project size made it a target o f attempts for political favors, and
 salaries for people who contributed little. Bothprojects disbursedmainly duringthe last
 part oftheir implementation life. Financialaudit reports o fbothprojects found problems,
 such as incomplete records, disbursements for ineligible expenditures, and awards to
 favorite contractors."

 3.5       Decentralization,planning, and institutional development. Bothprojects focused
 on decreasing Secretariat administrative costs, promoting decentralization, and reducing
 administrative staff (about 19percent of Secretariat employees). ADEPRIR was to study
 the administrative structure ofthe Secretariat ofEducation, conduct diagnostic surveys of
 rural schools, organize the school administrationand supervision networks for rural
 schools, develop a student testing system, and prepare comprehensive operationalplans
 to improve the quality o f education. However, the government didnot really want a
 reorganization andresisted project activities. l Thus, most ADEPRIR activities involving
                                                           9
 institutionaldevelopment and decentralization were not carried out (Annex A Table 1).

 3.6      The donors involved inthe follow-on PROMEBinsistedon a decentralization
 decree and a new organizationalchart as a condition o f disbursement. Thus, the project
achieved the creation o f departmental directorates with staff hiredon the basis o f a
competition. Departmentaldirectorates now carry out many o f the functions once
centralized inTegucigalpa. Nevertheless, some important functions, such as teacher
appointments andtextbook decisions, are still centralized. Staff were not moved from the
capital to other parts o f the country as expected, but a few new positions were created in
the central departmental directorates. Overall, however, activities involvinginstitutional
development were carried out as expected (Annex A Table 2) and the relatedPROMEB
objective was achieved.



17.As far back as Education11, the projectimplementationunits sufferedfrom frequent changes inmanagement-
they had a differentdirector almost every year.

 3.7       School mapping didnot succeedunder ADEPRIR butpartly did so under
 PROMEB. The school censuses conducted in 1995 and 2000 have provided information
 to help program interventions for the Educationfor All initiative. To manage the large
 numberso fsmall schools, efforts at networkingZohave beendeveloped since Education
 11.However, the terrain andtransport needs limit communicationwithinnetworks andthe
 schools continue to receivelimited supervision. The projects didnot focus on the
 activities supervisors shouldcarry out to make learningmore effective.21

 3.8       Civil works. Inbothprojects, only limitedcivil works were foreseen, but targets
 were exceeded as other activities were dropped. The schools built underADEPRIR
 responded to 80 percent o f the needs inCholoma and Olanchito municipalities,22andmost
 are reported still to be sturdy 10-15 years after their construction. In 1997, responsibility
 for schools construction was removedfrom the Secretariat o fEducation school
 constructiondepartment. Almost all o fthe construction investment on education was
 transferred to FHIS, which had built schools since 1990. However, the Secretariat has not
 supervised adequately construction by FHIS or monitored costs. FHIS schools cost about
 twice as much as those built bythe Secretariat o f Education, and several had structural
 problems, such as non-functional toilets. Thus, about 15 percent fewer schools were built
 and46 percent fewer repaired than expected under PROMEB.23However, the all 18
 departmental offices were built as expected (Annex A Table 2).

 3.9       Communityparticipation. Like other Central American countries, Honduras has a
 tradition o f communityparticipation, anddonors encourage it. Community participation
 with materials and labor startedwith EducationII.24 formed 47 community
                                                                      ADEPRIR
 support committees. Communityparticipation, which initially started as an amendment to
 the PROMEBproject, further evolved with PROHECO schools. Parents' associations
 (AECOs, or Asociaciones Educativas Comunitarias) receivetraining and are then
 entrusted with most school management functions, including the money to pay for
teacher salaries and school expenses. According to staff interviewedby the OED
mission, this `uuditoria social 'has increased involvement inschool affairs and
communitymanagement was expanded to all rural areas duringthe follow-on
 Community-BasedEducation Project (Cr. 3497-HO). About 1,663 schools are runby
AECOs.

3.10      Textbooks. Since the 1970s, students have had access to textbooks that were
initially developed with U SAID assistance and revisedthrough Bank financing.25

20. Schoolnetworks involve anucleus schoolthat has a full-time director for 5-10 satellite schools locatedwithin a few
kilometers that may only have a few grades. The nucleardirector is expectedto visit the satellite schools on aregular
basis, though lack of transportoften makes that difficult. Supervisoryand admininistrative services would link the
network to the schooldistrict, departmental,regional, and central levels.
21, The government could study the feasibility of telecommunicationsdevicesto linknetworked schools and
supervisors.

restructured.

ADEPRIR distributedan unknownnumber oftextbooks in75 schools (vs. 36 schools
 foreseen duringappraisal). A revised set o f 11.7 million textbooks (vs. 5.4 million
 expected at appraisal) was printedthrough German bilateral aid, and PROMEB
distributedthem. (The targetwas exceededpartlybecause extra textbooks were printed
after hurricane Mitch.) The textbooks were given to schools, to be available to students
only duringclass time. Havingbeenprintedoverseas, there are no copies available for
sale inHonduras, andwhen books are worn out they are not replaced. So, despite large
numerical targets, this component has not provedvery sustainable. The problems created
bythis deficiency are discussed at lengthinthe issues section.

3.11       Teacher training. ADEPRIR financed meetings o f teachers belonging to networks
o f about 75 schools, but these ceasedafter the end o fthe project. UnderPROMEB
(which initially trained at least 32,500 educators), in-service education moved from an
informal basis to a degree-granting function carried out inthe UniversidadPedagbgica
Francisco Morazh. Much education for teachers and the populationingeneral i s now
available through distance education (including universityprograms for teachers, Maestro
en Casa and Educatodos for adult literacy, Telebasica, andradio programs). The quality
o fthe programs and their effects on teacher and student performance are unclear. Though
numerical targets have beenmet or exceeded, no study hasbeenspecifically undertaken
to evaluate the effects o fthis investment. However, a study o f factors affecting learning
outcomes showed ambiguous relationships betweenteacher training and student
performance (see para. 6.8). The recommendations o f the study underline the needfor
more basic math, practical curricular monitoring, and increased use o f students' time in


3.12     Bilingual education. PROMEB financed materials, dictionaries and grammars in
languages for 8 ethnicities such as Miskito, Garifuna, Tawahka, Pech, and others. These
languages were to be taught inorder to improve quality o f education o findigenous
speakers, but activities have beenlimited to materials production and some distribution o f
materials. Almost no bilingual education i s taking place, andthe goal o f teaching
indigenous students intheir language has not beenachieved.

3.13     Achievement testing. BothADEPRIR and PROMEBsupported educational
testing.27PROMEB financed an extemal evaluationunit,the Unidadde Medicibn
Curricular Extema (UMCE), housed inthe Pedagogical University, that has developed
criterion-referenced tests. But although strategies and feedback forms have been
developed,28results have beenmerelyreportedto the g~vemment,~~and little action has
been taken on the informationprovidedthrough testing.

  3.14     Project evaluation. Honduras has the capacity to evaluate andmonitor its
  educational programs. ADEPRIR had a final evaluation carried out by a local consultant
  andPROMEBhadone conducted byan international cons~ltant.~~Bothreports were
  informative andbased on focus group responses, but neither used robust research designs
  to assess project impact quantitatively. The ADEPRIR evaluation focused on how the
  project changed the relationshipbetween students, teachers, parents, and other
  community members. The responsesindicated that there was greater communication
  among these groups, but the evaluation design didnot permit a study o f the impacts o f
  the inputsor their significance inincreasing performance. Neither o fthe reports received
 wide dissemination or discussion, so their findings were not usedextensively for
  improving subsequent operations.
  Mission Observations

  3.15     The OED mission visited departmental directorates inL aPaz, Intibuch, Copan,
 Lempira, Cortks and interviewed 5 district directors, approximately 50 teachers (14
  individually and 36 inone group), and 16 current or former government officials and
  staffwho had worked inthe implementationunits o f the two projects. District staff
 expressed satisfaction with the activities o fbothprojects. Staff inCholoma had a high
 regardfor the educational inputs given throughthe pilot micro-planningproject of
 ADEPRIR inthat area (Annex B).

 3.16      The mission also visited 19                        inthe areas that hadbenefitedfrom
 ADEPRIR or from PROMEB.The schools were 1to 2 kilometers from ahighway and
 mighttherefore havebeenofbetterquality thanmoreremote schools. Observations
 (carried out at the end o f the school year) were as follows:

     0    Constructionseemedto be o f adequate quality. However, some teachers
          complainedthat the FHIS hadmade buildingerrors, such as disconnected
          bathroom tubes. Manybuildings are used only inthe morning. Rather thanhold
          some classes inthe afternoon, a district director reportedthat teachers preferto
          crowd the schools inthe morning or demand more construction.

     0    Most of the textbooks financed byPROMEB(Escuela Morazhica) are still
          available, but inmost grades several students had to share books or do without
          more advanced modules that were not available. Small school libraries hadbeen

       0   Inmodestlyefficient schools, studentsshouldreadrelativelyfluentlybytheend
           o f grade 1, at a speed o f about 30 to 70 words per minute.32However, the
           approximately 70 randomly chosen students who were askedto readand solve
           simple problems didso slowly and with many errors. Grade 1childrenmainly
           read individual letters, andmany students were still not fluent by grade 3. Several
           ingrades4 and5 understoodlittle ofpassagestheyreadandmerelyreread
           sections when asked about their meaning. Several childreningrades 3 and 4 could
           not understandthe mathematical problems they were readinginorder to solve
           them. This was particularlythe case with multigrade classes, where studentsget
           only a fraction o f the instruction they should get and must studypartly on their
           own. Some districts offer remedial courses betweengrades, but this practice i s
           limited.

       0   Teachers seemed unaware and unconcerned about their students' limitedskills.
           Those interviewedby the OED mission often attributed students' low
          performance to poverty and maln~trition.~~              They maintainedthat studentswere at
           the curricular level they should be at that time o f the year, althoughquick checks
           showed that students hadnot masteredprerequisites.

       0  Interviews with teachers indicatedthat the supervisors rarelyvisit, partly because
          o f limited travel resources. When they visit, they focus on school necessities
          rather than students' basic skills.

       0  Parents indicatedthat they were able to carry out the school management
          functions entrusted to them, pay the teachers, andbuymaterials for the school.
          Despite a few incidents o f funds stolen by outsiders and initial difficulties inthe
          provision o f funds, community management seems to have been satisfactory.

 4.       Results

4.1       This section provides data on changeso fimportant educational indicators during
the 1990s. It is difficult to separatethe effects o fthe two projects underreview from
those financed by other donors and effects o f government policies. However,
observations about the evolution of the sector suggest some possible outcomes o fthe
Bank's work.

 4.2       The extensive dialogue with the donor community inthe 1990sbrought about
 policy changes with respect to decentralization, financial efficiency, and management.

 projects it supported have beenrelevant to the economic needs o fthe country. The
 government has sufficient evaluation capacity and its policy over time shows evidence o f
 learningfrom the lessons ofthe past. Also, officials involvedwith the two projects
 evaluated inthis report feel very positively about the actions and outcomes ofthose
 projects (Annex B). According to government officials interviewedbythe mission, the
 investments enabled the country
 to make progress toward
 improved quality.                               Figure 1. Gross EnrollmentRates

 from primary school. Despite highenrollment, low overall dropout rates, and
 improvement inpromotion rates inthe 1990s, this goal remains problematic and
 inequitable. Grades 1-2 still have highrepetitionrates that set childrenback, andabout 30

 5.      Ratings

 Project Outcomes

 5.1     Themanagement-related objectives ofADEPRIR were substantially relevant to
 the humancapital development needs ofthe country, but duringtheprojectperiodthe
 government was not preparedto carry them out. Project objectives were extremely
 ambitious givenits small lendingamount, andremained unchanged after the scope was
 reduced. They were not achieved. Project design was complex andhard for the borrower
 to understand and its efficacy was negligible. Limitedfunds were earmarked for the
 activities subsequentlydeemed most useful by officials interviewed, that is, school
 construction, textbook distribution, andteacher training; thus eflciency was modest.
 Overall, the outcome o f ADEPRIR project i s rated unsatisfactory.

 5.2     The outcome o fPROMEBis rated satisfactory. The project supported several
 reforms, including decentralization, achievement measurement, attentionto multigrade
 schools, andteacher training, particularly degree-oriented training. Thus, relevance and
 eflcacy were substantial. Persons interviewedwere uniformly positive onproject
outcomes and achievements. Although improvements inoutcomes were modest
(suggestingmodest eflciency), muchprogress was made inprovidingthe inputsand
increasing efficiency that should leadto improved learning achievement ifattention to
some basic issues increases.

InstitutionalDevelopment Impact

5.3      Institutionaldevelopment for the ADEPRIRproject i s rated modest. Inpilot
areas, activities were carried out such as school networks, decentralized supervision, and
development o f student tracking forms intwo districts. However, there was no follow up
at the end o f the project, and the systemic improvements planned for rural schools didnot
materialize.

5.4      Institutionaldevelopment for the PROMEBproject i s rated substantial. A
financial tracking system was created, many Secretariat functions were decentralized to
geographical departments, and trainedprofessionals were made available to schools.

Sustainability

5.5      Sustainabilityfor bothprojects i s rated likely. PROMEBhas laid the basis for
institutions that already sustain the activities andpolicies that contribute to the
achievement o f EFA.At the same time, most o f the activities envisaged underADEPRIR
are beingimplemented 10years after its completion: school networks with decentralized
supervision and group teacher training, school governments, community participation,
andmicro-planning.

                                              17


Bank Performance

5.6      Bank performance for PROMEB i s ratedsatisfactory while that o f ADEPRIR i s
rated unsatisfactory. The Bank didnot realisticallyplanmany o fthe actions to be
executedby ADEPRIR. Project files show no evidence that the Bank was aware o f or
dealt with the government reluctance to improve sectoral management. Though there
were 27 supervisionmissions inthe project's nine years many lasted 2-3 days and
involved one person. The design defects were addressedonly toward the end of the
project, when its scope was reduced.

5.7      The designs ofbothprojects were complex and challengingfor the government to
implement. World Banktask managers changed frequently, particularly for PROMEB.
Duringthe late 1990ssupervisions becameinfrequent,andpersons interviewedvoiced
concems that at times the Bank seemed to neglect the two projects. However, the Bank i s
also seen as an institutionthat pushedhardfor educational reform, was frank with the
government, andbrought on board consultants and staff o f quality. Its evaluations are
public, interesting, andwidely read. The government has learned from Bankprocurement
practices anduses them for other bids. The Bank proved flexible and extremely helpful
after hurricane Mitch and its financing made education expansionpossible duringthe
recent economic crisis. With its project size and involvement inthe FHIS, the Bank has
investedincross-sectoral inputs and, according to some government staff, has emerged as
the leader inthe educational donor community.

5.8      However, the mission also heard criticism that the Bank pushes the same policies
indifferent countries with limiteddifferentiation, anditdoesnot sufficiently appreciate
contextual differences.

Borrower Performance

5.9      Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory for ADEPRIR and satisfactoryfor
PROMEB.There was limited ownership for ADEPRIR andfew of its activitieswere
fully implemented. Ownership for the PROMEBwas high, andmost activitieswere
carried out despite size, complexity, andpolitical interference. Many technically capable
staffworked on the project and learned. Counterpart funds were available, and officials
expected staff to carry out activities competently.

efforts to reconcile accounts, it i s unknownto what degree accounts o f the current project
have improved.

 6.         Issuesfor Future Consideration

 6.1        Government strategy continues to focus on educational quality. To bringabout
 EFA, the government has adopted a five-pronged strategy to improve: (a) student
 promotion and retention, (b) preschool education to prepare studentswho will enter
 primary education, (c) quality and efficiency o fteachers, (d) demand for education and
 participationo f disadvantaged communities, and (e) participation o f dispersed rural
 communities. The EFA fast-track initiative                             outlines means and goals,
 including the merger of small multigrade schools where possible. However, the lessons
 o fpast projects suggest that some obstacles have beenhardto overcome. To implement
 the fast-track initiative and achieve EFAby 2015, the government o fHonduras and
 donors must focus on these more specifically andprioritize improvement ifstudents are
 to complete primaryschools and acquire basic skills.

 ContinuedEmphasisNeededon BasicSkills Acquisition

 6.2        Because childreninthe numerous multigrade schools o f Honduras must rely on
 reading to learn other subjects, early skills are very important. Test scores, mission
 observations and discussions with teachers highlightedthe incidence o f limitedreading
 andmath skills.46 The limited accessto textbooks andto easy readingmaterials makes it
 hardfor poor readers to get thepractice needed for fluencyV4'Consequently, children are
 often unable to read the supplementary books providedthrough PROMEBand increase
 reading speed. Staff o f other donors interviewedby the missionhave advised the
 government to improve learning conditions by procuring copies o f existingtextbooks.
 However, the government has embarked on an extensive curricular revision andplansto
provide a new set o f textbooks to students. These are still under development, and a trial
 set was to reach schools inMarch 2004. This goal was not achieved, and delivery dates
 are uncertain. This means that childrenwill continue to have limitedopportunities for
reading, andtheir valuable school time may be lost. This may reduce the probability o f
 achievingEFA.

6.3        Methods such as "direct in~truction"~~have proved effective with some poor U S
populations, However, Honduras i s moving inthe opposite direction. The new curriculum

 is based on the "constructivist" philosophy, which allows childrento find out answers for
 themselves and construct their knowledgenetworks. Accordingly, teachers are supposed
 to be merely facilitators o f learning. While this philosophy i s laudable, it i s time-
 consuming and mayresult inlow reading skills among the                                    Classes inpoor
 Honduran schools do not have the sufficient amount o f time requiredfor this
 methodology. The missionrepeatedly observed childrenlaboriously writing answers to
 questions rather thanbeingtaught, a practice that is relatedto lower test scores.5o

 6.4        A clear and finite set ofquality-orientedactions for training andclassroom
 implementation needs to be developed with the agreement o f all donors to implement
 through the EFA actions. To improve basic skills o fpoor students, the government might
 consider offering summer classes, supplementing the existing textbooks (through
 photocopies, for example), reducing the other subjects for grades 1-2, and ask teachers to
 provide a lot more readingpractice. The prioritywould befast and effortlessreading
 by the end ofgrade 1, fast basicmathcalculations,and effective student and
 curricular monitoringby teachers. When childrenbecomeproficientreaders, thenit
 will bepossible to implement multigradeteaching andthe constructivistphilosophy more
 fiuitfilly.

 InstructionalTime is Importantto Achieve EFA

 6.5       Fulfillingtheprescribed days ofinstructionaltime continues to be anEFA
 objective, However, classes continue to be canceled for minor reasons. The mission
 received an estimate inone school that out of 200 days, 10 were spent intraining, 4 in
 strikes, 5 inextravacations, 5 innetwork meetingsfor quality, 9 for gettingpaid. When
 classes are held, they often start late or finish early. (Teacher absenteeism i s informally
 estimated at 20 percent.) Class time includes collecting and handingout books or
 copying. Writing takes a long time when childrenhave limitedreading skills, and a few
 sentences and can take an entire hour.

6.6        Giventhe various reductions oninstructionaltime, the efficiency o fthe system
may be only about 12per~ent.~'              However, the government and the donor community in
the Fast-Track Initiative pay 100percent ofthe costs o fthe wasted time. Actions must be
developed to increase instructional time at every stage. The donor community should
makethis apriority issue.

Panama. Despite discouraging anecdotal observations, there have been no rigorous impact evaluations.

 The Benefits of Teacher Training are Unclear

 6.7      Since 1974, the Bank's strategy inemphasizing teacher training has encouraged
 the government to maketraining a priority. Most teachers are involvedintraining
 activities, rangingfrom distance education for a Bachelor's degreeto meetingin
networks. Some o fthe formal teacher study takes place becauseteachers with Bachelor's
 degrees receive a 69 percent salary increase.

 6.8      As the UMCE studies have shown, training has some negative consequences; a
 studyhas found that teachers' studytoward a degree is negativelyassociatedwith
students' achievement insome                        Schools close for teacher training for 10-15
days a year, partly a result o f locally operating NGOs deciding that teachers intheir areas
mustbetrained incertain subjects. Efforts arebeingmade to streamline activities and
coordinate with the government. However, the knowledge andbehaviors acquired in
training have not beenevaluated. It i s unclear how important the topics are andwhether
they are taught ina way that will improve teacher behaviors inclass. Furthermore, the
new curriculum will requireextensive teacher training throughout the country. Evenif
done largely duringvacations, the training may reduce the amount o f time teachers spend
inclass.

6.9       The hypothesis that teachers become more effective with training remains largely
untestedinHonduras. The types andtopics o ftraining associatedwith improvedstudent
performance needto matchclosely the areas inwhich students have deficient skills.
Regardless o f effectiveness, however, the salary increases to degreed teachers are certain
to increase the already highwage bill. Teacher training (degreedor otherwise) should
address clearly delineated deficiencies rather than beprovided as a general andundefined
set o f activities. A study o fthe skills acquired andnot acquired duringtraining would
serve to direct future investments inthis area.


7.        Lessons

7.1       Experience with the assessedprojects confirms a number o f OED lessons from
the education sector:

     0   Despite considerable quality-oriented investments byboth the assessedprojects,
         progress instudent performance has been limited. Thus, educational project inputs
         andrisingeducation budgets do not translate automatically into increased student
         performance. To increase performance, teachers and students must use inputs
         effectively andmaximizethe instructional time students are engaged inlearning.

    0    Both assessedprojects developed action plans, but their implementation was
         limited.Those actions mustbefeasible within the budget andhumanresources
         available, and Government officials must also clearly perceive the need for plans
         and the subsequent actions.

  PROMEB and its follow-through project successfully involved the communities
  inthemanagement ofrural schools. Decentralization of school management to
  the community levelmay mobilize local support for the schools andincrease
  pride inachievement by studentsandteachers.

0 The achievement tests developed through PROMEB providedvaluable
  monitoring information to the government, but outcomes were not widely
  disseminated, anduse was limited. Thus, the development o f standardized
  achievement tests strengthens the capacity o f institutions to obtain monitoring
  information. To be valuable, the information must be disseminated widely to
  school level ifpossible, and actions must be carried out based on the feedback it
  provides.

Annex B. Statements and Issues RaisedinMissionInterviews
    Interviews took place individually or insmall groups as the circumstances dictated.
The table below reflects the number o f respondents who indicateda view on each
question; persons could raise one or more issues. Not all staffhad opinions about all
questions and sometimes only one person ina group expressedopinions, so reply
statistics are approximate. Teachers were only asked questions regarding inputs and
effectiveness, since most didnot know who hadpaid for the inputs they hadreceived.
The questions posed to respondents were:


    What were the benefits o f the project inyour school, geographic or sectoral area?

    What problems didyou face inimplementingthe project?What were its
    disadvantages?

    Which components worked best inbringingabout results, which didnot? (some
   persons interviewedwere asked about specific components, as appropriate).

   How effective were the Bank staff or consultants who worked on the project?

   What training didyou receive through the project?Didit teach you what it was
   supposed to?

   Theprojecthad some qualified audits. What financial irregularitieswere there inyour
   area o fjurisdiction?

   What would be different ineducation sector o f your state ifthe project hadnot
   existed?

 Annex D. Commentsfrom the Borrower

 Specific Comments on ProjectPerformanceAssessmentReport
 Honduras

 RuralPrimaryEducationManagementProject(LN.2804) andBasicEducation
 (Cr. 2694)

 Paragraph 1.3 Line 6: It should read Honduran Social Investment Fund instead o f
 Emergency Social Fund(FHIS).

 Paragraph 1.5 Line 8: The goal o f 100% for graduation rate should specify that it
 corresponds to the year 2015.

 Paragraph 1.6 Line 6: The 2,500 classrooms referred to, were not only built for
 preschoollevel. The majority were built for basic education level.

 Paragraph    1.7:  The Distance       Education and Cultural        Heritage Project
 (PROFUTURO) does not finance primary rural schools.

 Paragraph 1.8 Line 1: Why does the document state that the large-scale sector work
 was carried out by GTZ? I s it referring to the analytical research o f education? For
 example, the research on Basic Social Services was financed byUNICEF andUNDP,
 as well as other keyresearch activities on expenses were financed by the World Bank,
in some cases through Social Route. GTZ only financed the Sectorial Research on
Education in 1997. We also have to consider the Government's contribution with its
counterpart h d s in staff, physical areas and equipment. Inthe year 2000, Dr. Jorge
Sanguinetty of Devtech Systems carried out a study about the impact of research on
the educational policy o f Honduras. Several initiatives considered in the efforts o f
educational reform have been based on the studies of education (including the public
consultation on the topic through the FONAC) duringthe 90s.

Paragraph 2.3, line 3, the complementary financing was granted by KfWnot by GTZ.

Paragraph 3.2, line 1: During 1996, its initial year, the Project had a drop in its
execution. However, in 1997, all its components and subcomponents were in full
execution. The PFC, had begun. The texts were being elaborated, the classrooms and
Departamental Offices were being built and the first Departamental Directors,o f
Education had been appointed by a decree emitted in 1996. By the time Hurricane
Mitch struck the country, PROHECO had already begunits implementation.

Paragraph 3.8, line 4: The responsibilityo f transferring the constructiono f schools to
the FHIS was not infact due to mismanagement inthe Ministryo f Education. Instead,
it was a strategy usedin order to speed up the social investment (of health, education
and others) and generate employment to reduce the impact o f the structural
adjustment measures o f the economy.

                                            36


 Inthe last line, the document should refer to the construction o f the Departamental
 Offices, which included 18 as it hadbeenplanned.

 Paragraph 3.9: The social audit has expanded to the whole country but in the rural
 area through the AECOs and the ADELs.

 Paragraph 3.10: lines 4 5. The texts and notebooks o f the "Mi Honduras" series were
revised with hnds of the World Bank, which later became another series called
Morazanica School. The printingo fthe texts was financed by KfW.

Paragraph 3.11,line 5: The programs EDUCATODOS and Maestro en Casa are adult
literacy programs. It would be necessary to mention other distance education
programs for primary education teachers o f the Universidad Nacional Aut6noma de
Honduras (UNAH) as well as the Universidad Pedag6gica Nacional Francisco
Morazhn (UPNFM).

Paragraph 4.6, last line: It i s uncertain to what extent this statement i s acceptable:
"The Bank projects and policy dialogue have not specifically dealt with instructional
issues". Maybe the educators have something to say to this respect. Aren't the texts,
the Basic National Curriculum (BNC) and other instruments a form o f dealing with
the topic?

Paragraph 6.2, line 9: The government, knowing that a modernized curriculum didn't
exist, proceeded to take the decision that the educational materials should respond to
the focus established inthe National Basic Curriculum. It has been established that in
the year 2004, the Rendimientos Basicos will be used and starting on 2005, Spanish
andMathematicsfor grades 1-3 will beprioritized.

Paragraph 6.4:     This observation is extremely strong for our country when its
implementation i s being analyzed. Its implementation should not be seen as "pure
constructivism", instead it should be seen as preventive because the pertinent
adaptations will be made. For such reason, joint efforts o f all the programs and
projects are beingmade inorder to achieve the EFA goals.
