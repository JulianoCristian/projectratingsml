 attendance, and create more effective learning conditions,\n            thereby reducing student dropout and repetition rates and\n            raising student's academic achievements. The project\n            also aims at strengthening the Ministry of Education's\n            institutional capacity to deliver basic education services\n            at higher levels of efficiency and fiscal accountability,\n            leading to a reduction in administrative costs. The project\n            comprises two major components. The first component is the\n            Improving the Quality of Basic Education component which\n            provides for: 1) training and assistance to upgrade the\n            skills of preprimary and primary teachers, principals and\n            supervisors, and improvements to pre-service teacher\n            training and accreditation; 2) educational materials\n            including textbooks, didactic materials, classroom\n            libraries, and improved distribution facilities; 3)\n            bilingual education in indigenous areas for the Garfuna and\n            Miskito communities; 4) external evaluation of\n            student's academic achievements; and 5) infrastructure\n            improvements for overcrowded rural schools, including\n            additional teachers and access to community-run preschool\n            education in poor rural areas. The second component is an\n            Institutional Strengthening one which will provide for: 1)\n            technical assistance for the restructuring and\n            decentralization of the MOE, and improved supervision; 2) a\n            pilot program of teacher performance incentives; and 3)\n            project administration, monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1995-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
