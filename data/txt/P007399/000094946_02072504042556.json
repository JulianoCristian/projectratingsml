        institutional development impact as substantial, Bank\n            performance as satisfactory, and Borrower performance as\n            satisfactory. The most substantial impact on implementation\n            was caused by hurricane Mitch in November 1998. To respond\n            to the crisis, the project legal documents were amended in\n            April 1999, thereby integrating the project in the national\n            emergency plan through a new emergency subprojects\n            component. This component was instrumental in providing\n            resources at the departmental and community levels. The key\n            lessons learned are: A community-based strategy can lead to\n            rapid improvements in the delivery of education services in\n            rural areas. The achievement of project development\n            objectives is best guaranteed by appropriate adjustments to\n            the changing needs of the country and the sector. The\n            development impact of external evaluation of student\n            learning achievements is greatly enhanced when results are\n            broadly disseminated and utilized in sector policy\n            decision-making. Maintenance agreements for the\n            sustainability of education infrastructure must be supported\n            by adequate financing. The production of textbooks and other\n            education materials must be supported by an efficient\n            distribution system. New textbooks should be consistent with\n            changes in curriculum. The production of new education\n            materials is enhanced by the systematic field test of such materials."}, "docdt": "2002-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
