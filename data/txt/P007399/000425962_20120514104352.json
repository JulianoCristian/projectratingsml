The project\n            also aims at strengthening the Ministry of Education's\n            institutional capacity to deliver basic education services\n            at higher levels of efficiency and fiscal accountability,\n            leading to a reduction in administrative costs. The project\n            comprises two major components. The first component is the\n            Improving the Quality of Basic Education component which\n            provides for: 1) training and assistance to upgrade the\n            skills of preprimary and primary teachers, principals and\n            supervisors, and improvements to pre-service teacher\n            training and accreditation; 2) educational materials\n            including textbooks, didactic materials, classroom\n            libraries, and improved distribution facilities; 3)\n            bilingual education in indigenous areas for the Garfuna and\n            Miskito communities; 4) external evaluation of\n            student's academic achievements; and 5) infrastructure\n            improvements for overcrowded rural schools, including\n            additional teachers and access to community-run preschool\n            education in poor rural areas. The second component is an\n            Institutional Strengthening one which will provide for: 1)\n            technical assistance for the restructuring and\n            decentralization of the MOE, and improved supervision; 2) a\n            pilot program of teacher performance incentives; and 3)\n            project administration, monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1995-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
