                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All MDTF financed components (water, education, rural household support) which were implemented by UNICEF and UNIDO were completed as scheduled. These
                         activities were completed at a satisfactory quality.

                         The PCU has been up and running with an office in Damazin, capital of Blue Nile and been adequately carrying out their activities.

                         The health component, and the physical works of the capacity building component financed by GoNU are progressing well. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the health
                         component has now been fully constructed, and the State Governor has submitted a request to Unity Fund to support it through provision of required equipment; maintenance of the
                         Center will be financed by Damazin Hospital. The demining component has now been completed and implementation of the rural roads component has now been counter-financed
                         and implemented by the Blue Nile State government and works are close to completion.

                         Supplementary activities targeted at fisheries and rural livelihoods in the amount of US$3.0 millionwere approved by the MDTF oversight committee in July, 2010 and became
                         effective (as a sub-project) in November, 2010.
