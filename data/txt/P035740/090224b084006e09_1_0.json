the Lima Transport Project\n            for Peru were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was significant, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: improving\n            mobility and accessibility for the poor through bus rapid\n            transit systems requires integrating the main corridor\n            effectively with feeder services and other public transport\n            system that reach close to the traveler\u2019s origins and\n            destinations. Realistic scenarios and sound risk allocation\n            are crucial for public-private partnerships if high service\n            standards are to be maintained and the use of the assets\n            providing the service is to be maximized. Given the complex\n            urban settings in which rapid urban transport systems are\n            typically situated, it is important to inform and consult\n            with all categories of project affected persons, to\n            anticipate and take effective measures to prevent possible\n            negative environmental and social impacts and related\n            disputes. A shift towards non-motorized transport can be\n            expected to take a long time even with enabling and\n            supporting factors and facilities in place."}, "docdt": "2015-12-17T00:04:02Z"}
