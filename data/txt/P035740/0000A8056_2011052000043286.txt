                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The main objective of the project is to assist the Municipality of Metropolitan Lima (MML) in enhancing the economic productivity and the quality of life within
                         the Lima Metropolitan area through improving mobility and accessibility for the metropolitan population, especially in the peri-urban poor neighborhoods by
                         establishing an efficient, reliable, cleaner and safer mass rapid transit system. The specific project development objectives are to: (i) implement the new mass
                         rapid transit system on the basis of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with concessioned bus corridor/feeder routes operations and fare collection system; (ii)
                         improve access within low income areas through facilitating the use of low cost transport alternatives, such as bicycles and walking; (iii) strengthen the local
                         institutional capacity to regulate and manage the metropolitan transport system on a sustainable basis; and (iv) reduce the negative environmental impact of
                         motorized transport in Lima.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         The parallel GEF funds will help facilitate greenhouse gas reduction from ground transport in the Metropolitan Area of Lima-Callao through contributing to the
                         promotion of a long-term modal shift to more efficient and less polluting forms of transport, such as non-motorized transport and high-capacity public transport
                         vehicles operated on segregated bus ways. The project GEF specific objectives are: (i) rationalization of public transport capacity by providing financial
                         incentives (Credit Guarantee Fund) to retire old buses; (ii) rehabilitation and expansion of the existing bikeway network in Lima and Callao and promotion of
                         bike use; (iii) delivery of an institutional strengthening program on sustainable transport, targeting municipalities and institutions dealing with environmental
                         issues and/or transport planning; and (iv) to assess and monitor the GEF project global consequences.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         THIS ISR COVERS ONLY THE LOAN and is the last one because the project closing date is April 30th, 2011.
                         By April 2011, the Metropolitano is operational and all the stations and terminals are operating. Currently, the Metropolitano is transporting around 340,000 passengers per weekday
                         and the system productivity has increased in the last months from a Passenger Kilometer Index (PKI) of 3 to a PKI of 6.5. However, only 197 of 312 trunk buses and 159 of 232
                         feeder buses are operational.
                         Demand is expected to reach the targeted 600,000 rides per day by December 2011 due to four main reasons: (i) the new administration has committed to remove traditional buses
                         in routes parallel to the Metropolitano. There are about 40 routes competing with the Metropolitano that will be removed starting on May 2011; (ii) Protransporte will implement by July

                         to increase feeder-trunk trips. Currently, only about 10% of feeder trips transfer to the trunk corridor; and (iv) demand is naturally increasing every month. For the last months,

                         ridership has been growing at a rate of 2% per month in the trunk corridor and at 10% per month on the feeder corridors.

                         In addition, due to the success of the project, the new administration of Lima is very interested in implementing a Second Line of the Metropolitano with the support of the World Bank.
