The specific project development objectives are to:\n            (i) implement the new mass rapid transit system on the basis\n            of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with concessional bus\n            corridor/feeder routes operations and fare collection\n            system; (ii) improve access within low income areas through\n            facilitating the use of low cost transport alternatives,\n            such as bicycles and walking; (iii) strengthen the local\n            institutional capacity to regulate and manage the\n            metropolitan transport system on a sustainable basis; and\n            (iv) reduce the negative environmental impact of motorized\n            transport in Lima. The extension is necessary to: (i)\n            implement the social mitigation plan. The project affects\n            some owners of old buses and other parties related to this\n            business. The project introduces modern buses that will\n            replace several hundred old buses. A social plan has been\n            finalized and its implementation will take place as the old\n            buses are displaced by the new system. As said, the project\n            will enter operations gradually. This process will take\n            place beyond the current closing date; (ii) implement the\n            communications plan, which was recently approved by the\n            Bank, as well as the air quality monitoring network; and\n            (iii) Reengage Protransporte and the Barranco\n            representatives in light of the (Spanish Fund for Latin\n            America and the Caribbean) SFLAC-Financed Traffic Management\n            study, part of management's action plan for the\n            on-going inspection panel. The study will have intermediate\n            results by August 2010 and final results by September 2010."}, "docdt": "2010-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
