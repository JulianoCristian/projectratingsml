                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The main objective of the project is to assist the Municipality of Metropolitan Lima (MML) in enhancing the economic productivity and the quality of life within
                         the Lima Metropolitan area through improving mobility and accessibility for the metropolitan population, especially in the peri-urban poor neighborhoods by
                         establishing an efficient, reliable, cleaner and safer mass rapid transit system. The specific project development objectives are to: (i) implement the new mass
                         rapid transit system on the basis of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with concessioned bus corridor/feeder routes operations and fare collection system; (ii)
                         improve access within low income areas through facilitating the use of low cost transport alternatives, such as bicycles and walking; (iii) strengthen the local
                         institutional capacity to regulate and manage the metropolitan transport system on a sustainable basis; and (iv) reduce the negative environmental impact of
                         motorized transport in Lima.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         The parallel GEF funds will help facilitate greenhouse gas reduction from ground transport in the Metropolitan Area of Lima-Callao through contributing to the
                         promotion of a long-term modal shift to more efficient and less polluting forms of transport, such as non-motorized transport and high-capacity public transport
                         vehicles operated on segregated bus ways. The project GEF specific objectives are: (i) rationalization of public transport capacity by providing financial
                         incentives (Credit Guarantee Fund) to retire old buses; (ii) rehabilitation and expansion of the existing bikeway network in Lima and Callao and promotion of
                         bike use; (iii) delivery of an institutional strengthening program on sustainable transport, targeting municipalities and institutions dealing with environmental
                         issues and/or transport planning; and (iv) to assess and monitor the GEF project global consequences.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         By September 12 2010 the Metropolitano project was fully operational in the entire trunk alignment, except some stations that needed INC approval, such as the Barranco and
                         Camaná Carabaya stations. By January 2011 all stations and terminals were operational and the project was transporting 300,000 passengers per weekday. However, only 157 of
                         300 trunk buses were operational, and only a fraction of the feeder routes had started service. Demand is expected to reach the targeted 600,000 rides per day once the entire fleet is
                         operational and traditional buses in routes parallel to the Metropolitano are removed.
                         The closing date, which originally was December 2010, has been extended to April 30 2011. The change enabled the Municipality of Lima, through its implementation unit
                         PROTRANSPORTE, to finalize work contracts and consultant services, specifically to implement the update social mitigation plan, the communication campaign and to continue
