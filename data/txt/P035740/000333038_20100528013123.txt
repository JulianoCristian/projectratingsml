The main objective of the project is to assist the Municipality of Metropolitan Lima (MML) in enhancing 
the economic productivity and the quality of life within the Lima Metropolitan area through improving 
mobility and accessibility for the metropolitan population, especially in the peri-urban poor neighborhoods 
by establishing an efficient, reliable, cleaner and safer mass rapid transit system.The specific project 
development objectives are to: (i) implement the new mass rapid transit system on the basis of a Public 
Private Partnership (PPP) with concessioned bus corridor/feeder routes operations and fare collection 
system; (ii) improve access within low income areas through facilitating the use of low cost transport 
alternatives, such as bicycles and walking; (iii) strengthen the local institutional capacity to regulate and 
manage the metropolitan transport system on a sustainable basis; and (iv) reduce the negative 
environmental impact of motorized transport in Lima.
