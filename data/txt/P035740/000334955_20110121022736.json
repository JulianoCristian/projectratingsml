2009, the Inspection Panel\n            received a request for inspection related to the Peru: Lima\n            Urban Transport Project. The request was submitted by\n            residents of the District of Barranco within the Lima\n            Metropolitan area, who claim they are suffering and will\n            suffer harm as a result of the ?deficiencies and omissions\n            of the World Bank in the design and implementation of the\n            project as it relates specifically to Barranco. The project\n            supports the construction of a bus rapid-transit system\n            (BRT) through the city of Lima. The project includes a bus\n            corridor in Barranco, a coastal district located in the\n            south-east of Lima between the relatively wealthier\n            Miraflores district and the relatively low-income Chorillos\n            district, where the bus route ends. Barranco was designated\n            a historical district by the National Institute of Culture\n            in 1972. In the Requesters'view, the permanent\n            rerouting of traffic, caused by the project, has severely\n            affected traffic in Barranco, leading to health and safety\n            concerns, deterioration in the conservation of the historic\n            area of Barranco and adverse social and economic impacts. In\n            particular, they state that the traffic that was re-routed\n            from Avenida Bolognesi is posing great danger to the\n            district's historical and ?monumental heritage and\n            deteriorating its quality of life because of very high\n            volume of traffic and pollution. The panel notes that,\n            independently of the project, there have been significant\n            increases in traffic volumes in recent years both in Lima as\n            a whole and in Barranco in particular. In the Panel's\n            view, the significant and poorly managed changes in traffic\n            in Barranco as a result of the project, superimposed on the\n            construction work associated with the BRT and the general\n            changes in the urban character of Barranco described above,\n            have caused deterioration in the quality of life of many\n            residents of Barranco and posed a threat to the\n            district's historical character. In addition, the poor\n            quality of some of the project work along the Avenida\n            Bolognesi in Barranco, such as pavements and pedestrian\n            crossings, as well as delays in the construction process,\n            have added to the hazards, aggravation, inconvenience and\n            frustration suffered by the residents of Barranco. These\n            harms cannot, in fairness, be solely attributable to the\n            Project, and some of them may be reduced as the BRT enters a\n            fully operational stage. Nevertheless, they are significant."}, "docdt": "2011-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
