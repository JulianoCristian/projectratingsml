The study includes data collection and processing\n            of a traffic management plan to be implemented in the short\n            term (one year) from a multi-criteria analysis selection of\n            alternatives. This stage of the study will provide\n            preliminary results of a comparison of three alternative\n            proposals for traffic management plans for the district of\n            Barranco. The Study Terms of Reference (TOR) also state that\n            the three management plans proposed for comparison are:\n            First, Baseline Scenario, corresponding to the current\n            situation; Secondly, community proposal to be implemented in\n            the short term; Thirdly, Alternative Proposal Consultant.\n            The traffic management interventions propose measures\n            relating to planning the use of streets for pedestrian and\n            vehicular traffic, i.e. planning directions of traffic,\n            pedestrian use of the street in whole or in part, or\n            periods, use of streets for parking of vehicles; bans on\n            operation of certain types of vehicles, and eventually\n            proposed works that can be planned, designed and built in a year."}, "docdt": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
