7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The main objective of the project is to assist the Municipality of Metropolitan Lima (MML) in enhancing
the economic productivity and the quality of life within the Lima Metropolitan area through improving
mobility and accessibility for the metropolitan population, especially in the peri-urban poor neighborhoods
by establishing an efficient, reliable, cleaner and safer mass rapid transit system.The specific project
development objectives are to: (i) implement the new mass rapid transit system on the basis of a Public
Private Partnership (PPP) with concessioned bus corridor/feeder routes operations and fare collection
system; (ii) improve access within low income areas through facilitating the use of low cost transport
alternatives, such as bicycles and walking; (iii) strengthen the local institutional capacity to regulate and
manage the metropolitan transport system on a sustainable basis; and (iv) reduce the negative
environmental impact of motorized transport in Lima.

                                   Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Peru, Loan 7209-PE will be extended from June 30 2010 until
   December 30 2010.

2.      The Project is on target to achieve its Project Development Objective because the
tests for the operational stage began April 15th 2010 with buses rolling on the buslanes of
the bus rapid transit system on a segment of the alignment. On May 1st 2010 tests began
of buses with passengers but without charging a fare. Gradually, the tests will cover a
wider length of the 28-Km alignment, as the remaining stations are completed. In June
2010 the tests of the electronic fare collection system will begin. The electronic control
center for the buses is also undergoing tests as part of the operation with passengers. This
sequence is standard for mass transit systems, given the complexity of the many parts that
have to work together. It takes typically three to six months to take a mass transit system
to regular operation. With all the systems in place, the project is expected to follow this
path gradually and hence achieve its PDO.

3.      The performance of the Borrower and the project implementing agency,
Protransporte, is satisfactory, as rated in the last ISR. Protransporte has improved over the
last year and ratings such as implementation progress were upgraded to satisfactory and
ratings on public involvement were updated from moderately unsatisfactory to
moderately satisfactory.

4.      As documented in the last mission aide memoire there is a plan, formulated with
Bank's help as part of the on-going supervision, to complete the project before December
2010. The key task that remains is to implement the social mitigation plan. Neither the
loan in particular, nor Perú in general, is subject to an ongoing suspension of
disbursements; and no audit reports are outstanding or not satisfactory to the Bank. The
last audit report was submitted to the Bank on April 7th 2010 as established in the Loan
Agreement and the Bank deemed it adequate.

5.     The proposed extension is necessary to: (i) Implement the social mitigation plan.
The project affects some owners of old buses and other parties related to this business.
The Project introduces modern buses that will replace several hundred old buses. A social
plan has been finalized and its implementation will take place as the old buses are
                                             5
displaced by the new system. As said, the project will enter operations gradually. This
process will take place beyond the current closing date. (ii) Implement the
communications plan, which was recently approved by the Bank, as well as the air
quality monitoring network. (iv) Reengage Protransporte and the Barranco
Representatives in light of the SFLAC-finaced Traffic Management study, part of
Management's Action Plan for the on-going Inspection Panel. The study will have
intermediate results by August 2010 and final results by September 2010.

6.     This will be the second extension of the closing date of the project. The first
extension (dated December 12 2008) extended the closing date by one year. The current
one extends it by six months. The total extension is therefore 1.5 years.
