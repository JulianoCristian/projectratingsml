whose\n            construction the city has reserved the necessary right of\n            way. The characteristic of the entire roadway assembly is\n            similar to the existing section of the Paseo de la\n            Rep\u00fablica. An important part of the right of way is in the\n            public domain, whereby traffic has been using partially\n            paved streets and recreation areas, gardens and sports\n            fields. Another part yet to be used is agricultural land and\n            urbanized and built in areas whose owners are aware of the\n            future construction of the roadway.The completion of the\n            Expressway with its extension to Highway Pan and its\n            junction with Av Pedro Miotto satisfies a large sector of\n            the city of Lima, for both public transport and private\n            transport. This is expected to generate large social benefits."}, "docdt": "2010-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
