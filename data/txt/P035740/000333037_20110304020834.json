Management responded to the\n            claims in the request on November 13, 2009. In its\n            subsequent report to the Board, the Panel found the request\n            eligible and recommended that the Executive Directors\n            authorize an investigation. They did so on December 16,\n            2009. On January 18, 2011, the Panel issued its report\n            outlining the findings of its investigation. Management\n            appreciates the Panel's clear and thorough presentation\n            of its findings.
