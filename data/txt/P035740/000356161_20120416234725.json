satisfactory; GEO\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible; risk to GEO outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: strengthen project implementation\n            agency's capacity for mainstreaming environmental and\n            social management into urban transport project preparation\n            and supervision. Enhance the Bank's due diligence on\n            compliance with environmental and social safeguard policies,\n            including consultation and communications, during\n            supervision. Consider at appraisal key elements that are\n            likely to facilitate the successful implementation of\n            complex Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) projects. Focus on the\n            ridership target strategy in order to achieve financial\n            sustainability prior to pre-operation of the system or\n            during the first year of operation. Project design should\n            not be focused on a single BRT line: it must contain a\n            broader sectoral approach that considers a long-term vision\n            of the urban transport sector in the city. Project design\n            should reflect the agreements with the Borrower and include\n            studies to examine possibly complex policy issues."}, "docdt": "2012-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
