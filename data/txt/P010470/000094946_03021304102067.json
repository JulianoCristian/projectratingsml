Several lessons are drawn\n            from the project, lessons which further reinforce the need\n            to balance realistic objectives, and coverage of the\n            project, particularly, given the Bank leverage on the\n            government of Pakistan is considered weak. Nonetheless, the\n            demonstrated project ownership, and commitment were key\n            during project preparation, and, helped a timely project\n            restructuring reduce implementation delays, and costs.\n            Project experience also shows the importance of the\n            Bank's strong supervision and monitoring of the\n            project's financial management, which included the\n            guidance provided by project accounting staff, ensuring that\n            weak financial management areas be addressed, and timely\n            improved. While policy changes usually take time, requiring\n            completed implementation of reforms, in the process,\n            governments and finance institutions should promote\n            development of alternative mechanisms, by facilitating the\n            development of markets through better information, better\n            contract dispute resolution, and similar market supportive infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2002-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
