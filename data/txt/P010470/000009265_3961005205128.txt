MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR A
FINANCIAL SECTOR DEEPENING AND INTERMEDIATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Loan to Pakistan for US$216.0 million. The proposed Loan will be at standard Bank terns with 20
years maturity, including a grace of 5 years and will provide resources for a financial sector deepening
and intermediation project. The Project is expected to be co- inanced for about US$100.0 million by
the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Financial Institutions, Issues and Performance
2.        The financial system has undergone rapid change in the past few years. The Bank
supported some of the reforms that enhanced competition and the efficiency of financial intermediation
through a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) in 1989-1992. The changes included the
privatization of two of the five government-owned commercial banks, establishment of new
commercial banks and other financial institutions (FIs) as well as virtual elimination of exchange
controls. The Government of Pakistan (GOP) also started moving toward more indirect means of
contiolling monetary aggregates and has been strengthening prudential regulations. Rates of return on
loans and deposits were liberalized; the degree of credit concessionality to selected sectors was
reduced; bank-by-bank credit ceilings were abolished and an.auction market for government securities
was established. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has turned over provision of short- and medium-
term foreign exchange cover to the private sector.
3.        The Fls have successfully adjusted to policy reforms in the real sector--privatization of
many industrial and commercial firms, elimination of investment sanctioning and modest steps toward
trade reform. In addition, the Fls have developed new instruments based on the principle of
profit-and-loss sharing in accordance with Islamic requirements. Nevertheless, policy and institutional
reforms need to be extended and made consistent if they are to meet their objectives in increasing the
efficiency of financial intermediation. Notwithstanding recent reforms, the financial system still
suffers the legacy of years of financial repression and state ownership. Consequently, over the last
decade the sector has only roughly kept pace with nominal GDP in contrast to rapidly growing East
Asian neignbors where financial sector growth has typically outpaced GDP. The banking system holds
about two-thirds of the assets of the financial system (including the capitalized value of firns listed on
the stock exchanges). Although their share is falling, state-owned commercial banks still account for
almost 70% of the assets of the banking system.
4.        Macroeconomic Policy. To promote the continued healthy development of the financial
sector, a number o' policy issues must be addressed. The most important policy issue is gaining and
sustaining control of the public sector deficit. So long as the public sector preempts a large portion of
total financial savings, real interest rates (and hence, the cost of public borrowing) will remain high
and few financial resources will be left for Fis to channel to private investment. A number of
financial sector policies, such as concessional SBP lending through Fls, failure of state-owned Fls to
recover loans, and provision of foreign exchange cover for importers and some bank deposits have
created the high fiscal cost of SBP operations (which amounted to around 1.4% of GDP in FY90/91).
The high fiscal cost has made deficit control much more difficult. The ongoing reforms would
address the problems and remove some of the major causes of this cost.
5.        Recently, the GOP has put in place key elements of an expanded economic reform
program. This has included strong measures in fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policy. The fiscal
program contains measures to increase revenues and contain expenditures, including a reduction of



- 2 -
defense expenditures as a percent of GDP. The GOP has also introduced legislation for increasing the
autonomy of the Central Bank and initiating taxation of wealth and income in the agriculture sector.
A sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit is a cornerstone of this broadened reform program. The new
economic program has received strong support, including an IMF Stand-by Arrangement and a Public
Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL) from the Bank. In addition, the IMF Board recently approved the
GOP's request for arrangements under Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of SDR 606.6 million
(80% of quota) and Extended Funds Facility of SDR 379.1 million (50% of quota), which will support
Pakistan's adjustment program over the next three years. The comprehensive program includes an
agreed macroeconomic framework with a substantial reduction in fiscal deficit (by about 5% of GDP
over the program period) a move toward indirect monetary control, further liberalization of the
exchange and payments systems, tax reform, trade reform, and financial sector reform, including
strengthening prudential regulations and supervision of the banking sector.
6.        The GOP's medium-termn macroeconomic framework, as agreed under the IMF
arrangements and the Bank PSAL, and set out in the Policy Framework Paper 1993/94-1995/96, has
the following objectives and targets: a rebound in GDP growth to 6.5% per annum; a reduction in
inflation to 5.5%; and a significant increase in the level of international reserves (from 2.3 weeks to
11.5 weeks). The key policy targets for 1993-94 are: a reduction in the overall budget deficit (i.e.,
public sector borrowing requirement) from 9.5% of GDP in 1992/93 to 6.7% in 1993/94; slowing
down of domestic liquidity growth to 14.7% (below the projected nominal GDP growth) in 1993/94;
and a reduction in the current account deficit from 6.4% of GDP in 1992/93 to 3.5% in 1993/94. The
GOP intensified implementation of its adjustment program in the second quarter of 1993/94. As a
result, all of the key macroeconomic targets of the program were met during the first half of 1993/94,
and the budget deficit for the first half of 1993/94 was broadly in line with the program.
7.        State Bank of Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan is the main regulator of Fls and the
executor of monetary policy. Over the years, it focused its regulatory efforts on minutia (bank-by-
bank interest rate ceilings, mandatory credit targets, etc.) and administered large volumes of
concessionary credit. These activities have distracted it from enforcing strict prudential standards and
promoting efficient resource allocation. Although regulation of Fis has improved, more needs to be
done, particularly, to eliminate unnecessary differentiation among classes of FIs, to force further
.eduction in clients' over-indebtedness, and to shift to a risk-weighted assets (BIS) basis of capital
requirements for FIs. This will need to be accompanied by strengthening SBP's capacity to regulate
the increasing number of FIs.
8.        Banks. Although the privatized commercial banks, new banks and foreign banks are
chipping away at the dominance of state-owned banks through innovation and increased efficiency,
privatization needs to be extended to other larger commercial banks. In both cases, considerable
information generation is needed to attract buyers and this should begin as soon as possible. And,
until public sector banks and other Fls are privatized, they should be autonomous and answerable only
to their boards of directors. Presently, the PC has been given responsibility for privatizing two of the
remaining three nationalized commercial banks (NCBs). Provincial banks, which appear to be strong
and well managed, need to be brought into the SBP supervision and data collection system.
9.        Development finance institutions (DFIs) were affected even more than banks from the
period of state ownership and repressive financial policies. Not only did they suffer from the
generally poor climate for loan recovery, but they were also forced to lend for politically motivated
projects. In addition, as inflation and volatility of rates of return have increased, their traditional
business, long-term fixed rate lending, has become less viable. New sources of funds and instruments,
improved relations with their clients, and in some cases, new ownership are needed.



10.       Other non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) including investment banks, leasing
companies and modarabas, are rapidly developing. Some are attempting to find niches that are created
artificially by inappropriate tax or regulatory discrimination among institutions. Different prudential
regulations and tax obligations have created a shifting patchwork of advantages and disadvantages.
Taxation and regulation need to be related to an activity rather than an institution in order to create a
level playing field on which each institution can find its comparative advantage.
11.       Insurance Market. As with banking and the DFIs, the insurance sector is aiso dominated
by state-owned institutions. Life insurance is almost exclusively in the hands of State Life and private
casualty insurers have to cede a large portion of their business to a public reinsurance firm. Insurance
regulation needs to be strengthened and state-owned firms sliould be restructured and/or privatized.
12.       Capital Market Development. Concessional credit and weak regulation have permitted
firms to become highly over-leveraged, leaving them little apparent need for equity finance. Financial
liberalization and some improvement in regulation have started to reverse these factors and the
securities market, although still at an early stage of development, has flourished in recent years.
Nevertheless, several regulatory weaknesses and taxation issues have hindered the development of
securities markets. Firms with their underwriters need to be able to set the issue price of new shares
freely; and the cost of securities transactions and triple taxation of dividends received through mutual
funds need to be reduced. Lack of adequate oversight of securities trading has dampened investors'
interest in equities as well. The Corporate Law Authority (CLA) also needs to be strengthened to
protect investors better and take the lead in the development of the securities market. International
Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Bank have worked together closely in identifying obstacles to
capital market development and means of overcoming these constraints.
1 3.      Loan Recovery. Notwithstanding the creation of special courts for loan recovery, cases
still languish for years and the number of new cases filed e,.ceeds the number disposed, adding to the
backlog. The legal framework for loan recovery needs improvement through rationalization of court
procedures and possibly additional courts and facilities.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
14.       The Bank's strategy for the financial sector is to assist the GOP's effort to make it
responsive to market signals and better able to support structural adjustment in the real sector.
Pakistan needs a financial system that can allocate credit efficiently to growth sectors, provide
restructuring services and reduce the costs of adjustment. To achieve this end, the Bank is assisting
the GOP to establish and implement measures that will broaden and deepen the financial marke's and
support an expansion of private investment and savings to be accomplished over two overlapping
phases. The first phase strengthens the foundation for the development of the capital and money
markets, focusing on the creation of a strong banking system and market-based credit allocation prices,
as well as market-oriented management of domestic debt and money supply. The proposed Project is
a continuation of the first phase. The second Rhase will focus on the non-bank sector of the financial
system and help its development.
15.       The proposed Project, which will combine sector policy adjustment issues as well as
project requirements, will be the first of its type for the Bank's assistance to the financial sector in
Pakistan. It is an integral part of the Bank's country and sector assistance strategy in the medium tenn
and will deepen the GOP's current reforms of financial liberalization supported by the FSAL.
Although project loans have supported specific investment and institutional reforms, they have not
contained conditions requiring policy reforms and adjustments as it is the case under the proposed
Project.



- 4 -
16.       The Bank's assistance to the financial sector has helped improve credit allocation and
economic growth, increase resource allocation, reduce disintermediation, support capital market
development, reduce transaction cost in financial markets, introduce a system to auction GOP's debt,
strengthen banks' supervision, enhance competition, increase autonomy and accountability for NCBs,
bring about necessary institutional reforms for Fis operating in term lending, assist DFIs in their
operational diversification, and ensure a stable flow of long-term foreign exchange resources to private
industry. The proposed Project will build on the experience gained under previous loans and credits
and focus on completing key reforms in privatization, improving the legal framework for loan
recovery and strengthening the institutions that regulate the financial system.
17.       Lessoiis from Previous Bank/IDA Operations. The Project is designed to build on Bank
experience both in Pakistan and worldwide. The most important lesson incorporated is to embed the
financial sector operation in the context of a sector strategy for reform, both those that have already
occurred under FSAL and those being supported by the Project. A second key lesson is to ensure the
financial soundness of the participating financial institutions (PFIs). This would be accomplished by
efforts to strengthen all institutions (through strengthening of regulatory institutions and financial
sector reform) and by restricting the use of Bank funds to institutions that meet criteria of financial
soundness. The third lesson is to design a project so that an effective and successful implementation is
ensured. Consequently, the following elements were incorporated in the design of the proposed
Project: (i) have each institution focus on key actions taking into account the overall project
conditionalities; (ii) break the major reforms into phases; (iii) have upfront actions before loan
approval on several important issues; (iv) have clearly monitorable targets and outcomes; and
(v) assess the GOP's and implementing agencies' capacities to implement new activities.
Country Assistance Strategy
18.       The Country Assistance Strategy, which the Executive Directors discussed on March 31,
1994, highlights two closely linked development goals as the primary focus of the Bank's program in
Pakistan, namely poverty reduction and reducing constraints to sustained growth. To address the
poverty reduction objective, the Bank's approach focuses on improving inadequate basic social
services and so improving weak social indicators. To support the growth objective, which will also
help with the income-related aspects of poverty reduction, Bank efforts concentrate on: structural
reforms, with an emphasis on public finance issues and improving the enabling environment for the
private sector; strengthening inadequate basic infrastructure; reducing constraints on agriculture
productivity; and protecting Pakistan's natura! resources base. The proposed Project will directly
support the GOP's on-going structural reform program, with particular emphasis on further
strengthening policy and institutional reform initiatives in the financial sector. It will also provide
term resources to help meet private sector financing needs to boost private investment in the industry,
trade and services sector which is essential to job creation and improving income generation. The
proposed Project directly supports the private sector development, growth and poverty reduction
objectives of the Bank's program and is therefore fully consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy.
Project Objectives
19.       The Project, which supports the continuation and deepening of the financial sector reform
process, building upon progress achieved under FSAL, will help the GOP implement a set of long-
term policy and institutional development objectives for the financial sector. In particular, the GOP
aims at raising concessional rates to market levels, moving towards open market operations and
restructuring and/or privatizing FIs. In view of these considerations, the Project will promote a set of
policy reforms: (i) further strengthening of the regulatory framework through improved procedures,
monitoring and enforcement; (ii) improvement of the legal framework for loan recovery;



(iii) strengthening banking and non-banking institutions; (iv) reduction of the amount of concessional
finance extended by the SBP; (v) development of a private market in foreign exchange cover;
(vi) improvement of the management of monetary instruments to eliminate inter-sectoral and inter-
institutional distortions; (vii) strengthening of the payment system; (viii) enhancement through capacity
and institutional building of regulatory functions of the securities and insurance markets; and
(ix) privatization, restructuring and institutional development of banks, DFis and insurance companies.
Actions in support of further financial refonns are explained in a Letter of Financial Sector
Development Policy which was sent to the Bank. The Bank and the GOP also discussed and agreed
on the matrix which summarizes policy reforms and their timing. Progress toward targets set out in
these documents will be reviewed approximately one and two years after Loan Effectiveness during
the agreed interim reviews. Continued commitments to new sub-projects will be contingent on the
Bank being satisfied that progress on policy reforms remains on track.
Project Description
20.        The proposed Project will comprise a Bank loan of US$216.0 million which will be
utilized for: (i) a line of credit (US$200.0 million) for long-term loans to any private enterprise that
fits the pre-determined criteria with exceptions such as real estate, trading and certain consumer
services; (ii) an administration fee (US$1.0 million) to Bankers Equity Limited (BEL); and (iii)
technical assistance (US$15.0 million) for consultancy services, training and equipment to the SBP,
CLA, Controller of Insurance (CI), PC and BEL in order to carry out the financial reforms and
improve the capacity and performance of key FIs, as well as the environmental protection measures
for sub-projects. The GOP will on-lend/invest the line of credit to eligible PFIs and grant the
technical assistance funds to the technical assistance beneficiaries to implement the various components
for institutional development and capacity building. The technical assistance allocated to BEL will
assist project preparation and implementation. Technical assistance to SBP will include some support
for enhancing financial sector policies.
21.       The GOP will lend the Bank's funds to the PFIs through BEL, the Administrator. The
GOP's lending rate will be the Bank's prevailing component currency cost rate determined for each
currency of withdrawal, being US dollars, deutsche mark or yen, plus a commitment fee of 0.25% per
annum on the amount of the Loan withdrawn and outstanding. The commitment fee will represent the
average charge to be paid by the GOP over the life of the Loan. Each PFI will also provide a
guarantee from a suitable third party. In the case of the GOP-owned financial institutions, for which
guarantee will not be required, the GOP will still charge a fee of 0.5% per annum to be collected by
BEL. The on-lending rate to PFIs including fees and charges is expected to be about 9.25% for dollar
denominated loans. The PFIs will lend to enterprises at the prevailing rate in their financial market
which will cover the Bank's lending rate, the foreign exchange risk if needed, interest risks,
commitment fee, guarantee cost, administrator's fee and appropriate spread for the PFIs. Sub-
borrowers will bear the foreign exchange risk. PFIs may use Bank funds for sub-loans with original
maturity of up to 12 years including 2 years of grace and sub-lease investments with maturity up to 9
years including 2 years grace or the useful life of the equipment financed, whichever is shorter. Sub-
loanis and sub-lease investments will be denominated in US dollars, deutsche mark or yen (or rupees,
through an agreement between the sub-borrower and the PFI, that foreign exchange cover could be
obtained by or on behalf of the sub-borrower for a fee). The maximum sub-loan/lease investment size
will be US$8.0 million.



22.       In the case of leasing modarabas' they will lease to enterprises at the prevailing mark-up
rates in their leasing market, which must cover all their costs plus an acceptable return on investment.
The leasing modarabas will repay the GOP a return on the amount of the Loan withdrawn and
outstanding from time to time at a provisional rate of return to be declared at the beginning of the
period as expected profits, which will be equal to the agreed installment of principal and profit to be
repaid plus commitment and administrator fees. They will return the GOP's initial investment in
accordance with a fixed amortization schedule of nine years, inclusive of three years of grace. The
US dollar, deutsche mark and yen will be the denomination for the currency or currencies to be
returned to the GOP. All terms and conditions will be contained in Participation Agreements between
BEL, acting as Administrator, and the PFIs. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are
given in Schedule C and D. respectively. A map is attached.
Project Implementation and Administration
23.       The Project includes a detailed Implementation Plan covering progress, costs,
disbursements, administrative and financial aspects, training, technical assistance, monitoring indicators
and other pertinent information. The Implementation Plan identifies constraints and proposes
remedies. The GOP and the Bank will review the plan bi-annually and update it accordingly.
24.       An Administrative Unit (AU) will be created to ensure effective execution of the programs
and activities given the large number of potential beneficiaries. The AU will be a focal point to
ensure that sub-projects conform to agreed criteria and environmental standards, monitor PFI
eligibility, coordinate technical assistance (other than such assistance for SBP), maintain project
accounts and report on various activities. BEL will administer the unit on behalf of the GOP on a fee
basis. The GOP will make the proceeds of the line of credit and technical assistance components
available to the PFIs and recipients of technical assistance (other than SBP) through the AU. The SBP
will administer its own technical assistance. It will report directly to the Bank on implementation
issues. It will also monitor, coordinate and report on the Project policy component.
Project Sustainability
25.       The proposed Project supports the GOP's program for financial sector reform as reflected
in the Letter of Financial Sector Development Policy. It has been designed to ensure its sustainability
through agreed monitoring and implementation actions. The Bank will undertake jointly with the
GOP, as provided under the agreed Project Implementation Plan, a comprehensive review of project
implementation about one year after Loan Effectiveness and again one year after the first review for
identifying major bottlenecks and reaching agreements for dealing with them. In addition, the Bank
would monitor project implementation, on the basis of periodic reports, and through Bank supervision
visits.
Co-financing
26.       The ADB has indicated its willingness to provide co-financing of US$100.0 million for the
Project. However, the success of the Bank financing does not depend on availability of external
funding frcm other co-financiers. The Bank and ADB have coordinated their credit line and technical
'   A Modaraba is an Islamic form of limited partnership in which a managing firm agrees to invest funds of a
fairly large number of passive investors. Modarabas activities sanctioned by a Religious Board enable
them to engage in almost any line of business, though leasing generally is the dominant activity.



assistance conditions. In addition, the Bank has collaborated with the IFC on the design and structure
of IFC's line of credit to help address the long-term finance needs of the private sector. The Bank
and IFC agreed that IFC would handle aspects of the Project related to leasing companies. The IFC's
linle of credit of US$70.0 million for lease financing was signed in May 1994.
Environmental Issues
27.       It is expected that some industrial sub-projects financed under the Loan will require an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The AU will include professionals backed up by specialized
consultants to address the environment concern of sub-projects during the period of expansion and
institutional strengthening of Environment Protection Agencies. The AU will decide which sub-
projects need an EIA, supervise the procedures, monitor the implementation, verify that the plan or
equipment installed satisfies the environmental requirements of the EIA and advise sub-borrowers.
The EIA studies, which will be done by the Environmental Division of GOP's Environmental
Protection Centers and/or private consultant firms, will be made in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. At the momerdt, there are no official guidelines for EIA studies, but it is expected that the
GOP will issue guidelines during the period of the proposed Project. The proposed Project will
provide training to AU staff to build up their capacitv to carry out environmental evaluations. It will
also provide funding for short-term (foreign or local) consultants to advise the unit on technical
matters related to EIAs and industrial environmental issues. The mechanism for environmental
reviews and vetting of sub-projects will be assessed at the First Interim Review to ensure that the EIAs
are executed in accordance with the GOP and Bank's guidelines.
Benefits and Risks
28.       The Project will support efforts undertaken under the FSAL of implementing an
appropriate policy framework for the financial sector, trimming the fiscal cost of SBP operations,
enhancing SBP's regulatory capacities, helping to develop the securities and insurance markets and
strengthening the FIs. The Project will foster the use of new financial instruments and encourage Fls
to diversify their funding sources. At present, private sector investment in Pakistan is increasing
rapidly, yet because of inadequacies of life insurance regulations and uncertainty about inflation and
nominal interest rates, the financial sector has not been successful in mobilizing a significant volume
of term resources. The Project will therefore reduce a financing gap and encourage development of
new financial instruments. The Project will complement GOP's efforts to improve financial sector
efficiency. The Project will also play a role in helping ease the environmental burden of the country's
industrial sector. The primary risks attached to this Project include: (i) a lack of fiscal discipline,
which could put upward pressure on inflation and nominal interest rates, crowd out private investment,
raise the budget deficit and lead to reimposition of caps on Treasury-bill rates discouraging FIs from
mobilizing resources for term financing; (ii) political opposition from defaulters to the establishment of
measures to improve loan recovery; (iii) a negative impact on the pipeline of eligible sub-projects due
to slowness of economic improvements; and (iv) slippage in the technical assistance to strengthen
SBP's and other regulators' capacity to oversee the operations of FIs. However, experience indicates
that most of the above risks will be reduced because of the macroeconomic measures that the GOP has
agreed to implement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility and the Extended Funds
Facility with the IMF and Bank under the PSAL. Furthermore, technical assistance will be provided
