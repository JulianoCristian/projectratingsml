The project only partially achieved its objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was partially\n            successful, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was marginally satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            high quality and timely training of project functionaries is\n            a sine qua non for high quality service delivery. Second,\n            there is a need for an increased emphasis on the health and\n            care-related factors determining nutrition outcomes in the\n            youngest children. Third, operational research needs to\n            focus on a reduced number of high quality, carefully\n            conducted, and punctually reported studies to be carried out\n            within the first two to three years of the project, so that\n            findings can be used to improve the project. Fourth, more\n            importance needs to be attached to monitoring, with respect\n            to quality in general, and the need to more visibly track\n            progress towards the impact objectives in particular.\n            Finally, the project demonstrated clearly that the rapid\n            expansion of ICDS into new blocks usually comes at the\n            expense of service quality."}, "docdt": "1998-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
