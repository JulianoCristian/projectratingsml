    commitment to the reform program may be present at the\n            highest echelons.

With the Bank's increasing emphasis on\n            Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC), greater attention is\n            needed on: (a) political economy analysis; (b) fraud and\n            abuse of government funds; and (c) voice and accountability\n            (the demand side of governance). For complying with the\n            expanding agenda, the task team will need to take cognizance\n            of the recommendations of the Bank's GAC council."}, "docdt": "2011-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
