outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: country\n            ownership drives the partnership, while the quality of the\n            underpinning technical analysis is key to the relationship.\n            Mexico's sophistication and good internal consultation\n            process imply a well defined client agenda, which can be\n            backed by the provision of technical expertise by the Bank,\n            taking advantage strong cross country experience.\n            Flexibility with Middle Income Countries (MICs) implies\n            ongoing dialogue and room for better responsiveness in\n            planning and execution. Irrespective of political economy\n            considerations (that were important in this operation's\n            instrument choice), a broad reform programmatic approach can\n            provide for ongoing dialogue on a number of policy fronts\n            and more flexibility in responding to MICs changing needs\n            and priorities. Broad reform based Development Policy Loans\n            (DPLs) can benefit in terms of supervision cost by taking\n            advantage of the sector's overall dialogue and lending/\n            non lending program. Intrinsic differences can sometime\n            explain the slow take up of capital markets for funding."}, "docdt": "2008-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
