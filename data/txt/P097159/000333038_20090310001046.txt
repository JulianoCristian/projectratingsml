1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal


Macro-economic context:
The loan was approved during a period of sound macro-economic management. In
the years preceding loan approval, the government reduced the fiscal deficit from 3.1
percent of GDP in 2003 to 0.7 percent in 2006, while the outstanding external debt
dropped from 28.3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 23.5 percent in 2004. The sound fiscal
policy was aided by rising oil revenues. Tight monetary policy brought inflation down
from 9 percent in 2000 to 4.1 percent in 2006, and the current account deficit narrowed
from 3.7 percent in 2000 to 1.9 percent in 2006 due to a surge in oil revenue and
remittance transfers that compensated a widening in the non-oil trade deficit.

Economic growth, driven by private consumption and private investment, was
broad based. Taking advantage of the global economic recovery and high international
oil prices, the Mexican economy saw uninterrupted economic growth since mid-2003,
averaging 4 percent per annum between 2004 and 2006. With business confidence and
investments on the rise, strengthened investment inflows, and strong export growth, the
market perception of Mexico was favorable. However, given the strong economic
linkages to the US, the PAD pointed to a potential risk of economic slowdown in the case
of a sharp drop in US growth.

Mexico's consistent macroeconomic management generated confidence in
international financial markets. The GoM had announced the pre-funding and
prepayment of external public debt service obligations due in 2006 and 2007, thereby
suggesting it would not need to return to international bond markets throughout this
period. International markets were confident about the political transition, as reflected by
the evolution of Mexican sovereign debt spreads prior to the election.

Developments in the financial sector:
The undertaking of regulatory reforms and the opening of the financial system to
foreign investors supported the stabilizing of the banking sector after the Tequila
crisis. Non-performing loans from banks' balance sheets were transferred to an asset
management facility, and prudential regulations tightened. Foreign strategic investors
bought large stakes in the banking system, thus bolstering its capital position. As can be
seen in Table 1, the quality of assets improved markedly, with non-performing loans
coming down to 2.5 percent in 2004, and provisioning levels reaching comfortable levels.
Capital adequacy ratios remained solid at around 14 percent, and return on equity ratios
increased after 2001. However, concentration levels were high, with 6 out of the 29
commercial banks operating in Mexico controlling over 85 percent of total banking sector
assets. Foreign banks held the vast majority of the assets (82 percent).

Despite the increased soundness of the banking sector, financial intermediation
remained shallow after the crisis. The process of cleaning up bank balance sheets after
the Tequila crisis in 1994/95 in combination with the entrance of large foreign investors
led to a drastic fall in private sector financing. Bank credit to the private sector dropped
from a peak of 39 percent of GDP in 1994 to 8.2 percent of GDP in 2001, but by 2004
had recovered slightly to 11.5 percent of GDP. As can be seen in Figure 1, this was below
the share of private sector credit in other countries in Latin America. The share of bank
liabilities to broad money (M2) also witnessed a deterioration, while the importance of
public securities and private pension funds increased after the introduction of mandatory
defined contributions pension schemes in 1997. Overall, the total assets of the financial
system declined from 59.7 percent of GDP in 2001 to 51.3 percent in June 2005, as can
be seen in Table 2.

The government also implemented important reforms in the non-bank financial
sector. With Bank support, it refocused the role of public banks on second-tier lending
activities, and extended private bank prudential regulations to them. This limited the
potential for economic distortions and reduced possible contingent liabilities for the
GoM. Changes in the legal and regulatory framework for SOFOLEs and SIEFOREs were
introduced, which facilitated their creation and growth. This was of particular importance
for the reinvigoration of the housing finance sector and the development of a private
pension system, although both still represented only a small but growing fraction of the
financial system.

Substantial progress was also made to improve financial infrastructure. Credit
Bureaus were introduced in 1997, and a new legal framework passed in 2001. In 2004,
Credit Bureaus were estimated to cover around 60 percent of all potential borrowers, a
high percentage by regional standards. Additionally, reforms were initiated to bring
national accounting standards in line with international standards and a new bankruptcy
law was passed to enhance contract enforcement and creditor rights.

The capital markets, particularly the equity market, continued to be shallow, and
were dominated by government securities and selected private stock. In order to
bolster the markets, a new securities law was passed in 2001. It supported reforms to
strengthen corporate governance and improved supervision and institutional
arrangements through stronger inspection and enforcement powers for the supervisor.
Furthermore, the basic infrastructure of the markets was upgraded. A new debt
instrument, the certificado bursátil was launched in 2001 to facilitate bond issuance,
protect investors and help diversify the market away from government securities. Another
important achievement was the development of a local currency benchmark yield curve,
which was made possible by an enhanced government debt management strategy and a
stronger focus on financing through the domestic bond market. The established
benchmark facilitated private and sub-sovereign bond issuance, but the increased
volumes of government bonds in local currency also posed the risk of crowding out the
private sector.

Despite these reforms, there continued to be a shortfall of financing and available
investment vehicles, which led to a loss of potential growth opportunities. Supplier
industries became a major source of supplier finance, but the funds available were not
sufficient to bridge the gap created by the drastic drop of bank financing after the crisis.
Pension funds mostly invested in government debt, thus also not providing the needed
funds to the private sector. On the savings side, the lack of savings mechanisms for
households and hedging instruments for investors and firms hampered the ability to save
and manage risks adequately. These factors likely had a negative impact on overall
growth and employment opportunities. However, at project approval, there were already
signs that the undertaken reforms in the financial sector had started to bear fruits and
intermediation levels were on the rise again.

Political context and rational for bank assistance:
The above-mentioned reforms to stabilize and deepen the financial system formed
an integral part of the government's National Development Plan (NDP) for 2001-
2006. The Plan covered three broad areas: (i) social and human development, (ii) growth
with quality, and (iii) order and respect. Financial sector reforms were included under the
second reform area and aimed at: (i) promoting efficient arrangements for regulation and
supervision in the financial system, (ii) promoting a solid and efficient commercial
banking sector, (iii) strengthening non-bank financial intermediaries and building a
culture of insurance in Mexico, (iv) creating a social banking sector, (v) strengthening
development banks, (vi) fostering efficiency in the capital markets, and (vii) developing
new instruments for risk control and promotion of stability. Financial sector reforms were
further detailed in the economic and fiscal program PRONAFIDE (Programa Nacional
de Financiamiento de Desarrollo), which supported the implementation of the NDP.

Upon request from the government, the Bank supported the comprehensive
financial sector reforms program of the government through a two-phased
programmatic development policy lending operation. The program was to focus on
on-going reform areas for which there was a broad political consensus, in order to



                                              4

minimize the risks associated with program implementation during an electoral period
and a transition in government. Additionally, it was foreseen that the Bank would provide
analytical support at the request of the Government1, to complement the reform program
and help build consensus for future reforms. The DPL also complemented reforms in
other areas of the financial sector, which the Bank supported through on-going lending
and analytical work.2

The project was well aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy, which focused
on increasing competitiveness as one of its pillars. A competitiveness study conducted
prior to project approval confirmed that an efficient and well-diversified financial system
was essential to stimulate and enhance competition in Mexico. Aiming at diversifying
and deepening the financial system, the project supported measures to ease the flow of
financing to business and households, thereby increasing opportunities for innovation and
expansion, and ultimately fostering competition and economic growth. The CAS did
foresee a financial sector loan for FY07, which was to focus on improving access to
finance. However, as described in the PAD, the government requested financing at an
earlier stage, and given that another Bank operation was still on-going (the Second
Savings and Rural Finance Project that aimed at broadening access), the focus of the
financial sector loan was to enhance overall financial sector stability and diversification.
This approach was in line with the Bank's strategy for middle-income countries, which
aims for a more streamlined lending approach in countries with a proven macro-
economic track record and sound long-term development plans.

This is the Implementation Completion Report for the first DPL, which was approved by
the Board in March 2006. As will be discussed further down, a second DPL in the series
did not materialize, but there are ongoing discussions on a new loan that in substance
adheres to the programmatic approach established by the first DPL.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The development objective of this operation was to support sustainable growth and the
alleviation of poverty by
     (i)       Contributing to reduce the probability of a systemic financial crisis;
     (ii)      Fostering the sustainable growth of a financial system and capital markets that
               address the needs of the productive sector and increase the overall
               competitiveness of the economy; and
     (iii)     Increasing the diversification of savings and investment instruments available
               to households and institutional investors.

 So far, the Bank had focused on selected aspects of financial sector deepening, in particular expansion of financial
services to rural areas, strengthening of public banks and the competition in banking, and support for mortgage market
development. Additionally, several analytical studies were carried out, amongst those an Auditing and Accounting
ROSC, an Anti-Monetary Laundering ROSC and a Competitiveness study.

performance indicators (see Table 3). Additionally, the policy matrix (included as Annex
2 to the PAD) specified a list of key performance indicators along the lines of the selected
policy areas, which are presented in Table 7.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

To help implement the overall objective of the loan, the two DPLs aimed at supporting
reforms in three overarching policy areas:
    (i) strengthening market integrity and prudential regulation
    (ii) increasing the depth, access and diversification of financing to foster a more
         effective role of the financial sector in the development of the economy; and
    (iii) promoting diversified investment instruments to complement the aim of
         increased financial access through enhanced national savings levels and
         investment vehicles.

1.6 Other significant changes

It was expected that the second Development Policy Loan would be approved within 18
month after launching of the first loan. While the government implemented the vast
majority of the triggers for the second operation (see Table 5), a second loan as initially
foreseen has not materialized. Several factors contributed to this: (i) a fiscal surplus in
2006 due to higher than expected growth rates, as well as increased fiscal revenues due to
surging oil-prices, (ii) a downward trend in real interest rates, which made market
financing more attractive, (iii) an active debt-management strategy which aimed at
curtailing overall debt levels, reduce external debt, and lengthen the maturity of domestic
debt. The second operation was never formally cancelled and there are ongoing
discussions on a new loan that in substance adheres to the programmatic approach
established by the first DPL, although it may not materialize under that program.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Both the outgoing and the new government were committed to the financial sector
reforms. Among the risks identified by the PAD was the political risk from the up-
coming elections for the continuation of the reform process. This risk was mitigated
through a broad consultation process, which ensured that the conditions for the release of
the first operation were met prior to Board approval, and that implementation of financial
sector reforms continued after the election of a new government into office. The majority
of the second DPL's triggers were implemented, but due to a fiscal surplus in the recent
years, the government did not require additional financing from the World Bank.
However, as discussed above, a new DPL is currently under discussion, which will likely
follow the lines of reforms as established in the first DPL.

The background analysis was sound, building on previous and ongoing analytical
work and a strong dialogue with the authorities and other IFIs. The relevance of the
undertaken reforms was acknowledged by an FSAP update (a joint WB and IMF
exercise), which was conducted shortly after loan approval. The project was also
implemented in close collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank, which
supported financial sector reforms in Mexico through a two-tranche US$ 600 million
Financial System Consolidation Policy Loan. The loans of both institutions
complemented each other in the areas of prudential regulations, development of capital
markets and public debt management.

The risk assessment was relevant, concentrating on economic linkages with the US
and political risk. The PAD correctly identified the close linkages to the US market as a
potential risk to stability, both for the overall performance of the Mexican economy and
the banking sector itself. It also recognized that launching a programmatic series of loans
before up-coming elections might entail political risk for the continuation of the reform
process and pointed out that the broad consultation process undertaken for financial
reforms, as well as the focus on politically feasible reforms for the second operation,
would shield the program from those risks.



2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The design of the monitoring and evaluation framework was adequate. Given the
wealth of relevant publicly available information, the design of the monitoring and
evaluation system focused on information that was being monitored already by the
supervisory agency (CNBV). This guaranteed timely monitoring during implementation
and reduced the strain on the borrower. The PAD provided a wealth of baseline data and
information, and also clearly specified the key performance indicators for the operation.
While the PAD itself did not specifically list baseline and target values for each indicator,
the data was readily available elsewhere in the appraisal report and was later specified in
the implementation status and results (ISR) report. The key performance indicators were
directly aligned with the individual policy actions and linked well into the overall policy
areas that were supported by the loan.




                                               11

The focus during implementation was on progress made towards the
implementation of the triggers for the second operation, as well as achievement of
the overall goals of the program. The dialogue with the government during project
implementation was facilitated through on-going interaction between the Bank and the
borrower on a broad set of financial sector issues. Supervision missions were combined
with missions for on-going technical assistance, such as the technical assistance for
BANOBRAS, as well as analytical studies such as the FSAP mission in March 2006 and
the Financial Sector Competitiveness non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) requested
by the government. This reduced the de-facto cost of supervision for this operation,
helped keep overall operational costs low and allowed continued dialogue when it
became apparent that a second DPL would not materialize in the expected timeframe.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
There are two related and complementary new loans, one recently approved and
another in preparation. The Private Housing Finance Markets Strengthening DPL
(P112258) was approved on 11/06/2008, aiming to strengthen the financial capacity of
SHF to consolidate markets for housing finance and to expand access to lower income
groups over the medium term, as well as to improve SHF's technical capacity in doing
so. A new Financial Sector DPL is also under preparation, expected to support the
government's broader financial sector reform agenda.

Additionally, the Bank provides advice to the government through a series of
targeted financial sector competitiveness studies. These aim at providing guidance to
the government on how to foster competition in the local financial market by
benchmarking Mexico with other countries3.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objective of the loan continues to be highly relevant. The government's current
National Development Plan, which covers the years 2007-2012, includes two pillars
which are directly aligned with the objective of the project: fostering competitiveness and
equality of opportunity. Financial sector reforms once again feature prominently, and
lately have even gained further importance and attention due to the intensifying of the
international financial crisis. The Government is increasingly focusing on deepening the
financial sector to reach levels consistent with Mexico's peers.

In line with the Bank's strategy for middle-income countries, the new Country
Partnership Strategy is closely aligned with the government's program, but leaves
sufficient flexibility for on-demand services, a streamlined lending portfolio and demand

 As part of the Financial Sector Competitiveness studies, four analytical pieces have so far been delivered, covering: "
Framework for Financial Sector Development", "Development Bank Strategy", "Microfinance Policies Review" and
"Microinsurance Market Developments". A study on impediments to Capital Market Development is currently
underway.

driven technical assistance. As discussed above, two new financial sector lending
operations will complement and deepen reforms supported under the Finance and Growth
DPL.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives


The Mexican government continued to maintain a sound macro-economic
framework, and poverty dropped due to solid economic growth. The exchange rate
remained stable, and the inflation rate continued its downward trend from 5.2 percent in
2004 to 3.8 percent in 2007. Due to the increase in oil revenue, the government achieved
a primary fiscal surplus of over 2.5 percent in 2006/07, which helped keep the external
public sector debt to GDP at 25 percent. Overall, a fiscal responsibility law requires a
balanced budget, which has been achieved in the last three years. Sovereign credit ratings
are two steps above the lowest investment grade, and the risk perception of default is low,
as shown by a comparatively low EMBI spread. GDP growth averaged 3.8 percent during
2004-2007, but has recently slowed to 2.8 percent (yoy) in the first half of 2008. It is
expected that growth will further slow in 2009 due to the impact of the worldwide
financial crisis and the ensuing economic slowdown in key trading partners, particularly
the US. Headcount poverty declined from 50 percent in 2002 to 43 percent in 2006, with
GDP per capita increasing in real terms by 6 percent.

As will be discussed further below, the government made solid progress in
consolidating the stability of the financial sector and facilitating its growth, but the
depth and outreach of the system continues to remain limited in international terms.
The domestic financial system currently equals about 70 percent of GDP4, and continues
to be dominated by the banking system. Credit to the private sector as percent of GDP
grew by 32 percent between 2005 and 2007, and accounted for 21 percent of GDP as of
end-2007. The ratio however continues to be below the ratios achieved in other countries
in the region, and is still lower than prior to the Tequila crisis. The same holds for
deposits, which grew in the last 2 years combined by 8 percent and now account for 26
percent of GDP. Regarding developments on the capital market, private bond issuance
increased, and stock market capitalization reached 45 percent of GDP in 2007, despite
fewer stocks being listed. These positive trends reflect the overall successful reform
program in the area of financial sector reforms, to which this project has contributed.
However, available bank credit and other sources of funding are still comparatively
scarce, and together with the elevated costs of financing, continue to dampen the growth
potential of the enterprise sector, particularly small and medium enterprises.

Development Objective 1: Contribute to reduce the probability of a systematic
financial crisis (satisfactory)

After the restructuring process of the banking sector during 2000, the Government
implemented a series of financial reforms to strength the solvency of banks and the

  This includes liabilities of domestic financial institutions and direct holdings of government securities by the non-
financial private sector.

  risk management practices. Such reforms involved risk management, internal controls,
  corporate governance standards and capital adequacy requirements, mainly. The CNBV,
  through in-site visits and information requirements, supervises the correct functioning of
  banking institutions and fines have proved to be useful mechanisms to prevent banking
  institutions from failing to comply with information requirements and other secondary
  regulation. Mexico has also improved its compliance with the principles established in
  the Basel Committee regarding risk management and its appropriate measuring. Within
  the last amendments to the capital adequacy rules, banks are subject to capital
  requirements with respect to their operational risks, as established in the Basel II
  principles. In addition, the regulatory framework establishes that banks should count with
  internal risk committees to manage, control and monitor their exposure to risks

  As can be seen in Figure 3, the soundness of the banking system has continued to
  improve over the last few years. The Capital Adequacy Ration (CAR) for the entire
  banking system increased from 14.3 percent at end-2005 to 16.1 percent at the end of
  August 2008, with all banks staying above the mandatory 10 percent CAR. Only one
  bank dropped below the threshold since 2006, and was quickly re-capitalized.
  Profitability saw an upward trend until end-2007, when returns on equity reached over 20
  percent system-wide. Non-performing loans stayed at around 2.5 percent of total loans,
  and provisioning levels remained sound. The exposure of the banking system to the
  government sector dropped from over 34 percent of total assets in 2004 to 14 percent in
  June 2008, making room for a larger share of credit going to the private sector. While
  concentration and foreign ownership remain high, market shares of the largest 3 and 5
  banks have slightly come down in the last year due to entrance of new banks and the
  growth of domestic "niche" banks.

  The measures introduced by the government to promote transparency and
  accountability, as well as to improve corporate governance, have also begun to bear
  fruits. The FSAP update in 2006 confirms that significant improvements were made with
  regard to the quality and enforcement of securities regulation5. The CNBV regularly
  publishes reports on sanctions imposed on individual financial institutions for failure to
  comply with individual corporate governance standards, and also provides all the balance
  sheet information and the links to the published accounts of individual financial
  institutions / conglomerates. Additionally, loan classifications are published per bank,
  and individual banks placed information on their risk management systems on the web.
  The increased transparency is also reflected in the Doing Business indicators for Investor
  Protection, which give Mexico a very high mark on disclosure (see Table 6). The Doing
  Business index on legal rights index improved from 2 in 2004 to 4 in 2008, nevertheless
  below regional and worldwide standards. The increased transparency allows a more
  efficient functioning of the market, and helps enforce discipline.

Mechanisms for banks that have financial problems have been included in the
Banking Law in two stages, while more amendments are expected: (i) with the 2004
amendments, procedures were established to identify in a timely manner banks whose
financial situation is deteriorating and to establish prompt corrective actions; (ii) the 2006
amendments (banking resolutions) developed mechanisms that allow liquidation through
resolutions schemes that maximize the bank's assets' recovery value; (iii) as a third stage,
the Mexican government is working on a new amendment to the Banking Law with the
objective of establishing the mechanisms necessary to liquidate an insolvent bank in a
definite manner - this amendment incorporates mechanisms that pursue a better asset
value recovery, protecting the interests of depositors.



Development Objective 2: Increase Depth, Access and Diversification of Financing
(moderately satisfactory)

The DPL aimed at supporting the diversification of financing through the fostering
of institutional reforms in the capital market to allow companies to tap additional
resources. The reforms were part of a broader government reform program aiming at
developing a conducive legal framework for the capital market, enhance corporate
governance standards, and eliminate barriers to the developments on the institutional
side.

The increase in stock market capitalization in the last few years has been significant,
but challenges and untapped potential remain. Between 2004 and 2005, the stock
market value tripled, reaching 45 percent of GDP at the end of 2007 compared to 25
percent at end-2004. However, the increase in value probably reflects appreciation of
individual stocks in the wake of favorable external and internal conditions rather than
deepening of the market. Only a handful of new companies were listed on the stock
exchange, none of which in the form of a SAPI-B. While the figure of SAPI itself has
successfully been accepted by firms to fund their operations in the market, the SAPI-B
scheme requires additional compliance standards set for publicly listed companies such
as increased level of information disclosure and corporate governance standards, listing
costs, etc. Another important aspect of the SAPI-B scheme is the threshold limit of 3
years to fulfill the requirements to become a SAB. In this sense, the requirements to
finally transform a SAPI-B into a SAB, and the cost-benefit involved during the process
might be restraining firms to exploit this vehicle. The IPOs were not sufficient to
compensate for delistings, due to Mexico-listings abroad (mainly in New York via
ADRs), mergers and acquisitions, a cleaning process by BMV during 2006 to determine
listing requirements compliance resulting in 22 delistings, but also some medium sized

firms deciding to retire stock since the benefits did not cover the direct costs. Overall, the
number of companies listed in the domestic stock exchange decreased by 16 percent
since 2000 to 125, comparing unfavorably to other regional and international capital
markets.6 The turnover ratio of stock remained at around 30 percent, which is higher than
many neighboring countries, possibly the reflection of high US investor participation. A
limited number of stocks continue to dominate the market and the stock market does not
yet appear to be an important source of financing for companies, especially small and
medium enterprises.

In the bond market, the amount of outstanding values of domestic bonds increased
steadily over time due to increased volumes of government and financial sector debt,
but non-financial corporate bonds have not performed as favorably. Since 2005, the
bond market saw growth rates of around 26.5 percent annually (amounts outstanding),
reaching 9.19 of GDP as of 2008. As part of the government's strategy to finance a larger
share of its debt on the domestic market, the government significantly increased its
domestic issuance of bonds over the years, which helped establish a yield curve, and
lengthen the average maturity of government bonds. Financial institutions, particularly
SOFOLEs active in the housing finance segment, also increasingly used the capital
market to place bonds to finance their growth. However, the share of the corporate sector
in total bonds outstanding decreased from 9.2 percent in 2005 to 7.9 percent in March
2008, and the total volume of corporate bonds increased only marginally in the same
period. Despite higher demand for corporate bonds, particularly by SIEFORES, only well
rated blue-chip companies access this market, with small and medium enterprises relying
on other funding sources.

The Law of Credit Institutions has overall had a positive impact allowing
enterprises to tap capital markets in order to fund their credit activities. In
particular, some non-deposit taking institutions, such as SOFOLES, gained access to the
stock market to fund their activities (consumer credit, mortgage, etc.). Two other factors
also enhanced the benefits of this reform: (i) the introduction of the "certificado bursátil"
framed in the Securities Market Law, providing operational flexibility to the debt market
and the issuers, and; (ii) the reforms to the pension fund system allowing Pension Funds
to invest a share of their portfolio in debt instruments issued by SOFOLES and other
enterprises. With the entrance of these intermediaries in the market, the debt market
activity increased significantly




6 In an effort to better understand and promote the funding through the securities market, the authorities have
intensified their efforts to understand and attract more participants from the private sector, including the request for a
Bank conducted study to understand and enhance the access of firms to the securities market.

SHF has successfully fostered the rebound in mortgage lending, but significant
weaknesses remain. The government created SHF with a limited mandate for private
market development, to support the development of new financial products such as
mortgage default insurance and securitizations, and new non-depository intermediaries
such as SOFOLES. Funding by SHF of SOFOLES lending drove the vast majority of
private sector lending to households earning between the median and the 80th percentile
of the income distribution between 1998 and 2006. SOFOLES are indeed the only ones
reaching the informal sector, with the support of SHF funding. Several SOFOLES have
developed a significant market presence and three of the largest have received significant
investments by foreign depository institutions, while issues by SOFOLES initiated the
RMBS market in 2002 and continue to account for the majority of RMBS issuance.
However, despite the progress made and rapid growth in this segment, a number of
weaknesses and a considerable gap in access (especially among lower income segments)
remain in the domestic market, as mortgage lending has grown only to 9.2 percent of
GDP (much smaller than Chile at 14 percent); most mortgages are made to formal sector
households earning the median income or more. The ability of even larger SOFOLES to
tap capital markets is constrained by the current disruption in international credit markets;
and the Mexican RMBS market remains comparatively small and illiquid both for
primary issuance and secondary trading. SHF continues to play an important role in
market development, supported by a Bank loan and under a re-orientation of the bulk of
its operations towards alternative lenders and housing finance products more appropriate
for the below median income groups and where the head of household is employed in the
informal sector.

Monoline insurers were active in Mexico prior to 2007, but have withdrawn with the
recent crisis. Each Mexican RMBS issue requires credit enhancement by two means: 1)
internal enhancements via the creation of senior and subordinate bonds; and 2) external
partial enhancements by third parties such as U.S. monoline bond insurers, multi-lateral
agencies (IFC or FMO), or SHF. Monoline insurers were active in Mexico prior to 2007,
with approximately 21 percent out of the $4.7 billion of Borhis RMBS outstanding
having a monoline guarantee. Indeed, SHF withdrew its product for financial guarantees
for RMBS when monoline firms and other multi-laterals provided coverage at more
aggressive prices. However, the withdrawal of monoline guarantors from the Borhis
market has required SHF to reprise its former role of bond guarantor and may lead SHF
to again offer financial guarantees for RMBS issues.

Development Objective 3: Promote Diversified Investment Instruments

The supported reforms in the area of pensions intended to promote competition in
the AFOREs industry, thereby broadening coverage of workers and lowering
associated costs. The pension industry7, which relies on mandatory contributions,

  At the end of the first half of 2008, the AFORES industry was composed of 18 administrators and 102 specialized
investment companies (of which 90 are basic SIEFOREs). Of the administrators, eight are part of financial groups, four
are linked to insurance companies and the remaining six, mostly formed in recent years, are associated with other
sectors such as trade or the administration of investment funds.

currently comprises around 7.6 percent of GDP, up from 6.5 percent in 2004 but below
the share reached at the end of 2007. The system lags behind other larger countries in the
region as far as assets are concerned. The number of accounts managed by AFORES
increased by 24 percent during the last four years, but accounts of independent workers
continue to be negligible. Only half of all AFORES offer accounts for independent
workers and only 38.703 accounts are currently registered, representing less than 0.1
percent of all accounts.

Fees and commission were initially brought down as a result of the measures to
increase transparency and lower switching costs, but increased again in mid-2007.
With regard to commission fees, the government introduced new regulation at the
beginning of 2008, which eliminated the commission "sobre Flujo" and replaced it by a
single commission. This has the advantage of better comparability, but the new
harmonized commissions appear to be on the high side. Overall, the Mexican pension
system continues to be amongst the most expensive systems, and comission dispersion
between the various providers continue to be substantial (ranging between 1-3 percent).

The supported reforms also helped lower the barriers to entry. Costs for switching
between funds were brought down, and the actual process of switching facilitated. In
December 2005, fees for the collection agency PROSECAR and the regulator CONSAR
were switched to proportional basis, which reduces the financial burden on smaller
pension companies who so far had to pay equal shares of the costs. Undetermined
accounts were assigned to those funds with the lowest cost structures to increase the
incentives for further cost reduction and entry. The reforms facilitated entry of 5 new
players between 2001-2005, but since then no further entries were registered.8 As can be
seen in Figure 5, this reform also led to a drastic increase in transfers.

After introducing changes to the investment regime in 2005, the government further
relaxed the investment regulation for SIEFORES recently9, allowing for additional
diversification. As a result of the reforms, the share of government and parastatal
securities in the overall asset portfolio of SIEFORES dropped from 82 percent in July
2005 to 65.8 percent in October 2008. The investment portfolio of individual SIEFORES
varies greatly, ranging from an actual investment of below 40 percent of assets in
government paper to over 90 percent. Most of the investments are done in local currency,
with maturities of 5 years and higher. Investments in corporate bonds saw an impressive
growth, up from 7 percent of total pension system assets in July 2005 to over 17 percent

  As a result of the new competitive environment created by the legal reforms of 2007, there were two processes of
fusion, while another AFORE entered in the process of dissolution. The AFORE Santander, one of the largest managers
of the system, was acquired by ING AFORE, becoming the third largest with 12.8 percent of total net assets managed
in the system. The AFORE Actinver bought by Metlife AFORE , holding 2.5 percent of net assets in the system. The
AFORE de la Gente, owned by BANSEFI, entered in the process of dissolution, after just over a year of operations,
with its the operational part acquired by PENSIONISSSTE that will manage the individual accounts for public sector
workers under the new pension scheme. The mergers could represent a benefit to affiliates due to lower commissions
and by the right to transfer individual accounts to any other administrator.

in October 2008, but the increased demand has not yet translated into a larger supply of
corporate bonds (see above). Additionally, investments in variable national and
international interest rate bonds, which were only allowed in 2004, now comprise up to
10 percent of total assets combined. The actual composition of each individual fund is
compiled by CONSAR and publicly available on the web.

increasingly important for banks and firms, either for hedging or negotiation purposes.
For this reason, in December 2008, CNBV reformed the derivatives disclosure regulation.
Listed firms are forced to disclose on a quarterly basis the internal policies for risk
management, exposures to risk, governance for risk decisions, exposures to derivative
instruments and a brief explanation on their use of derivatives, whether their use is for
hedging or for negotiation purposes. However, the private sector is mainly financed
through banking credit and other credit suppliers, while firms access the securities market
through debt issuance instead of capital.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The overall outcome under this operation has been satisfactory. As part of a broader and
on-going government program to foster the development of the financial sector in
Mexico, the loan supported improvements to the legal and regulatory framework in the
areas of banking, capital markets and pensions, and introduced measures to enhance
availability of a diverse set of financial instruments. As discussed above, solid progress
was made in all reform areas, which is reflected in the development of the key
performance indicators. The measures contributed to the overall favorable development
of the financial sector, both regarding growth and soundness of key players in the
financial sector.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project likely had a positive impact on poverty reduction and social development.
There is general agreement in the literature that a sound and healthy financial system is
conducive to broad based growth, and that access to a more diversified set of financial
instruments benefits the well-being of individuals. During project implementation, more
than 10 million new households were registered as having received a credit, and housing
finance increased significantly due to larger availability of credit and a lower interest rate.
Additionally, smaller enterprises benefited from better access to credit, as evidenced by a
larger number of enterprises registered to have received a credit while overall volumes of
credit only increased slightly.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening




                                                      23

The operation had an important and positive impact on the institutional framework. The
supported reforms helped to establish a sound regulatory framework in the area of
banking, pensions and capital market, bringing regulations in line with international
standards. The reforms also helped clarify the responsibilities of the supervisory agency,
foster transparency and enhance corporate governance standards.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

There were no unintended outcomes and impacts under this operation. The Mexican
Government continued to advance reforms to foster the development of the financial
sector, and made good progress toward implementation of reforms originally foreseen for
the next phase of lending.

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
     Rating: moderatel

The biggest risk to development currently stems from the ongoing international financial
crisis. The financial system in Mexico has so far been able to withstand the impact of the
global financial liquidity crisis, and the overall perception of rating agencies and
economic think tanks is that the financial system in Mexico continues to be sound. While
the international crisis will likely impact the financial sector through a deterioration of
conditions in the real sector, in combination of drying up of external financial flows, the
banking system revamped its risk management standards, and the quality of the portfolio
improved over the years. The reforms supported under this project have helped diversify
the financial sector, enhance supervision and enforcement, and fostered the health and
quality of the system. All these factors should contribute to mitigate the risks.

The government has already introduced measures to ease the impact of the global crisis.
In the area of housing, the government owned SHF is providing guarantees and credit
lines to the SOFOLES to bridge the shortage of liquidity. To prevent a drying up of the
bond market, two other development banks are offering partial guarantees of up to 50
percent of each issuance. Discussions on further World Bank support for the financial
sector are ongoing.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)


5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
     Rating: Satisfactory

The project team performance during identification, preparation and appraisal is rated as
satisfactory. The DPL's strategic relevance was based on the GOM's policy priorities for
the financial sector (as expressed in the National Development Plan for 2001-2006) and
was well aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (that focused on increasing
competitiveness as one of its pillars). The design of the DPL profited from ongoing
financial sector dialogue with the government as part of policy and investment based
lending (in housing finance, rural finance, and public bank strengthening) and analytical
work (including the Competitiveness and Trade AAA, a ROSC exercise, the 2005 and
2006 Doing Business input, and the "Wither Latin American Capital Markets?" report
prepared by regional chief economist office with a focus on Mexico). Importantly, the
Bank maintained close dialogue with the government on financial sector issues after the
initial FSAP and supported the development of the Government's financial sector
program through provision of technical expertise in selected areas. In addition, the Bank
closely coordinated with the IADB during project preparation, which also supported
financial sector reforms in Mexico. Finally, the DPL design reflected important lessons
learned of overall relevance for the Bank's interaction with middle income countries.

(b) Quality of Supervision
     Rating: Satisfactory

Staff support for the government's program and candid dialogue with the government
was facilitated through on-going interaction on a broad set of financial sector issues
(reflecting the broad nature of the DPL), with supervision also benefiting from on-going
technical assistance and analytical studies (including an FSAP in March 2006). This
flexibility allowed on the other hand continued dialogue and stock taking despite the fact
that the second DPL did not materialize, but also indirectly resulted in the lateness of the
ICR process initiation. Indeed, the ongoing engagement is reflected by new projects in
related financial sector issues, including a housing finance loan (P112258, approved
11/06/2008) and a new finance DPL (P112076) in preparation in support of the
government's financial sector reform agenda.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

The rating of satisfactory is justified, among others, on the project's strong strategic
relevance, structural importance and good design and risk recognition at entry; as well as
on the continued dialogue for stock taking and policy assistance during supervision.




                                              25

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory


The government displayed strong ownership of the operation (being on the `driver's seat
on the design of the operation, with Bank providing advice and technical expertise). The
strong analytical work, broad consultation and legislative process carried out by
government created the necessary consensus on the needed financial sector reforms, thus
paving the way for the DPL in the wake of elections. Importantly, even though there was
no request for the second DPL, the government continued with reforms aligned with its
triggers.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

The commitment of the government was also reflected by the performance of SHCP
(Ministry of Finance), the implementing agency. The SHCP team's availability and
involvement through broad dialogue and active problem solving resulted in the
conditions for release being met prior to Board approval and implementation of reforms
that were triggers for the second envisioned operation, despite eventually not requesting
such support.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

The rating of satisfactory is justified, among others, on the borrower's strong ownership
and commitment in implementation on both dimensions.



6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)


Middle-income countries, like Mexico, pose a challenge that requires a more
effective Bank approach in delivering a flexible, high quality and cost-effective
menu of services. Although not unique to MICs, some lessons learned are of particular
importance for countries with similar characteristics to those of Mexico: (i) Country
ownership drives the partnership, while the quality of the underpinning technical analysis
is key to the relationship. Mexico's sophistication and good internal consultation process
imply a well defined client agenda, which can be backed by the provision of technical
expertise by the Bank, taking advantage strong cross country experience; (ii) Flexibility
with MICs implies ongoing dialogue and room for better responsiveness in planning and
execution. Irrespective of political economy considerations (that were important in this
operation's instrument choice), a broad reform programmatic approach can provide for
ongoing dialogue on a number of policy fronts and more flexibility in responding to
MICs changing needs and priorities.




                                              26

Additional lessons learned, with a more project specific focus include: (i) broad
reform based DPLs can benefit in terms of supervision cost by taking advantage of the
sector's overall dialogue and lending/ non lending program; (ii) intrinsic differences can
sometime explain the slow take up of capital markets for funding.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Mexican authorities have taken important regulatory steps toward efficiency,
transparency and soundness of the financial system in the recent years. The sound
macroeconomic environment enabled the implementation of these reforms aimed to
provide enhanced access of financial services to the population.

After the financial crisis in 1994-1995, the authorities addressed their efforts to enhance
the soundness of the banking system. After 2000, the banking system was considered
solid and with a capital adequacy ratios above international levels. The focus of the
authorities was then to provide enhanced access to the population of financial services
and, thus, achieve a greater economic growth and quality of life for the population.

On the securities side, the reforms to the Securities Market Law were aimed to increase
the access of firms to fund their operations via the securities market and strengthen
corporate governance standards. With these reforms, the Government took the steps to
enhance the entrance of new firms to the securities market through societary transition
vehicles.

These entities, from SAPI to SAB, target small to medium firms seeking financing,
complying with reduced corporate governance standards and disclosure requirements.

In line with these actions, the authorities will continue addressing it´s efforts to deepen
the financial services.
