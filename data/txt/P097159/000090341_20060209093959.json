financial crisis;\n            (b) fostering the sustainable growth of a financial system\n            and capital markets that address the needs of the productive\n            sector and increase overall competitiveness of the economy;\n            and (c) diversifying the range of savings and investment\n            instruments available to households. The second Development\n            Policy Loan will support the completion of implementation of\n            the reform agenda in the financial sector in these three\n            areas.
