                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the Project is to consolidate a decentralized and sustainable quality real property rights system that facilitates access for the Peruvian
                         population. This system will enhance the welfare of real property owners and facilitate access to economic opportunities.Even though the Project cannot
                         eliminate all forms/causes of informal tenure, it will reduce the negative impacts of informality and discourage further informality by consolidating the legal
                         security of property rights, completing conversion of informal tenure, and building capacity to address its causes through strategic partnerships of various
                         levels of Government and key stakeholders in the private sector and civil society. The proposed system will also provide support to the ongoing
                         decentralization program of GoP through the institutional strengthening of Participating Municipalities.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured on June 24, 2011. The modifications included: (i) changes in implementation arrangements following the decision of MEF to convert the Project

                         Coordination Unit (PCU) into an autonomous budget-holder unit; (ii) changes in component-specific costs; (iii) changes in disbursement arrangements to introduce a new
                         disbursement category, reallocation of Loan proceeds, and an increase in the disbursement percentage (up to 82% or 90% depending of the expenditure categories) which is
                         consistent with Peru's country financing parameters to provide adequate financing for selected activities; (iv) extension of the Closing Date by six months to June 30, 2012 to
                         complete critical Project activities and ensure satisfactory outcome at exit; (v) changes to selected indicators of the results framework to ensure closer alignment of the contribution of
                         Project-financed activities to the achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO); and (vi) revisions to the Project Annual Operating Plans (AOPs) and Procurement Plans
                         (PPs) as a result of the above changes.
