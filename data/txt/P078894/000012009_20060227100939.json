This system\n            will enhance the welfare of real property owners, and\n            facilitate access to economic opportunities. It will further\n            reduce the negative impacts of informality, ensuring the\n            legal security of property rights, completing conversion of\n            informal tenure, and building capacity to address its causes\n            through strategic partnerships at various levels of\n            Government, and key stakeholders in the private sector and\n            civil society. The comprehensive real property rights\n            policies component will strengthen the policy-making process\n            on property rights, ensuring stronger legal, regulatory and\n            institutional reforms, and, also ensure that further policy\n            reforms will lead to equitable, and sustainable\n            socio-economic outcomes. It will finance technical\n            assistance (TA) in knowledge management, and in the\n            preparation of sound legal and regulatory reform proposals,\n            in inter-institutional coordination in a decentralized\n            governance framework, access to affordable land, land use\n            planning for municipalities, and the linkages between real\n            property rights institutions and the financial, and housing\n            sectors. The second component, decentralized formalization\n            and cadastre services provision, will establish the cadastre\n            services in urban and peri-urban areas among the\n            participating municipalities, through TA provided to\n            COFOPRI, in adapting the needs of informal owners;\n            justifying the cost-benefit terms; and, providing\n            capacity-building for provincial and district\n            municipalities. The modern, real property registry systems\n            component will support the integration of real property\n            data, and the establishment of the national cadastre system,\n            to improve the quality of, and access to real property\n            registry services. Communications and Information component\n            seeks to formalize benefits, by fostering real\n            property-related economic activity. Specifically, it will\n            provide information linkages between registration and access\n            to credit; reduce information gaps for credit providers;\n            identify measures to facilitate real property transactions;\n            and, develop strategic public-private partnerships to\n            promote business development. Finally, the fifth component\n            will support project management activities, namely,\n            monitoring and evaluation, project coordination, and the\n            assessment and accountability frameworks."}, "docdt": "2006-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
