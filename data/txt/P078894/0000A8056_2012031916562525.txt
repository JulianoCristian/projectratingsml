                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the Project is to consolidate a decentralized and sustainable quality real property rights system that facilitates access for the Peruvian population.
                         This system will enhance the welfare of real property owners and facilitate access to economic opportunities.Even though the Project cannot eliminate all forms/causes
                         of informal tenure, it will reduce the negative impacts of informality and discourage further informality by consolidating the legal security of property rights, completing
                         conversion of informal tenure, and building capacity to address its causes through strategic partnerships of various levels of Government and key stakeholders in the
                         private sector and civil society. The proposed system will also provide support to the ongoing decentralization program of GoP through the institutional strengthening
                         of Participating Municipalities.
