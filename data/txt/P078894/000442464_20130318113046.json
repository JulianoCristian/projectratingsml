Property Rights\n            Consolidation Project for Peru were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned include: project designs should include all\n            of the elements necessary to meet the development objectives\n            or otherwise estimate operational risks accordingly. Future\n            operations should contemplate the sustainability of\n            partnerships that can be strained by high turnover in the\n            leadership of a partner institution, and if finally\n            included, assess the risks associated with that\n            interdependence. Projects involving Information and\n            Communications Technology (ICT) activities should require\n            that all parties commit to robust standardized protocols\n            beforehand. The project failed to identify how a zero error\n            clause included in the contract has impeded the satisfactory\n            delivery of consulting products for an activity of such a\n            grand scale. Implementing a project with multiple executing\n            units should require additional agreements on project\n            governance structures. It is difficult to promote inter- and\n            intra-institutional communication if the coordination risks\n            have not been tackled through appropriate agreements on\n            project governance structures. Projects involving a high\n            number of hiring's should include some safeguards in\n            connection with the due diligence standards for hiring processes."}, "docdt": "2013-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
