                        RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
1.     This document proposes changes in the implementation arrangements, cost
estimates, expenditure allocations, closing date and results framework of the Real Property
Rights Consolidation Project (the Project) and the corresponding amendment to the Loan
Agreement between the Republic of Peru (the Borrower) and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated November 3, 2006, as amended to date
(the Loan Agreement). These changes have been requested by the Ministry of Economy
and Finance of the Borrower (MEF) as a result of a detailed Project review conducted in
conjunction with the Agency for the Formalization of Informal Property (COFOPRI) and
the Superintendency of National Public Registries (SUNARP).

2.        The proposed changes aim at consolidating Project achievements and ensuring
Project sustainability after closing. The proposed modifications include: (i) changes in
implementation arrangements following the decision of MEF to convert the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) into an autonomous budget-holder unit; (ii) changes in
component-specific costs; (iii) changes in disbursement arrangements to introduce a new
disbursement category, reallocation of Loan proceeds, and an increase in the disbursement
percentage (up to 82% of the expenditure categories) which is consistent with Peru’s
country financing parameters to provide adequate financing for selected activities; (iv)
extension of the Closing Date by six months to June 30, 2012 to complete critical Project
activities and ensure satisfactory outcome at exit; (v) changes to selected indicators of the
results framework to ensure closer alignment of the contribution of Project-financed
activities to the achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO); and (vi)
revisions to the Project Annual Operating Plans (AOPs) and Procurement Plans (PPs) as a
result of the above changes.

3.      The PDO and the description of components, subcomponents and activities remain
unchanged. The results framework is revised only to drop or modify some output and result
indicators.


PROJECT STATUS
4.      The Project was approved by the Board of Directors in March 14, 2006 and the
Loan Agreement was signed in November 3, 2006. It was amended on November 20,
2006, to reflect a reduction in the commitment fee payable by the Borrower, and on
December 19, 2007, to: (i) modify the role of COFOPRI in connection with Part B of the
Project; (ii) modify the role of Provincial Municipalities in connection with Parts B.1 and
B.2 of the Project; (iii) modify the composition of the Steering Committee; (iv) extend the
definition of Operating Costs under the Project; and (v) modify the description of Parts B.1
and B.2 of the Project, as to reflect the new role of COFOPRI. The Loan Agreement was

                                             4
further amended on November 4, 2010 to allow the use of electronic means for delivering
applications for withdrawals and supporting documentation.

5.      The Project was originally designed for an implementation period of 5 years from
January 2007 to December 2011. However, due to the lack of a PCU team throughout most
of 2007, and the need to process an amendment to the Loan Agreement to reflect the impact
of the legislative decisions that devolved formalization and cadastre powers to COFOPRI
(December 2007), full-fledged implementation only started in January 2008.

6.      In spite of some delays and implementation issues, the Project has been performing
satisfactorily for most of the last four-year period. To date, with 68% of the IBRD loan
disbursed, key outcomes include the establishment and operationalization of a multi-
sectoral commission, average cost of titling kept below US$100, about 416,000 properties
cadastred and 45 district municipalities trained on cadastre services. By component, the
following have been achieved:

        (a)     Comprehensive Real Property Rights Policies Component. This component
has: (i) strengthened the policy-making process on property rights in Peru to preserve the
achievements of the legal, regulatory and institutional reforms pursued under the previous
Urban Property Rights Project (UPRP); and (ii) ensured that further policy reforms will
lead to equitable and sustainable socio-economic outcomes. It has financed the technical
assistance required to facilitate real property rights knowledge management, and to prepare
sound legal and regulatory reform proposals. Topical areas have included inter-institutional
coordination in a decentralized governance framework, access to affordable land, land use
planning for municipalities, and the linkages between real property rights institutions and
the financial and housing sectors.

        (b)     Decentralized Formalization and Cadastre Services Provision Component.
This component has provided formalization and cadastre services in urban and peri-urban
areas, through activities: (i) adapted to the diverse needs of informal owners; (ii) justified in
cost-benefit terms; and (iii) involving capacity-building for Provincial and District
Municipalities. The Project has continued promoting administrative simplification to
recognize and protect property rights to ensure that formal rules interact with social reality
and reduce transaction costs for the Government of Peru (GoP) to avoid reversion to
informality. It has financed titling and cadastre activities, capacity-building and technical
assistance for local governments on formalization and cadastre services.

        (c)    Registry Services Provision Component. This component has supported the
integration of real property data and the establishment of the national cadastre system in
SUNARP’s Property Registry (RP) to improve: (i) the quality of real property registry
services; and (ii) access for the Peruvian population. It has financed the adoption by
SUNARP of a real property registry information system and geo-referencing activities by
the National Geographic Institute (IGN).

        (d)    Formalization Benefits Dissemination Component. This component has
supported the economic utilization of formal property rights and fostered real property–
related economic activity in selected areas. It has financed activities aimed at: (i) providing
practical information on the linkage between registration and access to credit as a tool for
                                               5
individual empowerment; (ii) reducing information gaps between formalized owners, and
credit providers; (iii) understanding real estate markets in marginal areas in order to
identify measures to encourage and facilitate real property transactions; and (iv) developing
strategic alliances among the public and private sectors to promote business development
and property respect in Project areas.


PROPOSED CHANGES
Results Framework/Indicators

7.      The restructuring proposes changes to the Project’s results framework and
indicators. These changes aim at aligning more closely the contribution of individual
Project activities with the achievement of the PDO. We are reducing the number of results
indicators choosing only the ones that are most relevant in measuring the Project’s desired
outcomes. The revised indicators are described in detail in the table in Annex 1.

Institutional arrangements

8.      The composition of the Steering Committee will be updated by replacing MINJUS
(Ministry of Justice) by VIVIENDA (Ministry of Housing). The definition of COFOPRI
will also be updated to reflect the latest legal provisions.

9.      The restructuring will reflect MEF’s decision to establish an “Executing Unit 002 –
Real Property Rights Consolidation Project,” as of January 2011 under COFOPRI’s
structure aimed at improving service delivery to the target populations. This new
arrangement has important practical implications for the more effective execution of the
Project, in particular a change in the capacity of the existent PCU, as autonomous budget
holder, which should facilitate the procurement and financial management processes, as
well as the internal coordination within COFOPRI. The definition of the PCU in the Loan
Agreement will be amended accordingly. Because it is the same PCU, there was no need
for a new assessment of implementation capacity. Recent evaluations of financial
management and procurement capacity during supervision missions have been satisfactory.
Since its inception, the PCU has operated under the provisions of the Loan Agreement
No.7368-PE.

Financing

10.    Project and Component Costs. The proposed restructuring will reflect a change in
individual component costs. In particular, the total cost of implementing Components 1, 3
and 4 will be reduced while the total cost of Component 2 will be increased to support the
completion of COFOPRI’s titling activities in selected areas where substantial demand for
formalization and cadastre services have been detected. The geographic scope of the project
has been modified accordingly in the Annual Operating Plan and the Government has taken
over responsibilities for some activities/areas with its own resources. Table No.1
summarizes the changes in the costs per component.

11.     Establishment of a new Expenditure Category - “Non-Consultant Services.” The
activities included in the property registry information management system of Component
3 are critical for the achievement of the PDO but were delayed because the definition of the
new property registration model took more time than originally expected.

12.    While determining the appropriate disbursement and procurement procedures, it
was found that not all the services required for the transfer of the property records to the
new registration model meet the standards of “consultants’ services,” as these services are
more mechanical and repetitive than intellectual and analytical. As a consequence, the Bank
procurement and financial management specialists agreed to establish a new expenditure
category for “Non-Consultants’ Services,” to finance the services required for the migration
of property registry records to the new registration model developed under the Project.

13.    In order to expedite the migration of 5.8 million property registry records and
ensure the completion of this activity critical for the consolidation of the property rights
system in Peru, this activity will be carried out through two separate procurement
processes: Migration by Lots – Batch Processing through Quality and Cost-Based Selection
(QCBS) and Digitalizaton of Records through International Competitive Bidding (ICB).

 Reallocation

 14.    The proposed restructuring will require reallocations of the proceeds of the Loan
 across categories of expenditure as presented in detail in the table in Table No.2. The
 revised PP has shifted US$1 million from Components 1, 3 and 4, to Component 2 in order
 to adequately finance formalization services demand previously identified and complete
 COFOPRI’s titling component taking into account the adjustment to the geographical scope
 of the Project. The new disbursement percentages take into account Country Financing
 Parameters and applicable tax rates for goods or services. The disbursement percentage for
 all expenditure categories will be increased from 65% to 82%. The project costs per
 component (as per Table No.1) have been duly revised to reflect the overall increase in
 disbursement percentages.

 15.    Proceeds for Peru, REAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CONSOLIDATION PROJECT,
        Loan No.7368-PE, P078894 will be reallocated as follow:

Closing date

16.     The restructuring proposes an extension of the closing date for six months, from
December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012. This is the first extension of the Closing Date. This
extension will enable the completion of critical Project activities under Components 3 and
4, and thereby ensure the achievement of the desired project outcomes. The Task Team has
confirmed that this request meets the Bank’s internal policy requirements for Closing Date
extensions because: (a) the Project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the
performance of the implementing agencies (COFOPRI and SUNARP) is satisfactory; (c)
the Borrower and the Bank have agreed in writing to a specific action plan and schedule to
complete the project.

Fiduciary Arrangements

17.     The fiduciary arrangements as well as the fiduciary risks remain unchanged and
therefore no changes to the Disbursement Letter are required. However, the PP has been
revised to account for the changes proposed in this restructuring paper.

Implementation schedules

18.    Following the restructuring process, a detailed AOP and PP have been agreed with
the GoP to facilitate satisfactory and timely completion of the restructured project.


D.      APPRAISAL SUMMARY
19.     The proposed restructuring does neither change the Project scope nor technical
analyses. Likewise, it does not raise new social or environmental issues or trigger new
risks or exceptions to Bank policies. The change in implementation arrangements has been
appraised and found acceptable to the Bank. The adjusted project costs per component and
disbursement percentages do not significantly alter the project's economic and financial
analysis. The project is also expected to integrate a higher number of real property cadastre
units and registry records.

Project Development Objective (PDO):
The main objective of the Project is to consolidate a decentralized and sustainable quality real property rights system that facilitates access for the Peruvian population. This system will
enhance the welfare of real property owners and facilitate access to economic opportunities. Even though the Project cannot eliminate all forms/causes of informal tenure, it will reduce the
negative impacts of informality and discourage further informality by consolidating the legal security of property rights, completing conversion of informal tenure, and building capacity to
address its causes through strategic partnerships of various levels of Government and key stakeholders in the private sector and civil society. The proposed system will also provide
support to the ongoing decentralization program of GoP through the institutional strengthening of Participating Municipalities.

Project Development Objective (PDO):
The main objective of the Project is to consolidate a decentralized and sustainable quality real property rights system that facilitates access for the Peruvian population. This system will
enhance the welfare of real property owners and facilitate access to economic opportunities. Even though the Project cannot eliminate all forms/causes of informal tenure, it will reduce the
negative impacts of informality and discourage further informality by consolidating the legal security of property rights, completing conversion of informal tenure, and building capacity to
address its causes through strategic partnerships of various levels of Government and key stakeholders in the private sector and civil society. The proposed system will also provide
support to the ongoing decentralization program of GoP through the institutional strengthening of Participating Municipalities.
