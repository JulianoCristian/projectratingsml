7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The main objective of the Project is to consolidate a decentralized and sustainable quality real property
rights system that facilitates access for the Peruvian population. This system will enhance the welfare of
real property owners and facilitate access to economic opportunities.Even though the Project cannot
eliminate all forms/causes of informal tenure, it will reduce the negative impacts of informality and
discourage further informality by consolidating the legal security of property rights, completing conversion
of informal tenure, and building capacity to address its causes through strategic partnerships of various
levels of Government and key stakeholders in the private sector and civil society. The proposed system
will also provide support to the ongoing decentralization program of GoP through the institutional
strengthening of Participating Municipalities.
