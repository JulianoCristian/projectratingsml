                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the Project is to consolidate a decentralized and sustainable quality real property rights system that facilitates access for the Peruvian
                         population. This system will enhance the welfare of real property owners and facilitate access to economic opportunities.Even though the Project cannot
                         eliminate all forms/causes of informal tenure, it will reduce the negative impacts of informality and discourage further informality by consolidating the legal
                         security of property rights, completing conversion of informal tenure, and building capacity to address its causes through strategic partnerships of various
                         levels of Government and key stakeholders in the private sector and civil society. The proposed system will also provide support to the ongoing
                         decentralization program of GoP through the institutional strengthening of Participating Municipalities.
