living in smaller\n            municipalities and rural areas (i.e. all areas outside the\n            two main cities of  Brazzaville and Pointe Noire). The\n            program comprises four components: (i) Financing of priority\n            local investments; (ii) Support to community organizations\n            (iii) Capacity enhancement for central and local\n            governments; and (iv) Balance of payments support. The\n            Project is  expected to assist Congo's stabilization\n            and recovery process by: (i) contributing to improving\n            living conditions in areas which to date have received\n            limited external support and where poverty is  acute; (ii)\n            helping strengthen civil society in rural areas and small\n            towns; (iii) facilitating the decentralization process and\n            the effective provision of basic social services outside\n            Brazzaville and Pointe Noire; and (iv) helping maintain the\n            pace of economic reforms. The main risks are the possibility\n            of renewed violence in some areas, difficulties on the path\n            to reform, and a compromised administrative capacity for implementation."}, "docdt": "2003-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
