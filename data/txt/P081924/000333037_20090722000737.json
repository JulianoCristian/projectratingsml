Recovery and\n            Community Support Project for Republic of Congo were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            project implemented in a weak institutional environment\n            needs a powerful champion in the administrative and\n            political apparatus if far reaching reforms addressing\n            multi-sectoral needs have to be implemented. There was a\n            window of opportunity at the end of the conflicts for\n            launching some critical reforms, and the project\n            successfully laid the groundwork for a number of\n            improvements to the institutional environment. However, the\n            Project Coordination and Implementation Unit (PCIU) did not\n            have the means to facilitate the dialogue and complete the\n            reform process. An inter-ministerial committee regrouping\n            all the involved ministries, and presided by e.g. the Prime\n            Minister, could have advanced adoption of the reforms and\n            their implementation. The delays in implementing\n            decentralization reforms also show that reforms should be\n            implemented incrementally and in well defined phases. The\n            post-conflict environment can be used to create conditions\n            for inclusiveness and build a solid base for private sector\n            participation in the reconstruction efforts and for\n            launching reforms. Gradual mainstreaming of project\n            activities into initially weak sector ministries is\n            necessary to assure sustainability."}, "docdt": "2009-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
