However, some outcomes were only partially\n            achieved, particularly there is a question over political\n            commitment - as evidenced by the failure to carry through on\n            intentions in resource allocation, and by breakdown of the\n            training management system. Moreover, staff trained may not\n            be available or willing to work as expected given the low\n            pay and poor working conditions in the civil service.\n            Lessons learned from this project include: Complexity is a\n            relative concept that can change as project agencies acquire\n            skills. National ownership is vital in a capacity building\n            project, but such a project can also build ownership.\n            Institutional development is a longer term challenge than\n            capacity building. Every means possible should be sought to\n            ensure national ownership and control of technical\n            assistance. Close supervision of capacity building projects\n            brings results. Crisis can produce beneficial change, if a\n            flexible approach can be taken. With regard to Yemen, civil\n            service is unlikely to be high yielding under existing\n            incentive framework. The budget problem has yet to be resolved."}, "docdt": "2001-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
