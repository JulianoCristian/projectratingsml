Beneficiarr:        National Electricity Authority (PLN)
Amount:              $226.0 million equivalent.
Terms:               Repayable in 20 years including 5 years grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:    The proceeds of the loan will be onlent from the
Government of Indonesia (GOI) to PLN for 20 years includ-
ing a grace period of 5 years; the onlending rate will be
equal to the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus
no less than a quarter percent for administration
charges. The Governmnent will bear the foreign exchange
risk.
Project
Description:      The proposed project would support government objectives
to promote productive activities and to improve the
welfare of the population through the provision of
electric power, and also to improve the economic and
technical efficiency of energy supply and uce. In
particular, the proposed project would: (a) expand
transmission and substation facilities in Java to
efficiently utilize the planned addition to generating
capacity during the period from 1986/87 to 1990/91; (b)
extend distribution facilities in the Jakarta, Tangerang,
Bogor and Bekasi areas to supply electricity to
industries, commercial consumers and about 250,000 new
residential consumers in urban and rural areas; (c) expand
PLN's center for testing and certifying indigenous
products and for researching utility-oriented problems;
(d) provide consulting services to (i) assist PLN's
Engineering Services Center; (ii) continue the detailed
engineering of a coal-fired thermal power plant at Paiton
in East Java; and (iii) define and implement measures to
improve PLN's operating efficiency.
Risk:                The principal risk relates to possible delays in
implementing the transmission and substations component of
the project because of difficulties in land acquisition.
Advance action has been initiated by PLN to help prevent
such delays.

INDONESIA
POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
I.  THE ENERGY SECTOR AND ELECTRICITY SUBSECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Oil.  Indonesia is richly endowed with energy resources including
oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal energy. Oil and natural gas
now account for almost all of total commercial energy consumption. While
undiscovered oil reserves are estimated at 10-40 billion barrels, proven
resources are 9.5 billion barrels. Though the production capability is about
1.9 million barrels per day, the current production leveL is about 1.3 million
barrels per day, due to OPEC production quotas.
1.02      Natural Gas.  The estimated proven remapling natural gas reserve as
of January 1984 was about 80 trillion cu ft (TCF)P  of which 90% is non-asso-
ciated and can be developed independently of oil. However, major reserves are
generally located away from population and industrial centers. The Arun field
in North Sumatra has 14 TCF and Natuma in the South China Sea, 41 TCF. About
5.0 TCF of reserves are proven offshore Java of which about 2.6 TCF are in the
East and 2.3 TCF are in the West.   Production of natural gas reached 1,580
billion cu ft in 1985. Half of this was exported as liquidifed natural gas
(LNG) to Iapan from Arun and Badak.  LNG production was about 15 million tons
in 1985.-   Gas pipelines have been laid to domestic steel and fertilizer
factories and domestic consumption is expected to increase by about 8.0% per
year.
1.03      Coal.  Indonesia's coal reserves are believed to be as high as 20
billion tons, mostly located in West and South Sumatra and Kalimantan. While
production is currently about 530,000 tons per year, major increases are
planned by GOI. Work started early in 1982 on a 3.0 million ton per year mine
at Bukit Asam and on a 0.6 million ton per year mine at the nearby Muara Tiga
coal field. Proven reserves in this area are over 400 million tons. A
program to raise the coal production at Ombilin in West Sumatra to 1.3 million
tons per year mainly for export, is also being implemented by GOI. In addi-
tion, in 1981, GOI entered into a number of production-sharing agreements with
private foreign and Indonesian joint-venture companies for the exploration and
exploitation of coal reserves in Kalimantan. Coal reserves defined by these
contractors and expected to be economically recoverable, amount to about
1.0 billion tons. The South Sumatra and Kalimantan coal has a potential for
sustaining a large program of coal fired power generation in the country.
1/   1 TCF of gas = 24.7 million tons of oil equivalent.
2/   1 ton of LNG = 1.2 tons of oil equivalent.



- 2 -
1.04      Hydropower.  Indonesia's total hydroelectric resources are large but
development is limited by their geographic distribution relative to demand.
The greatest potential (over 35%) lies in Irian Jaya where the demand is less
than one percent of total domestic demand, while Java, which accounts for 80%
of current consumption, has less than 10% of the total potential. Existing
hydroelectric installations aggregate to 2,028 MW; they are located in Java
(1,235 MK), Sumatra (612 MW), and Sulawesi (181 MW). Schemes with an aggre-
gate capacity of about 1,000 MW are currently under construction. The
National Electricity Authority (PLN), assisted by Nippon Koei of Japan, has
carried out a systematic countrywide resource survey using funds from IBRD
Loan 1365-IND, that has produced an inventory of hydroelectric sites.  The
survey is being followed up with various prefeasibility and feasibility
studies of the promising hydroelectric sites; prefeasibility studies of 21
such hydro schemes were financed under Loan 1365-IND. In addition,
prefeasibility studies for 20 sites and feasibility studies for 6 sites are
being financed under Loan 2300-IND.
1.05      Geothermal.  Surface manifestations of geothermal energy are found
on all islands except Kalimantan, but only a few sites have been investigated
and only one, Kamojang in West Java, has been developed. It is believed that
potential  eserves may approach 10,000 MW, distributed as follows:  Java 5,500
MW; Sulawesi 1,400 MW; Sumatra 1,100 MW; other islands 2,000 MW. GOI, in
collaboration with the Government of New Zealand, initiated development of the
Kamojang field in 1976. The first 30 MW generating set was commissioned for
commercial operation in January 1983; the Twelfth Power Project (Loan
2214-IND) provides for the expansion of the station by 110 MW. Further
development potential exists in Kamojang. In 1982, PERTAMINA (The National
Oil and Gas Company) entered into a joint operation contract with Union Geo-
thermal, a subsidiary of Union Oil of California, for development of the Salak
field in West Java. A potential of 100-200 MW has been proven by explora-
tions. Also, PERTAMINA has explored geothermal fields in the Dieng and Drajat
areas in Java. The economic viability of developing these fields is under
study.
Institutions in the Energy Sector
1.06      The principal agency responsible for implementing government
policies in the energy sector is the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). MME
was established in 1978 to coordinate all activities in the energy sector and
control tie three state enterprises responsible for the execution of
government policies in the energy subsectors; PERTAMINA for oil and gas, P.N.
BATUBARA for coal and PLN for electricity. Other ministries and agencies are
also involved in the sector; for example, the Ministry of Public Works primar-
ily deals with hydropower resource surveys, the Ministry of Agriculture
oversees forestry products, and the National Atomic Energy Commission is
responsible for nuclear development. In order to ensure appropriate
coordination of energy policy, an inter-ministerial National Energy Board
(BAKOREN) to oversee sectoral development was established. BAKOREN is
supported by a technical committee (PTE) consisting of senior officials in
different departments, chaired by the Directoe General of Electric Power and
New Energy (DGEP).



-3-
The Electricity Subsector
1.07      The electricity subsector is regulated by MME through the Director
General of Electric Power and New Energy (&GEP). The subsector comprises:
(a) PLN, the National Electricity Authority; (b) captive plants installed by
private parties for their own use; (c) some small municipal franchises; and
(d) a small number of cooperatives which were set up to provide electricity in
certain rural areas remote from PLN supply systems. An electricity act was
passed in 1985 (Law No. 15), consolidating earlier decrees, which permits
private and cooperative franchise participation in the electricity
subsector. The DGEP is the chairman of the supervisory board which oversees
PLN's operations and reviews PLN's investment plans, budgets and tariffs.
PLN's Organization
1.08      PLN was established as a public corporation (Perum) under
Presidential Decree No. 18 of 1972, with responsibility for the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity and the planning, construction
and operation of electricity supply facilities. PLN is managed by a board of
directors headed by a President Director, who is appointed by the President
and is accountable to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The President
Director has authority for all day-to-day operations of PLN. The board
currently includes five other directors with functional responsibility,
respectively, for planning, construction, opetations, finance and adminis-
tration. Operational responsibility devolves to 17 regions, and responsi-
bility for major construction to 14 project managers. Also reporting to the
board are several staff units responsible for power research, education and
training, management services, an internal audit unit called the Corporation
Inspectorate, and the Java system operation and control unit. An engineering
services unit was added in 1985 (para. 3.08).
PLN's Facilities
1.09      PLN is the dominant entity in the electricity subsector.  In
1985/86, it had 5,240 MW of installed generationg capacity--1,680 MW of steam
(oil fired), 800 MW of steam (coal fired), 930 MW of gas turbines, 740 MW of
diesel, 1,060 MW of hydroelectric and 30 MW of geothermal (para. 2.06). PLN
also operates over 11,600 km of transmission lines at 70, 150 and 500 kV and
about 86,000 km of distribution lines.
Sector Development Issues, Objectives and Strategy
1.10      Since oil has been Indonesia's major export commodity, the major
thrust of the Government's energy policy is to maintain the level of export
earnings by diversification of domestic consumption away from oil to alterna-
tive and more economic resources such as coal, hydropower, geothermal and
gas. The Government's strategy is to use the electricity sector as the prin-
cipal agent for the implementation of this policy. The other major objectives
of the sector are to increase the welfare of the population through an
increase in the proportion of electrified households-from the current low
level of about 14% to a level of about 40% over the next 10 years and to
support economic development through the supply of electricity to productive



- 4 -
users in urban and rural areas. The extension of electricity supply will also
contribute to the objective of reducing oil consumption through substitution
of kerosene and diesel oil in applications where electricity is more economi-
cal. Currently, PLN has forinuLated a 10-year investment program amounting to
about US$15 billion equivalent to achieve these objectives (para. 2.07).
Captive Generation
1.11      Due to nonavailability of electricity supply from the grid, a large
number of industriaL and commercial establishments produce electricity for
their own use. The growth of this "captive" power was very rapid in the
1970s, and their installed capacity is comparable to the generating capacity
of PLN. S';;ce the captive power generation is largely diesel based and
generally more expensive than PLN's supply, it is the policy of the Covernment
to favor the replacement of uneconomic captive generation by PLN's supply as
rapidly as this can be extended to reach them and to license new captive
plants only when they are more economic or where PLN cannot supply.
Pricing
1.12      Following the increases in international oil prices in the 1970s,
petroleum products in Indonesia were highly subsidized. However, the Govern-
ment has moved rapidly to remove the subsidies in the past four years. After
a total increase of about 225Z since December 1981, the weighted average of
domestic prices of petroleum fuels in September 1986 was slightly above the
average international price, although the kerosene price remained at about 75%
of the international level (Annex 17, Table 2). Electricity prices have been
increased by about 130Z since 1981, resulting in the current average price of
about 96.0 Rp/kWh, which was equivalent to USO8.5/kWh prior to the devaluationa
in September 1986 but amounts to USC5.8/kWh after devaluation. Mainly because
of the devaluation, adjustments will be needed to fully reflect the long run
marginal cost of supply both in the level and structure of the current
tariff. The proposed project would address this need (para. 5.16).
Institutions and Manpower
1.13      Weak institutions and scarcity of trained manpower continue to
constrain rapid and efficient implementation of the energy strategy in spite
of the progress that has been achieved. In the electricity sector, PLN has
made considerable progress not only in achieving a rapid expansion (its sales
grew by over 300Z in the ten year period 1974/75 to 1984/85), but also in
gearing up for implementing an even greater program in the future. The Fourth
Five-Year plan (1984/85 to 1988/89) had set a target of increasing PLN's sales
by 150% from about 10,000 GWh in 1983/84 to about 25,000 GWh in 1988/89.
These targets have since been scaled down in view of the deteriorating
economic environment and financial constrants; the sales target for 1988/89
being about 19,000 CWh. To meet even this reduced goal, PLN needs to
implement and operate projects and systems of growing size and increasing
technical and managerial complexity. PLN also needs to continuously enhance
and improve its capabilities in all areas of management to manage such rapid
growth. Special emphasis on project management, engineering, finance and
accounts, and manpower development is needed. Also, a great deal of effort to



- 5 -
improve PLI's ability to efficiently operate and maintain the increasingly
complex facilities currently under installation and planned for the future
will be needed.
Import Substitution
1.14      The electricity industry is capital intensive with high import
requirements. About 60Z of PLN's total proposed investment in the ten year
period 1984/85 to 1993/94 is expected to be in foreign exchange, amounting to
over USS10 billion. The Government has placed great emphasis on the reduction
in the import content of the program by promoting, inter alia, increased use
of local consultants for engineering and the progressive manufacture of
selected equipment within the country. The implications of this policy for
PLN are twofold.  One, a need to have stronger engineering capability within
PLN to supervise and guide the work of consultants and two, a need to develop
its Testing and Research Center to undertake a program of product testing,
quality control and guidance to local manufacturers, for the products for
which it is a dominant purchaser (para. 4.18).
Bank Role and Strategy
1.15      The Bank has been actively involved in the development and implemen-
tation of most of the sectoral objectives described above. In 1981, the Bank
carried out a study of the energy sector issues and prepared a report entitled
"Indonesia: Issues and Options in the Energy Sector". The report confirmed
that alternatives for oil must be developed quickly for electricity generation
and recommended that this strategy should be extended to other sectors such as
industry, transportation and households. It emphasized the need for efficient
pricing, stronger institutions and manpower development as major objectives.
Following up on the ongoing dialogue with the Covernment on the pricing of
energy products, the Bank prepared a study entitled "Indonesia: Selected
Issues of Energy Pricing Policy" in 1983. Actions of the Covernment on the
pricing of petroleum products and electricity in the past three years have now
eliminated net subsidies. In October 1984, the Bank carried out a detailed
review of PLN's investment program for the ten-year period 1984/85 to
1993/94. The findings supported the general direction of the plans but sug-
gested a scaling down of the programs and some measures for improving the
investment efficiency. These findings, which were accepted by the Covernment,
were presented in the Bank report "Indonesia Power Sector Investment Review"
in 1985. Also, a Bank mission studied the possible improvements in the
efficiency of operation of thermal and hydro plants and maintenance of diesel
plants and presented its findings in a report, entitled "Indonesia: Power
Generation Efficiency Study" in 1986. The Government and PLN have accepted
the recommendations of these reports. In addition, the Bank reviewed the
rural electrification program in Indonesia and presented its findings in a
report in November 1986, entitled "Indonesia: Rural Electrification
Review." An Energy Options Study is currently being carried out which will
assist the Covernment in formulating a strategy for the development and use of
primary fuels.
1.16      The Bank is also providing considerable technical assistance for
institutional development in the energy sector. A number of assistance



-6-
efforts have been devised for PLN in such important areas as project manage-
ment, planning, power market survey, hydro survey, accounting, manpower
development and training, and are financed with Bank funds. Furthermore, in
the coal subsector, various steps are being initiated for institutional and
manoower development under two Bank-assisted projects: the Bukit Asam Coal
Mining Development and Transportation Project (Loan 2079-IND) and the Coal
Exploration Engineering Project (Loan 2153-IND). In the p,as subsector, a
study on liquified petroleum gas (LPG) was financed under Credit 898-IND and
an energy pricing study is being financed under a Bank loan for the Gas
Distribution Project (Loan 2690-IND).
1.17      The Bank's involvement with the electricity subsector in Indonesia
has gone through two distinct phases and has now entered the third and most
crucial phase. In the first phase (1968-1977), the Bank's work was directed
toward creating an autonomous nat-onai entity to deal with the sectoral
problems and after PLN's creation in 1972, to help put in place procedures and
systems to manage and improve its then small-scale operations. In the second
phase (1978-83), the primary thrust of the Bank's work has been to enable PLN
to undertake rapid expansion of its supply facilities (sales increased 122% in
the period) and, coupled with efforts to evolve integrated grids (particularly
in Java), to take full advantage of advanced technologies to reduce supply
costs. The fruits of this effort will be reaped in the period 1985-89 with
the commissioning of large power plants at Suralaya (1,600 MW), Saguling (700
MW), and Cirata (500 MW) with an overlay of a 500 kV transmission grid. The
costs of electricity supply will significantly drop in real terms in these
years. The current phase of the Bank's involvement is focused partly on
contributing to the financing of Indonesia's massive power programs to meet
its development needs, and more so, to build on the foundations laid in the
second phase to transform PLN into a modern and mature utility like others in
the region through a major emphasis on institutional objectives. These
include greater financial autonomy, better operating efficiencies, and
improved engineering and research capabilities. The proposed project
addresses these concerns and provides technical assistance, inter alia, for
the efficiency improvement measures. Suitable efficiency improvement measures
have been agreed with PLN. Action plans have been formulated and their
implementation would be monitored.
Bank's Earlier Operations and PLN's Performance
1.18      Since 1969, the Bank Group has provided US$2,083 million for power
generation, transmission and distribution facilities through fourteen separate
projects. Four distribution projects (Credits 165-IND and 334-IND, and Loans
1259-IND and 2056-IND) rehabilitated and expanded the distribution facilities
in the greater Jakarta area. Ten power projects (Credit 399-IND and Loans
1127-IND, 1365-IND, 1513-IND, 1708-IND, 1872-IND, 1950-IND, 2214-IND, 2300-IND
and 2443-IND) assisted PLN to expand electricity generation capacity in Java,
to provide a strong all-Java 500 kV grid, to extend distribution facilities in
Java, to reduce system transmission and distribution losses and to introduce a
program of mini hydro development in Sumatra. Project Performance Audit
Reports on the first six projects (Credits 165-IND. 334-IND, 399-IND and Loans
1127-IND, 1259-IND, and 1365-IND) have been issued and the lessons learned
from these operations are being applied to subsequent operations. They relate



- 7 -
mainly to the need for timely appointment of consultants, and delays in
procurement and construction.
1.19      PLN's implementation capacity has grown substantially since the
Bank's early association with it. All Bank financed projects have been or are
being implemented as designed and have generally been within the estimated
cost. However, delays of the order of six months to two years in implementa-
tion have been experienced compared to the appraisal estimates. The growing
size and complexity of the projects, coupled with cumbersome procedures for
the appointment of consultants, award of contracts, opening of letters of
credit, and budget approvals, have been responsible for most of the delays.
Implementation schedules for Bank financed projects, however, have generally
been optimized to international standards with little slack to accommodate the
delays which can occur in a still-maturing utility like PLN. Moreover, steps
are being taken at the entity and national level to streamline budgeting and
procurement procedures.
II. THE POWER MARKET AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The Market
2.01      Principal sources of electricity supply in Indonesia are PLN and
self generation (captive) mainly by industries. Electricity consumption in
the country grew rapidly in the last decade from about 50 kWh to 150 kWh per
capita.
2.02      Captive generation, which accounted for over 50% of the market in
1974/75, and has continued to maintain at that level. There is evidence to
suggest that the share of captive generation may have increased during the
period 1982/83 to 1985/86, because of large installations such as Asaham,
Krakatau Steel, Cibinong Cement etc. which PLN was not able to supply.
Annex 1 shows the growth in PLN's supply facilities, and Annex 2 shows the
growth in captive p.ant in Indonesia.
2.03      In spite of the rapid growth, the level of consumption of electri-
city in Indonesia is low, at about 150 kWh per capita compared to a level of
about 550 kWh per capita in Egypt cr about 350/400 kWh per capita in Thailand
and Philippines. The level is even lower than that in India and Pakistan
which have much lower per capita GDP.
2.04      Low level of electricity consumption is primarily due to lack of
supply facilities and low access to the network for the residential and other
sectors. In 1985/86, only 14% of all households in Indonesia were electri-
fied. The electrification ratio was about 16% in Java and about 11% off Java.
Demand
2.05      It is clear from different studies that the potential demand for
electricity is still large and PLN's sales are supply constrained. There is a
potential for rapid growth in PLN's sales as supply capacity expands- This is
supported by the fact that, while PLN's sales in the period 1982-1985 grew by
about 12Z p.a., the growth in the electricity consumption in the country was



about twice as large, the additional growth mainly coming from the use of
private generation by industry. The addition to PLN's sales is contributed by
three factors, viz (a) extension of supply to new areas for residential and
other sectors; (b) gradual takeover of supply to industries currently using
their own diesel plant and (c) growth in consumption with GDP growth.
PLN's facilities
2.06      PLN's total installed capacity by end 1985/86 was 5,240 MW, out of
which 3,841 MW (73%) was in Java. Nearly 64Z of the capacity uses petroleum
fuels. Table 2.3 shows the breakdown of the generating capacity in Java and
Outside Java.

Development Program
2.07      In the latest review.i of PLN's investment program, PLN has
established the following target of sales and generating capacity for the year
1990/91:
1985/86 (Actual)                    1990/91

- 9 -
2.08      The above projections are considerably lower than those set at the
beginning of the Fourth Five Year Plan (Repelita IV) whi-ch commenced from
April 1, 1984, where sales targets for 1988/89 were about the same as the
current targets for 1990/91. The slow down in the sales growth in 1983/84 and
1984/85 was largely due to (a) sluggishness in economic growth; (b) resource
constraints for investments in supply facilities; and (c) delays in project
implementation. The resource constraint has particularly affected the shorter
lead time components ef the investment program viz. transmission and distribu-
tion projects. As r. result of the ongoing program of construction of generat-
ing plants, capacity addition of about 1,800 MW will take place in Java during
the three year per.od 1987 to 1989. Matching expansion of transmission, sub-
stations and distribution facilities is a high priority task to derive maximum
benefit from the investment program.
2.09      The investment program formulated by PLN is the least cost expansion
program for achieving the planned objectives. Annexes 3 and 4 give the
generation expansion plans for Java and outside Java for the period 1985/86 to
1993/94. Annexes 5 and 6 give the investment requirements for Indonesia and
Java respectively.
2.10      In order to ensure soundness of the development program, the Bank
has the following agreements with the GOI and PLN, which will be continued in
the proposed loan:
(a) PLN will prepare, review with the Bank and implement a customer
connection program each year;
(b) PLN and GOI will review annually with the Bank PLN's development
plan and investment budget to enable the Bank to express its views
on the priorities and the balance among the generation, transmission
and di6tribution investments; and
(c) The Gavernment will provide sufficient funds to finance PLN's
capital expenditures as reviewed and agreed with the Bank.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The borrower of the proposed loan would be the Government of
Indonesia (GOI) and the beneficiary would be PLN, the sole government-owned
national power utility in Indonesia. PLN's organization was described in
paras. 1.07 and 1.08. Annex 7 gives the organization charts for MME and PLN.
Institutional Development
3.02      Over the past years PLN has grown impressively from a department of
a ministry to become one of the largest utilities in the country. Since
1977/78, PLN has connected new consumers at an average annual rate of about
half a million per year, increasing from about 350,000 in 1978/79 to about
800,000 in 1985/86. Its sales increased at an average rate of about 17.4% for
the period 1977/78 to 1985/86, from about 3,500 GWh to 12,700 GWh. During



- 10 -
this period, performance indicators such as the number of consumers per
employee and the energy sold per employee improved (Annex 8).
3.03      During the next five years, PLN is expected to continue to grow
rapidly (para. 2.07). The rapid expansion of supply facilities require
increasingly complex technical and managerial tasks, for which PIN will need
to develop rapidly in several areas.
3.04      Areas which need strengthening have been recognized and technical
assistanc- is either already underway or planned, in many cases with the
support from the Bank. These programs are designed to support PLN's effort to
deal with problems, which can be grouped into the following major areas, viz.
(a) planning, (b) project formulation and management, (c) management
information systems, (d) efficiency improvements and (e) training.
(a) Planning
3.05      Through the years, PLN has gradually strengthened its technical
planning activities. Also, PLN set up a corporate planning unit in 1981 and a
market survey unit in 1982 with Government agreeing to provide necessary
policy guidelines and data to PLN for improving the quality of the survey
results. Both these units need to be strengthened in coming years.
Procedures for the formalization of the review and approval of the demand
forecasts were agreed under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND) and
instituted. The review of the investment program recently undertaken by the
Bank (para. 1.15) has identified further areas of improvement necessary which
are being followed up. Also, PLN prepares a rolling 10-year financial
forecast and financing plan based on its long-term investment program, but the
process has to be further refined.
3.06      In November 1984, for the first time PLN's Board issued a five-year
corporate plan defining corporate objectives for all areas of PLN's
function. Such an effort has to be further developed to convert the
objectives into specific action plans for different areas and units.
(b) Project Management
3.07      In order to improve the project implementation monitoring, under the
Eighth Power Project (Loan 1708-IND), the Bank financed a Project Management
Advisory Services (PMAS) assignment, which specifically addressed all aspects
of project management. The reporting system recommended by PMAS is imple-
mented for major projects to monitor the progress and to control the expendi-
tures. PLN has also set up a Central Project Services Group in the
Directorate of Construction to monitor the progress of major projects and
liaise with field organizations. These initiatives are being further
developed and consolidated.
3.08      It was agreed under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND)
that in the interest of integration of expertise and optimum use of scarce
skilled manpower, PLN should unify project formulation, engineering, design,
procurement, and construction monitoring under an Engineering Services Center
(PPE). A decree to establish the center was issued on May 10, 1985. Its head



- 11 -
has been selected and a decree for its staffing by the reorganization of the
existing Directorates of Planning and Construction, is expected to be issued
by the end of 1986. The proposed project provides for consulting services for
the development of the center (para. 4.21). This step will improve PLN's
ability to design and implement projects and reduce its dependance on
consultants.
(c) Management Information Systems
3.09      Currently, PLN is developing information systems in the following
areas, some of which are being developed with Bank financing: (i) operation;
(ii) project management (Eighth Power Project); (iii) finance and accounting
(Eleventh Power Project); and (iv) personnel and manpower development (Twelfth
Power Project). Steps are now being taken to evolve a general management
information system which will draw upon the subsystems. The local consulting
firm of PT Utama, assisted by the U.K. consultants, PA International are
currently carrying out this work and is being financed from the Thirteenth
Power Loan (2300-IND). In these efforts, local counterpart staff assignment
is emphasized in order to ensure the transfer of know-how and effective main-
tenance of the system by local staff once the systems are installed for
operation.
(d) Efficiency Improvement
3.10      To monitor the efficiency improvement performance in the regions,
PLN has introduced a system of targets and objectives for specific indicators
which include, among others, sales, system losses, consumers' connections,
billing collections, etc. The Bank has given, and will continue to give, full
support to these initiatives. During the appraisal of the proposed project,
sensitivity tests were performed to assess the financial implications of
efficiency improvements in PLN's operational and financial management
(Annex 9). These tests show that one of the most important areas of effi-
ciency improvement is the reduction in transmission and distribution losses,
which after a steadily reducing trend for several years, increased in 1983/84
(Annex 8). Loan 2214-IND provided funds for the study of the causes, their
seggregation, formulation of steps to monitor and correct the problems and
procurement of necessary equipment and materials. New Zealand consultants,
Beca-Worley International, are currently assisting PLN in these steps.
Intensive action has been initiated by PLN, based on these studies, to control
and reduce losses, as a result of which Losses reduced from 20.8% in 1983/84
to 19.6% in 1985/86. An action plan to control and further reduce the losses
has been prepared by PLN and reviewed by the Bank. PLN has agreed to the
implementation of this action plan in FY86/87 and thereafter. Also under the
present project, PLI'i has prepared and agreed to implement an action plan for
improving efficiency and reducing costs of its operations by use of gas
instead of oil at selected locations, improved maintenance of thermal plants,
fuel efficiency improvement, improved maintenance and rennovation of diesel
plants, rennovation of old hydrostations, etc. (para. 4.22).



- 12 -
(e) Training
3.11      As of Karch 31, 1986, PLU had about 51,OOO employees of whom about
39,000 are employed on the permanent payroll. PLN has no difficulty in
recruiting staff at levels up to technical high school, but less than 3% of
the staff have full university degrees. To address the manpower problems, PLN
established a separate department for education and training. This depart-
ment, known as Pusdiklat, plays an important supporting role and manages six
training centers with a staff of over 200, including about 50 trained instruc-
tors. PLN has also established a subdirectorate for manpower planning and
development.
3.12      The Bank has been supporting PLN's training activities and human
resources development efforts. Early IDA credits and Bank loans helped in
establishing five training centers. The Ninth Power Project (Loan 1872-IND)
provided for an advanced training school for training in the operation of
thermal power plants at Suralaya, with a facsimile digital training simulator
which has been completed. Under the Tenth Power Project (Loan 1950-IND) on
the-job training was arranged in the country with the help of consultants in
selected areas, e.g., civil works contract administration, power system
planning and operation, and power market surveys. The Twelfth Power Project
(Loan 2214-IND) includes a large training component to reorganize and enlarge
the entire manpower development, training and personnel management functions
for middle and lower level staff. It also provides for starting five more
training centers, improving job performance evaluation systems and introducing
in-house management training. Expatriate assistance involving about 30 man-
years is well under way, with the assistance of Pacific Engineers and
Construction Company of Taiwan, which will provide a framework for future
effort in this area.
3.13      Lack of trained staff is also a major constraint in PLN's accounting
areas. PLN has made an effort to recruit qualified and experienced accoun-
tants to fill more senior posts. PLN has a crash program of training in
accounting practices and procedures under an Asian Development Bank (ADB)
loan. The consultancy assignment to improve PLN's accounting and budgeting
systems, financed by the Bank under Loan 2056-IND, includes an intensive
training program for counterpart staff; this program is being implemented
successfully. PLN is also implementing a program for the training of senior
and middle level personnel in technical and financial areas, which is
supported from bilateral assistance as well as the Bank's Twelfth Power Loan
(2214-IND).
Accounting and Budgeting
3.14      PLN's present accounting system follows generally accepted prin-
ciples and normal utility practices. But this system, which was originally
installed in the early 1970s, needs redesigning and restructuring because it
has become increasingly ineffective due to the increased complexity and volume
of accounting transactions. As a state company, PLN's budgets are subjected
to review by a supervisory board and are approved by the Government. PLN's
internal procedures for budget preparation and monitoring actual expenditures
are not very effective. Coordination among various departmental units and



- 13 -
between regional offices is also weak. Under the Eleventh Power Project
(Loan 2056-IND), funds have been provided for consultancy services to assist
PLN in setting up a more appropriate accounting system, and to strengthen
procedures for budgetary control. The consultants (Pamintori in association
with Coopers & Lybrand, Australia) completed the assignment in late 1985. PLN
plans to implement the new systems under the next phase. The Bank will
continue its support in these areas. The new accounting system will also
cover a management information system utilizing computer facilities for
accounting and financial reporting. In addition, PLN is to carry out several
studies, supported by ADB financing. A study to improve PLN's inventory
control, which is currently being carried out by consultants, is expected to
be completed in December 1987. Another study to improve its property
accounting and cost accounting systems, and training of account staff is also
being initiated.
Billing and Collections
3.15      Bills are prepared on a monthly basis.  Computer billing is utilized
at the computer center at the headquarters in Jakarta. Collection performance
is generally satisfactory. The receivable position of general consumer
accounts has been kept at about one and one-half months of the yearly billing.
However, collections from some government users (including the Armed Forces
and local governments) have not been as prompt.
3.16      The Government has been aware of the unsatisfactory payment
performance of government users. In 1983, the MME issued instructions jointly
with the Ministries of Finance, Defense, and Home Affairs to expedite payments
by government users to PLN. Overdue government accounts receivables were
reduced from over one year in 1981/82 to about five months of billing in
1983/84. As a result of continued efforts by the concerned ministries and
PLN, the overdue government accounts receivables were further reduced to about
two months (62 days) of billing in 1985/86, and are currently Less than two
months (54 days) of billing. An existing covenant, which requires that
amounts owed to PLN by all government users in aggregate will not be overdue
by more than two months of total yearly billings for such users, will continue
under the proposed loan.
Audit and InternaL Control
3.17      PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by
Government auditors. The audits are carried out following generally accepted
auditing practices and standards. The audit reports are acceptable to the
Bank. Earlier, PLN used to experience subst 2tial delays in completing the
consolidated accounts for audit. During the last three years, PLN has made
special efforts to expedite the closing of all regional accounts; it is now
able to complete the consolidated accounts for audit six months after the
close of the fiscal year. P1N has also taken measures to train its regional
accounting staff and has begun to prepare plans to computerize large districts
to expedite accounts processing. The FY84/85 audited accounts with report and
the unaudited accounts for FY85/86 were submitted to the Bank on time.

3.18      PLN has an effective internal audit group which reports to the
President Director for various special investigations, in addition to keeping
general and project accounting matters under review.
Insurance
3.19      PLN currently carries transit and marine insurance on equipment and
materials in transit. Projects under construction are covered by the
contractor's all risk and erection insurance. Fire and other hazards on
assets in operation are as yet self-insured. In view of the geographical
spread of PLN's assets, any single loss would be relatively small by compari-
son with total assets and operations, and this policy has been accepted by the
Bank. However, some very large-sized projects have recently been completed
and others are now under implementation which would result in a greater con-
centration of assets in certain locations than in the past. As agreed under
the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND), PLN has, with assistance from a
local insurance company, carried out a review of its insurance practices and
requirements. As a result of the review, PLN now recognizes the need to take
out commercial insurance for at least its major operating assets. The
Government has approved, as a first step, PLN's plans to take out insurance
for about 30% of its high risk assets, at Muara Karang and Suralaya thermal
power plants. PLN is con':inuing to review the question of the proportion of
assets to be insured by commercial agencies, and that to be carried as self-
insurance, and is expected to inform the Bank of its decision by March 31,
1987.
IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01      The project supports several of the sector objectives.  First, by
ensuring that the investments in transmission and distribution during the next
three to four years proceed at the desired level, it would reduce the cost of
electricity by optimizing the productivity of ongoing investments in genera-
tion projects (para. 2.08). The extension of the network will enable PLN to
supply electricity to unelectrified areas to serve residential, commercial and
industrial consumers. In Java, the waiting lists of industrial consumers
alone amount to about 500 MW. Extension of the PLN's supply will reduce the
growth of uneconomic captive generation. Second, the project will be used as
a vehicle for improving PLN's engineering capability by pi-viding technical
assistance for the development of the new Engineering Services Center,
resulting in more efficient use of scarce engineer-ng talent. Third, the
Testing and Research Center (LMK) of PLN will be equipped to play an expanded
role in the testing and certifying of indigenously produced equiprlent.
Fourth, the project will further the objective of strengthening PLN's finan-
cial position by ensuring continued attention to measures necessary to achieve
this objective, including tariff change and efficiency improvements. Fifth,
the project provides for technical assistance for furthering some of the effi-
ciency improvement measures. Finally, the project supports the engineering of
the proposed coal fired power plant at Paiton in East Java, which is the
important next step in the energy diversification strategy.

Project Description
4.02      The project comprises the following:
(a)  Construction of 150 kV and 70 kV transmission lines and substations
in Java;
(b)  Construction of 20 kV and 220/380 V distribution facilities in
Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi areas (Jabotabek);
(c)  Equipment for the Testing and Research Center (LMK) of PLN;
(d)  Consulting services for:
(i) efficiency improvement measures;
(ii) engineering of Paiton steam power plant in East Java; and
(iii) development of the Engineering Services Center (PPE) in PLN.
4.03      In 1981, using funds from the Sixth Power Loan (1365-IND), Beca
Worley International (BWI) of New Zealand reviewed the development require-
ments for the transmission and distribution program till 1987. Their report,
dated April 1982, identified additional requirements which have resulted in
several projects financed by OECF, ADB, KfW, export credits, etc. PLN has
carried out further studies to define the total required program of transmis-
sion and substation development in Java during the period 1986-90, to match
the ongoing program of g erating capacity additions in the same period, which
amount to over 1,800         A review of the ongoing transmission projects with
respect to the needed program has identified the balance of requirements for
Java, which are proposed for financing in this project.
4.04      The distribution component of the project covers the requirements of
the expansion of distribution facilities in Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and
Bekasi (Jabotabek) areas up to the middle of 1990. The studies for their
requirements were carried out by PLN, following up on the studies carried out
by SOFRJ.EC of France in 1979/80, to identify requirements up to 1990.
4.05      These two components of the project are designed to ensure that the
development of transmission and distribution facilities will remain in balance
with the growth of generation capacity in Java.
4.06      Most of the planning and initial design work connected with the
project has been carried out by PLN. However, to assist in the detailed
design, contract coordination and constructien management of the transmission
and substation work, PLN has selected consultants (para. 4.26).

4.09      Annex 10 gives the complete list of transmission lines and sub-
stations covered by the project.
4.10      Land Acquisition.  In view of the difficulties experienced in the
past with the acquisition of land for substations and rights of way for the
transmission lines, advance action has been initiated for them in this proj-
ect. Out of the 25 new substations proposed to be constructed, land is
already purchased for 10 locations. Out of the remaining fifteen locations,
twelve are in West Java and Jakarta areas. It was agreed with PLN that the
locations will be selected and inventoried by December 1987 and Ehe land
acquired no later than March 1988, except for the sites in Budikemuliaan and
Setiabudi, which will be acquired no later than June 1988.



- 17 -
4.11      For transmission lines in Central Java and East Java, surveys and
inventories have been completed while for those in West Java and Jakarta
areas, surveys will be completed by July 1987 ard inventories completed by
October 1987. Land compensation will be completed for all lines by March
1988. To accomplish this task, special task forces will be set up in the
Major Projects (Transmission) Group of PLN.
4.12      Transformer Relocation Program.  To improve the utilization of
stepdown transformers of 150kV and 70 kV substations, included in the project,
a comprehensive transformer relocation program is proposed. It was agreed
with PLN during negotiations that such a plan will be implemented to suit the
project implementation schedule.
4.13      Flexibility.  Due to long lead times for procurement of transmission
lines and substation equipment, PLN has encountered difficulties in responding
quickly to requests from industrial consumers for supply of power in areas
requiring installation of new 150 kV or 70 kV substations. As a result,
industries are obliged to purchase their own generating equipment, mostly
diesel plants, even though it may be uneconomic to do so (para. 1.11). In
order to respond to such situations, it is proposed to provide flexibility in
this project to use materials procured under the project for meeting urgent
needs for power supply to consumers at locations which may not be covered by
the currently envisaged list of substations (Annex 10). Also, the proposals
covered by the project are derived on the basis of current expectation of
demand growth in different areas in Java, which could change, requiring alter-
ation to the physical components of lines and substations. PLN has already
standardized the transmission lines and substation designs which will permit
such changes to be made without difficulty. The cost estimate provides
physical contingencies of 10% to permit increase in the quantities of mater-
ials required to cover such variations. PLN has agreed to review annually,
the plan for substations and transmission lines included in this project,
starting December 31, 1987, to identify the changes necessary, and thereafter
present them to the Bank to affect change in the list of proposed transmission
lines and substations in Java, with the consent of the Bank.
Distribution
4.14      Jaka5ta, Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi (Jabotabek) cover an area of
about 5,700 km and a population of over 10 million. The population of
Jakarta City in 1985/86 was estimated to be 7.3 million and growing at about
4.5% p.a. The percentage of electrified households was 58% in Jakarta, 24% in
Tangerang, 30% in Bogor, and 10% in Bekasi. In 1985/86, the electricity sales
in this area accounted for about 36% of PLN's sales in the whole country.
Also industrial and commercial consumers, amounting to over 200 MW of load,
are on PLN's waiting list for supply in this area.
4.15      The Bank has been involved in the reinforcement and expansion of the
distribution system in this area from the early stages through Credits 167-IND
and 334-IND and Loan 1259-IND, which are successfully completed. Also, Loans
2056-IND and 2443-IND cover the ongoing expansion of the network. The former
will be completed by the middle of 1987 and the latter by the middle of
1988. The project includes the estimated requirements for the extension of



- 18 -
the distribution facilities in this area for the two year period from mid-1988
to mid-1990.
4.16      The estimated quantities of materials required for the project are
shown in the table below:

4.17      There were considerable delays in the procurement cycle in the
Eleventh Power Project (Loan 2056-IND), and the Fourteenth Power Project
(Loan 2443-IND), which has resulted in delays in implementation and disburse-
ments. In order to avoid such delays both GOI and PLN have agreed to take
special steps to complete the procurement process for this project expedi-
tiously. It is agreed that the contracts for distribution equipment will be
finalized by August 1987, for transmission lines by September 1987 and for
substations and underground cables by October 1987.
Testing and Research Center
4.18      The Testing and Research Center (LMK) of PLN is responsible for the
testing of electrical power equipment including certification of local
products and assistance to the power equipment industry, as well as applied
research on problems relevant to PLN's operations. Its current facilities
include Electrical Laboratory, Fuel, Gas and Chemical Laboratory, the Hydro
Power Laboratory, the Electrical Power System Reseaech Unit and the Survey
Unit. It has a total staff of about 200 engineers and technicians.
4.19      In 1985, the French Covernment and EDF provided grant funds to
prepare a master plan for the LMK's development for the next 15 years. EDF
connenced this work in May 1985 and has prepared interim reports defining the
needs in a phased manner for three 5-year periods. The final report is
expected by early 1987. The project provides for a part of the funds needed
for the first five-year period, primarily for the purchase of additional
equipment for the existing laboratories, to enable them to augment and
modernize the test facilities. For the establishment of new laboratories such
as short circuit testing laboratories, pollution study laboratory, hydro
research laboratory and thermal laboratory, further detailed studies will be
carried out, with bilzteral assistance.

Consulting Services
4.20      Funds for commencing the design and detailed engineering for a
thermal power plant in East Java (at Paiton) were provided in Loan 2056-IND
and Loan 2300-IND. Sargent & Lundy of the USA and Integ of Canada, in
association with the Local consulting firm of PT Citaconas, have been
appointed following Bank guidelines. They completed the design work and
specifications for turbine generators, steam generators and othe- major
components in early 1986. However due to slower than expected g iwth in
demand and resource constraints, the tenders have not been issu-d. It is
expected that the issue of tenders will be authorized by early 1987.
Therefore, extension of their services is now required for procurement, post
contract engineering and contracts coordination work. The project provides
for the continuation of the work involved for tender evaluation and post-
contract engineering for the period of about one year, involving about 250 man
months of expatriate effort.
4.21      As agreed under Loan 2443-IND, PLN has established an Engineering
Services Center (para. 3.08). It is proposed to employ services ot a
consulting engineering firm to help in the development of the cent_r. The
project provides for such services amounting to about 500 man-months spread
over a period of about three years. Terms of reference for the services and
short list of consultants were agreed with the Bank and proposals received
from them are under evaluation. The appointment of consultants is expected by
March 31, 1987.
4.22      The project also provides for technical assistance to enable  PLN to
formulate in detail and carry out certain efficiency improvement measures
(para. 1.17 and 3.10), which include: (a) renovation of hydro-plants at
Plengan, Ketenger, Lamajan and Jelok in Java; (b) improvement in the avail-
ability factor of Suralaya coal fired thermal plant; (c) improvement of the
data base for distribution systems, including detailed mapping; (d) train-
ing. The assistance may be in the form of individual experts or consulting
firms to be selected in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. These will
amount to about 150 man-months of consultant services and will be executed in
1987 and 1988.
Cost Estimate
4.23      Annex 11, Tables I and 2 give the detailed cost estimate for the
transmission lines, substations &nd Cistribution components of the project.
All costs are based on December 1986 prices; physical contingencies are at 10l
for transmission and substations (par&. 4.13) and at 5S for distribution. The
price contingencies. calculated on the basis of the following inflation
factors, amount to 10.8Z of the base cost plus physical contingencies:

Financing Plan
4.25      The financing plan for the project would be as shown below.  It is
proposed to finance about 87Z of the foreign cost of the project from the
proposed loan amounting to about 58.5% of the project cost, including the
interest during construction. GOI and PLN are in the process of finalizing
arrangements for financial assistance from the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany to cover the foreign exchange cost of goods and services
required for the construction of transmission lines and substations in Central
Java. The proceeds of the Bank loan, which would be made to COI, would be
onlent to PLN under a subsidiary loan agreement, the signing of which will be
a condition of loan effectiveness. The onlending rate will be equal to the
Bank's standard variable interest rate plus no less than a quarter percent for
administration charges. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by GOI. It
has been agreed that GOI would make available adequate funds for the project
and for PLN's overall agreed investment program.

Engineering and Construction
4.26      PLN carried out the feasibility studies for the transmission and
substation component of this project. It has also completed most of the pre-
liminary survey and design work and prepared specifications and procurement
documents for them.  Consultants have been selected for assisting PLN in
tender evaluation, contract negotiations, post contract engineering work and
construction management of the project. The total work is divided between
three local consulting firms, each assisted by a foreign consultant, which
are, PT Citaconas in association with Ewbank Preece (UK) for West Java; PT
Indra Karya in association with Fichtner (W. Germany) for Central Java; and PT
Encona in association with WJEC (Japan) for East Java. These arrangements
have been accepted by the Bank and the work is being financed under Loan
2443-IND.
4.27      The engineering and construction of the distribution component of
the project is being carried out by PLN's own distribution staff. The tender
documents for distribution materials have been finalized and bids have been



- 22 -
invited. The staff in the Jabotabek area is already implementing the ongoing
program of the expansion of the distribution network (Loan 2056-IND) and is
sufficiently experienced for the proposed program.  All procurement wil' be
centrally carried out by PLN's staff at the head office.

procured by local competitive bidding, all equipment and related services
financed under the proposed Bank loan shall be procured by international
competitive bidding (ICB), in accordance with the Bank's procurement guide-
lines. Qualifying domestic manufacturers would be eligible for a preference
in bid evaluation of 15% or the import duty, whichever is lower. The Bank
financed items will include (a) transmission towers, conductors, insulators,
and accessories; (b) transformers; (c) 150 kV cables; (d) 150 kV, 70 kV and 20
kV switchgear, control cables and accessories; (e) substation equipment;
(f) distribition materials including 20kV and 400 V cables, distribution
transformers, circuit breakers and meters; (g) concrete poles; and
(h) Consulting Services. The construction of the transmission and distribu-
tion networks financed by GOIIPLN funds will be carried out by following local
competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the Government guidelines,
which are acceptable to the Bank. Consultants will be engaged in accordance
with the Bank guidelines. Table 4.2 summarizes the procurement arrangements.

4.29      All bidding packages for goods financed by the Bank and estimated to
cost over US$1,000,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review
of procurement documents, which covers all the foreseen centracts.
Implementation Schedule
4.30      Annex 12 gives the implementation schedule for the project.  The
construction of the transmission lines and substation is expected to be
substantially completed by the end of 1990 and the distribution equipment is
planned to be installed by the middle of 1990. The project implementation is
expected to be completed in all respects by December 31, 1991.
Disbursement
4.31      The Bank loan woulu be disbursed against approved contracts and will
cover: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and
materials; (b) 100% of ex-factory expenditures for locally manufactured items;
(c) 70% of local expenditures for other items procured locally (ex-shelf);
(d) 80% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for concrete poles; and
(e) 80Z of local expenditures for the services of local consultants and 1OOZ
of foreign expenditures for the services of other consultants. No disburse-
ments will be made for expenditures prior to the loan signing. To the extent
practicable, withdrawal applications will be aggregated in the amount of
US$100,000 or more prior to submission to the Bank.
4.32      Annex 13 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank
loan. The disbursements against this loan are expected to be faster than the
regional profile in the third and the fourth year because of the advanced
state of preparation of the project and also because the Bank loan would be
disbursed against procurement of goods and services only.
Ecology
4.33      Transmission and distribution projects will be designed and carried
out in accordance with the current technological practices and will cause
minimum disturbance to the environment. Also, PLN will coordinate the routing
of the lines and the land acquisition with local authorities to reduce their
adverse impact. No environmental hazards are foreseen.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Results
5.01      When PLN was established, no accounting system was in operation, and
accounts were not properly recorded. The Bank's first lending operation
(Credit 165-IND, 1969) financed consultancy services to assist PLN in setting
up an accounting system. The first balance sheet and related statements
revealed that PLN had been incurring losses. Over the years, PLN has advanced
considerably from the near chaotic conditions in the late 1960s to a reason-
ably sound organization in the 1980s. However, despite the growth in PLN's
operation, its financial results in recent years have been uneven. Highlights

of the operations are given below in Table 5.1. Historical financial
statements are given in Annex 14.

5.02      During the period of FY79/80 through FY84/85, PLN's operating
revenues and expenses increased at about the same rate averaging about 45X
p.a. The increase in expenses was mainly due to the rapid rise in the fuel
prices during this period. Although PLN's energy sales increased by about 17%
p.a. and the average tariff increased by nearly 3.6 times over the same
period, the increases in operating revenues were just enough by 1984 to meet
the increases in its costs of operation, resulting from fuel cost increases as
well as inflation and depreciation.
5.03      P1N's operating performance showed an improving trend in FY84/85 as
a result of the various measures it initiated to improve its operational effi-
ciency (para. 3.10); it was able to meet the indicative targets of the self-
financing ratio, as projected under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-
IND). This was mainly because of (i) high percentages of consumers' contribu-
tions and depreciation in its internal sources, and (ii) lower level of
realized capital expenditures than originally projected.
Present Position

5.05      PLN'S unaudited financial operating results for FY85/86 show a con-
tinuation of the improving trend in its operating performance, which was
observed in FY84/85 (para. 5.03). The estimated outcome for FY86/87 indicates
further improvement in that year. In July 1986, the Government reduced the
prices of industrial fuel oils (diesel, and residual- fuel oil) by 10% and
simultaneously reduced the electricity tariff by 6% for industrial
consumers. This measure had an impact of improving PLN's operating results
since the reduction in operating costs as a result of decreases in fuel prices
was higher than the loss of revenue due to reduced rates. PLN's rate of
return (ROR) on net revalued assets is estimated to be about 0.5% in FY86/87
compared to -0.2% in FY85/86 and -0.9Z in FY83/84. The self-financing ratios
for FY86187 would, however, be at a level of about 15%, compared to 202 in
FY85/86 and 22% in FY83/84. This decline is mainly because debt service
payments would absorb a larger share of the internally generated funds as
repayments on some of the on-lent foreign loans have now started.
5.06      Despite noticeable improvement in its operating performance during
the last 2-3 years (paras. 5.03 and 5.05), PLN is unable to satisfy the
revenue covenant adopted under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND) in
1984, which requires PLN to achieve an ROR of not less than 6% in FY85/86, and
annual RORs of not less than 8% in the fiscal years tnereafter. For PLN to
have achieved the covenanted RORs for FY85/86 and FY86/87, tariffs would have
to have been increased by about 13% at the beginning of FY85/86, and by about
5% in FY86/87. The Government, however, did not permit any tariff increase,
as it believed that a tariff increase would have reduced the pressure on PLN



- 26 -
to improve its efficiency.  The Government also considered that PLN's
financial performance needed to be evaluated in a broader context because of
tbe inherent differences among its regional operations.
Regional Operations
5.07      When PLN's operations are separated into Java and outside Java
operations, the contrast between the results of the two operations is
striking. This is illustrated in Table 5.3.

/a   Unaudited.
7T   PLN estimate.
5.08      While in FY85/86, PLN incurred a huge loss in its outside Java
operations, its Java operations actually generated a net operating profit of
Rp 99 billion with an estimated ROR of about 4.9Z. For FY86/87, PLN's operat-
ing losses in its outside Java operations are estimated to be Rp 160 billion
or about 50% higher than the level in FY85/86, but for its Java operations,
the net operating profit is expected to increase to about Rp 180 billion with
an ROR of about 6.7%.
5.09      The main reason for this vastly different performance between Java
and outside Java operations is that, under a uniform national tariff system,
the electricity supply in Java is through the interconnected grid and with
larger plants and, therefore, at a lower cost compared with outside Java,
where expensive diesel generation is the main source of electricity supply.
Electricity sales outside Java account for only about 20% of PLN's total
sales, but the operating costs account for over 30% of PLN's total operating
costs. Tnis disparity in PLN's regional financial operating performance is
expected to continue in the next few years, when more economical and energy
efficient thermal and hydro plants are connected to the Java grid.



- 27 -
Performance Monitoring
5.10      The Government, PLN and the Bank have reviewed jointly whether the
revenue covenant currently applicable to PLN (para. 5.06), is appropriate for
PLN's operations as a whole and whether PLN realistically can be expected to
achieve the financial objectives underlying the covenant.
5.11      PLN's operations in Java, which account for about 80% of its total
energy sales, are profitable (para. 5.08). These operations, which include
large central power stations which supply electricity through an intercon-
nected grid sy_tem, are at a scale which is reaching a level comparable to,
and have conditions which are similar to, those prevailing in other large
utilities in the region. While PLN carries out at the Government's direction,
both inside and outside Java, a variety of socially-oriented operations such
as its rural electrification programs which are not of a commercial nature,
their sLare of and financial impact on the operations in Java is relatively
small compared to that in the operations outside Java. By most standards,
PLN's operations in Java are considered well-established and sufficiently com-
mercially-oriented to warrant their performance to be measured by normal
utility yardsticks.
5.12      PLN's operations outside Java differ substantially from those in
Java, and are highly unprofitable (paras. 5.08 and 5.09). These operations,
which are small-scale and are dispersed over a large number of islands,
encompass over 600 separate power generation and supply networks. As they are
based largely on diesel, these networks have a high cost of energy genera-
tion. Moreover, with isolated load centerr and limited demand, transmission
and distribution losses are much higher than in Java, and the overall energy
supply costs are high. Since socially-oriented activities constitute their
major portion, PLN's operations outside Java remain largely noncommercial in
nature and have a significant adverse impact on PLN's overall finances. PLN
is, however, not able to set a tariff outside Java which is higher than in
Java because Government considers a country-wide uniform tariff to be
desirable to meet social and regional development objectives. The Government
and PLN, however, recognize that over a period of time these operations should
become self-sustaining and, eventually profitable.
5.13      As a means for improving its overall financial performance, PLN
proposes to implement certain measures to enhance the efficiency of its opera-
tions, both in Java and outside Java (para. 3.10). These improvements are,
however, not expected to alter significantly in the medium term the opera-
tional differences between the two types of operations. In view of these
differences, it is proposed to adopt separate financial performance targets
for the two operations, and to modify the requirements of the existing revenue
covenant as follows:
(a) PLN shall from time to time take all such measures as shall be
required to realize for its Java operations, no later than in its
fiscal year 1988/89 and in each of its fiscal years thereafter an
annual rate of return of not less than eight percent (8U); and



- 28 -
(b) PLN shall from time to time take all such measures as shall be
required with respect to its non-Java operations to produce for each
of its fiscal years after its fiscal year ending on March 31, 1990,
total revenues equivalent to not less than the sum of non-Java
operations': (i) total operating expenses; and (ii) the amount by
which debt service requirements exceed the provision for depre-
ciation.
Agreements with the Government and PLN have been reached that under the
proposed loan the existing revenue covenant for PLN as a whole will be
replaced by an ROR covenant for PLN's Java operations, and a break-even
covenant for PLN's non-Java operations, as outlined above.
5.14      In addition to the efficiency improvement measures proposed to be
undertaken for PLN's operations in Java and outside Java (para. 3.10), tariff
increases as well as appropriate adjustments in the tariff structure would be
necessary for PLN to achieve the proposed financial performance targets for
these operations (para. 5.13). The timing and the size of the tariff adjust-
ments required will be determined on the basis of the review of the adequacy
of its tariffs, which PLN is currently required to carry out before December
31 of each year (para. 5.24).
5.15      Accounting for PLN's Java and non-Java operations is separate except
for overhead expenses and debt service payments which are, at present, diffi-
cult to separate except on a notional basis. It was agreed with PLN that
initially the overhead expenses and debt service payments could be allocated
on the basis of unit sales of energy, and that PLN will pursue the separation
of debt service payments on the basis of actual debt and related service
payments. For monitoring the performance under the proposed revenue
covenants, PLN has agreed to provide the Bank with separated historical finan-
cial results (beginning with its fiscal year 1986/87) and forecasts on a pro
forma basis, but not separate audited financial statements. This arrangement
is considered satisfactory.
Tariffs
5.16      PLN's present tariff schedules comprise 17 consumer categories.  For
all except the smallest domestic class, two-part charges are applied, and for
industrial and large commercial consumers time-of-day pricing is in effect.
Provision can be made for surcharges to cover cost increases. Variation of
surcharges requires the Minister's approval. Alteration of the basic rate,
however, requires Presidential approval. The present tariff structure and the
history of past tariff increases are given in Annex 16. The average level of
the current tariff was about 15X lower than the estimated average long run
incremental cost of supply, prior to devaluation in September 1986; the
devaluation would increase this gap. Appropriate tariff adjustments are
envisaged under the proposed project (paras. 5.14 and 5.25).
5.17      The present basic rate schedules were introduced by PLN in May 1980
to structure its electricity tariffs according to the Long Run Marginal Cost
(LRMC) pricing principles, as agreed with the Bank under the Seventh Power
Project (Loan 1513-IND). However, from 1980 to 1983, all tariff increases



- 29 -
were effected entirely thr9qgh changes in the energy charges. The failure to
adjust the demand charges -' had distorted the tariff structure in two ways.
The first relates to the allocation of electricity charges between fixed
charges (demand charge) and variable charges (energy charge). The Government
and PLN have already moved toward. their reduction in 1984 and it is expected
that further progress will be made in the coming years. The second relates to
the issue arising out of the cross subsidy between different categories of
consumers, e.g. commercial and affluent residential consumers compensating for
low tariff for small residential consumers. While no major changes in the
latter policies are foreseen, the Bank has advocated reduction in such
distortions.
5.18      Under the Fourteenth Power Project, an agreement was reached that
PLN would periodically review its LRMC and tariffs, and discuss the results
with GOI and the Bank. This convenant will continue under the proposed loan.
Taxes
5.19      In accordance with the prevailing tax legislation effective since
1984, PLN is subject to a 10% Value Added Tax (VAT) and to corporate income
tax. The Government currently bears the VAT on the foreign contracts, and PLN
bears it on the local contracts; this policy is assumed to continue throughout
the forecast period. With respect to corporate income tax, the current
Indonesian tax code permits the use of accelerated depreciation of assets in
operation, instead of the straight-line method used by PLN in its financial
accounting. As a result, PLN does not expect to pay any corporate income tax
for its fiscal year 1986/87, and during the forecast period. In calculating
the rate of return, however, any income tax payments will be taken into
account.
Financing Policy
5.20      During the past five years, PLN's tariff adjustments have been
effected mainly to offset the increases in fuel costs resulting from oil price
increases (Annex 17). With negligible or negative net income, PLN's major
sources of internal funds have been depreciation and consumers' contribu-
tions. The Government, in the past, provided PLN with substantial funding
mainly in the form of equity. Although PLN is authorized by its charter to
borrow from local and foreign lenders and to issue its own obligations, the
Government in practice secures all foreign borrowings on behalf of PLN and
bears all foreign exchange risk. Due to growing budgetary constraints facing
the Government, foreign borrowings through on-lending arrangements have become
increasingly important. In addition, the Government is allowing PLN to borrow
4/   "Energy charge" is the charge per kWh based on metered consumption of
electricity. "Demand charge" is the fixed component of a customer's bill
which is designed to recover the "capacity costs" (e.g. depreciation,
finance charges) of the capacity the utility must keep to meet peak
demands.

lion or about 19Z, compared to about 35Z for the previous five-year period.
PLN's own contribution from its internal sources is projected to remain at
about the same level (19%).  The financing gap is proposed to be filled by
substantially increasing both local and foreign borrowings which would cover
about 62% of the financing requirements.

5.23      PLN's forecast financial performance for the period FY86/87 through
FY92/93, and related income statements for its operation in Java and outside
Java are summarized in Table 5.5. Detailed projections are given ir. Annex 14,
with notes and assumptions given in Annex 15.
5/   The domestic capital market has been used by companies only to a very
small extent to raise finance through the issuance of bonds. These bonds
are without tax exemption status and are not very attractive in the
market. Tendering of PLN's bonds in the local market is not likely to be
a major source of its local financing in the near future.

5.24      Under the proposed revenue covenants, PLN will be required to
achieve: (a) for its operations in Java, an annual rate of return of not Less
8% by no later than FY88/89 and to maintain it at or above that level for
fiscal years thereafter; and (b) for its operations outside Java, a break-even
situation by no later than FY90/91 (para. 5.13). In addition, PLN will, by
December 31 of each year, review the adequacy of its tariffs and determine the
timing and quantum of tariff adjustments required to meet these objectives
(para. 5.14). This covenant will be repeated under the proposed loan.
5.25      In the financial projections, the proposed revenue covenant for the
operations in Java would be met in FY88/89 when a tariff increase of about 25%
is projected to be required at the beginning of that year. Smaller annual
tariff increases would be required in later years of the forecast period, to
maintain the rate of return at a level above 8%. A tariff increase in 1987
is, however, not considered practicable by Government, as it is trying to
contain inflation following the recent (September 1986) currency devaluation,
and has declared its intention to maintain the prices of essential commodities
as well as limit price increases by state enterprises to the extent possible.
5.26      The proposed revenue covenant for the operations outside Java is
projected to be met in FY90/91, with the tariff increases projected during the
forecast period, along with the implementation of the action plan to improve
the efficiency of operations outside Java (paras. 5.13).
5.27      PLN's overall financial performance is also projected to improve
over the forecast period, and its overall annual rates of return would be in
the 5-7Z range from FY88/89 onwards, compared to -0.2% in FY85/86. However,
in spite of such significant improvements in its rate of return performance,
PLN's self-financing ratios during the period FY87/88-FY90/91 are projected to
remain in the 16-21% range, but would gradually improve to about 29% in
FY92193. This is because PLN's annual capital expenditures (including
interest during construction) in FY90/91 are expected to be nearly three times
the level in FY85/86 when its self-financing ratio was about 20%.  One of the
reasons for the lack of improvement in the projected self-financing ratios is
the increase in the amount of investment in Rupiah terms because of the
September 1986 currency devaluation. The forecasts also assume that PLN would
.inance an increasingly larger share of its investment program (55-70%)
through local and foreign borrowings, and rely less on Government contribution
(paras. 5.21 and 5.22). On this basis, debt as percentage of debt plus equity
(excluding revaluation surplus) is expected to rise from about 41% in FY86/87
to 56% in FY89/90 and stabilize thereafter; the projected debt service cover-
age ratio is expected to be about 1.6 to 2.0 times for most of the years of
the forecast period. This is still considered satisfactory. The existing
covenant binding PLN to a minimum 1.5 times debt service coverage will
continue under the proposed loan to ensure PLN's prudent debt management.
5.28      The Government currently assumes the foreign exchange risk on the
foreign debt borrowed to finance all public corporations and this policy is
assumed to continue.



- 33 -
Asset Revaluation
5.29      PLN's assets have teen revalued periodically.  The last detailed
revaluation was done in FY79/80 as required of all public corporations under
instructions of tho Ministry of Finance. The re%aluation was recorded in the
books and was accepted by the Bank. Fixed assets acquired after March 31,
1979 are appraised at cost. Following the currency devaluation in September
1986, Government hao issued Regulation No. 45/1986 dated October 2, 1986
providing for the revaluation of assets of business and public corporations,
acquired through September 12, 1986. The Regulation specifies the annual
revaluation factors for the years 1970 to 1986 for adjusting the asset values
as of January 1, 1987, and corporations have untiL December 31, 1987 to com-
plete this process. Since FLN's fixed assets are already revalued upto
March 31, 1979, under the Regulation it needs to carry out asset revaluation
only with respect to the period after that date. PLN has already prepared, on
a preliminary basis, such a revaluation of its assets for the period FY79/80-
FY86/87.
5.30      Under the Fourteenth Power Project (Loan 2443-IND), PLN agreed to
carry out annual revaluation of its operating assets, accumulated deprecia-
tion, work in progress and consumers' contributions, for the purpose of the
rate of return calculation. Towards this end, PLN was required to prepare in
consultation with Government and the Bank a report on the methodology to be
used for the annual revalmiation. During negotiations, PLN's proposed methodo-
logy for asset revaulation for purposes of monitoring performance under the
rate ctf return covenant was reviewed. Under the proposed methodology, which
had been reviewed and accepted by an interministerial committee of the Covern-
ment, asset revaluation for the period FY79/80-FY86/87 would be based on the
revaulation factors and guidelines contained in Government Regulation
No. 45/1986 (para. 5.29), and when an appropriate Covernment directive (such
a Covernment Regulation No. 45/1986) is unavailable, the assets would be
revalued on the basis of the Electrical Installations Index issued by
Indonesia's Central Bureau of Statistics. However, for purposes of financial
projections, weighted annual escalation rates for foreign and local
components, as mutually agreed between PLN and the Bank, would be used. The
proposed methodology is considered satisfactory, and financ il projections
have been prepared on that basis.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The justification of the project rests on the need to provide the
Bank's support to the electricity sector and PLN through a c-acial period of
its growth and development (para. 1.17). The technical assistance components
of the project will help the institutional development. As discussed in para.
2.08, PLN needs to expand its transmission and distribution facilities rapidly
as part of an overall expansion program, to satisfy large demand reflected in
long waiting lists and to er.tend supply to unelectrified areas. The
generating capacity in Java is expected to increase from the 1985/86 level of
3,841 MW to about 6.100 MW in 1990/91 (Annex 3), mainly by the addition of
Kamajang (110 MW,, Cirata (500 MW), Suralaya (800 MW), and Cresik (400 MW),
which are already under implementation. The first three projects are financed



- 34 -
in part by earlier Bank loans. Also, PLN has a list of over 500 KW of large
industrial consumers who have already contracted for supply or with whom
negotiations for supply are in progress. Additionally, extensions of PLN's
supply to hitherto unelectrified areas is proposed in such a way as to
maintain a balance between generation, transmission and distribution
facilities. To attain this objective the investment program for the
transmission and distribution facilities in Java up to 1990191 is planned as
follows (Annex 6):
1986/87  1987/88   1988/89  1989/90   1990/91    Total

Transmission and
substations              160.9    111.8     150.1    167.8      177.5    768.1
Distribution               286.7    299.5      319.8    347.2     376.1  1,629.3

6.02      The proposed project includes those transmission and substation
projects which would be commissioned in the period 1988 to 1990 and are not
otherwise financed. Other lending agencies involved in the financing of the
program in Java include ADB, OECF, KfW, ODA, and loans from Belgium, France,
Korea, Yugoslavia and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Transmission and Substations
6.03      Each of the proposed transmission and substation facilities included
in the project was justified on the basis of detailed technical study on the
basis of (a) supplying new loads; (b) avoiding overloading of existing facili-
ties; or (c) improving system reliability. About 25 of the 46 substations
included in the project are at new locations (Annex 10), in each of which the
proposed substation is a lower cost alternative than establishing or extending
diesel generating facilities or extending distribution at 20 kV.
6.04      The proposed project along with the other ongoing projects will
increase the 150 kV and 70 kV substation capacity in Java from a total of
6,000 MVA in 1985 to about 9,000 MVA in 1990, which is consistent with the
projected growth in the peak demand from about 2,200 KW to 4,000 MW.
Distribution
6.05      The distribution component of the project is justified for support-
ing the augmentation and expansion of distribution facilities in the Jabotabek
area which provides nearly 36% of PLN's saLes (para. 4.14).
6.06      The number of consumers in Jakarta/Tengerang area grew from about
293,000 in 1978/79 to about 1,080,000 in 1985/86 and the sales grew from



- 35 -
1,510 GWh to 4,543 GWh in the same period, corresponding to growth rate of
20.5Z and 17.0Z respectively. PLN's current targets are to connect 1.7 mil-
lion consumers by 1990/91, a growth rate of about 9.0% p.a. The electrifica-
tion ratio in the area is projected to increase from 55% to 65Z. The electri-
fication ratios in Bogor and Bekasi which were 28% and 10% respectively in
1985/86 will increase to 45% and 17% respectively in the same period. These
targets are reasonable and within the implementation capability of PLN.
Economic Rate of Return
6.07      In projects involving transmission and distribution networks where
it is difficult to assess the benefits attributable to the specific components
of the expansion program and where the schemes represent an area and time
slice of a total development program, it is appropriate to evaluate the
economic rate of return of the entire program rather than attempt separate
economic analysis of the components. In the case of this project, the
economic analysis of the PLN's investment program in Java for the period 1987-
1991 of which the current project is a part, was carried out. Annex 19 sets
out the details.
6.08      The economic analysis was carried out using the investment costs for
generation, transmission and distribution facilities which would be put in
place during the period. The generating plants being added amount to about
1,800 MW, mainly consisting of Cirata (500 MW), Suralaya (800 NW), Gresik (400
NW), and Kamojang (110 MW). Investments on these plants incurred prior to
1986/87 were included in the cost stream. The capital costs were shadow
priced by using a composite factor of 0.925, derived by using a shadow price
factor of 0.8 for locally procured equipment and materials which account for
about 20% of the investments and a factor of 0.65 for unskilled labor which
constitutes about 10% of the cost of the program. The balance of the
investment costs were not shadow priced since PLN would import equipment and
materials on which it pays no duties or taxes and the foreign exchange rate is
equal to its shadow price of foreign exchange in Indonesia. The incremental
operation and maintenance costs, including fuel, were derived from the
computer simulation of system operation for the period under study. Fuel
costs have been valued at border prices, in September 1986.
6.09      The benefits are derived by using the estimated incremental sales
that would result from the proposed investments. In addition to revenues to
PLN, consumer surplus has been quantified, on the basis of "willingness to
pay" of industrial and residential consumers.
6.10      The willingness to pay for industrial consumers was estimated by two
methods. Oner there is ample evidence that industrial consumers are willing
to pay the cost of electricity provided by captive diesel plant (para. 1.11),
which is in the range of Rp 100 to 175 per kWh, depending on the size of the
installation and the usage pattern. Considering PLN's current average _evenue
per KWh from industrial consumers of about Rp 74 per kWh, the willingness to
pay would be in the range of 1.3 to 2.3 times the current tariff. As an
alternative approach, a demand curve was constructed using available
information which showed that some autoproducers are willing to pay up to
three times PLN's tariff and over 50% of them are willing to pay over 1.5



- 36 -
times the cost of PLN's supply. Based on such a survey the consumers' surplus
for the industrial consumers was estimated at 1.7 times PLN's industrial
tariff (Annex 18, Table-3). For the present analysis, a conservative factor
of 1.5 is used.
6.11      Willingness to pay for residential consumers has been recently
estimated in a Bank study entitled "Indonesia: Rural Electrification Reviec"
(Report No. 6144-IND of November 1986). The study concludes that the
willingness to pay for presidential consumers is of the order of 2.0 to 2.5
times the prevailing tariff, including the benefits for substitution of
kerosene for lighting and other uses of electricity such as increased
lighting, use of electrical appliances and television. On a conservative
basis a multiplier of 2.0 is used for the calculation of IERR.
6.12      Currently, PLN's average tariff to commercial consumers is
relatively high (about Rp 166 per KWh). Hence the willingness to pay is
equated to current tariff. Similarly, for the Government users and public
supply such as street lighting and mosques, the willingness to pay may be no
higher than the current tariff and the multiplier factor has been taken as
1.0.
6.13      The IERR for the investment program in Java works out to 17X.  It
would reduce to 15Z if the investment costs increase by 10Z or if the sales
went down by 10%.
6.14      The FIRR using financial costs and revenue to PLN as benefits is
8%.  This shows that the tariff is still somewhat below the cost of supply.
If tariff is increased by 20%, as is expected, the FIRR would go up to 11%.
Risks
6.14      The risk in the implementation of the transmission and substation
projects is primarily one of delay that may occur in the acquisition of land
for substations and right of way for the construction of overhead lines
(para. 4.10). PLN has already initiated advance action to avoid such
delays. A satisfactory action plan for completing the acquisition to suit the
project implementation schedule has also been agreed with PLN. There are no
unusual risks in the implementation of the distribution component of the
project.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements Reached
7.01      During negotiations, the following items were discussed and
agreements reached:
(1) With PLN
(a) PLN will carry out, in consultation with the Bank, an action plan
for controlling and reducing transmission and distribution losses in
1986/87 and thereafter (para. 3.10);



- 37 -
(b) PLN will carry out, in consultation with the Bank, an action plan
for efficiency improvements for all its operations (para. 3.10)
(c)  PLN will acquire land for substations and right-of-way for
transmission lines in accordance with a satisfactory schedule
(para. 4.10 and 4.11);
(d) PLN will carry out a comprehensive transformer relocation program
for substations included in the project in accordance with an
implementation schedule satifactory to the Bank (para. 4.12); and
(e)  PLN will review annually the plan for transmission lines and sub-
stations included in the project, commencing December 31, 1987, to
identify any changes necessary, and thereafter adjust the plan in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.13);
(2) With GOI and PLN
(a) An agreed financial and operational program with measures including
sufficient tariff increases as well as appropriate adjustments in
the tariff structure will be implemented to enable PLN to achieve
for its Java operations, a rate of return on revalued net assets of
not less than 8%, no later than in its fiscal year 1988/89, and in
each of its fiscal years therafter (paras. 5.13 and 5.14); and
(b) An agreed financial and operational program with measures including
efficiency improvement and tariff increases as necessary will be
implemented to enable PLN to achieve breakeven in its operations
outside Java by no later than in its fiscal year 1990/91
(paras. 5.13 and 5.15).
Condition of Effectiveness
7.02      Signing of the subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and PLN (para.
4.25) will be a condition of the effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Recommendations
7.03      With the above agreements and understanding, the proposed project is
suitable for a loan of $226 million for a period of 20 years including a
5-year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate, to the Republic
of Indonesia.

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Sensitivity of Efficiency Parameters
1.        This Annex reviews the financial implications of PLN's efficiency
improvements in some areas of its operational and financial management, and
attempts to quantify some of the effects in terms of the targets assumed in
the financial forecast for the period 1986/87 to 1990/91 (Annexes 14 and 15).
Fuel Consumption and Cost
2.        PLN's primary source of energy generation has been fuel oil.  During
the past five years, its fuel efficiency has shown a modest improving trend,
as given in Annex 17.
3.        While PLN's fuel efficiency has been improving, its fuel cost has
been steadily increasing as a result of government's policy of removing domes-
tic oil subsidies. As shown in Annex 17, the average price of PLN's fuel oil
increased by over 4.8 times over the period of 1981/82 to 1985/86. Fuel cost
has become the single most important element in its operating expenses, rising
from about 40% of the total operating expenses in 1981/82 to about 56% in
1985/86. Sensitivity tests show that an efficiency improvement in fuel con-
sumption over the period 1986/87 to 1990/91 by 1% would result in an estimated
average annual saving equivalent to about Rp 10 billion.
System Losses
4.        PLN's transmission and distribution (T&D) losses were 24Z in
1974/75, and subsequently reduced to 19% in 1982/83. But, they increased to
20% in 1983/84 mainly due to the slowdown in investment in transmission and
distribution and increases in unauthorized/unaccounted for consumptions. Dur-
ing the last two years, PLN, with assistance from consultants who are
currently studying the causes of high system losses and formulating steps to
monitor and correct problems, has initiated intensive action to control and
reduce losses. As a result, losses reduced to 19.6Z in 1985/86. At this
level, the T&D losses are considerably higher than many neighboring countries
(Malaysia 7.6%; Thailand 9.9Z; and Korea 6.8%; all in 1982/83). Clearly,
there is ample scope for improving the system losses. PLN will need to
continue its efforts to control and reduce losses through appropriate
preventive measures. Over the period 1986/87 to 1990/91, a decreasing trend
is assumed to again prevail, reaching from 18 in 1986/87 to 14.6% in
1990/91. A sensitivity test shows that if the T&D system losses were to
remain at the level of 18.0% over the period 1986/87 to 1990/91, PLN's fuel
cost could be expected to increase by a total    about Rp 116 billion for the
same period, or about Rp 29 billion per annum.-
1/  Improvements in system losses will help to reduce the production costs,
especially the fuel costs, to meet a given level of sales.

Labor Productivity and Salaries
5.        During the period 1981/82 through 1985/8'g PLM's total employees
increased by about 43% from 35,791 to 51,290. Labor productivity improved
over the same period in terms of customers per employee (from 90 to 116) and
MWh sold per employee (from 219 to 248). While these figures are low by
international standards, the improving trend over the past five years is
encouraging. Over the five-year period 1986/87 to 1990/91, the improving
trend is expected to continue with the sales per employee reaching from about
280 MWh in 1986/87 to about 405 MWh in 1990/91.
Accounts Receivables and Collection
6.        PLN's accounts receivables from general customers are good, and its
position with respect to government entities has improved significantly during
the past two years and is currently satisfactory. It is important that PLN
continues its efforts to improve its collection performance. The settlement
of overdue accounts and prompt payment of current accounts by government
customers involve time-consuming interministerial discussions and negotia-
tions. Also, the instaLlment payment procedures by Armed Forces have caused
the considerable accumulation of accounts receivables. Under Power XIV (Loan
2443-INUD, June 1984), the Government agreed to ensure that PLN's total overdue
accounts receivables from government entities would not exceed 60 days. While
this requirement is currently being met, it needs to be kept under continuous
review.
7.        Although efficiency improvement in collection performance may not
have immediate direct impact on PLN's operating expenses, its financial impli-
cation is not insignificant. The financial projections assume that the total
accounts receivables position during the forecast period 1986/87 to 1990/91
would be maintained at a level of 50 days achieved in 1985/86. If, for
example, PLN8's total receivables in 1988/89 were to be at 60 days instead of
the 50 days assumed in the projections, then P1WN's working capital position
for that year would be increased by about Rp 63 billion.
Inventory Management
8.        Because of the widespread distribution of PLN's regional operations
and its construction activities in outer islands, PLN's inventory levels are
higher than a normal utility operating in a closed geographical area. Table 1
shows that PLN's positions in 1984/85 were slightly higher than or comparable
with neighboring countries.
9.        PLN's internal investigation has revealed that its inventory manage-
ment needs considerable strengthening. Actions have 'oeen planned or taken to
improve efficiency in this area.  A sensitivity test ahows that if the inven-
tory level (excluding fuel) were to =aintain at a level double the projected
one in 1990/91, the resulting inc-ease ,i working capital requirement would be
about Rp 200 billion.

- as x of construction expenditure           13.2          27.7           15.4
Cash Management and Liquidity
10.       The overriding objectives of cash management include providing funds
for day-to-day transaction needs, developing and implementing programs and
providing for overall liquidity. An effective cash management program depends
an continued review of the current pattern of income receipts and disburse-
ments, known future requirements, and other sources of funds. In this regard,
PIN's cash management needs considerable strengthening. A review of PLN's
cash balance indicates that the level fluctuates widely from year to year. It
is important that PLN formalize its cash management functions, develop more
sophisticated cash-control techniques and prepare accurate regular daily and
other periodical cash-flow forecasts.
11.       External factors also contribute to the fluctuation in PLN's cash
balance levels. First, PLN depends on the Government's approval for capital
expenditures, but the budget approval and release procedures are complex and
time-consuming. In addition, because the cost of local borrowing from commer-
cial banks is high (interest rates of 18-20% p.a.), PLN is increasingly rely-
ing on borrowings from Government banks at Government subsidized interest
rates (currently 6% p.a.). However, PILN's borrowings from Government banks
are subjected to Government's lengthy approval. Any delay has thus reduced
the flexibility and effectiveness of PLN's cash management. It is essential
that the Government expedite budget and borrowing approvals and streamline the
release procedures to avoid any unnecessary delays and uncertainties.

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts
1.        Inflation has been taken into account at the following rates (X):
1991 and
Year:1985    1986    1987    1988    1989    1990       after

Local costs /b          4.5    13.0    10.0      5.0     3.5     3.5        3.5
/a   Including indirect offshore costs, excluding fuel.
7D   Excluding indirect offshore costs and fuel.
2.        Separation of accounts of PLN's operations in Java and outside Java
is based on individual accounts maintained by PLN for each of its regional
units. These accounts are separate except for overhead expenses and debt
service payments which, for the purposes of financial projections, have been
allocated proportionately on the basis of unit sales of energy.
3.        Revenues assume a tariff increase of about 25% at the beginning of
FY88/89, and further tariff increases of about 7% in FY89/90 and about 10% in
FY90/91 for PLN to achieve and maintain (i) for its operations in Java, annual
rates of return of not less than 8% from FY88/89 onwards; and (ii) for its
operations outside Java a break-even situation from FY90/91 onwards. A coun-
trywide uniform tariff is assumed throughout the forecast period.
4.        Fuel/bulk power is derived directly from PLN's planting schedule.
The fuel costs for FY86/87 and beyond are based on PLN's Financial Projection
Report, dated November 12, 1986; all costs have been adjusted to reflect the
currency devaluation in September 1986. The fuel prices to PLN are not
escalated on the assumption that the current domestic fuel prices will remain
at or above the projected international prices through FY92/93.
5.        Operating expenses, other than fuel and personnel expenses, have
been forecast taking into account the facilities expected to be in use each
year, and subject to foreign and local cost inflation, as approprigte.
Personnel expenses are assumed to increase at an overall rate of 6Z p.a. in
line with expected productivity gains.
6.        Depreciation is based on the application of PLN's normal rates
(straight-line method) to assets revalued annually. For purposes of corporate



- 68 -
ANNEX 15
Page 2
income tax, the current Indonesian tax code permits the use of the accelerated
method of depreviation of assets in operation instead of the straight-line
method.
7.        Financing.  Average terms of foreign borrowings are assumed to be
20 years' repayment period with 5 years' grace, and at an average interest
rate of 10% p.a.  Average terms of local borrowings, which are to be from
Government-owned banks, are asiumed to be 12 years with two years' grace, at
an interest rate of 6% p.a.; any interest charges in excess of 6Z p.a. are
assumed to be borne directly by Government.
8.        Capital expenditures are based on PLN's investment program (Annex 5)
and exclude costs of geothermal steam field development which are assumed to
be incurred by another agency. The 10% Value Added Tax (VAT) on the foreign
contracts is assumed to be borne by Government, and on the local contracts it
is assumed to be borne by PLN.
9.        Net fized assets, work in progress and consumers' contributions are
revalued annually, up to FY86/87 according to Government Regulation
No. 45/1986, dated October 2, 1986, and from FY87/88 onwards, according to
weighted annual escalation rates (foreign and local). The rate base is the
average of the revalued net fixed assets in operation, less revalued con-
sumers- contributions. The rate base does not include work in progress.
10.       Customer accounts receivables ari assumed at 50 days of energy
revenues.
11.       Transmission and Distribution (T&D) system losses are assumed to
reduce by about 2% in FY86/87 to a level of about 18Z, and to gradually
decline thereafter to a level of about 13.3Z in FY92/93.
12.       Substitution of fuel oil in selected existing plants in Java by
natural gas is assumed by FY88/89 when gas-based generation is projected to
account for about 20% of total energy generation in Java.
13.       For PLN's operations outside Java, implementation of an action plan
to improve the efficiency of these operations (e.g., reduction of T&D system
losses) and to reduce costs, is assumed for the forecast period.
14.       All projections are assumed net of Corporate tax.

Notes:  1.  The generatlon investements are for the projects scheduled to be commissioned in the period 1987 to
1990.
2.  Fuel costs have been worked out by operation simulation by PLN.  The costs are assessed at the
international level, prevailing in September 1986, a. follows:  coal, S40 per tonne; fuel oil, U.M8.0
per liter.
3.  Shadow Pricing  About 60% of the investment program consists of equipment and materials imported at
offshore prices. As there is no shadow price for the foreign exchange, this component does not need
shadow pricing. Out of the remaining 40%, about 207 would be for local materials with shadow price
factor of 0.80, IOZ for unskilled labor with shadow price factor of 0.65 and 102 for skilled labor with
shadow price factor at 1.0, since skilled labor is scar'e. Hence the composite shadow price factor for
the total investment cost works out to 0.925.
