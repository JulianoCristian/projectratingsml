of electric power, and also\n            to improve the economic and technical efficiency of energy\n            supply and use.  In particular, the project will:  (a)\n            expand transmission and substation facilities in Java to\n            efficiently utilize the planned addition to generating\n            capacity and (b) extend distribution facilities in the\n            Jakarta, Tangerang, Bogor and Bekasi areas to supply\n            electricity to industries, commercial consumers and about\n            250,000 new residential consumers.  In addition, the project\n            will (c) expand the National Electricity Authority (PLN)\n            center for testing and certifying indigenous products and\n            for researching utility-oriented problems; and (d) provide\n            consulting services.  The latter component will (i) assist\n            PLN's Engineering Services Center; (ii) continue the\n            detailed engineering of a coal fired thermal power plant at\n            Paiton in East Java; and (iii) define and implement measures\n            to improve PLN's operating efficiency."}, "docdt": "1986-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
