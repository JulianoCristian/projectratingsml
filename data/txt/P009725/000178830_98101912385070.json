      which will in turn be grouped into about 25 cooperative milk\n            marketing federations; (b) the construction of dairy\n            processing facilities with a total incremental capacity of\n            about 5 million liters per day; (c) the provision of\n            packaging, distribution and transport facilities to handle\n            the marketing of project milk; (d) the provision of storage\n            and long-distance transport facilities to support the\n            establishment of a buffer-stock of dairy products and the\n            development of a national marketing network to balance\n            inter-regional disparities in milk supply and demand; and\n            (e) the provision of training, research, and technical assistance."}, "docdt":
