                         will be completed by June 30, 2014 and 40 others - by November 30, 2014. The study on the "Institutional reforms and Research Management", one of the two critical studies for the
                         operationalization of the Amended BARC Act, has been completed, validated and disclosed. However, the second study on "Financial Management Code" suffered from important
                         delays which is a critical backdrop to lay the foundation for the follow up operation. Moreover, CIGs have emerged as valuable village level farmer organizations for implementation of

                         special drive for improving farmers access to quality seeds led to establishment of many farmer groups as seeds producing SMEs. The home grown model of Farmer Information and
                         Advisory Centers have proved their effectiveness as single window access closer to the farmers and housed within the local government complex. The pilot on Supply Chain
                         Development business model has been expanded from 10 to 20 upazilla with a broadened package of 42 post- harvest technologies along with a network of 25 Commodity Collection
                         and Marketing Centers. The processing of all procurement packages are about to be completed, except for BARC and HORTEX which may hold back the current rising trend of
                         disbursement. An action plan has been agreed with the project team for proper completion of all unfinished tasks.
