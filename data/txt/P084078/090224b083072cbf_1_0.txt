﻿AUDIT OPINION ON SOE
We have audited the accompanying Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) of the "National Agricultural
Technology Project (NATP) Phase-I" Financed by IDA under Credit No. 4386-739-BD for the year 2013-
2014. The claim on the basis of SOEs are the responsibility of management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the SOEs based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
(INTOSAI), Auditing Standards and Government Auditing Standards. These Standards require that we plan
and conduct the audit to provide reasonable assurance that the SOEs are free of material misstatements.
The audit includes verifying the SOEs with the accounting records, supporting documents, and physical
inspection of the work carried out, the goods and services acquired and with the Credit Agreement. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, with regard to the SOEs, adequate supporting documents have been maintained to
support the claims to IDA for reimbursement of the expenditures incurred and that the expenditures are
eligible for financing under the Credit Agreement.
