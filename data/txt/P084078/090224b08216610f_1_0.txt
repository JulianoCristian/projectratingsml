                         The project team is completing documentation to finalize an additional $7 million grant from USAID to scale-up and deepen project activities in critical areas.

                         The project continues to make commendable progress in implementing agricultural research activities: 199 research projects have been funded, over 40% of which address
                         Bangladesh’s most agro-ecologically constrained ecosystems; the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council's Governing Board has been reconstituted with 30 members; and a

                         Research Grant for the National Agricultural Research System institutes has been established. Demonstrations of improved agricultural technologies are steadily rolling out, and over
                         1 million farmers have adopted new technologies. To increase the institutional capacity of the National Agricultural Research System 108 PhD candidates are being supported by the
                         project. An additional 528 staff have gone on exposure training in the last six months.

                         Twelve public institutions are implementing a total of 108 Sponsored Public Good Research projects. Significant progress has been made on developing high yielding saline tolerant
                         and high yielding aromatic rice varieties. Improved agricultural packages have been released to extension for dissemination—including, leaf-curl disease free tomato for all seasons
                         and farmer-friendly integrated pest management technology. Ninety-two Competitive Grant Research grants have been awarded where public institutions are working with non-
                         government organizations (27) and about 2500 farmers. Thus far, their reported achievements include: high yielding varieties of lentils, chickpea, mung bean, mustard, and black
                         gram; tissue-culture for banana plantlets; integrated land-use and management; coconut mite control; and citrus canker control. The latter contributed to restoring citrus exports to the
                         UK after a 3-year suspension.

                         The project team will focus on completing long-awaited studies for institutional reforms and to further strengthen the effectiveness of farmers organizations and ensuring their
                         sustainability.
