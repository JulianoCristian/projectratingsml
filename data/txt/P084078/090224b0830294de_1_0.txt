1.
      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      At appraisal, the agriculture sector in Bangladesh accounted for 23% of the gross
domestic product (GDP) and the rural non-farm economy, which is directly connected to
agriculture contributed another 33% of GDP. Despite substantial progress in overall
poverty reduction, about half of the population still lived below the poverty line. Around
85% of the total poor lived in rural areas. Therefore, improved economic performance of
agriculture and rural non-farm sectors was considered critical to reducing poverty.
2.      The agriculture sector was, and continues to be, characterized by small farm size
and rice-dominated farming systems. The productivities of rice, wheat, maize and those
for other commodities in fisheries and livestock were largely stagnant. Acceleration of
agricultural growth was deemed to be constrained by: (i) weak technology generation
and transfer; (ii) deteriorating and declining natural resource base, especially cultivable
land; (iii) poor functioning of input and output markets and delivery of other
support services; (iv) low private sector investment in agro-processing; and (v)
weak local institutions to influence performance of the delivery of agricultural services
by government agencies, including the large agricultural technology system (i.e.
research and extension).
3.      The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) requested assistance from the World Bank
(the Bank) to increase public investment in agricultural research and to reform the
technology system to help achieve the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
objectives. In the Bank’s FY06-10 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), strengthening of
agricultural research and extension systems was identified as a key area to diversify
traditional crops into high value crops, develop non-crop agriculture (fisheries and
livestock) and intensify rice-based cropping systems. Also, the Bank’s earlier study on
the National Agricultural Technology System (NATS) identified key areas for reform to
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the technology system.
1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
4.      The original PDO was to support Government of Bangladesh’s program to improve
the effectiveness of NATS and to improve agricultural productivity and farm income.
5.      Achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following outcome indicators:
(i) number of farmers adopting new agricultural technologies or management practices by
size of landholding and type of farming system; (ii) increase in agricultural productivity;
and (iii) increase in household net incomes by farm size and type of farm.1



1
    There is an inconsistency between the key outcome indicators provided in the main text (page 8) and the Results
    Framework and Monitoring (Annex 3) of PAD. Since the Results Framework was used as the primary monitoring tool
    throughout the implementation, the outcome indicators provided in the Results Framework were used here.




                                                         1
1.3        Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
6.     The revised PDO was “to improve the effectiveness of NATS as measured by
increases in agricultural productivity and farm income in selected districts”.
7.      The PDO was revised to articulate it more specifically in terms of increased
agricultural productivity and farm income in the project target areas. The key indicators to
measure the achievement of the revised PDO were modified as: (i) increases in agricultural
productivity; and (ii) increases in household income by farm size. Also, there was a
refinement in the Intermediate Outcome Indicators, along with an increase in the target
values associated with program scale-up resulting from the approval of Additional
Financing (AF) funded by USAID Trust Fund (USAID TF). However, as lengthy
Government AF approval procedures reduced the implementation period for the scaled up
AF activities significantly, it was decided not to sign and activate the AF. Consequently,
the refined indictors were retained but the targets were formally scaled back to the “without
AF” situation.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
8.      Overall, at appraisal, the total number of households to benefit directly from the
project was estimated to be 330,000 and the total number of beneficiaries 1.65 million. Key
beneficiaries were divided into different groups as follows:
          Marginal, small and medium farmers2. These were small and medium-size farmers,
           who would participate in the project through memberships in CIGs and non-CIG
           farmers, who would adopt the new technologies as part of knowledge and
           technology transfer activities;
          Private entrepreneurs. These were private entrepreneurs, who were to participate
           in value chain improvement interventions under the project including local traders
           and processors in Upazillas;
          National research and extension staff. A large number of researchers and extension
           staff of the national research and extension systems were also expected to benefit
           directly from the project through long-term (PhD and Masters level) studies, short-
           term on-the-job training programs and other capacity building activities.
1.5        Original Components
9.     The project had four components: (i) Agricultural Research Support; (ii)
Agricultural Extension Support; (iii) Development of Supply Chains; and (iv) Project
Management and Coordination and was co-financed by IDA, IFAD, and GoB. 3 The
individual components are summarized as follows:



2
    An average marginal farmer has 0.2 ha of land, small farmer 0.5 ha of land and medium farmer 2.1 ha of land.




3
    Around 74% of total project cost was financed by IDA, 23% by IFAD, and 3% by GoB respectively.




                                                            2
(i)       Component 1: Agricultural Research Support (US$27.3 million). This component
          aimed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the National Agricultural
          Research System (NARS). The component had a national coverage and financed: (a)
          competitive grants program (CGP); (b) Sponsored Public Goods Research (SPGR);
          and (c) activities for enhancing institutional efficiencies of NARS.
(ii)     Component 2: Agricultural Extension Support (US$38.2 million). This component
         aimed to establish a decentralized, knowledge-based, demand-led extension service
         with greater accountability and responsiveness to farmers, with a focus on small and
         marginal farmers. The project was to cover about 25% of all districts/upazillas
         during first phase and finance the following activities: (a) mobilization of CIGs; (b)
         decentralization of extension service; and (c) enhancing the institutional efficiency
         of national institutions involved in agricultural extension.

(iii) Component 3: Development of Supply Chains (US$4.0 million). For increasing and
      diversifying sources of income for small and marginal farmers, the development of
      supply chains of selected commodities was to be supported on a pilot basis. The
      project financed activities related to: (a) strengthening farmer-market linkages; and
      (b) enhancing institutional efficiencies of supply chain organizations.
(iv) Component 4: Project Management and Coordination (US$4.4 million). The
     Ministry of Agriculture (MOA - lead agency) and the Ministry of Fisheries and
     Livestock (MOFL) were the lead project implementing agencies. The Project
     Coordination Unit (PCU) at the MOA coordinated and facilitated the project
     implementation in collaboration with Project Implementation Units (PIUs) based at
     individual agencies.4
1.6         Revised Components
10.      During implementation, there was no change in the four components of the project.
An Additional Financing was approved on February 6, 2014 involving a scale up of key
activities (SPGR sub-projects, CGP sub-projects, establishment of additional CIGs,
additional Farmers’ Information and Advice Centers (FIACs), and additional Commodity
Collection and Marketing Centers (CCMCs)) as well as expansion of the project area
(additional six districts and 30 Upazilas). However, as lengthy Government AF approval
procedures significantly reduced the period available for implementation of the scaled up
AF activities, the Government and Bank management decided not to sign and activate the
AF, but to shift these resources to the proposed follow-on operation. Subsequently, the
component targets were rolled back to the without-AF situation through another project
restructuring on October 21, 2014. As a result, eventually there was no change in the scope
of the original project components.
1.7         Other significant changes



4
     Project Implementation Units were located at: Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), Department of Fisheries
    (DOF), Department of Livestock Services (DLS), Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC), Krishi
    Gobeshona Foundation (KGF), and the Horticulture Export Development Foundation (Hortex).

11.     During project implementation seven restructurings (one level- I and five level-II)
were approved and implemented. The following specific changes were introduced under
the respective restructurings:
(i)    On March 31, 2008, GoB’s contribution to total project costs was changed from 5%
       to 3% in Financing Agreement to reflect the accurate amount of GoB’s contribution
       as shown in the project cost table (Level II).
(ii)   On December 23, 2012 some inconsistencies between the Development Project
       Proposal and the Financing Agreement were resolved. Also, the Financing
       Agreement was amended to reflect the following: establishment of a Procurement
       Core Team (PCT), reallocation/change in financing percentages, definition of CIGs,
       and Operating Costs (level II).
(iii) On December 2, 2013 the IDA Credit closing date was extended by one year from
      December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 to allow the project to finish uncompleted
      activities caused by delays in project implementation (level II).
(iv) On February 6, 2014, (a) an AF in the amount of US$7.1 million to support the scale-
     up of NATP, and (b) a reallocation of Credit proceeds were approved by the Regional
     Vice President and (c) three new indicators to capture the quantitative achievements
     related to new technologies adopted, newly established CCMCs, and FIACs..
     (combined AF and level I).
(v)    On March 4, 2014, (a) the PDO was revised; (b) safeguard policies on environmental
       assessment, pest management, and indigenous peoples were triggered; and (c) the
       environmental category of the project was re-classified from C to B (combined AF
       and level I).
(vi) On October 21, 2014, PDO level targets and intermediate outcome indicators were
     rolled back to the without-AF situation because, due to insufficient time for
     implementation, it was decided not to proceed with the AF (level II).
(vii) On December 30, 2014, IDA savings in the amount of SDR 2.12 million of the Credit
      (US$2.98 million equivalent) were cancelled. The cancellation was caused by
      implementation delays in project activities resulting from the protracted approval
      process of revisions to the Development Project Proposal (DPP) related to the
      February 2014 reallocation of Credit proceeds. Until RDPP approval, the project
      could not finance expenditures exceeding prior component/activity allocation
      ceilings. The cancelled IDA savings were used for other Bank activities in
      Bangladesh (level II).
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
12.     GoB’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) gave high priority to accelerating
agricultural growth to increase rural income, reduce poverty, and improve food security.
The PRSP identified increased productivity, diversification into High-Value
Agriculture (HVA) and post-harvest value addition as the key drivers of future growth. The
project preparation benefited from Bank’s study on Bangladesh’s NATS and Operations
Evaluation Department’s (OED) project performance assessment, which highlighted the


                                            4
importance of addressing the unfinished institutional reform agenda, including governance
and autonomy issues of NARS as well as decentralization of extension service at district
and lower levels.
13.     The project design focused on intensification of rice-based cropping systems,
diversification to high value crops and development of non-crop agriculture (fisheries and
livestock), which were identified as key agriculture priorities in Bank's FY06-09 CAS. The
project design paid particular attention to agriculture commercialization. It carefully
designed pilot activities focusing on selected commodities identified through the Bank
study on promotion of HVA commodities. The project also promoted a decentralized
participatory planning and market-led integration in the supply chains. The pilot approach
was chosen to ensure that small and marginal farmers, already resource-poor, were not
exposed to undesirable risks which would affect them adversely. The project design took
into account the lack of in-country capacity in promoting market-led HVA specifically
involving small and marginal farmers and provided for international technical assistance.
14.     The project was designed as the first phase of a three-phase Adaptable Program
Loan (APL) based on the recognition that there is a need for long-term engagement in the
sector to complete the institutional reforms in research and agricultural extension systems.
This approach was consistent with GoB’s policy to avoid the 'stop and go' development
pattern experienced in the past and linked to cycles of the externally-funded projects.
15.     The reforms and institutional changes proposed under the project such as
reorganizing BARC; developing new models for research funding to attract private sector,
civil society, NGO stakeholders in implementing farmers-needs driven agriculture research,
and decentralizing agriculture extension agencies with bottom-up and participatory
approach were critically important design features for bringing a greater efficiency to
NATSs.
16.     However, the project design underestimated the complexity of the tasks involved
and the time required for enacting the BARC Act and later on in developing the rules for
its smooth implementation. The enactment of BARC Act was the disbursement condition
of the Agriculture Research Component. Failure to obtain its timely approval led to delays
in the implementation of the component.
17.     The project was designed to bring together research, extension and value chain
development aspects involving multiple agencies for implementation and requiring a more
robust coordination mechanism, better role clarity and more explicit accountability
arrangements for the agencies involved than the design of the project might have originally
anticipated.
18.     The Results Framework had some deficiencies including some lack of clarity in the
definition of the PDO and outcome monitoring indicators. In some cases quantitative
targets were ambiguous; for instance, the target increase in agricultural productivity
provided in the Results Framework was given a combined percentage increase for all three
types of farmers without providing a clear methodology how they were combined5. This


5
    See Table 2, page 43, Annex 3 of PAD.




                                             5
created confusion during implementation and consequently the PDO, monitoring indicators
and some of the target values needed revisions at MTR. Even though a comprehensive risk
assessment was conducted, the risk associated with delay in amendments to BARC Act
was not foreseen at design stage.
2.2    Implementation
19.     Overcoming the initial delays in implementation, the project was eventually able to
deliver all key outputs. The implementation was flexible and responded effectively to
various challenges encountered during the project period. The highlights of specific
challenges and issues that the project faced during implementation, how they were
addressed and key timelines are discussed below.
20.      The project suffered from some serious delays in the beginning due to: (i) slow
recruitment of PMU staff; (ii) weak implementation capacities of participating agencies;
and (iii) difficulties associated with enactment of BARC Act and establishment of new
institutions. The project was approved in February, 2008 but it took 11 months to appoint
a full-time Project Director (PD) for the PCU, and several more months to recruit PCU
technical experts. Also, the implementation of the Research Support Component could not
start until December 2009 due to delays in the amendment of the BARC Act, which was a
disbursement condition of this component. Owing to weak capacities of implementing
agencies and teething problems of new and/or revitalized institutions such as the Krishi
Gobeshona Foundation (KGF) and Horticulture Export Development Foundation (Hortex),
the implementation of the agriculture research and supply chain components also
experienced delays. This resulted in downgrading of project implementation progress to
‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’ in June 2009.
21.    In response to this, the GoB renewed its commitment for reforms in agriculture
research, extension, and the project management team stepped up its efforts to resolve the
issues hindering the implementation progress. By the end of 2009, GoB approved the
BARC Act amendment, filled key staffing positions, developed a comprehensive CIG
mobilization strategy and revitalized the implementation process. As a result, in March
2010, project performance was upgraded to ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ status.
22.     The project MTR conducted in March 2012 assessed that all performance triggers
required to move from Phase I to Phase II of the 15 year APL were satisfactorily fulfilled:
(i) Amendment of BARC Act; (ii) Establishment of KGF; and (iii) Decentralization of
planning and funding responsibilities for demand-led extension micro plans to the Upazilla
level organization.
23.      Overall, despite the delays experienced during the initial period, most of the
activities of the Project were completed by the closing date when disbursement reached
around 92% of the target and US$2.98 million was cancelled mainly because some
activities related to SPGR grants, training and consulting services could not be completed
as planned. The savings resulted from cancellation were recommitted to the Country
program.
2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
24.     The Results Framework provided an adequate basis for assessing results, after some
deficiencies were corrected through restructuring. Performance of the M&E system was


                                            6
satisfactory, and during implementation, key physical outputs and outcomes were regularly
monitored through Management Information System (MIS) and these were reported during
regular Bank missions. At the outset of project implementation, a comprehensive M&E
strategy was developed and roles and responsibilities of each Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) (e.g. BARC, KGF, Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), Department of
Fisheries (DOF), Department of Livestock Services (DLS), and Hortex) for data collection,
analysis and reporting were defined. The overall responsibility of the project M&E and
reporting rested with the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and each PIU had its own M&E
Cell, which was tasked to design specific M&E plans to monitor and evaluate the project
activities and report progress on key performance indicators.
25.     During implementation, two independent assessments were carried out to review
the implementation progress and assess project impacts. As part of these independent
assessments, a series of stakeholder workshops (organized at strategically important
locations of project area) and surveys were carried out to obtain feedback from key
beneficiaries including farmers.
26.    Also, a five-member independent Experts Impact Assessment Team (EIAT),
composed of experienced specialists in economics, rural development and rural institutions,
representatives from farmers’ associations and the private sector was established, which
reviewed the implementation progress of M&E and commissioned independent impact
assessment studies. Findings of EIAT were reported to the Project Steering Committee
(PSC).
27.     However, some shortcomings related to M&E were observed during
implementation, which were subsequently rectified: (i) PIUs of implementing agencies
(except at BARC) could not develop their own MISs as were originally designed; (ii) lack
of coordination between the M&E at PCU and M&E Cells of PIUs; and (iii) M&E Cells
did not document project achievements and results more systematically; and (iv) Capacities
of M&E staff at PIUs were weak.

28.     At the end of project implementation, the reports of M&E system, along with the
independent impact assessment reports, served as the key source of data and information
for assessing the project outcomes.
2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
29.     Social safeguards. Safeguard Management Notes were mandatory for all sub-
project proposals and those requiring private land, or requiring the displacement of people
from either private or public lands were automatically rejected. Under the supply chain
development component, CCMCs were constructed on public land which required no
displacement or resettlement activities.
30.     The safeguard policy on Indigenous Peoples (O.P 4.10) was triggered because the
project area had some pockets with Indigenous People. However, specific plans were not
developed because project specific activities were not implemented in areas of
concentration of Indigenous Peoples. The research component of the project covered the
whole country and some demonstrations were carried out to show higher value agricultural
alternatives and livelihood improvement processes in areas with presence of Indigenous



                                            7
Peoples, but these activities were undertaken on a consultative and voluntary basis and
have been documented. The compliance with Indigenous Peoples policy is rated as
Satisfactory.
31.    Environmental Safeguards and Management. Envisaging no negative
environmental impacts in the design phase, the project was originally classified as Category
C and consequently, no safeguard policies were triggered. An Environmental Management
Framework (EMF) was developed as a proactive measure to minimize any likely adverse
impact of legally allowed pesticides that may occur during storage, handling and use. In
addition, certain items, which are likely to have adverse environmental implications were
excluded from implementation and listed in the EMF. However, realizing the risk of
increased use of pesticides and chemical fertilizer and trial of new crops in the technology
demonstrations involving crop, livestock, and fisheries, the Bank Task Team changed the
safeguard classification of the project during restructuring in February 2014 from Category
C to Category B and recommended that the project should adopt an adequate mechanism
for environmental screening and monitoring. Adoption of green technologies was also
recommended for environmental enhancement. The process triggered safeguard policies
on Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Pest Management (OP 4.09).
Compliance with these policies is rated as satisfactory.
32.     The project adopted a process of environmental data collection and monitoring and
also introduced a system for environmental screening of newly-constructed CCMCs, but
the process of environmental screening was not introduced for other eligible micro-plans.
The environmental monitoring system established by DAE, DLS, and DOF also recorded
the positive impacts of the environmental management activities carried out under the
project in terms of increased usage of organic manure, and biogas thus saving a sizeable
amount of urea, pesticides. Also, under the project trainings were organized for farmers on
poultry litter and carcass management.6 The project regularly disclosed its environmental
monitoring data on the website for the general public.
33.     Financial Management. The overall accounting and reporting system was
reasonably functional at district/Upazilla, and Union levels. The Financial Management
Systems (FMS) at PCU and PIU levels functioned adequately and regular quarterly and
annual audit reports were compiled and consolidated on timely basis. There is no pending
audit issue for the project. However, because of the project management structure
involving multiple PIUs and PCU and different requirements of participating funding
agencies (IDA, IFAD, and GOB), the FMS was complex in nature and sometimes ran into
difficulties when it came to timely reporting and consolidation of financial reports from
different accounting centers across the country, and incomplete fund reconciliation
between PCU and PIUs.
34.    Procurement. The procurement process and contract management experienced
some initial delays. At the PMU level there was a team of two procurement consultants


6
    Under the project, farmers used 85,000 tons of organic manure in the crop field, thus reducing the usage of urea by
    11,000 tons and pesticides by 3,800 tons. Through the implementation of biogas plan farmers also reduced the fuel
    usage by 2,000 tons. Around 82,000 farmers received trainings on poultry litter and carcass management.




                                                           8
and each PIU had a procurement consultant. At the PIU level, there was high turnover
among the procurement specialists. Project procurement plans were implemented largely
successfully. Overall, more than 50 procurement plans were prepared during the project
implementation period, the consolidation of these into fewer numbers of packages would
probably have resulted in more efficient execution. This lesson learnt will be used in
NATP-2, where common procurement items will be consolidated into larger packages. The
meetings of PCTs placed more emphasis on implementation of procurement plans and
documenting site visits, rather than focusing on improving capacity development,
sustainability and process performance. During project implementation there was a strong
presence of technical experts in the PCU along with reasonable in-house procurement
capacity at DAE. However, procurement management capacities at other IAs were weak.
Overall, the management setup and coordination mechanism for procurement between
PCU and PIUs turned out to be challenging, requiring frequent attention and follow-up.
2.5        Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
35.     The project was the first phase of a three-phase APL with the overall objective to
improve the effectiveness of NATS in Bangladesh. Based on the achievements and lessons
learned from the current project (see Section 6.1: Lessons Learned), the second phase,
National Agricultural Technology Project-2 (NATP-2) has been designed.7 NATP-2 will
continue promoting demand-driven, decentralized, agricultural technology system and will
focus on sub-sectors such as crop, fisheries, and livestock anchored in a cross-sector
research interventions. NATP-2 will also continue supporting BARC in implementing its
reform agenda on agriculture research by promoting strategic partnerships with
international research organizations on research management at BARC and develop
technical and strategic skills at Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) and
Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI).
36.     NATP-2 will scale-up the project activities to 56 districts.8 It significantly expands
on pilot activities for supply chain development carried out under the NATP and gives
greater focus on enhancing access to market opportunities. Based on lessons learned under
the project, NATP-2 will also adopt more consolidated implementation arrangement
especially on fiduciary management aspects.
37.     The project supported the establishment of new rural institutions such as KGF and
CCMCs and also helped revitalize existing organizations such as Hortex. The Government
has expressed its intention to continue supporting these institutions. BARC now has an
expanded mandate in which it will directly receive funding from the Government to
distribute to all agricultural research institutes.
3.         Assessment of Outcomes9


7
    NATP-2 was approved by the Board on June 5, 2015.
8
  Horizontal expansions are expected in 31 new districts and vertical expansions are expected in the remaining 25
  districts.
9
  There was a formal revision of PDO through Level-I restructuring. However, the split rating was not used to evaluate
  the project outcome. Instead, a single rating was used against the original project targets because: i) PDO revision was
  related to articulation rather than change in substance; ii) Level I restructuring was done only six months before project
  closing date when 93% of project expenditure was already disbursed.


                                                             9
3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
38.     The PDO remained highly relevant throughout the entire implementation period.
The project supported a broader GoB program aimed at increasing food security and
agricultural production through a revitalization of the NATS. In the 2011 Bangladesh
Country Investment Plan, a sustainable and diversified agriculture through integrated
research and extension has been identified as a priority area for support. Further, the
National Agricultural Extension Policy and the BARC Act approved/enacted in 2012
promote the development of decentralized, integrated, demand-driven agricultural research
and extension services.
39.     The project objective and scope are in line with the Bank’s current corporate
strategic goals of eradicating extreme poverty while promoting shared prosperity at the
global level and its strategic involvement in Bangladesh. In the Bank’s Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for Bangladesh for FY11-14 (extended to FY15), agriculture is highlighted
under Pillar 3: Vulnerability, Adaptation and Inclusion and Pillar 2: Economic Growth.
40.     Also, project objectives and scope are fully aligned with IFAD’s current Country
Strategic Opportunities Program for Bangladesh (2012-18) and its support for the NATS,
which specifically defines improved value chains and greater market access for small
producers and entrepreneurs as its strategic objective. IFAD’s strategic objective is to be
achieved through promoting innovative technology and enabling producers to acquire the
knowledge and skills needed to access input and output markets. At the time of Level 1
restructuring (PDO refinement to enhance measurability), the objective, design, and
implementation arrangements remained relevant. The PDO, design and implementation
features of the project at closure continued to remain relevant and have been incorporated
into a new phase project- NATP-2, approved by the Board on June 5, 2015.
41.     The project design remained highly relevant to the current development agenda of
agricultural research and extension systems in the country as it promoted high priority,
pluralistic, participatory and demand-led agricultural research including institutional
reforms of NARS and supported decentralized, participatory, demand-led and knowledge-
based agricultural extension service delivery. The development of market-driven supply
chain remains to be a highly relevant approach in resolving the key constraints of the sector,
as also reflected in the design of NATP-2.
42.    Project implementation was highly relevant by effectively responding to changing
needs and circumstances. It focused on performance improvements of government
agencies and NGOs working at Union and village levels and promoted decentralized and
demand driven extension service delivery.
3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives
43.   The PDO was fully achieved. The outcome indicators for productivity and farm
income achieved their targets. The outcomes achieved under the project are summarized




                                             10
below (detailed project outputs by components are in the project datasheet and in Annex
2). The productivity and household income increases could not be immediately compared
with their target values because the actual achievements could not be presented in the form
of combined growth targets as were reported at appraisal. However, the actual productivity
and income increases reported in range values clearly indicate that they were either
substantially achieved or achieved their target values. Also the actual achievements in crop
yields and household income increases were significantly higher than their baseline values
as discussed in para 45 below.
44.    Further, out of 13 agreed intermediate outcome indicators as detailed in the
datasheet, five indicators exceeded stipulated targets, six indictors were fully achieved, and
two indicators were substantially achieved.
45.    Over the past five years, in the project area, per ha yield of crops increased between
29-99%; and the productivity of livestock increased by 6-71%, and that of fisheries by 107-
193% against their baseline values. During the same period, household income increased
for marginal farmers between 47-135%, for small farmers between 31-92%, and for
medium-farmers between 23-77% against their baseline values. 10 Compared with the
control group, average farm household income in the project area increased between 6-
43% for various commodities.
46.     The key outcomes achieved under the project are summarized below (detailed
project outputs by components are in Annex 2).
A.          Agricultural Research Support
47.     Competitive Grants Program (CGP) and the Establishment of KGF: The project
successfully established KGF - a new non-profit organization, which served as a pluralistic
entity, where public and private sector entities and NGOs could participate in the
implementation of agricultural research. The competitive grants mechanism promoted
through KGF was demonstrated as an effective and efficient11 vehicle of collaboration and
inclusion of non-conventional actors in agricultural research. CGPs contributed to
enhancing responsiveness of research to the immediate needs and challenges of small and
marginal famers through on-farm research and adaptation. They facilitated the
implementation of site-specific and demand-driven research activities. Under the project,
84 CGPs were implemented substantially achieving their target of 100 CGPs.12 A total of
47 non-NARS partners participated in CGP against the target of 69. However, the fund




10
     Detailed productivity and household income increases are provided in Annex 2 (para 1).

11   The presence of the GB and BoD gave the required flexibility (in terms of quick decision making regarding resource
     allocation and priority areas of research) to be responsive and adjust to emerging challenges of research which was
     lacking in the public sector research system.

allocated to non-NARS partners reached 59% of total CGP budget significantly exceeding
the targeted 30%.13
48.     Sponsored Public Goods Research (SPGR): The project also supported a
significant amount of high-priority strategic and cross-cutting research works the national
Agricultural Research Institutes (ARIs) coordinated by BARC. Under this scheme a total
of 108 high priority sub-projects were completed exceeding their target of 45 SPRGs14
covering 12 eco-systems. About 24% of all SPRGs were focused on resolving agricultural
technology issues related to vulnerable and climate stressed agro-ecological zones of the
country (salinity/coastal, climate change affected, Hills, Hoar, Drought, Char and flood
affected zones). Under the project, BARC prepared a Vision Document on Agriculture for
2030 and beyond, 15 an important strategic document on national agricultural research.
49.     Improved Legal Framework for the National Agricultural Research System (NARS).
An important outcome of the project was that it successfully supported the amendment of
the 1996 BARC Act. The amendment improved the governance, institutional
responsibilities and management system of NARS. The amendment also gave BARC an
enhanced role in leading research coordination, prioritization and allocation of resources
at the national level and strengthened its role in monitoring and evaluation of research. The
amendment was approved by the Cabinet in December 2009 and passed by Parliament on
March 4, 2012. Initial critical steps required for operationalizing the amendment to BARC
started. To support the operationalization of amended BARC Act, the project developed
two strategically important documents - Financial Codes Study and Institutional
Development Manual – with key recommendations on enhancing transparency, financial
autonomy and institutional effectiveness of NARS.16
50.      The project also successfully funded 108 PhD scholarships both at national and
international research and academic institutions fully achieving their target of 109 17 in
critically important agricultural research areas, which were identified through a
comprehensive skills gap analysis at the national level.18 The project also supported the

     The Financial Code Study was to help implement transparent and well monitored financial autonomy of the NARS
     institutes, segregating the capital investment fund for research infrastructure and project based operational funds
     based on merits, robustness and matching with research agenda. The Institutional Development Manual was to
     enhance the institutional effectiveness of the NARS system and build an internationally competent research service
     cadre to achieve national research priorities.

     Skills gaps identified were mainly in the area of molecular biology, biotechnology, agronomy, entomology amongst
     others (Source: Human Resources Development Plan for National Agricultural Research System in Bangladesh 2009
     -2025); Key sub-sectors identified for priority setting included crops, livestock, fisheries, natural resources (soil),


                                                             12
establishment of an integrated Agricultural Research Management Information System
(ARMIS) at BARC that linked 7 national agricultural research institutes. ARMIS
developed, tested, and rolled out 9 key modules in important areas such as financial
management, human resources management, inventory, library management, procurement,
research, training, vehicle and data bank. The project also established M&E Cells at all
networked institutions and trained all relevant personnel in data entry and management.
51.     In summary, by promoting greater competition in agricultural research through
pluralistic, demand-driven agricultural research and strengthening national research
capacities in strategic skills areas and by enhancing the legal and institutional frameworks
of the country’s agricultural research systems, this component directly contributes to the
overall project development objective of improving the effectiveness of the national
agricultural technology system.
B.         Agricultural Extension Support
52.     Farmer Institutions Established. The project established more than 20,000
Common Interest Groups (CIG) in crop, livestock, and fisheries sub-sectors.19 Being a
village-level producer organization, CIGs acted as key focal points for technology
demonstration, dissemination, field days, training as well as input supply (provision of
small equipment and machinery and seeds). A majority of CIG members were marginal
and small farmers: out of total 398,700 CIG member farmers, 81% were marginal and small
farmers. Despite substantial CIG achievements at village levels, efforts to aggregate them
into higher-level Producer Organizations to better facilitate farmers’ access to technical,
financial and marketing services were largely not achieved.
53.     Participatory extension service plans were prepared, implemented and the process
regularized and trainings organized. With direct project support, each year around 18,000
of village-level extension plans were prepared and implemented with direct participation
of CIG farmers. This amounts to 1,345 Union-level extension service plans fully achieving
their target of 1,345 plans.20 The participatory approach made the village-level extension
plans more demand- responsive and helped selecting most appropriate technologies for
farmers. The Union level then aggregated at Upazilla level and the process was regularized.
The project organized in total 394,900 client-days of training significantly exceeding its
target of 53,000 client-days of training.21 The project also supported the establishment of
732 Farmers’ Information and Advice Centers (FIACs) to provide farm advisory services




     human nutrition, agricultural economics, agricultural mechanization, ICT. PhD scholarships were awarded in areas
     of agronomy, molecular biology, biotechnology, entomology, soil science, biometric genetics, aquaculture and GIS.

19
     Of total CIGs, 67% were in crop, 19% in livestock, and 14% in fisheries subsectors.

to farmers at the union level achieving its target at 100%.22 Though the project was able to
achieve some convergence in the participatory program planning by the three line
extension agencies, actual implementation was done mostly by the three agencies
separately, thereby potentially missing out on opportunities for better synergy and
complementarity.
54.     Improved and new technology packages are developed and disseminated. Under
the project, a total of 48 location-specific improved and new technology packages (16 for
crops, 11 for livestock and 20 for fisheries) were developed and made available to farmers
for adoption exceeding their target of 25 technology packages.23 The technology packages
focused on: (i) resource use efficiency and yield gap minimization for rice-based cropping
system; (ii) diversification of the cropping system into high value crops; and (iii) livestock
and fishery productivity enhancement. For technology dissemination, demonstration plots,
farmer field days and formal farmer trainings were organized. An estimated 1.9 million
farmers adopted improved agricultural technologies significantly exceeding their target of
0.39 million farmers.24 This include 0.4 million adopters,25 who are CIG members and 1.5
million farmers outside the CIGs. Marginal farmers constituted 39% and small farmers
42% of total adopters. Though the project was able to improve the research–extension-
farmer linkage to some extent through strengthening of extension planning mechanism,
further improvements are needed to achieve lasting impacts. In addition, 50 collaborative
extension sub-projects were implemented achieving their target at 100%.26
55.      Improved National Agricultural Extension Policy. The project provided support to
the DAE in revising and improving the National Agricultural Extension Policy. The
updated policy promotes the adoption of demand-driven decentralized extension approach
in all programs of DAE; promoting low-cost high-impact, demand-responsive technology
packages for accelerated agricultural growth; and differentiated targeting to address the
challenges and opportunities from main agro-ecological and economically constrained
areas. The policy is in draft form pending approval by the Government.
56.    In summary, by establishing and supporting grass-root level farmers’ organizations
(CIGs) as the key platform for promoting more efficient extension services, and by
developing and disseminating improved and new technologies, this component directly

     Technology adoption is counted only once irrespective of number of technologies adopted by each farmer. These are
     sustained adopters of the technology as they are adopting technology packages for more than one year/season after
     getting exposed to the technology.

contributed to enhancing the overall effectiveness of the national agricultural technology
system.
C.         Development of Supply Chains
57.     Producer Organizations established. The project established 20 Producer
Organizations (PO) vertically integrating small and marginal farmers with agri-business
enterprises along the supply chains. This involved 402 village-level CIGs (against the
original target of 20 POs and 200 CIGs). The POs provided farmers with a new model to
reduce their post-harvest losses and realize their produce at better prices and provided
market information, trainings on post-harvest and marketing aspects.
58.     Post–harvest technologies demonstrated and disseminated for adoption. The
project successfully demonstrated and disseminated 32 new and improved post-harvest
technologies significantly exceeding the target of 20 new and improved post-harvest
technologies.27 As a result 21,810 farmers adopted these new and improved technologies
in improved sorting and grading, poly cap use in banana, use of gerbera cup, perforated
rose cap, pulsing treatment, ice packaging of rose, use of trolley, harvesting tools, zero
energy cooler, steeping technology in lemon, solar drier and modified atmospheric
packaging in vegetables and fruits, milk. These technologies helped reduce post-harvest
loss of high value commodities by 5 to 18%. In floriculture sector alone adoption of
recommended technologies helped farmers receive 60% higher price than non-adopters.
59.     A new model for CCMCs was developed and pilot tested. The project established
25 CCMCs at rural markets accessible by farmer groups, traders, and assemblers against
the targeted 25 CCMCs. 28 The CCMCs improved the marketing channels and links
between traders and farmers through mobilizing them from farm gate to rural and
urban/city markets for selling of their high value agricultural produces comparatively at
higher profit. The CCMCs were provided with facilities for washing, grading and in some
cases storing produces. Initial report suggests that CCMCs gained 10 to 15% more price
for their produce compared with local markets.
60.    Enhanced capacities. The capacities of about 1,500 farmers, traders, and line
agency officials were strengthened through a series of training programs, workshops,
domestic and international exposure visits and dissemination materials in areas such as
agri-business development, processing of flowers, herbals and honey products, contract
farming systems, post-harvest handling, storage, packaging, and fish marketing. In total
16,700 client-days of training were organized among beneficiaries of supply chain
component significantly exceeding their target of 10,000 client days of training.29

61.    In summary, by supporting new forms of vertical integration of farmers and
agribusiness enterprises, disseminating modern post-harvest technologies, and linking
farmers and market, this component directly contributes to enhancing the NATSs.
3.3 Efficiency
62.     Overall, the economic efficiency of the project was found to be substantial. Cost-
benefit analysis of the project was conducted over a 20-year period (see Annex 3 for
details) and costs and benefits were estimated at 2014 prices with a 12-percent opportunity
cost of capital. In the PAD, the project was expected to yield an Economic Internal Rate of
Return (EIRR) of about 35%. At ICR stage the mission conservatively assessed the
project’s EIRR at 30%. Overhead costs for appropriate project service delivery were
reduced during implementation from 12% to 6%.
63.     The Financial analysis was conducted comparing impacts of new technologies on
farm income. Results show that adoption of new and improved varieties and management
practices enabled farmers to generate substantial financial benefits. CIG farm household
income as compared to the control group ranged between 6-43% for various commodities.
The project focused on improving the income situation of marginal and small farmers
constituting over 80% of benefitting households, and results show those poorer farmers
often generated proportionally higher incomes over the respective control groups than
medium farmers.
64.     Economic analysis was conducted to show the long-term economic viability of the
project. After adjusting financial prices with parameters such as shadow wage rate and
parity prices, the analysis prepared farm models to estimate the ‘on-site’ incremental net
benefits. These models represent the project objectives, namely for crops to intensify
mainly rice production and diversify cultivation at farm level by introducing high value
vegetables and generate additional income through marketing activities to minimize post-
harvest losses. Livestock and fisheries activities showed noticeable yield increases due to
the adoption of technology packages for dairy cow rearing and carp polyculture. Assuming
that farmers realized 75-100% of the benefits, aggregated economic returns to the project
show that benefits were substantial. The EIRR over the analysis period is estimated at 30%
and the Net Present Value of BDT6272.8 million. It is important to note that the NATP
would have achieved a higher EIRR, more in line with the PAD estimate, if the one-year
extension had been avoided, as the longer implementation period increased project
management costs and shifted benefit inflows further into the future. Benefits accruing to
non-CIG farmers were not counted in the economic analysis, but if done so, would enhance
substantially the overall benefits of the project.
65.     In addition, non-quantifiable benefits accrued under NATP were: (i) improved
nutrition at household level; (ii) improved advisory service provision for all farmers at
union level; (iii) improved capacity of local private sector actors; (iv) medium- and long-
term impacts from outputs of the improved national research system; (v) knowledge
generation by research staff; (vi) capacity development of research and extension staff; and
(vii) empowerment of farmers through participatory planning and group registration as well
as during field testing for research purposes.
66.     A basic sensitivity analysis was conducted against key variables (prices, yields)
affecting the project showing that returns remained robust and above the opportunity cost


                                            16
of capital. The combined 20% reduction in output prices for rice and vegetable would
result in an EIRR of 26%. A 10% decrease in yields of rice, vegetable, carp and milk yields
results would result in EIRR between 13-28%, which are still greater than the opportunity
cost of capital.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
67.     Overall, the project outcome is rated as Satisfactory. As discussed in Sections 3.1
and 3.2 above, the project objectives, design, and implementation remained highly relevant
throughout the implementation period. The project achieved significant outcomes in terms
of improving national agricultural technology systems as it successfully promoted new and
innovative approaches and institutions for agriculture research, extension, farmers’ group
organizations and also pilot-tested new rural service organizations such as CCMC and
FIAC. The project also made significant contributions to capacity building of national
agriculture research organizations and introduced substantial legal and institutional
reforms.
68.     Further, the economic and financial analyses results in Section 3.3 confirm that the
project achieved its development objectives efficiently. The project met most of its targets
and even exceeded some by significantly increasing crop yields, livestock and fisheries
productivities, and household incomes.
3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
69.     Poverty impacts. In a country with 47 million people still living in poverty of which
70% in rural areas, activities to strengthen farmers’ livelihoods were an appropriate focus
of the project. Given that marginal and small farmers account for over 90 percent of the
country’s rural population and make up for the vast majority of the country’s poor,
significant attention was paid to enhance farm productivity and improve living conditions
of marginal, including landless and small farmers, in the project area.
70.     Through adoption of improved farming technologies, the farmers supported by the
project increased their income by the end of project implementation as compared to control
groups. For instance, the annual income of marginal CIG farmers was 42% higher than
farmers in control group. Comparing gross margin increases across farmer groups,
marginal farmers achieved on many occasions higher gross margin increases than small or
medium farmers. Through facilitation of income increases, the project contributed to
building resilience among poorer CIG farm households who were able to decrease annual
expenditures on food to 43.7% as compared to the control group (50.5%). Other respective
expenditures shares for education were 8.6% for CIG and 7.8% for control respondents.
For house construction and repair this difference was even more pronounced with 7.9%
compared to 4.2%.
71.   Gender. The project required that under the extension component, CIGs must
comprise of at least 20% female members, but under the DAE, the CIGs now comprise
30% female members. The CIGs under the DLS comprises of 26% female members,
whereas the target was 20%. The CIGs under the DOF comprises of 18% female members,



                                             17
although the target was 20%. Traditionally and professionally fishing is not a sector where
there are a lot of women involved; hence the relatively lower participation rate in these
CIGs vis-à-vis other CIGs. According to field missions carried out, women members in
the CIGs are found to be better informed and more engaged in the group’s activities. Their
participation in the decision making process is also robust and female members are often
found in leadership positions in the CIGs (president, secretary or treasurer).
72.     The project interventions for women focused on vegetable and fruit production in
the homestead areas, compost preparation, seed preservation, beef fattening and
aquaculture. Involvement in production activities offered women the opportunities to get
actively involved in CIG activities and also take up gainful employment related to CIG
activities. Under the supply chain activities, pulsing and capping of flower generated a
good amount of income for the livelihood support of marginal farmers, and these practices
also generated employment for marginal farm women.
73.    Social Development/Inclusion. The project implementation strategy of promoting
decentralized extension services and bottom-up planning processes was a powerful tool for
marginal and small farmers’ empowerment and fostering leadership capabilities of
CIG/community leaders. A key element of social inclusion and targeting was also the focus
on women and the application of mechanisms to facilitate their involvement in project
interventions.
      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
74.      The project made significant contributions to institutional development of NATSs.
75.     Establishment of an innovative agriculture research organization: KGF
contributed to development of a pluralistic agricultural system. It broadened approaches to
research funding and governance systems which facilitated involvement of NGOs, public
sector institutions as well as public and private universities. It proved to be an innovative
approach to advancing agricultural research and development.
76.     ‘One stop’ extension services to farmers: Establishment of FIACs facilitated a
more holistic approach to information and technology dissemination of extension services.
FIACs served as integrated platforms where extension support services could be delivered.
As a one-stop shop, they contributed to the reduction of transaction costs (time saving) for
farmers who did not have to visit multiple locations and forged strong links with local
government, which fostered ownership and ensured sustainability and quality service
delivery.
77.     Institutions of the small and marginal farmers: The project established new
grassroots organization with focus on marginal farmers and small farmers – CIGs - and
brought in as partners in the decentralized, farmer-led and knowledge-based approach for
agricultural extension. These gender sensitive primary institutions were assessed and
graded for performance and federated into Producer Organizations.
78.      Moving farmers closer to consumers: CCMCs were established on a pilot basis to
improve marketing channels between small and marginal farmers and traders. This assisted
participating CIG farmers in achieving higher profits from sale of high value produce.
Inclusive management structures allowed farmers to have greater control over price setting,
facilitating a shift away from the characteristic of price taking normally associated with


                                             18
small and marginal farmers. Since it was a pilot, the CCMC model was in the process of
review to assess potential for scale up in the follow on operation.
       (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
79.     Technology generation coming out of research was largely geared towards
strengthening research-extension-farmer linkage. However, some SPGR sub-projects 30
were also able to demonstrate potential benefits of strengthening research-private-sector
linkages not considered under public research.
80.   Local government institutions forged strong ties with FIACs which created strong
ownership that ensured quality and sustainable service delivery.

4.         Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

81.    Most project outcomes are sustainable in medium to long-term period. A large
number of scientists, researchers and extension specialists trained under the project
continue to provide a solid basis for the sustainability of research and extension
organizations. Reforms and improved legal framework for national agriculture research
implemented under the project further reduces the risks to project development outcome.
The Government has indicated its longer term commitment to new institutions such as KGF
by agreeing to channel research fund through it.
82.   At the same time, the following specific areas need continued attention of the
Government and other stakeholders to minimize residual risks to development outcomes:
      i.   The recommendations from the institutional and financial reforms studies
           completed under the project need to be implemented to further strengthen specific
           aspects of the governance of the technology system. The project laid out the
           groundwork to further deepen institutional reform in the next operation.

     ii.   KGF fiduciary capacity requires strengthening especially as it moves towards the
           use of its Endowment Fund with an allocation significantly higher than what was
           allocated under the project.

 iii.      Hortex Foundation’s current resource generation capacity is largely dependent on
           external funding. Its collaborative partnerships with line agencies require further
           strengthening.




30
     BARI had developed a production package for high value horticulture crops through hydroponics, an alternative
     vegetable production technique that increased year round vegetable production. BARI signed a MoU with BRAC for
     further development and distribution to farmers. BRAC has country-wide coverage and the potential for mass-
     upscaling and uptake is significant.




                                                        19
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
83.     The Bank team ensured that the project design incorporated key lessons from
relevant projects of the Bank and other donors in the country and globally. The diagnosis
work and technical solutions identified were relevant and the rationale for Bank’s
intervention was firmly established. The project was designed to accelerate diversification
of agricultural production systems to high value commodities along with piloting of post-
harvest value addition, which were identified in Bank’s CPS as key priority.
84.      The project approach for strengthening pluralistic institutional structure of the
research and extension service providers through partnerships among public research and
extension agencies with universities, NGOs and private sector proved to be highly relevant.
The project design also incorporated formation and strengthening of grass roots, farmer
institutions of CIGs and federating them at a higher level to provide more farmer-focused
and demand responsive plans and programs for implementation.
85.      The project design promoted major reforms in agriculture research. However, it
underestimated the time required for first, getting the Act amended through the legislative
process which are prone to protracted delays and secondly to frame and implement
institutional and financial reform rules to operationalize the amended Act. Also, there were
certain ambiguities in the definition of the PDO, outcome indicators, and quantitative
targets, which created some confusion needing corrective revisions during implementation.
This led to the rating of the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry as moderately
satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
86.     The Bank team carried out 12 review missions to support project implementation.
All the task team leaders were Dhaka-based, who maintained effective working
relationships with the implementing agencies. The supervision missions delved into key
emerging implementation issues providing practical recommendations and sound technical
solutions as documented in the aide-memoires which were shared with the project teams
well before the wrap up meetings. The implementing agencies were provided adequate
opportunity to clarify issues raised in the aide-memoire.
87.     Considering the complexity of having different line departments and institutions
implementing the project, the Bank team balanced their support to ensure that all
components and institutions were adequately covered and supported for. The mission
composition also benefited from different skill mixes to cater to the demands of the project
team. The Bank team helped revising the Results Framework to adequately re-define PDO
and performance indicators so that monitoring of the project was robust and realistic. The
overall Bank supervision and support, particularly during the post-MTR phase, consisted



                                            20
of strong technical, managerial and fiduciary elements which made significant positive
contribution towards achievement of project results and enhancing its impact.
88.     The project was originally designed to provide demonstration and related training
to CIG farmers with the main focus on increasing adoption. The Bank supervision missions
stressed the need for focusing also on the non-CIG farmers for adoption of improved
technologies promoted by the project. It was also revealed that the main constraining
factors for adoption were non-availability of seeds and minor agriculture equipment. The
MTR mission recommended support to establish seed banks in villages, fish nursery,
breeds and insemination arrangements, minor equipment like pellet machines for fish feed
making, fishing nets, seed and fertilizer placement machines.
89.     At the same time, certain shortcomings were observed in Bank’s support. For
instance, the MTR mission was fielded one year later than originally planned (March,
2012). Timely fielding of MTR would have reduced project implementation delays. Also,
it took a considerable time for the Bank team (and Government) to prepare the AF of $25
million (USAID-financed Trust Fund) to scale up project activities. Its preparation started
in the second half of 2012 but because of changes in the processing modality during
preparation (initially started as a stand-alone project, then changed to AF) and various
Government approval procedures, AF approval was delayed until February 2014 (Bank)
and August 2014 (Government). The AF was eventually dropped because insufficient time
remained to implement the planned activities. The quality of Bank’s supervision has been
rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
90.    Overall, the Bank team did solid work at the entry level and the project design is
found to be sound despite some shortcomings such as under-estimation of challenges
related to reforms at research organizations and less clearly articulated PDO and
quantitative targets set in the initial Results Framework. During implementation, the Bank
team was proactive, identified issues on timely basis and facilitated appropriate solutions
including those that occurred during design stage. However, Bank team’s implementation
support suffered from shortcomings such as late fielding of MTR mission and slow
processing of the AF, which was never signed. Given Bank’s performance in ensuring
Quality at Entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory and Bank’s performance for
implementation support is rated as Moderately Satisfactory, the ICRR team rates the
Bank’s overall performance as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     The Government of Bangladesh was fully committed to and had a strong ownership
of the project, which was evident both during preparation and implementation. While the
Government ensured that BARC Act was eventually enacted, considerable delay in that


                                            21
process affected project implementation. There were also delays in approving DPPs and
RDPPs (and later on in its amendment in connection with the processing of AF) by the
Planning Commission, as well as in appointing PCU Director and key project staff. In view
of these, Government’s performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
 (b) Implementing Agencies’ Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
92.     There were two Implementing Agencies (IAs) - MOA and MOFL - which together
had six PIUs.31 The MOA acted as Lead Implementing Agency and housed the PCU that
performed the challenging task of coordinating implementation through the PIUs and the
dedicated team of staff members established within each of the IAs. The PCU was also
supported by national level Project Steering Committee (PSC) chaired by Secretary of
MOA and Secretary of MOFL on alternate basis. All heads of the departments were
members in the Steering Committee. While the PSC focused on higher level policy and
enabling issues, there was a Project Management Committee to resolve coordination and
other inter-agency operational issues. The PCU coordinated project implementation among
the PIUs, while maintaining the critical upward strategic communication with national level
policy makers. The mission reports prepared by the PCU consolidating progress, lessons
learned and implementation issues, in preparation for the different Bank missions were of
good quality, both in its contents and facts presented. Delays in project implementation due
to weak capacities and slow appointments of PIU staff, as also delays in taking actions to
process AF affected the project performance. Also, there were issues related to timely
submission of information, communication delays among the PIUs and between PIUs and
PCU occasionally. The performance of the MOA was Moderately Satisfactory.
93.    MOFL implemented the livestock and fisheries related activities of the project
through DLS and DOF. MOFL performed efficiently and delivered its key outputs as
envisaged under the project, closely coordinated its activities with MOA, in particular with
PCU. The performance of MOFL was Satisfactory. The combined overall performance of
the IAs was assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Given the performance ratings of the Government and IAs, the overall Borrower’s
performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
6.        Lessons Learned
The following key lessons were learned from the project:
94.    Ensuring effective linkages between research-extension-farmers is not easy and
continues to be in need of new and innovative solutions: Despite tangible progress being
made to improve the linkages between researchers, extension agents, and farmers through
innovative approaches such as CGP, decentralized extension service, and CIGs, there is


31
     The Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC), Krishi Gobeshona (Agricultural Research) Foundation
     (KGF), Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Department of Livestock Services (DLS), Department of
     Fisheries (DOF) and Horticulture Export Development Foundation (Hortex).




                                                      22
still significant room to further enhance their linkages through better coordination and
incentives. Under the project there were a number of cases, where researchers developed
new productivity enhancing technologies, but because of organizational silos, inertia, lack
of incentive systems in individual agencies, they could not always be quickly transferred
to extension and onwards to farmers. There clearly continue to be opportunities to develop
more effective and innovative approaches to strengthen the research-extension-farmers
linkages.
95.     The need to expand the focus of the research and extension service agendas
towards more agriculture commercialization, value chain, and agribusiness related areas
are fast emerging as a priority: A majority of research activities currently being carried
out under the project is focused on enhancing farm-level productivity, and on narrowing
the yield gaps between progressive and average farmers. However, with ongoing
transformation of farming towards greater commercialization, there is a fast emerging need
to expand the research and extension agendas to also effectively cover post-harvest
management and value-addition. .
96.     To maximize long-term impacts and effectiveness of major investments currently
being made into NARS, there is a need for continued support of ongoing institutional
reforms at BARC and ARIs: The 2012 BARC Act, amended with project support, provides
a significant scope to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the NARS through
improved research coordination, prioritization, and allocation of resources to agreed
priorities, and enhanced monitoring and evaluation of research. The implementation of
2012 BARC Act is crucial in sustaining and augmenting the positive impacts of ongoing
major investment in research.
97.     The implementation arrangement of a complex project such as this one needs
streamlining to achieve greater coordination, efficiency, and accountability: The project
implementation experience shows that proper coordination of activities involving a large
number of IAs is a major challenge often resulting in inefficiencies, duplications, weak
accountability, and difficulties in Monitoring and Evaluation. Based on the lessons learned
from NATP, the follow-up project has been designed with sub sector components led by
the corresponding specialized agency (e.g. livestock component with a PIU at DLS,
Fisheries component with a PIU at DOF etc.). That way, under the recently approved
NATP-2 it was possible to limit the number of PIUs to four. Moreover, to take advantage
of economies of scale, increase procurement efficiency and achieve savings, same items
will be pooled and procured through a process initiated by NATP-2 (not by the respective
agencies).   
98.     Before deciding on AF to scale-up an ongoing project, Bank teams and Government
counterparts should make thorough and realistic assessment on time and bureaucratic
procedural requirements needed for obtaining Government approval, and also anticipate
potential delays and distractions that the processing of the AF itself could cause to the
implementation of an on-going project. Likewise, additional reform of Trust Fund
procedures to streamline processing requirements would reduce the administrative burden
on task teams and allow greater time to focus on implementation and results.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/IAs/Partners
   (a) Borrower/IAs


                                            23
99.    Comments on the draft ICR were received from the Government of Bangladesh
(reproduced unedited in Annex 6) and were largely incorporated in the final ICRR.
100. In summary, the Government noted that the ICRR had covered all aspects
comprehensively and lessons learned from NATP were incorporated into the design of the
recently approved NATP-2. The Government requested that several data references be
updated (which was done). The Government further noted that despite overall project
outcome being assessed as Satisfactory, the performance rating of the Borrower was
assessed as Moderately Satisfactory and requested that the Bank consider upgrading this
rating.
101. The ICRR preparation team’s assessment of Borrower’s performance rating of
Moderately Satisfactory is based on several facts including significant delays in appointing
key project staff at project start, delays in amending the BARC ACT, and also prolonged
Government process of approving the revised DPP needed for credit reallocations and AF
approval. On the other hand, the rating of overall project outcome as Satisfactory is based
on assessment of PDO as measured by productivity and income increases for marginal-,
small-, and medium-size farmers and also based on efficiency levels achieved for the
project intervention. Based on these rationales, the ICRR preparation team retained the
current rating of Borrower’s performance as Moderately Satisfactory. Further details on the
rationale of performance assessment are provided in paras 20, 91, and 92 above.
   (b) Co-financier- IFAD
102. IFAD commented that the performance evaluation of IAs (Section 5.2(b)) is not
complete and should also present the evaluation of such agencies as DAE, DLS, DOF, and
Hortex Foundation.
103. The ICRR preparation team’s assessment of IAs are focused primarily on MOA and
MFL, which are formally defined in the Legal Agreement as the IAs. The performance of
PCU was also discussed, which had six individual PIUs located at agencies such as BARC,
KGF, DAE, DLS, DOF, and Hortex. The performances of individual PIUs or their host
agencies are evaluated in different sections of ICRR (paras 20, 24, 37, 82(iii), 97 and Annex
2) in various contexts of project implementation, final deliverables, capacities and
sustainability.

                             Annex 2. Outputs by Component
1.      The key project achievements on productivity and household income increases
against the baseline values are provided below:
     (a) Crops: Clean rice – 3.8 t/ha (39.7%); Wheat – 3.5 t/ha (36%); Maize – 8.5 t/ha
         (38.8%); Mustard – 1.5 t/ha (58.8%); Mungbean – 1.4 t/ha (39.8%); Tomato – 43.1
         t/ha (87.2%); Brinjal – 43.6 t/ha (99.1%); Jujube – 12.7 t/ha(54.8%); Cabbage –
         58.2 t/ha (48.2%); Potato – 22.1 t/ha (29.2%); Lentil – 1.4 t/ha (55.4%); and Tomato
         (summer) – 28.9 t/ha (36.9%).

     (b) Livestock: Egg (No/hen/yr): Local hen – 65 (16%); Layer – 309 (6.2%); and Duck
         – 152 (11.9%); Meat (Body weight gain-gm/animal/day): Local cattle – 348 (71%);
         Crossbreed cattle – 543 (70%); Goat – 47 (30.6%); Broiler – 52 (30%); Milk
         (liter/day/cow): local cow – 1.7 (38%); Crossbreed – 6.5 (26%).

     (c) Fisheries: Carp-Galda mixed culture – 3.9 t/ha (126%); Mono-sex tilapia – 7.2 t/ha
         (193%); Thai Koi – 5.1 t/ha (154%); Carp polyculture – 4.3 t/ha (107%).

2.      An impact assessment carried out by independent consultants team in 2013 shows
the following increases in farm household income by five main farming systems (and by
ranges in different farm sizes as shown in brackets): rice based farming (23 to 47%), crop
diversification based (rice with pulses/oilseeds/vegetables) (58 to 78%), mixed farming
based (crop diversification with livestock) (54 to 135%), livestock based (cow rearing/beef
fattening) (51 to 159%), and fish farming based (carp/tilapia) (66 to 69%).
3.      The detailed project outputs are discussed below by individual components:

A. Component 1: Agricultural Research Support
4.    The agricultural research component of NATP achieved most targets set and even
exceeded some as indicated below.
5.      Collaborative Research sub-projects (SPGR) under implementation or
completed: BARC implemented SPGR countrywide. A total of 108 basic and strategic
research sub-projects were financed, implemented and completed (exceeded the target of
45) by involving 12 NARS institutes and 6 public universities. The sub-projects covered
12 ecosystems representing the most vulnerable and climate stressed agro-ecological zones
in the country. The selection of sub-projects reflected priority needs identified through a
rigorous bottom-up process involving all key stakeholders. Involvement of farmers through
adaptive/validation and participatory processes not only led to the generation of new
technologies but also supported the transformation of the agricultural research system into
becoming participatory and demand-driven.
6.      The planned collaborations of Agricultural Research Institutes with the
International Agricultural Research Centers (IARCs) of the CGIAR and capacity building
of young scientists did not fully materialize. Only one SPGR sub-project involving an
international research institute brought in a small number of international experts to
provide technical support and guidance to scientists.


                                             26
7.       Non-NARS partners participating in KGF were established to manage the
Competitive Grants Program (CGP) and contributed towards the development of a
pluralistic agricultural research system involving public sector, private sector and NGOs
in agricultural research. The CGP mechanism was a new approach to collaborative
agricultural research and was first introduced in Bangladesh through NATP. Following a
rigorous evaluation and selection procedure that responded to micro-level priorities, 92
sub-projects were awarded which addressed problems related to commodities, specific
geographical regions with technological constraints and policy issues. However, after
rigorous quality assurance and close monitoring of performance, 9 sub-projects were
dropped during implementation. The remaining 83 sub-projects were successfully
implemented and final completion reports submitted to KGF. The project facilitated
collaborative partnerships between NGOs and public sector institutions (27 sub-projects
were implemented through NGO/public sector partnerships), involved 6 public and private
universities and awarded grants to 14 NGOs that participated independently. This created
space for non-conventional partners to participate in areas of agricultural research
traditionally assigned to public sector NARSs led by BARC. By its nature as on-farm
applied and adaptive research, there was a quicker turnaround of technology generation for
immediate uptake by farmers (more information provided in the paragraph below).
Furthermore, the challenges and rigidity faced in the public sector research system required
institutional innovative approaches to research funding and governance that the
competitive grants mechanism was able to provide through CGP. A total of 47 Non-NARS
partners participated in CGP and 65% of the total CGP fund was allocated to finance their
activities (exceeded the target of 20 Non-NARS partnerships with 30% share of CGP fund
allocation).
8.       Validation Trials) and New Technologies made available for Extension: While
a few (37%) 32 SPGR sub-projects were implemented in collaboration with extension
agencies, CGP sub-projects were primarily focused on on-farm applied and adaptive
research, which often involved extension agencies as well as direct participation of farmers.
In total 50 collaborative extension sub-projects were implemented during project
implementation achieving their target at 100% (Intermediate Outcome Indicator 5). As a
result of on-farm and on-station trials of CGP sub-projects implemented, technologies
developed from 11 sub-projects were scaled up as an intermediate step between technology
generation and mass scale adoption by farmers. For example, some CGP sub-projects
demonstrated the benefits of growing high yielding varieties of mustard (BARI Sharisha 9,
14, 15 and BINA Sharisha) after harvesting T-Aman rice that were disseminated through
on-farm trials. Over 7000 farmers adopted the newly released mustard varieties in 11
districts. In a different case, the introduction of a new cropping system that replaced Boro
with mungbean followed by short duration Aus (cv Parija) and thereafter T-Aman was
developed and adopted by large number of farmers in northern district. This led to savings
in electric energy (5,112 KJ) and fertilizers (190 kg TSP and 125 kg MoP) and resulted in


32
     BARC reported that 40 sub-projects out of 108 were implemented in collaboration with extension agencies; 55 sub-
     projects were implemented in collaboration with farmers; 45 sub-projects were in collaboration with NARS and
     Universities; and 67 sub-projects were conducted on station/at research station. It is important to note that the
     collaborations are not mutually exclusive.




                                                          27
substantial increases in system productivity. At project end, 28 technologies were
developed from CGP sub-projects and KGF was able to transfer 15 proven technologies to
BARC for scaling up and wider dissemination to farmers outside project area across the
country.
9.      SPGR generated 42 mature technologies and an additional 14 technologies were at
an advanced stage. 37 technologies were disseminated and in use at farm level as many of
their associated sub-projects were executed through participatory approaches involving
farmers from project inception. Notable among them were the development of a salt
tolerant rice variety for the vulnerable coastal zone (BINA dhan-10) that led to a seed
multiplication program. A heat tolerant summer tomato variety (BARI Hybrid Tomato 8)
was developed and released with yield potential of 35-40 t/ha. 150 on-station and on-farm
demonstrations were carried out in 19 districts of the country. A limited amount of breeder
seed was produced and distributed to Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation
and agribusinesses such as GETCO, ACI and Lal Teer for seed multiplication and
distribution. Collaborations with farmer involvement and partnerships with the private
sector created opportunities for quick dissemination of technologies as well as uptake for
rapid commercialization and diffusion of technologies. In total 25 technologies were made
available for extension services from CGP and SPGR (met target of 25) but an even larger
number of technologies were disseminated to extension agents through training and
indirect participation in on-farm sub-project activities.
10.     Scientists trained in identified skill gaps: NATP facilitated the preparation of
Human Resources Development (HRD) Plan 2009-2025 to develop the required level of
scientific manpower through training and higher study programs at home and abroad. The
project implemented the plan in which a total of 30 foreign and 79 local PhD fellowships
were awarded (met target of 109)33. The HRD plan also elaborated on the measures to
ensure return, utilization and retention of scientists in the profession and such measures
were applied to scientists selected for doctoral and MS studies (10 scientists were selected
for MS studies and completed). By project end, 65 scholars were already in country after
completing their studies and were reported to be working in various research institutes.
11.     In addition, capacity enhancement for scientists was also provided through overseas
training/study visits (371 participants), short term local training (5,070 participants) and
local seminars and workshops (9,508 participants). To enhance productivity, scientists
were also trained in the areas of monitoring and evaluation, financial management,
procurement and project management, bridging the critical skill gaps. This strengthened
their capacity to compete for research funding, implement and complete research projects.
12.     To further support efficiencies, an MIS was created within BARC and 7 ARIs
linked to the system. 9 MIS modules (financial management, human resources, inventory,
library management, procurement, research, training, vehicle and data bank) were
developed, tested and rolled out. M&E Cells were established at all networked institutions


33
     End figure of scientists who obtained PhDs was 108 because 1 student died while
     pursuing studies abroad. All students were expected to complete their studies by
     December 2014.



                                            28
and relevant personnel trained in data management and entry. By project end, over 12,500
entries were made into the ARMIS database. This promoted knowledge exchange amongst
different research institutes and was eventually expected to minimize duplication of
research efforts. Additional measures of awareness building and information dissemination
of research were undertaken. 70 (60 SPGR, 10 CGP) journal articles were published by
researchers both in local and foreign journals; 167 technical bulletins were developed for
SPGR and CGP; and 93 electronic and 62 print media were also covered.
13.     While the establishment of an integrated MIS at BARC was a major achievement
of NATP, it requires further strengthening. M&E Cells were established and personnel
trained, but those assigned were scientists who were given these additional responsibilities
apart from their regular functions. Thus accountability was weak as turnover was quite
high from regular transfers. For the MIS to be fully functional and effective, it will require
dedicated personnel to primarily focus on this responsibility.
B. Component 2. Agricultural Extension Support
14.      All activities designed under the Agricultural Extension Support Component
(earmarking 51% of the total disbursement under the project) were successfully completed
and good results have been achieved. The project implemented activities for intensification
of rice based cropping system, diversification to high value crops, and development of non-
crop agriculture, (fisheries and livestock). The project has achieved, in many cases
surpassed, the targets set for the components; main outputs are summarized below.
15.       The three agencies responsible for implementing the extension component were
DAE for crops and horticulture, DLS for livestock, and DOF for fisheries. The PAD set a
target of covering 25 % of the districts / Upazillas in the country for the component under
the current phase of the project. The component activities are implemented in all the 1345
Unions of the selected 120 Upazillas34 of the 25 project districts.
16.     The project newly established 20,012 CIGs comprising 398,700 farmer members.
In addition, there are 1,514,500 farmers outside the CIGs who became sustained adopters
of the technologies promoted by the project. Therefore the total number of farmers that
benefitted under the component at the closure of the project is 1.91 Million (39 % marginal
farmers, 44% small farmers and 17% other farmers). This is 46.5% of the total farm
household (4.11 Million35) in the project Upazillas.
17.     Farmer Institutions Established. The CIGs established by the project
empowered farmers to take increasing responsibilities for planning implementation and
monitoring of extension activities. The new grassroots farmers’ organizations of producers
emerged as the village level focal point for technology transfer through demonstrations,
field days, trainings and provision of small equipment and machinery and seeds. 13,450 of
them are crop CIGs, 3,892 livestock CIGs and 2,670 fisheries CIGs. Out of the total



34   There are 222 Upazillas and 2,241Unions in the 25 project districts and a total of 4527 Unions, 488 Upazillas and 64
     Districts in the country

membership of 398,700 farmers, 163,000 (41%) are marginal and 160,800 (40%) are small
farmers 36 against the targeted 70% of marginal and small farmers. 28% of the CIG
members are women against the targeted 12% and they actively participated in the trainings,
played significant roles in technology adoption as well as in mobilizing savings within the
CIGs.
18.     Nearly 43 % of the CIGs were registered under the Cooperative Act and the rest
are in advanced stages of registration. The CIG members have together mobilized an
amount of 261.91 Million BDT (equivalent to 3.36 Million USD) as savings/contribution
from members and are used for investments from own resources. The project organized
various capacity building measures including training, field days exposure visits to build
the capacity of CIG farmers covering not only the most appropriate technologies and
practices but also on entrepreneurship, leadership and institution development aspects. It
was estimated that 1.62 million person days of training was provided.
19.     Though 83% of the CIGs are classified as A or B grade, based on criteria based
Balanced Score Card assessment done by the project, the higher level Producer
Organizations established by federating them at Union, Upazilla and district level are yet
to be strengthened. The POs did not so far roll out their mandated activities of facilitating
access to technical, financial and marketing services to member producers, except the ones
involved in Supply Chain Development Component37.
20.      Extension Support Services Decentralized and Strengthened. The project
brought about far-reaching transformations in the planning, management and funding
responsibilities of the extension system. A new model of participatory and farmer-led
decentralization in planning and implementing extension related investments evolved and
institutionalized under the project. The bottom up and decentralized preparation, appraisal,
funding, implementation and monitoring of Micro Extension plans have become a regular
annual exercise in all CIGs. The 20,012 CIG Micro Plans prepared each year with the
participation of the farmers are first aggregated at the project Unions and then compiled at
Upazilla level. The plans included activities to reflect the prioritized needs of CIG members
and helped selection of most appropriate technologies suited for the locations. The review
and assessment of the quality of the plans by higher level Upazilla Extension Coordination
Committee (UECC) enhanced its technical feasibility and location specificity. The funds
for the implementation of the plans were also decentralized and transferred to Upazilla
level. The District level Extension Coordination Committee (DECC) with representation
from local Research Stations, ensured backstopping with technical support, and helped
avoid overlaps and duplications in addition to monitoring the implementation of the plans.
21.    In spite of the involvement of scientists in the DECCs, the research–extension-
farmer linkage requires further strengthening. While the DAE staff got trained in the
research centers, providing some opportunities for learning and information sharing with


36
     Marginal Farms (including near landless who depend on livestock or fisheries) with 0.01 to 0.49 acres; small farms
      with 0.50 to 2.49 acres and medium farms (including large farms) with above 2.50 acres of land area

37   Refer to the SCDC component description for details




                                                           30
scientists, DLS and DOF staff got lesser/little opportunities for trainings within the research
centers.
22.     Though the project could achieve some convergence in the participatory program
planning by the three line extension agencies, their budgets continued to be prepared
separately. This has resulted in implementation of three programs independent of each
other, leaving limited scope for coordination and convergence at the farm level.
23.      Farmers’ Information and Advisory Centres (FIACs) established and
operationalized: The project helped establish and put to operation 732 new FIACs as
permanent outfits for providing one-stop extension services to the farmers covering crops,
livestock and fisheries sub-sectors. The FIACs housed within Union Parishad Complexes
located closer to the farmers have emerged as important local hubs for technology
dissemination and technical support to farmers. The number of farmers that accessed
services from the FIACs reached 62 farmers per month per FIAC for crop related services,
41 per month for livestock related services and 12 per month for fisheries. There are strong
affiliations, convergence and ownership achieved in these centers with the local
government (Union Parishads) activities thereby ensuring continued service to farmers
beyond the project period. Some Union Parishads have purchased agriculture equipment
from own funds and made them available to FIACs. The FIACs are equipped with
Computers (100 FIACs with computers and printers and modems for internet connectivity
meant to provide e-agriculture services to small and marginal farmers) some small
equipment like sprayers, foot pumps, water testing mini kits, sprayers for tree crops,
learning tools and extension materials like posters, pamphlets, samples of crop varieties,
displays of common pest and disease (mini museums).
24.     The extension personnel within the FIACs include Union level staff of DAE
available on all working days. Community Extension Agents for Livestock (CEAL) and
Local Extension Agent for Fisheries (LEAF), community workers trained in Livestock and
Fisheries, are available on pre-announced days of the week. The project successfully scaled
up the homegrown model of CEAL and LEAF. Though brought in as a strategy to
overcome the staffing gaps at the union level for fisheries and livestock, both CEAL and
LEAF (1,300 each) developed into a critical link between the farmers and the Upazilla
level technical personnel of both the departments. With the training and support by way of
limited equipment and a nominal monthly conveyance allowance, these agents evolved
themselves into local entrepreneurs charging for the services they offer, especially when
farm visits are involved. However, the business model for the CEAL appears more
sustainable and additional measures need to be thought about for the sustainability of LEAF.
25.     Improved technologies successfully disseminated: The project has been able to
offer to the farmers 40 location-specific technology packages (Crops 16, Livestock 11 and
Fisheries 13) consisting of improved technology elements. The technology basket offered
was fully catering to the national priorities of: (i) improving the resource use efficiency
and yield gap minimization of rice based cropping system which constitute the core of the
sector; (ii) diversification of the cropping system by promoting pulses, oil seeds and high
value vegetable crops; and (iii) livestock and fish productivity enhancement with a focus
on raising people’s nutritional standards.

26.     A total of 81,375 demonstrations supplemented by field days and formal farmer
trainings have been implemented for disseminating technology packages. About 63,918
crop demonstrations with 16 technologies; 20,919 livestock demonstrations covering 11
technologies and 5,336 fisheries demonstrations covering 12 technologies have been
conducted. Farmers Adopted Improved Technologies: Though the demonstrations and
other knowledge management activities were originally planned to focus on adoption
within the CIG farmers, post MTR the focus shifted also on to adoption by non CIG farmers
within the villages. This led to increased adoption of the promoted technologies. The
number of farmers adopting demonstrated technologies over the life of the project rose to
1.89 million, comprising 0.38 million adopters 38 who are 96% of total CIG farmers and
1.51 million farmers outside the CIGs. The end of project target for adoption in the PAD
was conservatively estimated at a total of 0.39 million farmers.. Marginal farmers
constituted 39% among the adopters and 44% are small farmers. There are many instances
of ‘village wide’ adoption where almost every farmer in large contiguous farming
landscapes adopted many demonstrated technologies like changing cropping patterns by
including high value crops and varieties, integrated pest management including pheromone
traps, judicious use of water resources through Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD),
animal healthcare, better livestock management practices, and water quality monitoring for
sustained fish production. The emergence of many “seed villages” producing seeds of high
yielding varieties, “clean villages” practicing compost in all households, “green villages”
adopting integrated pest management, “resource efficient villages” practicing AWD,
“healthy animals villages” vaccinating and deworming all livestock in the villages, are
good outputs achieved. The total number of farmers adopting crop related technologies
stood at 1,221,960; livestock related technologies were 515,957 and fisheries technologies
were 233,653 farmers.
27.     Productivity of crops, livestock and fisheries enhanced: The project helped good
productivity improvements resulting mainly from the adoption of improved technologies.
Compared to baseline yields (2.73 t/ha) the yield of clean rice increased by 39.72%. The
body weight gain for most popular beef fattening rose by 71% for local cattle and 70% for
cross-bred cattle. The most popularly adopted Monosex Thilapia culture productivity
improved by 193%. While the focus commodities among crops were 13 in number,
livestock focused on egg, meat and milk production and fisheries focused on pure and
mixed culture of fish. One of the popular technologies demonstrated, which had 1.39
million adopters was Rice Yield Gap Minimization which combined a set of farmer
friendly technology elements to bridge the gaps in yield obtained by small and marginal
farmers against potential yield. The project tracked the yield gaps minimized by farmers




38
     Technology adoption is counted only once irrespective of number of technologies adopted by each farmer. These are
     sustained adopters of the technology as they are adopting technology packages for more than one year/season after
     getting exposed to the technology.




                                                          32
over the project period comparing farmer’s field and demonstration fields. Overall, for the
three crops of paddy the yield gap was minimized from 1.30 t/ ha to 0.76 t/ha.39
28.     New National Agricultural Extension Policy Formulated: The project helped
DAE in revising the National Agricultural Extension Policy, in close consultation with
project field staff and farmers with technical assistance from the Bank. The models and
approaches successfully implemented under the project are reflected in the policy and
would be scaled up throughout the country. These include the adoption of demand driven
decentralized extension approach in all programs of DAE; promoting low-cost high-
impact demand-responsive technology packages for accelerated agricultural growth; and
differentiated targeting to address the challenges and opportunities from main agro-
ecological and economically constrained areas. The policy is in its final stage of approval
and release. The DLS also advanced in drafting a similar policy for the Livestock Sector.
C. Component 3. Development of Supply Chain
29.    The project implemented activities to integrate small and marginal farmers and
agri-business enterprises into modern supply chains and brought about pilot models for
commercialization of agriculture. The component was implemented by the Hortex
Foundation, a ‘not for profit’ company under the MOA and chaired by Secretary, MOA.
The main output of the component, considering the Bangladesh context, is a relatively
simple but replicable and potentially scalable business model of ‘extension support using
market based methodologies.
30.    The component was originally meant to cover 200 CIGs in 10 project Upazillas.
Increased demand from farmers led to doubling the coverage to 402 CIGs in 20 Upazillas.
The total number of benefiting farmers is 21,810. This includes farmers who have benefited
from the adoption of 39 post-harvest technologies relating to high value agricultural
commodities demonstrated under the component as well as marketing their produce
through the 25 CCMCs established under the project.
31.     Vertically Integrated Farmer Institutions Established. The main output of the
component is 20 Producer Organizations (PO) vertically integrating 402 Village Level
CIGs against the originally planned 10 POs with 200 CIGs. The POs provided a platform
at higher level for the small and marginal CIG farmers and helped them reduce post-harvest
losses as well as realize better prices for their produce. The POs successfully negotiated
better prices and established linkages with local and up-country markets. In addition the
POs played a significant role in the management committee of the CCMCs established
under the project. The POs also disseminated market information among CIGs in addition
to coordinating various training programs and workshops for farmers covering post-harvest
and marketing aspects.
32.      Post–harvest Technologies Demonstrated and Adopted. The project
successfully demonstrated 39 improved Post-harvest Technologies against the targeted 20.
A total of 8,560 CIG farmers and 13,250 non-CIG farmers adopted these technologies


39
     The T. Aman rice yield gap minimized from 1.5 to 0.76 t/ha, the Boro rice from 1.70 to 1.04 t/ha and T.Aus rice from
     0.70 to 0.47 t/ha.




                                                           33
taking the total number of adopters 21,810. The commodities covered include vegetables,
fruits, flowers, livestock and fisheries.
33.     The improved technologies included improved sorting, grading of produce, poly
cap use in banana, use of gerbera cup, perforated rose cap, pulsing treatment, ice packaging
of rose, use of trolley, harvesting tools, zero energy cooler, steeping technology in lemon,
solar drier and Modified Atmospheric Packaging (MAP) in vegetables and fruits, milk can
and styrofoam insulated box for milk and fish transportation, marketing of minimally
processed fruits and vegetables using MAP. Some of the technologies which were found
widely adopted include use of clean plastic sheets for grading and sorting of produce
hygienically, use of purposefully designed plastic crates instead of traditional bamboo or
jute containers. These technologies helped reduce post-harvest loss of high value
commodities by 5 to 18% over the baseline situation. In the flower sector alone adoption
of recommended technologies helped farmers get an increased price of 60% higher than
non-adopters. The use of insulated styrofoam ice boxes reduced quality loss of fish to 2.5%
from 23% in the case of non-adopters using traditional practices.
34.     Established CCMC Model for Linking Farmers to Markets. The project
conducted studies to identify Strategic Value Chains upfront and clusters of CIGs were
formed to focus on commodity options providing critical volumes for marketing. The
project established 25 CCMCs at rural markets accessible by the smallholder farmer groups,
petty traders and assemblers. These CCMCs improved the marketing channels and links
between traders and farmers through mobilizing them from farm gate to rural and
urban/city markets for selling their high value agricultural produces comparatively at
higher profit. The CCMCs were provided with facilities for washing wherever necessary,
grading and in some cases storing produces. The CCMCs emerged as a forum where small
and marginal farmers from 402 CIGs got directly linked with about 431 traders. Compared
to local market the farmers linked to CCMCs gained 10 to 15% more price for their produce.
The management committees of CCMCs included in addition to farmer representative from
POs, other market operators like traders, transporters, and market lease holders which
improved the marketing operations of the CCMCs. Since inception40 the total value of
agricultural produce channeled through the 25 CCMCs reached BDT 1,183 million (USD
17.2 million). The total number of farmers benefited from the CCMCs are 8,000.
35.     CIGs/POs Linked to Public and Private Processors and Operators. Yet another
output from the component activities relate to direct linkage with processors and market
operators. The dairy CIGs were linked up with Milk Vita Cooperative Ltd., a national level
milk processor, and Milk Vita procured 964,480 tons of liquid milk at a 20% higher price
than prevailing in the local market. Similarly, banana CIGs from a CCMC negotiated an
agreement with Direct Fresh, a private company which delivers fresh fruit and vegetables,
as well as imported products, to high-end consumers in Dhaka. Direct Fresh procured 12
tons of banana (Amrito sagor) from CIG farmers at 15% to 20% higher price than
prevailing in the local market. Direct Fresh have recently expressed willingness to enter
into a formal contract farming agreement with the CIGs.


40
     10 CCMCs started in 2011 and the remaining ones after MTR during second half of 2012.




                                                         34
36.      Key Stakeholders’ Capacities Built. The project organized various capacity
building events like training programs, workshops, domestic and international exposure
visits in addition to bringing out booklets, leaflets and other dissemination materials. About
1,800 farmers, traders and line agency officials were trained in 15 events covering supply
chain management, dairy product development and post-harvest technology, business
development and the like. The exposure visits focused on small scale agri-business
development, processing of flowers, herbals and honey products, contract farming systems,
post-harvest handling, storage, packaging, marketing of fish etc. About 27 CIG farmers
and 22 non-CIG farmers were given opportunities to participate in overseas exposure visits.
In addition, about 3,600 and 2,400 non-CIG farmers were trained in 16 workshops
organized on various themes of post-harvest including marketing aspects. On the
information dissemination front, about 2,000 booklets on low cost preservation of fruit and
vegetables, 2,000 on shelf life, packaging and transportation of flowers, 2,000 on post-
harvest technologies, 1,000 booklets on safe production technology, and another 1,000
information booklets on solar drying methodologies were produced and distributed.
37.      Market Based Extension Support Business Model Initiated. Shortened value
chain model: With the introduction of CCMCs individual producing farmers are linked
with consumers bypassing the normally existing intermediaries consisting of local market,
collectors and farias (local agents), commission agents and wholesalers. The producers are
linked to consumers through traders, marketing companies and exporters. The traders
establish the link with consumers through retailers and supermarkets. The marketing
companies help farmers reach out to consumers through their outlets. The business model
shortened the chain and accumulated better margins at the producer level. One of the key
deficiencies of the model was lack of integration with the extension services. Hortex was
left to do all supply chain development activities.
38.    Integrated, Market Based Extension Model: Moving forward a collaborative
model was initiated for testing. The alternative model aimed at Hortex training the line
agency field officers so they could deliver extension services using market-based
methodologies. In fact, by 2012, the Supply Chain Development Component rolled out a
new model in 10 new Upazillas with an additional 200 CIGs, where the line agencies -
DAE, DOF and DLS - were better integrated and trained in supply chain methodologies.
This implies a long term commitment from line agents to promote SCD and thus free
limited Hortex resources to continue training elsewhere, whilst ensuring regular
monitoring.
39.      Integrated Market Based Extension Model. This comprehensive but simple
model consists of five elements: (i) mobilization and strengthening of two tier farmer
institutions (CIGs and POs); (ii) dissemination of improved agricultural technique; (iii)
aggregation, grading, packaging and transporting; (iv) local and national market linkages;
and (v) value chain specific interventions. The attractiveness of the model emerged out of
reduction in the marketing costs, enhanced quality of produce and realization of better
prices of high value crops, livestock produce and fisheries. A memorandum of
understanding was signed among Hortex and the line extension agencies. The role of
Hortex became that of an ‘enabler’ and the line agencies assumed the role of ‘technical
facilitators’. The role of ‘doers’ was progressively transferred to farmer institutions and



                                             35
other market operators. The model also promoted entrepreneurial ideas for farmers giving
them an opportunity to diversify their income.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1       Overview of the Project

1.      This annex presents the ex-post economic and financial analysis (EFA) of the
WB/IFAD/Government of Bangladesh (GoB)-funded National Agriculture Technology
Project (NATP). NATP’s development objective was to “improve the effectiveness of the
national agricultural technology system, as measured by increase in agricultural
productivity and farm income in selected districts”. The project was implemented over six
instead of five foreseen years and comprised four components: (1) support to research
through implementation of collaborative research sub-projects as well as institutional
strengthening; (2) support to extension by introducing bottom-up, demand-led and
participatory planning as well as provision of decentralized information and advice; (3)
supply chain development through demonstration of improved post-harvest technologies
and management practices as well as piloting of Commodity Collection and Marketing
Centers; and (4) project management.
2.      Total project costs, including contingencies, were US$73.81 million. Not all
projects funds were spent due to under-utilized funds as well as noticeable exchange rate
fluctuations. In budget revisions during project implementation the fund allocation
available for extension activities under component 2 increased by about 15%, which has
given further importance to NATP activities at farm level. At the same time, overhead costs
for project service delivery in the form of Project Coordination Unit cost decreasing from
originally estimated 12% (US$9.8 million) to 6% (US$4.4 million).
3.      In order to measure the efficiency of the project and assess the achievement of the
Project Development Objective (PDO), the analysis includes calculations of financial gross
margins for individual farm activities and an Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) as
well as a Net Present Value (NPV) for the entire project. The analysis uses farm models to
estimate “on-site” incremental benefits. It is based on data that was sourced during a field
visit to one district, updated information provided by the Departments of Agriculture
Extension (DAE), Livestock Services (DLS) and Fisheries (DOF), the World Bank and a
study (contracted by the Project Coordination Unit to an external company) prepared to
evaluate the impacts of NATP. The EFA focuses mainly on returns to investments under
component 2 (“Support to Extension”) and component 3 (“Supply Chain Development”).
4.     Taking into consideration the nature of NATP technologies it is assumed that initial
farm-level benefits from research that were generated under the project are captured by
the analysis of benefits from activities under component 241.
5.     NATP created a number of important externalities under components 1 and 2,
which have not been quantified because of the difficulty to assess in monetary terms the
increased efficiency and sustainability of the research system through human capacity




41 Approximately 48 technologies were handed over from research to extension including improved and
   location-specific varieties and various management practices.


                                                 37
development and policy/legislative interventions. As a consequence, the present analysis
is conservative and under-estimates partially the efficiency of the project42.
Pre Investment EFA
6.      The EFA for NATP in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) took account of the
framework nature of the project and did not carry out a detailed ex-ante analysis. It opted
for an economic analysis for the overall project considering the additional net value added
from increased agricultural production on farms that would be directly assisted through the
decentralized activities of components 2 and 3. For this purpose typical farm activity
models in main agricultural, livestock and fisheries activities were combined with the
number of farmers directly benefitting from project support under the extension support
and supply chain components. The incremental net value added as a result of the extension
activities alone was compared to the incremental investment and recurrent costs of NATP.
7.      While the original analysis did not calculate a financial rate of return for the entire
project, it did compare net income impacts of new technologies on farming households
(hh). The financial farm activity analysis indicated that NATP would generate substantial
financial benefits for farmers adopting higher productivity and more profitable
technologies and management practices. It further qualified that financial benefits would
be realized upstream in the agricultural commodity supply chains. The analysis assessed
project impact on marginal, small and medium households which were, based on the
activity budgets, grouped into the following farming systems: rice-based, rice plus
vegetables, rice plus freshwater shrimp, fish production and dairy production. The
economic analysis was also based on those farm activity budgets. No account was taken of
the medium to longer-term indirect benefits that would arise, neither from new research
funded through the project which was expected to generate new technologies in 5-10 years’
time nor from the increased capacity of researchers and extension agents.
8.      Initial project costs were US$84.6 million and economic costs of the total project
were computed by applying a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.9 to the financial
base cost estimates. The PAD’s analysis estimated the likely EIRR to be 34.78% and the
NPV (at a discount rate of 12%) as US$74.08 million. Based on assumptions that farmers
would realize on average 50% of estimated gains in net income, the EFA tested sensitivity
of results mainly versus different levels of expansion and uptake of directly benefitting
farmers over the five year period.
Post investment EFA/ICRR estimation methodology
9.     A pragmatic approach based on available data and following the PAD methodology
was applied in the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR). The Economic
Analysis estimates NATP’s contribution to Bangladesh’s economy as a result of
technology induced productivity enhancements and increases in net value addition on
farms. The Financial Analysis looks at net income increases for particular commodities
and improved returns per family day of labor. The EFA is able to be more specific about



42 Performing the financial and economic analysis of projects’ subcomponents is a common practice in the
   ex-post evaluation of projects.


                                                  38
costs and benefits than was the case at appraisal because investments and activities have
been identified and implemented throughout the (extended) project period.
10.     Farm budgets. Based on data collected during the ICRR mission, provided by the
Government and taken from the project’s impact evaluation, typical farm models were
developed. They specify quantities and costs of outputs (e.g. rice, vegetables, carp, milk)
and inputs (e.g. fertilizer, seeds, fodder) including labor for the “with” and “without project”
situations. Selected farm activities for the analysis were representative of the technologies
developed by NATP. Demonstrations on Rice Yield Gap Minimization (RYGM) (rice-
only), High Value Vegetables (HVV) (e.g. tomato) and other High Yielding (HY) varieties
(e.g. mustard) (rice plus vegetables) constituted 61% of all DAE demonstrations43. For the
purpose of this analysis farmers in respective DLS and DOF CIGs were grouped around
representative commodities, namely cow rearing and carp polyculture. Supply chain
activities were carried out by a much smaller subgroup of CIG members than anticipated
in the PAD.
11.     Data. Regular recording and reporting of progress as part of the M&E system left
the project with comprehensive data on activities, outcomes and impacts. In addition, the
project collected information on productivity of a control group, which allowed the EFA
to compute incremental benefits with data from current project beneficiaries and respective
control group members.
12.      Price/cost information. The Financial Analysis is conducted in constant 2014
prices (Bangladesh Taka/BDT), which allows assessing the real impact of NATP on its
target group, namely net increases in their incomes. The Economic Analysis aims to show
the contribution to the sector and national income generated by the project and uses
economic prices for this. Economic project costs, in the absence of necessary details to
remove specific levies from each item, were calculated by applying a conversion factor of
0.9 to financial prices of non-traded goods and services. This was also assumed by the PAD,
which removed this proxy to account for distortions between market and real prices. Parity
prices for relevant tradable goods have been calculated using World Bank Commodity
Price Projections and FAO data. A labor shadow exchange rate factor of 0.75 was applied.
For comparability purposes, cost and benefit flows have been calculated over a period of
20 years using an opportunity cost of capital of 12%. For the overall project analysis all
project costs were considered for estimating the EIRR except those excluded in the PAD,
namely 50% of component 1.3, 2.3 (institutional strengthening) and 4 (project
management). As per PAD, the analysis included partial costs of the extension service
support at upazilla level. The percentage wise inclusion of respective salaries was estimated
according to their involvement in NATP activities. Recurrent cost items going beyond
project implementation period were mainly confined to maintenance of capital goods, i.e.
research and IT equipment. All incremental benefits under component 2 and 3 were
considered.

13.     Beneficiaries. The EFA considered benefits accruing to those farmers who directly
received project support, namely members of the 20,012 CIGs established by NATP (see
Table 1: NATP beneficiaries for details). The total number of 398,735 farm households
was gradually included in project activities during the first three years of project
implementation. Broader benefits accruing to the 1.51 million non-CIG farmers in the
project area were not included in this analysis. According to the numbers reported by the
PCU, 269,000 (70%) farmers carried out crops-related activities, including supply chain
development, 76,335 (20%) livestock-related activities and 53,400 (10%) fisheries-related
activities.

14.      Adoption rates. Based on the findings of the project team, the impact evaluation
and direct observations during the mission’s field visit, the analysis considered a
progressive realization of project benefits. The project reports revealed that up to Year 3
(Y3 - 2010) of project implementation only 30% of all potential beneficiaries had adopted
at least one technology. Adoption is defined as cultivating a crop or else using a new
technology for at least one season, excluding the demonstration season. In Y4 70% of CIG
members were adopters and close to 100% in Y5. The assumed pace at which benefits
accrued once a farmer was considered an “adopter” was: 10 percent in Y1; 50 percent in
Y2; and 100 percent in Y3. Since technologies were often not fundamentally new to
farmers or very high in demand as in the case of winter tomato, the benefit adoption cycle
was assumed to be completed in three years. NATP rolled out its extension activities by
forming CIGs, conducting on-farm demonstrations and providing continuous support. In
an attempt to correctly reflect reality, no benefits were included for Y1 and only few in Y2.

2      Financial benefits of extension support

15.    Incremental benefits from extension and supply chain development support accrued
to farmers from productivity improvements due to improved varieties and better
management of inputs and new technologies; diversification (off-season high value
vegetables; replacing area previously under rice cultivation); and by generating additional
income through marketing activities (e.g. post-harvest loss minimization). Results of the
supply chain development pilot showed that substantial price increases could be achieved



                                             40
through improving quality of production, improved post–harvest management and group
marketing of products.
16.     Increased yields. Improved, location-specific and higher yielding varieties of rice,
beans, mustard and wheat as well as better management44 of inputs and new technologies
were key parameters for the increase in crop yields. In case of livestock and fisheries
noticeable yield increases were observed under proper adoption of technology packages
(e.g. improved rearing practices for higher daily milk production per cow and good pond
and feed management practices for fish cultures).
17.     In light of Bangladesh’s land shortage and small land plot sizes, the cropping
intensity remained constant during the implementation period (approximately 200%). Net
productivity as shown in Table 2: Yields and net income comparing existing and new
technologies by farm activity increased for individual commodities in the range of 6-43%.

18.     Since one of the objectives of NATP was to address the yield gap particularly in
rice, the analysis assessed the differences in yield achievements from research (“Potential
Yield in Research Trials”) through the extension system to farmers. The difference between
the “Potential Yield in Farmers’ Field” and the actual yield farmers get is commonly
referred to as “Yield Gap”. This gap, which stood at 60% at the beginning of NATP has
been reduced but could further be closed in the future. The PCU Annual Report 2014 and


44 E.g. improvement of soil fertility (through compost activities), reduced use of pesticides/insecticides (by
   introducing a pheromone trap etc.), and establishment of biogas plants in livestock areas leading to fuel
   wood savings. The newly introduced AWD technology further saved irrigation cost.


                                                     41
Annual Report 2012/13 state: “The main reason for yield gap was identified as the
knowledge and skill gap of farmers. NATP designed to minimize yield gap by adopting
properly aged healthy seedlings and balanced fertilization. Using quality seeds and other
improved practices would further minimize the yield gap.”45
19.      Increased revenues. The project helped to reduce poverty by improving welfare at
household level as measured by increased revenues and food security. Information of
income increases in the impact evaluation (23-135% as recorded in the Results Framework)
is in line with the findings of the Financial Analysis (see Table 2: Yields and net income
comparing existing and new technologies by farm activity). The analysis compared net
income impacts of new technologies on farming hh, which all indicate that technology
adopters can generate substantial financial benefits. Data collected during the mission to
test for sustainability of income increases show that necessary inputs are available locally
and while prices may be higher in regional centers, the current production levels are still
absorbed by the local market. Individual commodity interventions are therefore found to
be financially sustainable. Another proxy indicator for improved household income is the
return per family labor. As summarized in Table 3: Returns per Family Day of Labor
comparing existing technologies and new technologies by farm activity, the analysis could
only observe improvements for CIG farmers as compared to the control group.

45 The major cropping pattern in Bangladesh is essentially rice based and dominated by a Boro-Fallow-T.
   Aman cropping pattern. This situation was exploited for intensification and diversification of cropping,
   namely accommodating a short duration crop in the cropping pattern by adjusting varieties, planting
   times and manipulating the turnaround time, etc. in the existing cropping pattern.

20.     Poverty impact. Under NATP particular attention was put on improving income of
marginal46 and small farmers, constituting over 80% (150,000 marginal and 168,000 small)
of all benefitting households. In line with the impact evaluation, the EFA assessed the
impact of improvements in agricultural productivity by type of household and type of
farming on household incomes and found that marginal and small farmers often harvested
proportionally higher incomes over the control group than medium farmers (see Table 4:
Income effects by farm size and type of activity for details). Benefits generated by project
interventions were thus effectively harvested by poorer groups of CIG farmers.

21.     Positive social externalities/non-quantifiable benefits. Direct and indirect non-
quantifiable benefits accrued under NATP were: (i) improved nutrition at household level
by increasing availability and consumption of proteins and vegetables at household level48;
(ii) improved advisory service provision for all farmers at union level by strengthening
FIACs, which is expected to continue and progressively improve impacts on farm
productivity; (iii) improved capacity of local private sector actors engaged in supply chain
activities; (iv) medium and long-term impacts from outputs of the improved national
research system and dissemination of research outputs through the extension system; (v)
knowledge generation by research staff along with scientific documentation of
accomplishments; (vi) capacity development of research and extension staff through
implementation of sub-projects; and (vii) empowerment of farmers through participatory
planning and group registration as well as during field testing for research purposes.

22.    As mentioned above, benefits accruing to non-CIG farmers were not counted but
would contribute substantially to the overall benefits of NATP. There was no attempt to
measure employment generation or value addition from processing beyond farm-gate.
Additional returns from further expansion in area have also not been included in this
analysis. The same applies to benefits generated from the adoption of multiple technologies
by farmers.
4 Cost-effectiveness and economic analysis results
23.      A cost-effectiveness statement was prepared to compare service delivery to
farmers through FIACs, a complementary extension advice modality49 with the current
practice, in case of livestock and fisheries, of operating exclusively from upazilla level50.
Cost comparisons between officers residing in FIACs attending approximately 630 farmers
per month51 and upazilla-based livestock and fisheries officers attending similar numbers
of approximately 730 farmers per month52 showed that current amounts paid for FIAC
operations are much lower compared to the solution at upazilla level53. Estimated cost per
farmer using the more decentralized FIAC approach is approximately US$1.5 and US$2.1
for the current centralized approach54. In addition, farmers save transaction costs by opting
for union-based basic advice rather than travelling to upazilla level. Another advantage of
decentralized advisory services is the high ratio of extension staff to farmer (see Table 5
below for details).

24.     After adjusting financial prices, the Economic Analysis uses farm models in line
with the PAD to compute the EIRR.55 Selected farm systems are agriculture without supply
chain activities (rice-based 56 and rice with vegetables), agriculture with supply chain
activities, livestock in the form of dairy cattle rearing and fisheries in the form of carp
cultures57. Average farm size used is 0.4 ha. Depending on the commodity the analysis
further assumes that farmers reap 75-100% of the possible benefits from improved
technologies58. An EIRR was computed at 30%, which is slightly lower than the original
estimate but still an excellent economic rate of return. The analysis shows that the main
types of farm activities and farm systems are financially viable and economically
sustainable. Under the presented assumptions, the project NPV is BDT 6,225 million
[US$79.8 million @ 2014 exchange rate 78; US$90.2 million @ 2008 exchange rate 69].

     Past benefits were adjusted for inflation and future benefits are based on 2014 values.

56 In case of the rice-only model farmers it was further assumed that 50% of benefitting hh introduced
   homestead gardening activities as a means of improving household food security and family nutrition.
   On average 154 kg of fresh vegetables were produced each year of which 95 kg were consumed in the
   family and the additional income from selling the remainder on local markets contributed to family
   welfare and women empowerment as the income was earned by women. (DAE-Additional write up for

5       Sensitivity Analysis

25.      A basic sensitivity analysis was performed using two key variables affecting the
project until the end of the analysis period: (i) falling output prices and (ii) reduced yields.
Table 7 presents an overview of selected scenarios. While the overall project design is
fairly robust, the project’s returns are sensitive to selected scenarios.

6       Conclusions

26.     The Economic Analysis finds that NATP has generated very acceptable returns to
investment by the Government and people of Bangladesh. The conservative analysis
estimates the EIRR at 30%, which is considerably higher than the opportunity cost of
capital and cost of funds to the Government of Bangladesh. The real return would be higher
if long-term effects from research, capacity development as well as improved nutrition
would be taken into consideration. At the same time it is expected that returns to technology
development and dissemination could be substantially raised through even closer links
between research and extension, and strengthening of partnerships between farmer groups
and private sector providers for the supply of farm inputs as well as processing and
marketing of farm produce.


61 Not directly comparable to PAD NPV as it is not discounted.


                                                  46
27.     It is assumed that CIG farmers are able to maintain the level of benefits accrued
under the project beyond the investment period. Further formalization in the form of
increasing registration numbers of CIGs under the Department of Cooperatives is
indicative of enhanced Government attention paid to these farmers and opens a possibility
for farmers to get continuous/additional support. Savings at CIG level can also be taken as
an indicator for the sustained interest in maintaining and expanding the benefits initiated
by NATP’s support. Until the end of 2014 farmers had collected approximately US$3.36
million. According to the impact evaluation study, CIG and non-CIG members used 50%
of the savings for reinvestment in agriculture. Selected groups know they need to access
regional markets where they would get higher prices for their goods. Government
commitment to strengthen extension advisory services in the form of FIACs at union-level
shows through DLS and DOF efforts in working out sustainable business models for
decentralized extension officers. This reflects the importance these Departments give to
extension support for farmers.
28.     Possible alternatives to project implementation in the form of private extension
actors, e.g. NGOs and independent support to research would probably not have yielded
similar results. With various implementing partners at union level as opposed to the
Government’s decentralized staff, the extension support would have been more fragmented
and service delivery may not have been comparable. Also, similar benefits especially for
marginal and small farmers may not have been achieved as through NATP. Research could
have been supported independently but with even weaker linkages to the extension system
results may not have been even remotely comparable as achieved by NATP.

                         Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR

1.      The NATP: Phase-I implemented with the support of IDA Credit (39.4 million) and
IFAD Loan (12.3 million) benefited 1.5 million marginal, small and medium farm
households. Among these 30% are women. The project had four components: (i)
agricultural research support; (ii) agricultural extension support; (iii) development of
supply chains; and (iv) project management and coordination.
2.      The Agricultural Research Component included Competitive Grants Program
(through KGF) and Sponsored Public Good Research (through BARC). A model was set
for inviting proposals/concept notes based on the priority thematic area set by BARC and
screening through a rigorous multi steps evaluation process which ensured transparency,
widening participation and enabled entry to new partners. Over 100 transferable
technologies were generated relating to both commodity and management technology in
crops, livestock and fisheries.
3.      The Agricultural Extension Component helped mobilize formation of 20,012 local
farmers’ CIGs, involving 398,735 farmers which prepared participatory extension micro-
plans at the grassroots level reflecting their needs and consolidated into 1,345 Union
extension micro plan and then aggregated to 120 Upazilla extension plans. 732 FIACs
established under the project provided extension services to nearly 3 million farmers.
4.    Adoption by 1.5 million farmers of 46 improved technologies that were
demonstrated led to increased productivity in crops (12.5% to 73.1%), livestock (6% to
71%) and fisheries (110% to 193%)
5.     The CIGs have been registered with the Department of Cooperatives and started
savings and investment schemes. These farmer institutions demonstrated capacity and
sustainability to diagnose production problems, planned and implemented participatory
demand driven extension plans to address them. A bottom up participatory extension
approach has been established among extension agencies.
6.      Development of Supply Chains of selected commodities as the pilot intervention
helped increase and diversify income sources for small and marginal farmers. In total, 402
CIGs in 20 project Upazillas participated in pilot testing. About 15,000 CIG farmers and
traders benefited through 25 CCMCs which provided low cost storage facilities, product
handling and sanitation facilities. These activities were able to reduced post-harvest loss of
high value commodities by 10-15% from the original level of 25-40%. As a result of
improved supply chain activities the average annual income of CIG farmers increased to
Tk. 15,000/- over the base line Tk. 5,000/-.
7.       Project Management: PCU played a catalytic and pivotal role in project
management maintaining effective liaison among the donors, ministries and implementing
agencies. PCU successfully facilitated completion of this complex project by performing
all the key activities as designed in the project and adopting various innovative instruments
like Balanced Score Card for performance evaluation of the CIGs; guidelines for
functioning of the CIGs; providing training on fiduciary management, result based



                                             50
monitoring & evaluation (RBME), communication and media, ICT and website
development, and public procurement system and Governance and Accountability Action
Plan (GAAP).
8.     Monitoring and Evaluation: The project monitoring and evaluation systems
conducted internal monitoring and evaluation. A concurrent quarterly monitoring and
evaluation of the project output, outcome and impacts was conducted by an external
independent monitoring and evaluation farm. A comprehensive Impact Assessment Study
was conducted by independent consulting firm. In addition, an independent Expert Impact
Assessment Team (EIAT) reviewed the implementation progress of the project.
9.     Environment and Social Safeguards: The NATP Phase-I complied with the
environmental and social safeguard guidelines as identified in the EMF. Many project
interventions facilitated environmental safeguard through the use of green technology
namely, Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), application of increased quantity of organic
compost and cow dung and reducing quantity of chemical fertilizers, adopting integrated
judicious pest management practices with IPM focus, use of sex-pheromone, use of
botanical (herbal) pest control measures in storage.
10.    Fiduciary Compliance: The NATP Phase-I maintained fiduciary compliance
including measures for improving financial management and procurement aspects thereby
ensuring efficiency and transparency.
11.     Lessons Learned: The lessons learned from NATP Phase-I include: (i) competitive
research awarding system with newly evolved competitive and transparent research
proposal processing; (ii) linkage established between research-extension-farmer; (iii)
effective group approach and decentralized extension system using CIGs with participatory
bottom up extension micro planning; (iv) farmers’ access to integrated extension services
through the institutional arrangement of FIACs at the union level; (v) transformation of
farming category from subsistence to commercial farming as evidenced by successful
cultivation of different fruits (e.g. lemon, guava), vegetables (e.g. summer tomato, gourds),
milk and dairy products, meat (e.g. cattle fattening), integrated fish culture; (vi)
establishment of farmer-market linkage through CCMCs facilitating quality processing,
sorting, washing, packing, carrying and transporting of product to urban markets; and (vii)
coordinated team work in the project management - all leading to successful
implementation in achieving the project objectives.
12.     Achievement of Project Development Objectives: The two specified Project
Development Objectives (PDOs) have been achieved: the target of productivity increase
was by 10% and household income increase by 10%. Productivity in crops increased by
12.5% to 73.10 % (Potato - 12.5% and Brinjal - 73.1%), productivity increase in livestock
ranged from 6% to 71% (Poultry Layers - 6%, Cattle - 71%). Fisheries productivity
increased by 110% to 193%. The household income increased for marginal farmers by 42%,
small farmers by 31% and medium farmers by 17%.
13.     Efficiency: The economic and financial analysis conducted for the project revealed
the level of efficiency in terms of tangible outcomes of forming 20,012 CIGs comprising
398,735 farmer members (30% are female) and 1,043,120 Non-CIG farmers, established
732 FIACs providing extension services to about 3 million farmers demonstrating 46
technologies through 81,375 demonstrations and 382,137 CIG farmers adopted new


                                             51
technologies. The technology diffusion from CIG to non-CIG farmers was at the ratio of
1:4. In addition, 402 CIGs have been linked with the market and above 10,000 CIGs
registered with the Co-operative Department of the Government. In NATP: Phase-I
technology adoption rate was 40%, production and net income increased was by 34% and
23% respectively.
14.      Overall Rating and Justification: The overall rating of the project is “Satisfactory”
for most of the project components. However, with the level of achievement of the PDOs
and overwhelming success, a number of innovative approaches have been rated as “Highly
Satisfactory” recognizing that all project components have achieved the set targets even
many have exceeded the respective targets, and the project was able to contribute: (i) to
systems development in the form of coordination among the research institutes and
research and extension organizations, (ii) in establishing decentralized and integrated
extension services with bottom-up approach, participatory extension micro-level planning,
(iii) in bringing extension services to the farmers’ doorstep through FIACs and market
linkage development centering CCMCs.

farmers adopted various technology packages against the target of 0.3 million farmers (para
54), overall economic efficiency of the project was found to be substantial (para 62), the
project outcomes rated as satisfactory (para 67), the woman participation in the decision
making process is robust and are often found in leadership position in CIGs (para 71). In-
spite of all these achievements, borrower's rating has been given as "moderately
satisfactory". This rating can be revisited.
3.      The Government agreed with USAID AF fund and accordingly NATP Phase-l.
DPP was revised for accommodating the USAID fund amounting to USD 7.05 million.
Finally, the World Bank did not take the initiative to sign the financing agreement and
ultimately fund was not available to NATP Phase-I. However the amount has been
committed for NATP-2. Therefore para 12 and para 90 could be rephrased according to the
fact.
4.      In para 24 3rd line, the disbursement reached USD 72.11 million (around 92% of
the target) instead of USD 65.7 million (around 90% of the target).
5.     In para 2l, 2nd line PMU could be deleted; in para 36, 2nd line, PCMU should be
replaced with PCU; in para 90 Ministry of Agriculture should be written as MOA instead
of MA; in para 91 Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock should be written as MOFL instead
of MFL.  
6.     NATP-2 is built on the comprehensive learning of NATP. Overall the report
appears to be comprehensive.
