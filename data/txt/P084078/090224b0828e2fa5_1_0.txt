 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project has been able to exceed the targets set at the beginning of the project. A number of long term and short term research sub-projects were
 initiated to address the technological gaps in the most sensitive, under-served agro-ecological areas of the country. 108 research sub-projects
 (SPGR) had been implemented under BARC and all sub-projects were completed in October 2014. Similarly, 84 short-term adaptable research sub-
 projects (CGP) implemented under KFG were completed in October 2014. The study on "Financial Management Code", which had been delayed has
 been initiated and is expected to be completed by end-December. CIGs have progressively cemented their positions as valuable village level farmer
 organizations for implementation of the decentralized demand-led extension services promoted under the project, thus laying a solid foundation for
 strengthening the effectiveness of producer organizations. A review of the action plan for POs is looking to strengthen them on a commodity and
 cluster basis, and it is expected that guidelines for activation will be prepared and in place prior to the effectiveness of NATP-2. The pilot on Supply
 Chain Development business model has been expanded from 10 to 20 upazilla with a broadened package of 42 post- harvest technologies along with
 a network of 25 Commodity Collection and Marketing Centers. The procurement packages for BARC are expected to be completed by end-November,
 while 2 procurement packages under Hortex have been dropped and affected the disbursement trend. Moreover, the simultaneous roles currently
 being played by PIUs in the preparation of the follow-on operation as well as implementation of the ongoing project activities have also effected
 progress and in particular, disbursements. Current disbursement projections indicate a potential unspent balance of about US$5 million by closing
 date of December 31, 2014. This will be reviewed during the upcoming mission. Nonetheless, a potential unspent balance is a major concern given
 that despite a one year extension to fully utilize all unspent funds, the project is exhibiting challenges in absorption capacity. This should be a
 significant consideration for the follow-up operation seeing that the expectation will be to disburse almost three times the amount of funds available in
 the current operation. With regard to the refund of ineligible expenditures that has been pending for some time, the PCU submitted a proposal to
 Ministry of Agriculture in September which has been forwarded to ERD for No Objection. This matter will be followed up during the upcoming
 mission. The Project needs to ensure that all critical studies related to the follow-on operation are completed and drafts issued in time to fully inform
 the design of the new operation. Ineligible expenditures will also need to be reimbursed before the closing of the project to avoid any potential
 disruptions to disbursements.
