Specifically, the project\n            objectives were: (a) to upgrade the capacity and\n            productivity of small- and medium-sized industries through:\n            the acquisition of modern equipment and essential spare\n            parts and raw materials, and the provision of technical\n            assistance to improve production methods and management\n            skills; and (b) to initiate the development of a capability\n            for project evaluation within SBL with a view towards\n            progressively strengthening the institution's ability\n            to assume its expanded financial intermediation function\n            under the New Economic Mechanism (NEM). Bank's\n            performance was not satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was not satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: (a) potential reforms and resulting changes\n            in structure or methods of operations should be considered\n            before embarking on the first project in a particular\n            sector; (b) discontinuity of staff within an implementing\n            agency is of concern in any project but is of particular\n            concern in countries where human capacity is still weak; (c)\n            adequate attention to and resources for supervision on the\n            part of International Development Association (IDA),\n            particularly for the first operation within a sector, is\n            crucial to effective project implementation; and (d)\n            technical assistance, when crucial to project\n            implementation, should be included in project design and\n            financed by the project."}, "docdt": "1996-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
