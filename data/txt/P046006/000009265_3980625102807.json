system and gradually lead to greater\n            effective coverage; (b) implement a financially viable\n            pension system; (c) limit the fiscal impact of the current\n            pension system; (d) raise the level of institutional savings\n            and improve the allocative efficiency of domestic savings;\n            and (e) enhance capital market development by stimulating\n            greater private financial intermediation. The components\n            include: (a) implementing, consolidating, and fine-tuning\n            the reformed system for private sector workers; (b) updating\n            estimates of the fiscal costs of transition; (c) deepening\n            reforms to Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda de\n            los Trabajadores (INFONAVIT) (National Workers Housing Fund\n            Institute); (d) advancing in the technical preparatory work\n            for the reform of the public pension systems; (e) sustaining\n            public confidence through education and information; and (f)\n            advancing in the implementation of complementary financial\n            market initiatives."}, "docdt": "1998-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
