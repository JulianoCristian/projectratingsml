further\n            contribution to policy reform and institutional\n            strengthening in the areas of tariff administration, export\n            promotion and financial sector operations. Major components\n            of the IDA small and medium industry project include a\n            credit component for refinancing term subloans, through the\n            SMI Fund, to private sector SMIs; and a technical assistance\n            component to the Government of Sri Lanka and relevant\n            agencies. The technical assistance component provides funds\n            geared to (i) improving the efficiency of the financial\n            sector and developing action programs; (ii) improving the\n            access of indirect exporters to duty drawback and export\n            credit facilities; (iii) improving the efficiency of public\n            manufacturing enterprises (PMEs); and (iv) establishing an\n            SMI technical assistance facility."}, "docdt": "1987-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
