First, for\n            more systematic and effective project monitoring, the role\n            of the Apex Institution needs to be redefined and its\n            capabilities further improved to be able to carry out an\n            in-depth evaluation of economic impact and financial\n            performance of SMI sub-projects. Second, to ensure the\n            sustainability of SMI sector lending, the financial sector\n            needs to adopt lending to SMIs as part of their long-term\n            strategy. Third, more attention must be given to the design\n            and implementation of the TA component and to developing an\n            effective monitoring system to ensure more efficient and\n            successful project implementation. Finally, steps should be\n            taken to improve the effectiveness of experts through a\n            better selection process, evaluation of their performance,\n            and establishing counterparts in the concerned institution."}, "docdt": "1994-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
