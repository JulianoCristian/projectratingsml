The development objectives of the project\n            were to: (a) provide quality food products for export either\n            as raw materials or as inputs into agro processed goods; and\n            (b) improve the efficiency of agricultural producers by\n            providing additional financial resources to small scale,\n            private farmers and modernizing the agribusiness methods and\n            practices of managers of large scale farms. Bank performance\n            was satisfactory. The Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory through all stages of the project cycle. The\n            main lessons from the project were as follows: (i) project\n            design should be limited to achievement of a few, key,\n            well-defined objectives, and should be appropriately\n            reflected at the outset in agreed implementation\n            arrangements; (ii) (ii) policy conditionalities should be\n            limited to a few, key actions, with a clear indication of\n            priorities and importance; and (iii) special attention needs\n            to be provided to the design and implementation arrangements\n            where the project's technical assistance component is\n            financed largely from external donor sources."}, "docdt": "1997-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
