{"cdata!": "As Hungarian agriculture competes with\n            temperate climate countries of the northern hemisphere, it\n            must develop a functional domestic market structure which\n            sends clear signals to the farming and agroprocessing\n            sectors in the form of higher prices for quality products.\n            The objectives of the Integrated Agricultural Export Project\n            include : a) provision of quality food products for export;\n            and b) making agricultural producers more efficient by\n            providing additional financial resources to private, small\n            scale farmers.  The project will provide a line of credit to\n            finance investments by private farmers, agricultural and\n            agroprocessing enterprises to improve their operations.\n            Investment funds will finance planting material, breeding\n            and fattening stock, equipment for improvement of crop and\n            livestock production, and storage and commodity handling\n            facilities. The project also includes important agricultural\n            policy initiatives which support privitization of farming\n            assets and liberalization of prices and trade."}, "docdt": "1990-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
