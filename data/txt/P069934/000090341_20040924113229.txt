A. Project Development Objective

1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)

The overall objective for the World Bank's work inthe state o f Pemambuco is to support the Government's
agenda o f improving effectiveness and efficiency in service delivery whde ensuring social inclusion and
humandevelopment.

The development objectives o f the Pernambuco Integrated Development: Education Quality Improvement
Project are to (a) improve the quality, efficiency, and inclusiveness o f the public education system; (b)
modernize and strengthen the managerial, financial, and administrative capacity o f the Secretariat o f
Education to set policies and guidelines for the sector and deliver public education efficiently; and (c)
support the overall state modemization effort through interventions to be carried out in the Secretariat o f
Education and to be replicated inother state institutions.

2. K e y performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
By 2009 it is expectedthat the project will result in:

   m       Increased grade 4 completion rate from 81% to 86%, the Brazilian level.
           Increased fundamental level completion rate from 54% to 60%, the Brazilian level./l
           Increased fundamental level approval rate from 69% to 78%, the Brazilian level.
           Improved student learning achievement test scores (SAEB) in State schools to reach the national
           average.
           Decreasedpercentage o f overage students inthe fundamental cycle from 53% to 46%.
           Decreasedpercentage o f overage students inthe secondary cycle from 68% to 60%.
           Decreasedrepetition rates inthe fundamental cycle in State schools from 31% to 23%.
           Increase approval rates inIndigenous schools from 60% to 70% and in Quilombola schools./2
           Decrease fundamental cycle dropout rates inIndigenous schools from 13% to 10% and in
           Quilombola schools./2
           Complete SEDUC's state personnel census and formulate a medium-term staffing strategy.
           SEDUC meets the Law o f Fiscal Responsibility (LFR) personnel expenditure ceiling (60% o f net
          current revenue) each year until2007.

B. Strategic Context
1.Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 27043-BR              Date of latest CAS discussion: November 10,2003

The main CAS objectives are to promote a more equitable, sustainable, and competitive Brazil through a
multisectoral assistance program. The CAS specific education sector goals are to improve quality and
outcomes focusing on basic education, with increasing involvement in secondary education, early child
development, andhigher education.

/lThefundamentallevelincludesgrades1stthrough8thwhilesecondaryeducationincludesgrades9ththrough1lth. Basic
  education comprises of both fundamental and secondary levels. If the OECD methodology were used to calculate the
  completion rates for Brazil and Pemambuco, those figures would be 77% and 64%, respectively. This document uses the
  official education data producedby Brazil's National Institute for Education Studies and Research (INEP).

12 Because Quilombolu groups are not legally recognized as a separate ethnic group, disaggregated data are not available for
  them in the school census and no baseline information is available for Quilombola students. Baseline data are expected to be
  collected before project implementation.

 The goals o f the Pernambuco Integrated Development: Education Quality Improvement Project are
 consistent with the education sector goals o f the CAS in its emphasis to improve the quality o f basic
 education both at the state and municipal levels. By improving the quality o f education, the project seeks to
 achieve lower repetition and dropout rates and, consequently, reduce the number o f overage students inthe
 system, crucial steps for achieving the goals o f Education For All (EFA). Project goals are also consistent
 with the 2003 World Bank Policy Notes which, among six priorities, recommends the following:               (i)
intensifjring practices that increase quality and efficiency o f schooling, including giving schools autonomy
to develop their own development strategies; (ii)       prioritizing investments that increase equity and raise
outcomes; and (iii)   accelerating the provision o f secondary schooling.

Finally, the project is also consistent with the integrated development approach adopted by the State o f
Pemambuco and supported by the Bank. Such approach consists o f orienting Government actions and
interventions toward addressing four key priority challenges, identified during a participatory strategic
planning exercise in September of 2002. Those challenges are: (i)       stimulating economic development; (ii)
promoting social inclusion, particularly o f youth at risk; (iii) modemizing govemance and deepening public
administration reforms, particularly in the delivery o f education, health, and public safety; and (iv)
increasing access to water and sanitation in poor areas. With the exception o f the water and sanitation
objective, the proposedproject addresses all o f the challenges identified andprioritized by the Government.

2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:

Overview

Pemambuco, with its 7.9 million inhabitants spread across 184 municipalities, is the most urbanized state
o f the Northeast with 42 percent o f the population living around its capital, Recife. Pemambuco's GDP per
capita is R $ 3,279, above the Northeast average o f R$ 2,671 and below the national average R$ 5,740.
Pemambuco is characterized by a highly unequal income distribution: 54 percent of the population earn
monthly salaries two times or less the minimum wage while only one percent eam more than 20 times or
more the minimum wage.         While all social indicators have shown improvements over the last decade,
Pemambuco's Human Development Index (HDI) remains at .608, well below the national average (330)
andthere are large inequalities within the state.

Similar to other states in Brazil, Pemambuco's education system comprises the Municipal and State
systems, as well as private schools. According to the 2001 School Census, there are about 2.7 million
students in Pemambuco enrolled in 11,970 schools at the different levels in the three systems.        The state
system covers 35 percent o f all the students and 8 percent o f all the schools. Municipal students represent
almost half o f all students and 70 percent o f the schools. Private schools serve approximately 16 percent o f
the students and operate about 21 percent o f all the schools inPemambuco. Schools Iocated inrural areas
account for 57 percent o f all schools and 19 percent o f enrollment.

At the state level, the Secretariat o f Education (Secretaria de EducaqGo e Culturu -- SEDUC) is the
government body responsible for managing the education system and its 1,086 schools (99 of them
indigenous), and delivering education to 963,056 students. The SEDUC is organized into 17 Regional
Management Offices (Gergncias Regionais de Educacdo -- GERE), which provide support and guidance
to the schools.

Sector Issues

Deficient public sector administration. Pemambuco's public administration is characterized by the low
quality o f public services, lack o f accountability, and a tight fiscal situation. The lack o f universal access
to public services and their low quality hinder the State's ability to improve the quality o f life o f a
significant portion o f the population. On the other hand, the weak capacity for revenue collection and the
high shares o f personnel and other recurrent expenditures limit the Government's capacity to invest.
Likewise, the heavy administrative structure combined with the limited managerial flexibility have hindered
the State Government ineffectively and efficiently providing public services to the population.

In the education sector, the heavy administrative structure o f the SEDUC prevents the efficient and
effective delivery of quality education.       The current structure, including the policies and procedures
followed by SEDUC's offices and schools, make it difficult for schools to operate with more autonomy and
do not foster accountability. SEDUC currently has 66,559 staff on its payroll, about one-third o f whom
already retired.   Teachers in the classroom represent only 40 percent o f SEDUC's staff, though over
one-third o f those have temporary contracts. Additionally, while 18 percent o f all staff are assigned to
SEDUC's regional offices, those offices have limited autonomy to operate and decision-making authority
remains at SEDUC, which accounts for one percent o f all staff. Finally, two percent o f SEDUC's staff are
working outside o f the education sector but SEDUC remains responsible for financing those salaries.

While the current administration supports greater school autonomy, little has been done to modemize the
administrative structure so that it can operate more efficiently inthe context o f autonomous schools. As a
result and in spite o f almost one decade o f initiatives to make schools more autonomous, they still lack
managerial, administrative, and financial autonomy.       School Councils coexist with Implementation Units
(Unidade Executors -- UEX) and this has generated conflicting signals as to the real functions o f School
Councils inthe school community. Furthermore, the laws that govem the use o f public resources inBrazil
are not designed to allow small entities such as School Councils to manage and spend public resources,
even in very small amounts.       Finally, the implementation o f a two-step selection process for school
directors in 2001, with the participation o f the school community, has not been followed by the delivery of
adequate training to the 726 elected directors.

Coverage and exclusion. Education coverage at the fundamental level is still not universal inPemambuco
-- 90 percent andbelow the national level o f 94 percent -- as there are approximately 180,000 chldren aged
7 to 14 outside o f the school system. Additionally, there are still several municipalities with enrollments
lower than the state average. In 1998 there were 56 municipalities with coverage at the fundamental level
between 80 and 90 percent, 32 municipalities with coverage between 70 and 80 percent, and 9
municipalities with less than 70 percent coverage. It is not known whether low school enrollment inthese
municipalities results from lack o f available school places, demand-side problems, or to the fact that
students may select to enroll in neighboring municipalities.        Even though exclusion from the education
system is normally associated with poverty, children with special needs and minority groups such as
Indigenous and Quilombola chldren also tend to be disproportionately excluded from the formal education
system.    The Quilombola population is estimated at 33,300 people distributed in 39 communities.
Indigenous groups comprise a population o f approximately 20,000 people and there are 6,336 Indigenous
students enrolled in school, but there is little connection between what is taught in school and Indigenous
cultural and historic traditions. Finally, there are less than 15,000 students classified as special education
students out o f more than 2.7 million students in Pemambuco, indicating that the majority o f students with
special needs are outside the formal education system.

Another dimension o f education exclusion in Pemambuco is the large number o f adolescents and young
 adults who are not enrolled in school, not participating inthe labor market, and who have limitedifany job
 skills because they dropped out o f school before completing the fundamental cycle. The current education
 system has not been able to respond to the needs o f this growing group.          In 2002, 12 percent of the
population aged 15 to 17 was outside o f the school system. Furthermore, the average years o f schooling
for the 18 to 24 year old population is 7.2 and only 27 percent o f the population aged 18 to 24 years have
completed secondary education, compared to 7.8 and 32 percent for the national average.

Highrepetitionand age-made distortion. While net enrollment rates inPemambuco have increasedsteadily
inthe last five years, education indicators show a system that is plaguedwith age-grade distortions. About
half o f all the students enrolled inthe fundamental cycle are at least one year older than the appropriate age
for their grade level, well above the national average (39%) and only slightly less than the Northeast
average (57%).

The principal factors behmd age-grade distortion are late entrance to schools and the highrepetition rates.
Data for 2000 show that at the first grade almost half o f all students repeat while in fifth grade about 36
percent repeat. For each group o f 100 students entering the fundamental cycle, only 54 percent complete
8th grade. Even more shocking, only 3.2 percent o f students entering first grade manage to complete
fundamental education within the expected eight years. The average age o f students graduating from 8th
grade is 16 (compared to the expected 14), which results inlate entrance inthe secondary cycle and an ever
greater age-grade distortion at that level. While the average repetition rate is also high in the secondary
level, averaging 22 percent, it is clear that age-grade distortion at that level is mostly the result o f high
retention rates in the fundamental cycle o f students aged 15 to 17 years. As many as 68 percent o f all
students inthe secondary cycle are at least one year older than the corresponding age for their grade.

Classroom observations carried out during project preparation indicate that age-grade distortion seems to
be particularly high among Quilombola students.         In one Quilombola school visited only 6 of the 16
students inthe 8th grade were 15 years o f age or under. Quilombola students share with other students the
main reasons for age-grade distortion, namely late entrance to schools and high grade repetition rates.
However, they also have a high incidence o f temporary dropout from school, and t h s behavior is more
frequent and lasts longer among Quilombola boys.

The "repetition culture" as it i s commonly called in Brazil permeates Pemambuco's education system.
Approximately 56 percent o f all enrollment at the fundamental level is from repeaters. On average, only
about half o f the students enrolled in 1st grade ever complete the 8th grade, and when they do they take an
average o f 9.3 years to do so. Given the high levels o f repetition and dropout, the average number o f
enrollment years for each student who completes the fundamental cycle is 17.4. While ostensibly students
are asked to repeat to ensure appropriate learning outcomes before they move on to the next grade, the
results from the National System for Basic Education Evaluation (Sistema Nacional de Avaliaciio da
EducaGGo Busica -- SAEB), from the Education Evaluation System o f the State o f Pemambuco (Sistema
de AvaliaGCo Educacional de Pernambuco -- SAEPE) and from the National Secondary Education Exam
(Exame Nacional do Ensino Midi0 -- ENEM) demonstrate that overage students tend to have the worst
test scores. The 2002 SAEPE shows that in all grade levels, the more a student repeats grades the worst
hisher performance is inthe SAEPE.

L o w student achievement level and inadequate teacher aualifications and skills.         The performance o f
Pemambuco students as measured by the SAEB tests applied to a sample o f 4th, 8th, and 1lth graders in
1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001 has been close to the Northeast average and below the national one. In 1999,
only three o f the 27 Brazilianstates scored below Pemambuco in the mathematics and Portuguese SAEB


                                                     - 6 -

 test. Considering that the national average i s already far from adequate --in2000 Brazil placed last o f 32
 countries inthe Intemational Program o f Student Assessment (PISA) o f the OECD examination-- the even
 lower performance o f Pemambuco students is a strong indicator o f the poor quality o f education that the
 students are receiving.

 Inaddition to the SAEB tests, in2000 and 2002 the SEDUC carried out its own student achievement tests.
 The SAEPE included all students enrolled inthe 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 1lth grades in the State system. The
2000 SAEPE also included 68 municipalities and covered 292,106 students from 936 State schools and
 1,842 from Municipal schools. The results were equally disappointing: 37 percent o f 2nd graders could
not read a simple text; none o f the 4th graders was able to correctly respond at least half o f the test
questions; the highest score among 8th graders was in science test with less than half o f the questions
answered correctly, followed by 41% in Portuguese, and 30% in mathematics. A t the 11th grade, only
one-fourth of the students tested achieved the standards established by the teachers and specialists who
have designed the tests.

The 2002 SAEPE included all municipalities and covered 438,734 students from 6,098 schools
representing 95 percent o f all students enrolled in2nd, 4th, 8th, and 1lth grades inpublic schools (schools
with less than five students didnot participate). About one-third o f the students evaluated were enrolled in
rural schools. The results o f the 2002 SAEPE show no improvement in student performance. At the 2nd
grade, less than one-third o f the students were able to correctly respond to more than half o f the questions,
with negligible differences between state and municipal schools, and scores a little higher for urban schools.
Similar results were found at the 4th grade, with only 36 percent o f the students correctly answering more
than half o f the questions. The 8th grade results show that only 14 percent o f the students were able to
correctly respond more than half o f the questions in mathematics and 29 percent in Portuguese. These
results confirm that there has been no significant improvement inthe quality o f education in Pemambuco in
the last few years.

One o f the contributing factors to the poor student performance in Pemambuco is the low qualifications
and inadequate skills o f the teachers. According to the 2001 School Census, Pemambuco has 117,852
teaching positions in the entire education system (teachers often work at more than one network, so the
figure represents positions not teachers). About half o f the teaching positions are filled by teachers without
a higher education degree -- 70 percent o f the positions in 1st through 4th grades and 10 percent o f the
positions in 5th through 8th grades.      In the State network, 15 percent o f 36,280 teaching positions are
occupied by teachers without a higher education degree and five percent by teachers who do not even have
a secondary degree level. In the Municipal network, less than one-third o f the teachers have a higher
education degree.

Despite Pemambuco's huge investments in large-scale in-service teacher training programs inthe last 20
years, there is no evidence o f the impact o f these programs on student learning. One interesting observation
related to teacher qualifications is that student approval rates are higher (90 percent) and repetition rates
lower in the private system than in public schools, but only about half o f the teachers working in private
schools have a higher education degrees (compared to 80 percent inthe state system). The possible reasons
for this difference in outcomes include the fact that private school teachers have greater accountability
required by parents and students and teach a self-selected group o f students who come from higher income
families in which parents have higher levels o f education.      Finally, private schools tend to have better
school infrastructure and greater availability o f didactic materials. While there may be several reasons
behind the difference inperformance between public and private schools, the data clearly show that having
teachers with a university degree will not by itself necessarily lead to improvements in the quality o f
teaching. Recent research in Brazil confirms that, at the secondary level, teachers' education, salary, and


                                                       - 7 -

 pedagogical practices do not have a significant impact on student leaming.            Instead, the strongest
 correlation i s between the teachers' practical experience and leaming outcomes. Thus, there is a need to
 provide teacher training programs that directly address better classroom practices, particularly
 time-on-task.

 Inadequate infrastructure. It is estimated that about 40 percent o f school infrastructure in Pemambuco i s
 inadequate, with some schools operating in rented buildings and most without adequate furnishing and
 equipment.     Data for 1998 show that 27 percent o f the public schools in Pemambuco have sanitary
 facilities outside the school building, less than 1 percent have a science or computer laboratory, and only
 one-tenth have libraries. Of the 6,074 schools that participated inthe 2002 SAEPE, one-thrd didnot have
runningwater and 12 percent had no electricity. The same survey found that municipal schools hadbetter
infrastructure than state schools and that municipal rural schools were the ones with the greatest
improvement in terms o f infrastructure. No assessment has been made o f the accessibility o f school
infrastructure to disabled student but the prevailing conditions in schools indicate this to be lacking. Given
that SAEPE results pointed to infrastructure deficiencies as one o f the factors affecting student
performance, ensuring minimumquality standards for the schools inPemambuco is another challenge faced
bythe Government.

The schools serving Quilombola and Indigenous communities tend to have poor infrastructure, including
the lack o f electricity, clean water, and bathrooms. According to the 2001 Diagnostic o f Indigenous
Education, which examined the condition o f schools located in the Indigenous communities, out o f 97
schools, only two had sufficient school materials available for its students, including the minimum
materials required for learning activities, such as pencils and blackboards. It should be noted, however,
that the inferior conditions described above are not unique to these two groups.         Several remote rural
schools face similar shortcomings.

Poor Coordination between the State and the Municipalities. The education sector in Pemambuco suffers
from inadequate coordination between the State and the Municipalities. Despite the National Education
Law in 1996 (Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Education National -- LDB), which specifies roles and
responsibilities in the delivery o f education for each level o f government, the distribution o f education
functions and responsibilities among sub-national levels o f government is still quite variable across the
different systems in most o f Brazil. In the case Pemambuco, grades 1 through 4 are largely provided by
the Municipal network, while grades 5 through 11 are provided by the State network. But significant
overlap between the two systems still remains.          Municipal schools serve about 55 percent o f the
fundamental level students, followed by state schools (32 percent).        At the secondary level (grades 9
through ll),   77 percent o f the students are enrolled in State schools, followed by 17 percent in private
schools, and about 5 percent in Municipal schools. The Municipal and private systems deliver the bulk o f
preschool education. The lack o f coordination and clear division o f responsibilities between SEDUC and
the 184 Municipal Secretariats o f Education makes the administration o f education unnecessarily
inefficient inresponding to the system's demands and challenges. The problems associated with the parallel
systems create difficulties in optimizing resources, establishing accountability, and ensuring compatible
standards and prerequisites interms o f inputs and outputs inthe system.

Poverty related factors. Pemambuco has the second hghest incidence o f absolute poverty inthe Northeast,
with almost 2.6 million people living in poverty. While education efforts in Pemambuco have yielded
positive results in terms o f increasing access and reducing illiteracy, recent studies show that the poorest
segments o f the population tend to have the worst education performance. A larger share o f the poor never
enter the fundamental education cycle, comprising about 29 percent o f children from indigent families (i.e.
families with insufficient income to purchase the basic food basket    --R$73.36 in 1999) and 19 percent o f


                                                     - 8 -

children from very poor families (i.e. families with insufficient income to purchase food and other basic
necessities -- R$149 in 1999)./3 Moreover, repetition rates are higher among poor children andthey tend to
enroll later: among children aged 11 to 14, a higher percentage o f the indigent (71 percent) and poor (53
percent) were still enrolled in grades 1to 4 which are intended for children aged 7 to 11.

L o w education outcomes among the poor are particularly worrisome in Pemambuco since education i s
highlycorrelated with the level o f hture eamings. A recent World Bank study shows that completing 4, 8,
 12 years o f schooling, and university education in Pemambuco, raises per capita household income by 33
percent, 55 percent, 106 percent and 219 percent, respectively. The same study also confirms that the poor
get lower economic return for the same level o f education than the rich, citing the low education quality as
a plausible explanation. L o w education attainment among poor chldren is part o f the vicious cycle o f
poverty as the education attainment o f parents is the main determinant o f student achevement.

There is also a direct correlation between poverty and the hgh incidence o f student dropout rates.
Regression analysis carried out as part o f the World Bank Social Assessment for the State o f Pemambuco
concluded that for all age groups, the most important determinants o f dropout are household income,
parents' education, andpremature entrance inthe labor market.

Government's Strategy

Recogmzing a tight fiscal situation and the low quality o f public services, the State Administration has
pursued an ambitious state reform agenda since the beginning of its first term in 1999, calling for bold
measures to contain the cost o f government services and improve their efficiency. The vision and priorities
o f the State Reform are expressed inthe Master Plan for the State Reform (Pluno Diretor du Reformu do
Estudo -- PDRE) o f January 2000. The PDRE comprises a series o f policy and administrative measures to
increase managerial flexibility, while attempting to strengthen accountability.                   Specifically, the P D W
identifies as the main reasons for reform: (a) necessity o f fiscal adjustment; (b) deficiency in public
services; (c) the need to insert the State into the new pattem o f global production and to establish a stable
economic environment to attract private investments; (d) the changed role o f government from an
entrepreneurial state to a normative, regulator state whose main responsibilities are to guarantee universal
access to essential services; and (e) the need for control o f the state by society through greater transparency
in decision-making and service delivery that can be achieved by putting in place proper monitoring and
evaluation mechanisms.

The first-round o f reforms (1999-2002) resulted in some but not much concrete progress. The fiscal
pressure was alleviated by the proceeds o f extensive privatization o f State enterprises which allowed the
Government to move from a chronic deficit situation to a positive fiscal balance./4 The inflow o f
privatization funds allowed the Government to undertake a number o f priority infrastructure works without
upsetting the fiscal balance. However, as the privatization proceeds ran out, the State found itself once
again in a tight fiscal condition. Thus, in preparation for its second term (2003-2006), the Administration
renewed its earlier focus on the state reform, the substance of which was summarized in the document
"Restructuring and Modernization o f the State Apparatus" (October 2002). The new proposal continued to
base its fundamental rationale on the needto achieve greater economy (i.e., fiscal adjustment through

13 Indigenceline i s basedon the cost of a minimum food-basket (RS 73.36 in 1999) and lower-boundpoverty line as cost of
  minimum food-basketplus some non-foodexpenditures (about RS 149 in 1999).
/4 It shouldbe notedthat the use of the (extraordinary) privatization proceeds for financing capital expenditures meant that in
  terms of the prevailing accountingnorm, the State's primary balance worsened, in spite of the positive fiscal adjustments in
  other key dimensions such as the revenue performanceand the control ofpersonnel expenditures.




                                                            - 9 -

expenditure cuts and control), and efficiency and quality o f public services.        However, t h s time the
Government clearly identified social inclusion and human development as an explicit goal o f the reform.
The proposal highlighted four complementary areas o f emphasis:                   (i)introduction of a new
organizationaland adrmnistrative structure; (ii)  containment o f personnel expenditures and new personnel
management; (iii)reductions in non-salary recurrent expenditures; and (iv) restructuring and new
management model inhealth, education, and public safety sectors.

This proposal forms the basis for the State Reform Bill considered and approved by the State Legislative
Assembly on January 31, 2003 (Complementary Law No. 049). The new Complementary Law opens the
way for a number o f innovative governance and management approaches following the philosophy o f the
2000 PDRE. It mandates:

   (a)    Organization restructuring, whereby the number o f Secretariats is to be reduced from 17 to 12
   andthe number of indirect administration entities is to be reduced from 34 to 27.

   (b) Human Resources Reform.           The Law establishes two types o f public service careers: "Careers
   exclusive o f the State" to be governed by the respective statutes, and "Careers Non-Exclusive o f the
   State" to be governed by the general labor legislation.          The first type o f careers include senior
   managerial public positions, positions inlaw enforcement and legalijudiciary powers, the military police,
   and the military firefighting force. Future vacancies in positions belonging to "Non-Exclusive State
   Careers" would be automatically converted into the general labor legislationregime. Employees inthese
   positions would be subjected to periodical performance evaluations and could be dismissed under
   conditions specified by the law.

   (c)   Decentralization, Contracting-out, and Partnerships. The Complementary Law mandates
   decentralization or deconcentration o f those state functions that can more adequately be carried by other
   actors such as Municipalities, civil society organizations, or the private sector.

   (d) Priority Areas. The Complementary law directs the State to pay special attention to the areas o f
  health and education, reorganizing and modernizing their structures, giving priority to the units
  responsible for providing direct services to communities, and exercising constant monitoring and
   evaluation o f results in order to allow for timely corrections o f strategies. The Secretariat o f
   Administration and Reform o f the State (Secretaria de AdministraGGo e Reforma do Estado         -- S A R E )
   i s currently working with each line Secretariat to carry out this legislative mandate.

Since August 2002, the Bank intensified its dialogue with the State o f Pemambuco. A series o f meetings
were held to discuss the state's overall development challenges and policy priorities. These culminated ina
workshop in November o f 2002 where four strategic priorities were identified as bases for the next
Pluriannual Plan (Plano Plurianual      --PPA), which the Government is currently preparing with Bank
fmancial and analytical support. The four priority areas identified through this dialogue are (i)  enhancing
economic dynamism, especially o f small and medium-sized economic agents; (ii)improving living
conditions (habitabilidade), especially low-income families' access to quality water and sanitation services;
(iii)ensuring social inclusion, especially ofthe youth at risk; and (iv) strengthening governance and
management o f essential public services, especially education, health, and public safety.

In the education sector, SEDUC prepared a IO-year education strategy (Plano Estadual de Educapio,
2000-2009 -- PEE) at the beginning o f this Administration's first term (1999-2002).       The plan identified
two priority areas: (i)improving quality o f education through establishing a statewide student assessment
system, providing school inputs, and adopting strategies to reduce student dropout rates; and (ii)   reducing


                                                     - 1 0 -

system-wide inefficiencies by modemizing SEDUC's own structure so it functions better under a
decentralized school model, adopting accelerated programs to reduce age-grade distortions thereby reducing
future bottlenecks in the system, improving coordination and quality assurance in the Municipal school
systems, and promoting school leadership and autonomy.

Duringthe first two years following the publication of the PEE, SEDUC had limited success incarrying it
out but several achievements are recorded. Inthat period SEDUC developed the SAEPE and has applied
leaming assessment tests in 2000 and 2002 to all 2nd, 4th, 8th and 1Ith grade students enrolled in public
State schools.      The coverage o f the evaluation o f Municipal school students increased from 68
Municipalities in 2000 to all Municipalities in 2002. Inaddition, SEDUC adopted an accelerated program
at the fundamental and secondary levels with the objective o f reducing the high incidence o f age-grade
distortion.  Since 2000, almost 18,000 1st to 4th grade students and 14,000 secondary students have
benefited from this program. Additionally, since 1999 SEDUC is implementing a pilot in-service teacher
training program focused on improving student's literacy skills in the early grades and addressing the
cultural issue o f repetition among teachers. This program is expected to be expanded to cover all State and
Municipal schools. Finally, with financing from the School Improvement Program (Programa do Fundo
de Fortalecimento da Escolu -- FUNDESCOLA), SEDUC started an in-service teacher program in2000
(Programa para Forma@o de Professores em Exercicio        -- PROFORMACAO), targeting rural Municipal
teachers who have not completed upper secondary education. Currently, there are 1,791 teachers enrolled
inthis training, representing about 41 percent of all teachers inPernambuco without an upper secondary
education degree.

Realizing that quality and efficiency improvements are also affected by school management, SEDUC
adopted a more decentralized model o f school management, giving greater autonomy to schools and
providing incentives for schools to become more accountable to the school community and to the State.
Concretely, the main change that resulted from this policy has been the replacement o f politically appointed
school directors by a two-step selection process. The first phase o f the process involves a review o f
professional qualifications and a test on practical knowledge on school management, covering legislation
among other topics. Onthe second phase, the three candidates with the highest scores present a proposal to
the school community, who then elects the director o f their choice.  The first election process was carried
out in2001 and had the participation o f 1,632 candidates. Ofthese candidates, 1,151 were approved inthe
first phase, and 1,139 candidates ran in the elections for 775 state schools. The elected candidates were
nominated by the Governor for a three-year period, renewable for another three years. The final result was
that 726 o f the 986 state schools elected their principals.    To further advance school autonomy and
accountability, SEDUC plans to take several complementary actions, including: (i)     mandatory preparation
o f annual School Development Plans (Plano de Desenvolvimento Escolar -- PDEs), (ii)            provision of
management training to school directors and administrative personnel, and (iii)strengthening o f School
Councils through training. These actions are currently being defmed and should be implementedstarting in
2004.

Although SEDUC has launched several initiatives that are important for improving education in
Pemambuco, it has not carried out significant structural reforms that would have a long-term impact in
service delivery inthe education sector. Funds from the privatization o f State enterprises allowed SEDUC
to make the most urgent infrastructure investments but the necessary administrative reforms were
postponed, although they were contemplated inthe PDRE and the PEE. Thus, one o f the important current
challenges for SEDUC is to move toward an administrative model that is leaner and more consistent with
statewide modernization, decentralization, and deconcentration. Inthis respect, SEDUC is working in close
collaboration with SARE and the Secretariats o f Finance (Secretaria da Fazenda    -- SEFAZ), and Planning
(Secretaria do Planejamento -- SEPLAN) to define the strategy for modernizing its structure and make it


                                                    -11 -

 more responsive to the needs o f the schools.    Increasing efficiency in the education sector in terms o f
 increasing student promotion and graduation rates would be another important element in alleviating the
 fiscal constraint ineducation, as SEDUC wastes resources with student repeaters.

 3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
 The proposed project will focus on the following issues:

 Supporting the state-wide public sector modemization effort. The project will support the state-wide public
 sector modemization effort by helping develop public administration models and procedures, piloted at
 SEDUC, to improve effectiveness, efficiency and quality o f education.       The project will support:    (i)
 carrying out a detailed census o f State personnel and developing a proposal for performance-based
personnel management; (ii)developing an organization and management model, consistent with the
principles o f the State Reform and establishing a certification o f processes in the education system
according to the Intemational Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000; (iii)collecting and
processing social indicators data, and development and implementation o f models for monitoring
and evaluation of public policies and expenditures, in particular as related to education; and (iv)
fostering the implementation o f e-Government. By piloting the implementation o f such actions in the
education sector, SEDUC will pioneer the implementation o f the State Reform Program and will provide a
valuable example that can be applied to other Secretariats and public institutions in Pemambuco.
Additionally, by promoting greater efficiency in the education system, through the reduction o f repetition
and age-grade distortion, the proposedproject will be contributing to strengthenthe state's fiscal capacity.

Increasing access and inclusion.     The project will support interventions targeted at specific groups o f
children and youth such as Indigenous, Quilombola, and children with disabilities and special needs,
including school-specific interventions financed under the School Improvement Plans (PMEs). The aim o f
these activities is to make the schools more attractive to all children and more culturally appropriate to
minorities. Inthe Indigenous communities, SEDUC will build schools in areas identified as lacking them.
New construction will be financed with SEDUC's own resources while school rehabilitation will be
financed under the proposed project. In the case o f special education, in addition to PMEs focusing on
special education and inclusion, the project will also finance the purchase o f specially equipped vans to
transport disabled students and the purchase o f appropriate pedagogical materials. The project will also
support SEDUC's efforts to reorganize and rationalize the school system, including the municipalization
efforts already underway, to ensure the access to school to all school-aged children. Inaddition, the project
will support altemative programs targeting youth in schools identified as those with high incidence o f
violence, to foster youth permanence inthe education system andreduce violence. Because subsidies from
the Federal Bolsa Familia program are already reaching half a million children from all Municipalities in
Pemambuco and the Federal Government's intention o f increasing the coverage and scope o f this program,
the project will not finance demand-side interventions.

Improving education aualitv.      The project aims to improve the quality o f education both in terms o f
learning environment (input) and student achievement (output) through three lines o f action. The first one
includes ensuring that schools meet MinimumOperational Standards (MOS). The schools benefiting from
this intervention will be selected by SEDUC according to criteria outlined in Annex 2 o f this document.
The project's Operational Manual further details such criteria. The M O S was defined by SEDUC as a
simplified version o f the model financed under the FUNDESCOLA project and already adopted by several
Municipal schools in Pemambuco.          These operational standards include basic inputs, services, and
infrastructure that all schools should have. Additionally, the 16 regional centers for special education will
receive a set o f pedagogical materials. The second line o f action embraces the notion that school autonomy



                                                    - 1 2 -

coupled with strong community involvement leads to quality improvements at the school. Thus, the project
will support training for school directors, staff, and School Council members, to provide them with the
necessary skills to manage the schools under an autonomous model.               It will also promote community
involvement in the preparation o f the School Development Plans (Plano de Desenvolvimento Escolar --
PDE) and the implementation o f their associated subprojects targeting quality improvements at the school
and inthe classroom. Inthis context, the results of the SAEPE will be used to help the school community
diagnose teaching deficiencies so that, within its PDE, the school can identify the appropriate in-service
teacher training needed and address such deficiencies. Finally, a third line o f action includes supporting
current Government efforts to reform the pre-service teacher training program, including the definition o f a
new curriculum and in-service training to improve classroom skills.

Improving efficiency through reducing repetition and age-.uade distortion.            The proposed project will
support the Government's efforts to reduce repetition and age-grade distortion through a preventive and
corrective approach.      On the preventive side, it would finance the expansion o f an in-service teacher
training program (PROFA) developed by the Ministry o f Education that focuses on developing and
strengthening literacy in the initial grades for the fundamental cycle. This initiative differs from other
teacher training programs adopted by SEDUC in the past in that it has already been tested in some
Municipalities inPemambuco and has shown a positive impact inthe classroom. The proposed project will
finance the implementation o f a similar teacher training program focused on developing and strengthening
literacy and mathematic skills in the early grades.         These two training programs will complement the
training identified by schools and financed under the school subprojects, and will be available to both State
and Municipal teachers from schools that performed below the average in the SAEPE 2002. On the
corrective side, the project will support accelerated classes for overage students to complement those
already sponsored by the Government, thus reducing age-grade distortion and freeing up more spaces inthe
system.

The aforementioned actions will complement a bold initiative by SEDUC to improve literacy skills infirst
and second grades and eliminate repetition, described inthe following Chart.          As o f the beginning o f t h s
school year (2004), SEDUC has established a learning cycle for those early grades whereby the teachers
remain with the same group o f students for the two year period, during which time individual student
progress is closely monitored through a test every six months to ensure successful completion o f the cycle.

Modernizing and strengthening institutional capacitv. shifting the focus to the school. The modemization
and strengthening o f Pemambuco's schools and its school system is essential to ensure the sustainability o f
the Government's education strategy and the activities proposed under the project. The project will support
this goal by: (i)  strengthening SEDUC'smanagerial, financial, and administrative capacity to function in a
more effective and efficient manner; (ii)strengthening SEDUC's capacity to formulate and implement
statewide education policies; (iii)     improving the education information system, including monitoring and
evaluation; (iv) reviewing the pre-service teacher training program and developing and implementing a
teacher accreditation system; and (iv) promoting partnerships with Municipalities to increase access and
improve quality inthe fundamental cycle o f education.

C. Project Description Summary
1. Projectcomponents (see Annex 2 for a detailed description andAnnex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

Component 1. ImprovingQuality and Efficiency of the State Schools (US$28.6 million or 54.5 percent
o f total project cost without contingencies). This component seeks to improve the quality and efficiency o f
the 1,086 state schools in Pemambuco through the following subcomponents.

1.1       Strengthening School Autonomy Subcomponent: (US$7.3 million or 13.9 percent o f total
project cost without contingencies).               This subcomponent seeks to increase school efficiency and
accountability by giving the school community more autonomy and responsibility in managing their
schools.      In addition, it seeks to make schools more inclusive and culturally relevant to their students,
particularly in the case o f Indigenous schools 15, by giving them the autonomy to diagnose their own
situation and address deficiencies. This would be achieved through: (i)               providing management training to
school directors and other school administrative staff; (ii)         supporting the preparation o f the PDEs, inwhich
schools diagnose their problems and outline strategies to address those problems; and (iii)                      transferring
funds directly to schools to finance school subprojects (PMEs). School subprojects include, but are not
restricted to, in-service training for teachers, activities that promote inclusion o f children with disabilities,
equipment, library books, and didactic materials. As part o f the PDEs, whenever appropriate, schools
would be asked to include a strategy for inclusion o f students with special needs.

/5 Schools serving the Quilombola communities are under the responsibility of the Municipal governments. As such, they will
    receive financingto carry out similar activities under the secondcomponent of this project, which supports the development
    andimplementationof educationpoliciesstate-wide.

The project's Operational Manual will include the procedures for the selection o f PDEsPMEs. Municipal
Secretariatsof Education will have autonomy to select the PMEs for municipal schools to be financed by
the project, according to the guidelines prepared by SEDUC and included in the project's Operational
Manual.

 1.2     Ensuring Minimum Operational Standards at Schools Subcomponent (US$20.9 million or
39.9 percent o f total project cost without contingencies).    This subcomponent seeks to ensure that State
schools, including those serving Indigenous communities, meet the minimumoperational standards in terms
o f their infrastructure and inputs. SEDUC has defined basic operational standards in terms o f the
minimuminputsrequiredina classroom for students to leam, according to its needs and financial capacity.
The model consists o f a predetermined set o f essential inputs such as library books and students materials,
school h i t u r e such as desks, chairs, and shelves, and physical facilities, ensuring access to disabled
students, structural soundness, safety factors, and sanitary facilities. It should be noted, however, that the
project will not finance new construction. This subcomponent will also finance computer laboratories in
state schools that already have the physical facilities to accommodate the equipment --financed by
Alvorudu resources-- but that have not yet received the equipment. Additionally, only schools that met the
minimumoperational standards, have more than 500 student, and serve grades 5th and above wouldreceive
computers. Finally, t h s subcomponent will finance educational materials for the 16 regional centers for
students with disabilities. To complement the actions financed by this subcomponent, SEDUC will build
new indigenous schools in areas identified as lacking infrastructure while project financing will cover
rehabilitationo f existing schools andprovision o f essential inputs.

1.3      Improving Teachers Qualifications Subcomponent (USS0.4 million or 0.8 percent o f total
project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent will support a pilot pre-service teacher training
underthe revisedcurricula which aims to improve the quality o f the State public schools and to address the
shortage o f teachers in grades 5 through 8 and in secondary education. Once the new curricula is inplace,
financing will be provided for hgher education training for 300 State teachers who do not have a tertiary
degree. While ensuring this level o f qualification for teachers is particularly important given the expected
growth inenrollment inthe upper grades o f the fundamental cycle, the project will support such effort on a
pilot basis to ensure the new curricula is adequate and the investment yields positive results in terms o f
student learning. Training specialization will be offered in subject areas identified by SEDUC as areas
with a shortage o f teachers, and will take into consideration demandprojections resulting from enrollment
simulations carried out inthe first year o f project implementation.

Component 2. Improving System Efficiency and Effectiveness and Expanding Inclusion (US$15.4
million or 29.3 percent o f total project cost without contingencies).      This component aims to improve
education policy for the entire system and to support programs targeted to areas o f special concem such as
less than satisfactory teaching performance, high repetition rates, large age-grade distortions, the need to
consolidate a culture o f evaluation, and the exclusion o f children with disabilities inthe education system.
This will be achieved through the following subcomponents.

2.1      Enhancing Educational Policies and Performance Subcomponent (US$0.4 million or 0.7
percent o f total project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent seeks to improve the formulation
and implementation o f education policies that have an impact on the entire education system, including the
State, Municipal, and private schools, through the following activities:      (a) definition o f (i)policies for
curricula development and education materials, including educational software, (ii)policies for school
certification and standards; and (iii)strategy to strengthen Municipal Teacher Training Colleges; (b)
consolidation o f the SAEPE and dissemination o f results to schools and stakeholders; and (c) improvements

 ininformation systems covering education statistics, school enrollment, school census, and other education
 management tools.

 2.2      Supporting Education Programs to Increase Quality and Inclusion Subcomponent (US$l5.0
 million or 28.6 percent o f project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent seeks to improve the
 quality o f education in Municipal schools with the worst performance on SAEPE, reduce age-grade
 distortions at the fundamental level, and diminish youth idleness and involvement in anti-social activities
 through the following activities:   (i)support the expansionof accelerated classesprogramfor overage
 students attending grades 1 through 4 and 5 through 8; (ii) provision o f in-service teacher training to 1st -
4th grade teachers in all State schools and 1st to 4th grade Municipal teachers at the 500 schools with
 worst performance in the 2002 SAEPE; (iii) program targeting youth to be implemented by civil society
                                               a
 organizations (OrganizaG6e.sda Sociedade Civil -- NGOs) in schools identified as "high risk" due to high
 incidence o f problems with violence, drugs, teen pregnancy, and illicit activities; and (iv) support for the
preparation and implementation o f PDEs and PMEs in Municipal schools with the worst performance in
the SAEPE, including schools identified as either Quilombola or those primarily serving the those
communities (about 30 inall). Such PMEs will include subprojects that address the needs o f children with
disabilities and/or promote their inclusion inthe Municipal schools.

Component 3. Supporting the State Reform(US$4.8 million or 9.1 percent of total project cost without
contingencies).   This component promotes the State reforms aimed at improving efficiency in delivering
public services through two subcomponents, one that addresses broader public sector issues such as
supporting the development o f public administration models and procedures according to the PDRE, and a
second subcomponent that focuses on the introduction o f the more efficient models andprocedures into the
education sector.

3.1       Supporting the Implementation of the State Reform Subcomponent (US$1.6 million or 3
percent o f total project cost without contingencies). The objective o f this subcomponent is to support the
implementation of reforms recommended in the PDRE through the development o f public administration
models and procedures, which would then be piloted at SEDUC to improve effectiveness, efficiency, and
quality o f education. By doing that, SEDUC will pioneer the implementation o f the PDRE, serving as
example inthe development o fprocedures that could be applied to other Secretariats andpublic institutions
in Pemambuco. This subcomponent comprises six key activities: (i)        implementation o f the management
modernization program; (ii)creation o f an effective customer relations office at SEDUC (Ouvidoria)
serving education stakeholders; (iii)implementation o f e-government; (iv) development o f SEDUC's
managerial capacity through the Government School (Escola de Governo); (v) development o f a human
resources policy for SEDUC's State employees; and (vi) collection and processing of social indicators
data, and development and implementation o f models for monitoring and evaluation o f public
policies and expenditures, inparticular as related to education.

3.2       Strengtheningand ModernizingEducationManagementSubcomponentoJS$3.2 millionor 6.1
percent o f total project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent seeks to modernize SEDUC by
introducing changes recommended in the PDRE and developed under the previous subcomponent, in the
following areas: (a) human resources, (b) financial management, (c) planning, (d) technology, and (e)
supervision, monitoring and evaluation o f the education sector activities.     Technical assistance will be
provided to support the reorganization o f the SEDUC, including the introduction o f management
improvements to ensure more efficient service delivery, and legal and organizational measures necessary
for the implementation o f the reforms.

Component 4.       Project Management (US$2.3 million or 4.5 percent o f total project cost without
contingencies). T h ~ scomponent will finance the management o f the project and, at the same time support
the strengthening o f SEDUC through the provision o f technical assistance and consultant services to
implement the project and to adapt SEDUC to better integrate and gradually absorb project functions.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The proposed project was designed to support the goals o f Pemambuco State Education Plan for
2000-2009 and the Master Plan for the State Reform, including the implementation o f the public reform in
the education sector.   The following key policies and institutional reforms will be supported by the
proposed project:

   Supporting the public sector modernization effort by piloting proposed structural and administrative
   changes inseveral areas, including HumanResources Reform inthe education sector.

  Increasing efficiency of the State Secretariat of Education by supporting state-wide public
  modemization efforts.

  Improving the quality of education through the implementation o f Minimum Operational Standards
  for State schools and by encouraging Municipalities to do the same, and enhancing the skills o f teachers
  through in-service training anda re-designed curriculum for pre-service training.

  Ensuring the participation of excluded groups into the education system such as children with
  disabilities, Indigenous children, and other minorities by transferring resources directly to schools so
  they can prepare school subprojects (PMEs) that are relevant to the communities they are serving.


                                                  - 1 8 -

   Ensuringthat schools catering to those groups are targetedinproject activities.

   Improving the efficiency of the system and increasing completion rates by reducing repetition and
   correcting student flows through the provision o f in-service teacher training in Portuguese and
   mathematics targeted at lower primary level teachers and by expanding the accelerated program for
   overage students attending grades 1st through 8th.

   Increasing school autonomy and accountability by supporting a transparent, competence-based
   selection process for school directors, strengthening School Councils and ensuring that they are legally
   and technically capable to manage school resources; by transferring funds to the schools to be
   autonomously managed by them; and by fostering parent and community participation in school
   governance.

   Strengthening the State's Student Assessment System (SAEPE) through establishing an effective
   information system which ensures that results can be widely used as a decision-making inputs by the
   State and Municipal Secretariats o f Education.

   Improving coordination with Municipal systems, to increase coverage and quality o f education
   through sponsoring PDEs and PMEs in municipal schools with the worst performance in the SAEPE
   through Agreements (ConvZnios) with the Municipal Education Secretariats (Secretarias Municipais da
   EducaGZo, SMEs), whereby the State and Municipalities agree to coordinate key education policies such
   as school autonomy and accountability, transparency inthe selection o f school directors, and other kinds
   o f policies.

3. Benefitsand target population:
The direct beneficiaries o f the Pernambuco Integrated Development: Education Quality Improvement
Project will be basic education students in both State and Municipal schools and those entering school in
the near future. There are approximately 2.17 million students enrolled inbasic education -- 1.8 million in
the fundamental cycle and 373 thousand inthe secondary cycle, and there are another 1.17 million children
between the ages o f zero and six who will be entering school in the next five years. Students are expected
to directly benefit from better-prepared teachers, improved infrastructure, more adequate leaming
materials, better-managed and more accountable schools, and improved resource allocation. While project
benefits will accrue to the entire student population enrolled in public schools, ensuring minimum
operational standards is expected to benefit especially the poorest segments o f the student population,
which tends to be enrolled inschools inthe poorest areas and with worst conditions.

Additionally, the State Reform Component is expected to benefit three groups o f stakeholders. First, the
benefits o f achieving sustainable service delivery improvements in fundamental education accrue to all
Pernambuco residents who (or whose children) receive education from the public education system. To the
extent that good public education generates positive extemalities to society at large, effective
implementation o f the project should also benefit the State population as a whole. Second, the component
would benefit SEDUC by strengthening the agency's institutional capacity and modernizingits management
practices. Third, other government agencies would benefit from the implementation o f this component
through being able to leam from SEDUC's reform experience. The State Reform component is designed to
support application o f the Government State Reform agenda o n a preferential and pilot basis at SEDUC.
As SEDUC and SARE develop and execute a reform implementation strategy jointly, SARE inparticular
would be able to draw various lessons which it could subsequently apply to help implement the reform in
other sectors.

4. Institutionaland implementationarrangements:
The Pernambuco Integrated Development: Education Quality Improvement Project is expected to be
implemented over a period o f four years, from April 2005 to December 2009. SEDUC will be the main
project executing agency and will be supported by its 17 Regional Education Management Offices
(GEREs). SEDUC will work incoordination with other State Secretariats including SARE, SEPLAN and
SEFAZ in carrying out its administrative reform. In implementing the programs targeting youth at risk,
SEDUC will coordinate policies with the Secretariats o f Science, Technology and Environment (Secretaria
de Cigncia, Tecnologia e Ambiente -- SCTA), Citizenship and Social Policies, and Urban Development,
but programs will be directly implemented by NGOs. The School o f Government will execute part o f the
management training activities.            SEDUC will collaborate with participating Municipal Secretariats o f
Education to promote consistency between their actions and the project's goals. The School Councils in
State and Municipal schools will be responsible for preparing and implementing School Improvement
Subprojects (PME).

As a result o f the introduction o f the public sector reform, all state institutions suffered a down-sizing in
terms o f the staff positions allotted to them 16. For that reason, jointly with SARE, it was decided that the
most effective way o f implementing this project in accordance with the principles o f the reform was by
legally establishing a Project Coordination Unit (PCU)                        within SEDUC to coordinate project
implementation and allotting SEDUC eight additional staff positions for the PCU and 18 temporary
positions. The PCUwas legally established on December 29, 2003 and the eight staff positions have been
filled by Government staff. At project completion, the Government staff serving in the PCU are expected
to retum to their previous positions (or find alternative assignments within the Government), thus ensuring
the permanence of the acquired technical skills in the Government. Once the project is completed, the PCU
will cease to exist as its function will not longer be neededby the State. Likewise, temporary contracts end
when the project closes. On June 5, 2004, SEDUC also established a Special Bidding Committee to carry
out and oversee bidding processes. ' I h s committee is also formed by Government staff. The PCU has
technical and financial autonomy from SEDUC to implement the project but will coordinate with technical
offices in SEDUC, SARE and SEPLANthat are responsible for carrying out project activities andreaching
project targets. The PCU will have responsibility for: (i)           overseeing project implementation; (ii)     managing
project funds; (iii)    ensuring compliance o f Bank's guidelines incarrying out the project; and (iv) serving as
the liaison with IBRD staff during project execution.

Universities and NGOs will participate in project implementation under contract with SEDUC. SEDUC,
SARE and SEPLAN will have responsibility for: (i)                establishing priorities for the project; (ii)
                                                                                                             participating
in the preparation of the project's annual implementation plan; (iii)drafting terms of reference and/or
technical documents required for project implementation; (iv) ensuring, together with the PCU, compliance
with IBRD guidelines and procedures to carry out procurement processes and identifying consultants
andor service providers; and (v) ensuring the quality o f services carried out under the project. SARE and
SEPLAN will sign Agreements                   (Convenios) with SEDUC to carry out their share o f project
responsibilities. Resources will be transferred to the participating Secretariats upon the presentation o f a
satisfactory proof o f service completion.            SARE and SEPLAN will be responsible for maintaining all
documentation related to these expenses for the purpose o f project supervision and audits.

16 Staff positions ("cargos de confianpz") refers to the actual number of appointmentsallotted to SEDUC, normally awardedas
  managementpositions or other positions recognized as those of essential nature which should be directly appointed by the
  Secretary. Such appointments are accompanied by a gratification in addition to the government salary received by the
  person.

 D. Project Rationale
 1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Demand-side interventions. Although the highincidence o f poverty among school-aged children is llkely
to hinder their opportunities to attend school (19 percent o f children from poorhndigent families never
enroll in the fundamental cycle), the project preparation team decided that the Federal Education Subsidy
Program (Bolsa Familia) already addresses this demand-side issue.            There are almost half a million
children --representing    all municipalities- receiving Bolsa Familia (formerly Bolsa Escola) in
Pemambuco. Additionally, the current Federal Administration has signaled that it plans on emphasizing
such types o f demand-side interventions targeting the poorest segments o f the Brazilian population.

Teacher training.      The project design reflects the belief that improving the quality o f teachers in
Pemambuco is essential to improving student performance. However, it also reflects the fact that the
training needs o f teachers varies tremendously across schools, no single training program can adequately
address those differences, and that large-scale training programs have failed in the past. Thus, instead o f
offering a predetermined set o f in-service teacher training programs, the preparation team opted to allow
schools, using SAEPE results, to diagnose their own teaching deficiencies as part o f their PDE and to
allocate funds for in-service teacher training within the School Improvement Subprojects (PMEs). At the
same time, project design acknowledges that in-service teacher training focused on Portuguese and
Mathematics for the 1st through 4th grade teachers is justifiable given the high incidence o f repetition in
those grades and its direct impact on dropout rates and age-grade distortions. Given that such training
program has already been tested with positive results, the project will support it.

Accelerated education. The project design provides for financing o f accelerated classes only for students
in the fundamental level, because the SEDUC is already carrying out an accelerated program for students
inthe secondary cycle usingother resources.

Focus on the fundamental level. The current Administration has identified as one o f its four challenges
the social inclusion of youth between the ages o f 15 and 24. Of particular concem i s the highincidence o f
youth outside both the schooling system and the labor market. To address this problem the alternatives
considered were either to focus the project on upper secondary education or to have a program outside o f
the school system catered to youth who were out o f the education system. The team decided against both
options. About half of all students who enroll in 1st grade never complete 8th grade, and many o f those
who complete 8th grade lack the academic qualifications to proceed. As the PISA 2000 results show,
Brazil ranked last o f 32 countries interms o f student learning achievements. While investing inimproving
the quality and appropriateness o f upper secondary education would likely improve the employability o f its
graduates, this course o f action would still miss the students "lost" at the fundamental level, thus leaving a
large group o f youth without academic or working skills. The team also opted against including actions
targeting secondary education because it would result ina project whose interventions were too scattered to
have a strong impact. Instead, through the accelerated program, the project will focus on overage students
in 1stthrough 8th grades, with the aim ofassisting those students incompleting the fundamental education
cycle andhelping themmove to the secondary level.

Municipal participation.       There has been much debate on the extent to which Municipalities should
participatebenefit from the project. The quality o f education in Brazil cannot be improved without the
active participation o f Municipal governments.         The initial Government proposal was to restrict



                                                     -21  -

participation and only include those Municipalities that had participated in the first SAEPE assessment.
However, during project preparation the team realized that such criteria would discriminate against 60
percent o f all Municipalities, including several that are the poorest and neediest ones. Thus, it was agreed
that participating Municipalities would be selected on the basis of several indicators, such as performance
at the SAEPE and the UNICEF HDI index, and an agreement to continue participating in the SAEPE as
eliglbility criteria to benefit from project actions. Notwithstanding, grant transfers would be made directly
to the Municipal schools, without going through the Municipal Education Secretariats so as to ensure a
consistent policy between State and Municipal systems, andto promote school autonomy.

Computer laboratories. The project team debated whether it should limit the financing o f computers to
only the 145 schools scheduled to be remodeled with project financing rather than the 534 schools
requested by the Government.       The larger target was chosen because the Government informed the team
that those 534 schools already had the physical facilities ready to receive the equipment but the Federal
Government, which was supposed to purchase the equipment, had            tw1   out o f funds to provide them.
Additionally, the Government argued that by equipping those schools with computer laboratories, the
project would provide access to technology and internet to almost 70 percent o f all students in state
schools, a powerful equalizing factor.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Lessons learned from the design and implementation o f the Northeast Basic Education I, and I11Projects
                                                                                               11,
(Loans 1867-BR, 3604-BR and 3663-BR), the FUNDESCOLA Iand I1 Projects (Loans 4311-BR and
4487-BR), and the preparation o f the Cearh Education Project (Loan 4591-BR) and Bahia Education
Project (Loan 4592-BR) have been incorporated into the Pemambuco Education Quality Improvement
Project. More specifically, the project reflects the following lessons:

Focused Public Sector Reforms. The Bank spent nearly two decades designing and implementing public
sector reform projects inthe Latin America and Caribbean Region. Yet the Bank's track record with these
projects is mixed at best. Inthis field, the effects o f politics and organizational incentives play particularly
strong roles and it is often not easy to offer effective assistance for public sector reform. The Bank (as well
as others that are involved in this field) is still leaming about the dynamics o f public sector reforms, and
only tentative lessons have been drawn.

Given such a caveat, however, it seems that ambitious, comprehensive state reform projects with multiple
components tend to perform poorly, due to the complexity o f their implementation arrangements and the
typically uneven political readiness for reform across sectors/functional areas compromise project
implementation. Projects that focus on particular core government functions (e.g., financial management)
or target a particular agency (e.g., a tax agency) tend to be more successful overall. However, a narrowly
focusedenclave approach tends to suffer from weak sustainability. Successful reforms, as demonstrated
by Chile's decade-long efforts, require a carefully paced incremental approach over a significant number o f
years going beyond the typical life cycle o f one project. It has also been argued, though not necessarily
proven with clear empirical evidence, that public sector reform efforts that are clearly and directly linked to
improving govemment performance indelivering concrete services will have a better chance o f succeeding
than projects which exclusively aim to strengthening intemal administrative b c t i o n s (including
technological upgrading) without linkingthem to final policy/program outcomes.


                                                       - 23 -

 The proposed design o f the State Reform Component takes into account these lessons and (i) an      avoids
 over-ambitious design to focus on supporting reform implementation in a single sector; (ii)links the
 sector-specific modemization effort to the government's broader reform agenda thus aiming at increasing
 the probability o f its sustainability; and (iii)
                                                 subordinates the state reform agenda to concrete operational
 needs o f the education sector inorder to achieve quick and sustainable results with strong sector ownership.

 Importance of Basic Operational Standards. The establishment o f Minimum Operational Standards for
 schools inthe FUNDESCOLA projects has proven to be an useful and concrete tool for addressing school
 inequities. The standards are currently being adopted by several Municipalities inBrazil, including many in
 the state o f Pemambuco. However, these operational standards have also proven to be very elaborate and
 ambitious in a context o f limited fiscal capacity o f the states. Thus, taking FUNDESCOLA standards and
 the experience in selected municipalities, SEDUC has defined its own basic operational standards,
 appropriate to the State's capacity.

 Cooperation Between State and Municipal Systems. Given the structure and division responsibilities o f
the Brazilian education system, stronger coordination between the State and the Municipalities i s a
prerequisite to maximize resources made available to the schools and to reduce education inequality
state-wide. Past experience in the implementation o f the Paranh Education Quality and Minas Gerais
Pro-quality projects, as well as on-going experiences in the states o f Cearti and Bahia demonstrate that
cooperation with the Municipalities is essential in order for the project to have a significant impact on
education quality. Furthermore, consistent policies withinthe State prevent internal conflicts, duplication o f
efforts and contradictions, particularly with respect to issues related to teachers.

Adequate Monitoring and Evaluation Systems.               The positive experiences o f the nationwide Basic
Education Evaluation System (SAEB) undertaken by the Ministry o f Education with support from World
Bank projects, as well as Pernambuco's experience with its own Education Evaluation System (SAEPE
2000 and 2002), are incorporated in the project as a key element to continuously ascertain the quality o f
education in Sate and Municipal schools. The project will support SAEPE's dissemination as a tool to
improve the quality of education and its results will enable the SEDUC to develop and implement actions to
address those problems.

School Development Plans, Autonomy, and Participation. The results o f a preliminary evaluation o f the
School Development Plans (PDE) in Brazil indicate that the program has a significant effect on student
achievement, attendance, and attainment. The schools participating in the PDE program register improved
student test scores, especially inPortuguese, and reduced student grade failure and desertion. These results
held up even when controlling for student socioeconomic background, state characteristics, and school
quality. In general, the longer a school has been in the PDE program, the higher the test score gains over
non-PDE schools. Since a large share o f schools in the sample entered PDE in an early date (at the
beginning o f 1999), t h s means that students in those schools have made significant gains compared to
students innon-PDE schools. The evaluation results also show that these early-entering schools have been
able to reduce dropout rates and grade failure compared to non-PDE schools. This is the case even when
controlling for other variables, such as state and average student socio-economic status. Based on these
results, the project will support the PDE program.

Accelerated Classes. Age-grade distortion affects over half o f all students enrolled at the fundamental and
secondary education cycles inPemambuco. Large age-grade distortion is the result o f highrepetition rates,
late entrance into the system, and school dropout. Several states in Brazil have successfully "unclogged"
the system through the implementationof accelerated classes targeting overage students, offering them high


                                                     - 24 -

quality teachers and materials. Training to support this approach will be available in the project. The
inclusion o f accelerated classes, as well as the accelerated methodologies to be adopted by Pemambuco, are
based on successful experiences elsewhere in Brazil, particularly in the States o f SBo Paulo, Cearh, and
Parana.

4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The State Government is committed to the dual project objective o f supporting the application in the
education sector of the State modernization effort with the aim o f improving efficiency in service delivery,
while at the same time improving the quality, efficiency, and inclusiveness o f the public education system.

The Government o f Pernambuco is committed to an ambitious state reform agenda, as expressed in the
PDRE o f January 2000 and reiterated in the document Restructuring and Modernization of the State
Apparatus (October 2002). Duringthe first term o f this Administration, the State succeeded ineliminating
chronic fiscal deficits. During this current term, the Administration proposes to continue to develop and
deepen the State reform program, giving more emphasis to improving the efficiency and quality o f public
services.    Specifically, the plan calls for strengthening governance and management o f the key social
services (education, health, and public safety) as one o f the four priority challenges for Pemambuco, widely
known as "complementing infrastructure with social inclusion."

In the education sector, the Government`s commitment is expressed in the State Education Plan:
2000-2009, the implementation o f which has already started. Successful State initiatives germane to the
project include: (i)    support for the Federal Government's teacher training program PROFOEWACAO,
with the goal o f ensuring that all teachers in Municipal rural schools obtain secondary education
certificates; (ii)
                 jointly with the University o f Pemambuco, development o f an in-service teacher training
program for teachers who have not completed higher education; (iii)      establishment and consolidation o f the
SAEPE to enable SEDUC to better diagnose             the needs and deficiencies o f its students; (iv) gradual
reorganization o f the schools in order to better coordinate responsibilities with the Municipal governments;
(v) establishment o fa pilot accelerated program for secondary level students to remove eventual bottlenecks
inthe expansion of secondary education; and (vi) promotion of a more autonomous school-model with
greater accountability through eliminating political appointments for &rectors, strengthening School
Councils, and adopting the school development project (PDE). Additionally, as part o f the public sector
modernization efforts, SEDUC has already started its own restructuring by adopting a leaner and more
responsive structure that promotes greater coordination with Municipal Secretariats, and decentralizes
administration to regional offices and schools to achieve more efficient, responsive, and accountable
provision o f education services.

In sum, a strong commitment by the State Government and by the leadership of SEDUC supports the
challenging and innovative approach o f combining the objectives o f advancing public sector reform and
improving the quality o f education services inthe proposed project. This makes the effort viable and worth
pursuing, in spite o f the fact that it poses some implementation challenges for the project. The efficiency
gains resulting for the administrative reform o f SEDUC will directly impact on the State Administration as
a whole, since education expenditures now represent more than 10 percent o f total expenditures and the
reform model developed by SEDUC can be broadly disseminated throughout the State Administration.
Moreover, the scope and sustainability o f improvements in the quality o f education will be markedly
enhanced with the support o f a more efficient administration at SEDUC.         Ultimately, the synergy created
between the integrated objectives and lines o f action proposed for the project will strengthen Pemambuco's
institutional capacity to continue and expand quality education services over time.

5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
International Knowledge. The Bank is a well-known repository for intemational knowledge because o f
its active involvement in development programs, its extensive contacts with research organizations, and its
experience working with a wide range o f governments, sectors, and local communities. In addition to
providing financial resources to its clients, the Bank brings together global knowledge and experience,
neutrality and objectivity. It facilitates communication among key actors within and among countries, and
can offer relevant technical advice for reform implementation as the Government embarks on kmds o f
reform actions that few in Brazil have tackled.        Specific examples o f such support during project
preparation include Pemambuco's participation in the Continuous Leaming Framework (Marc0 de
Aprendizagem Continua      --MAC) enabling them to cross-fertilize information about the education sector
among several LatinAmerican countries.

National and Regional Experience. As the chief extemal financing institution for the Brazilian basic
education sector, over a decade, the Bank has amassed solid knowledge on national and regional education
issues and assimilated a diversified understanding o f cultural and political idiosyncrasies in the country.
For the past ten years the Bank has (i)     developed state education projects in S5o Paulo, Minas Gerais,
Parana, Cearb, and Bahia; (ii)  developed and implemented federal level projects in all states o f the North
and Northeast states; (iii)produced reports such as "A Call to Action" (1997), "Growth and Poverty
Reduction in Pemambuco: Developing a Sustainable Policy Framework" (2000), "Secondary Education in
Brazil: Time to Move Forwardt (2000), "Financing Education in Brazil" (1998), "Social Spending in
Selected States" (2002), and "Next Steps for Education in Four Selected States in Brazil" (2003) focused
on the Northeast. These lending and non-lending activities effectively contributed to improve the design o f
the proposed project.

Partnership and Cooperation. The Bank is able to function as a inter- and intra-national catalyst and
broker by bringing key actors to the table, and by stimulating the exchange o f information among
representatives from different levels o f Government, NGOs, andprivate organizations. Int h s capacity, the
Bank is able to foster policy dialogue and cooperation across groups that often have different points o f
view. Inthe particular case o f Pemambuco, the Bank team facilitated dialogue between SEDUC, SARE,
and SEPLAN on the subject o f State Reform inthe education sector. When different sector agencies are
pursuingtheir own legitimate policy goals, effective coordination among them, no matter how beneficial it
may be, is in practice hard to achieve. The Bank has facilitated such inter-sector coordination around the
Government's expressed priorities through its integrated strategic dialogue and in the preparation o f the
proposed project. Concretely, Bank staff specialized in education and public sector reform have worked
together with their respective counterparts to develop a viable joint working arrangement for SEDUC,
SARE, and SEPLAN. The Bank team will intensify this facilitating support during project implementation
to ensure continued coordination among the secretariats' involved.      Similarly, the Bank is workmg to
support coordinated actions between SEDUC and SEFAZ to address the state-wide fiscal reform agenda.
With regard to addressing problems o f youth at risk, the Bank team will promote the collaboration between
SEDUC and the Childhood Foundation (WCF) as well as that o f other specialized NGOs. Finally, the
State Reform Subcomponent includes an activity aimed at institutionalizing annual public expenditure
reviews within the Government's budget process. Results o f the reviews will be discussed jointly between
the Bank, the Government, and other relevant stakeholders, whxh would not only help the Government
re-assess its own performance for necessary policy and managerial adjustments, but would allow the Bank
to know about the Government's shifting priorities so as to adjust its own support for the State. It is
expected that this activity will thus enhance effectiveness o f both the Government's own policy
formulatiodimplementationand the Bank's support for it.

 E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessmentsare inthe project file, see Annex 8)
 1. Economic (see Annex 4):
0 Costbenefit           NPV=US$60.2 million; ERR= 15.8 % (see Annex 4)
0 Costeffectiveness
0 Other(specify)
The three main project benefits are: (i)as a result o f the acceleration classes and with the decline in
repetition rates students should complete a more advanced grade before leaving school or reach the same
grade younger, entering better prepared into the labor market; (ii)higher learning achievements, as
indicated by the results o f the SAEB, should lead to higher earnings; and (iii)  by moving faster through the
education system, students would cost less to educate and inthis way create room to reduce the overall cost
o f education.

The Project is expected to bring Pemambuco's SAEB scores up to the national average, which would entail
an average 8% increase in the state's results. In the long run this is expected to lead to an increase in
productivity and earnings o f students leaving the education system, starting with a 1% rise in 2005 and
increasing an additional 1% each year untilreaching a 5% increase in2009.

The expected increase in earnings accruing from the project is decomposed into the impact o f the
acceleration classes, the reduction in repetition and dropout rates in fundamental education - from 31.O%
and 5.1% in 2000 (assumed to be the same in 2002) to 23.0% and 4.7% in 2007, respectively            - and the
increase in earnings resulting from higher learning achievements (as measure by SAEB results). These
results show that the project initially imposes an additional cost stemming from the opportunity cost o f the
students that stay longer inthe educational system, essentially as a result o f lower dropout rates. Over time,
though, this is fully compensated by increased earnings. Initially, the only positive impact on income results
from better education, but starting in 2008 the acceleration classes also produce a net rise in earnings. The
improvement inquality and the rise inefficiency, inthis order, are the dominant effects inthe long run.

The analysis also explored the impact o f the reduction in age-grade distortion resulting from the faster
passage o f students through the education system - on account o f the acceleration classes and the decline in
repetition and dropout rates -- on the public sector's expenditures with education. There are two effects at
play. First, the project allows for a reduction inage-grade distortion and therefore total enrollment vis-&vis
a scenario o f no project. Second, the project leads to an increase inthe share o f secondary education intotal
enrollment. Acceleration classes have the dominant influence inthe short-run, but the long-run effect comes
exclusively from the improvement inefficiency.

The project initially increases public expenditures, as dropouts decline, relatively to a scenario inwhich the
project is not implemented, and especially due to the fact that the number o f students inthe more expensive
secondary education increases very substantially, notable in the first few years after the project is
implemented. With time, though, this initial effect o f flow correction recedes and the cost savings arising
from lower enrollment more than compensates the effect o f a higher share o f the students attending
secondary education. These cost savings are in addition to what is expected to occur in a scenario o f no
project, as a result o f the decline in enrollment expected in the projection period. In conclusion, project
costs -- including direct and implied costs, the opportunity cost o f students and the higher fiscal costs -
exceed its benefits until 2010, with net benefits turning positive and increasing after that. The economic
rate o f retum (ERR) corresponding to these net benefits is 15.8%, and the project's net present value, using
a 10%discount rate, is US$ 60.2 million.

 2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR= % (see Annex 4)


 Fiscal Impact:

Projections for annual disbursements by the Government o f Pemambuco o n account o f the project are
shown inAnnex 5, Table 5.2. To estimate loan service, a 6% annual interest rate was used along with the
assumption o f constant annual service, including interest and amortization. These flows indicate that:

     0    Indirect expenditures arising from the project (maintenance and replacement o f structures,
          equipment and others) rival inimportance with the debt service payments.
     0    The financial cost o f the project is small as a proportion o f the State GDP and total projected
          expenditures, peaking at 0.056% and 0.88%, respectively, in2014.
     0    Compared to typical expenditures on education (roughly 11% o f total expenditures and 1.8% o f
          GDP), the project financial cost is not large either.
     0   Finally, it is worth noting that according to Pemambuco's Secretariat o f Finance (SEFAZ), the
          state has room, according to the Law o f Fiscal Responsibility and other pertinent legislation, to
          increase its over debt by roughly US$225 million.


3. Technical:

The State o f Pernambuco faces several technical education issues, the most important o f w h c h are: (a) a
systemadministration that is hampered by a heavy bureaucratic structure, inadequate coordinationbetween
the State and the Municipal education networks, a tight fiscal situation, a cumbersome regime for managing
human resources, inadequate monitoring and evaluation systems, lack o f transparency and systematic
communication with stakeholders, and a fragile school autonomy model that i s not conducive to foster
school accountability; (b) poor quality o f public education as reflected in l o w student leaming assessment
scores; (c) inadequate qualification o f teachers and ineffective classroom practices which contribute to
unsatisfactory educational outcomes; (d) inefficient student flows, that are slow on account o f high
repetition and dropout rates and large age-grade distortions; (e) unequal access to education which curtails
the education opportunities for minority children, including Indigenous and Quilombola children and
chldren with special needs; and (0 school facilities that do not meet minimum operational standards in
their infrastructure, equipment and supplies and thus contribute to the poor quality o f the services
delivered. These issues are imbedded ina context o f high incidence o f poverty, both in rural and in urban
areas. The project addresses those issues with a focus on supporting public sector reform efforts to improve
efficiency and effectiveness o f service delivery in the education sector. Within this context, the project
focuses on improving the overall quality o f education at the fundamental education cycle, through a series
o f interventions designed to enhance equity, raise efficiency and substantively improve the quality o f the
public education services. The success o f the project in reaching its development objectives is predicated
on the strong commitment o f the Borrower, expressed at the highest level o f Government towards
improving the quality and efficiency o f public education and incorporated inthe State Reform Program. It
is also assured by the strong revolve o f SEDUC to undertake bold reforms, buildingupon the achievements
already made inthe education sector. Four years is a short period to carry out a comprehensive education
reform but the widespread support it has from the Government and civil society should ensure sufficient
progress to set the course for sustainable long-term improvement o f human capital formation in
Pemambuco.




                                                      - 28 -

4. Institutional:

The project will be executed by SEDUC through its various Directorates, including its 17 Regional Offices
(GEREs) which are directly responsible for overseeing the schools. School Councils and similar entities in
State and Municipal schools will play a key role, as they are directly responsible for implementing the
PMEs. A small Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) has been established in SEDUC to coordinate project
implementation. This unit will be supported by technical staff from SEDUC, SARE, and SEPLAN and
will be the liaison with the Bank. In implementingthe project SEDUC will collaborate closely with other
State Secretariats and institutions. In particular, SEDUC will collaborate with SARE and SEPLAN in
carrying out its administrative reform.   The School o f Government will be responsible for management
training, and Universities and NGOs will participate in providing training and assisting SEDUC in the
monitoring and evaluation o f the project. The fact that the institutional arrangements for the project are
those already in place facilitates project implementation and the future sustainability o f project
interventions once the project is completed.
4.1 Executing agencies:
Project implementation will be carried out by SEDUC. Under the leadership o f SEDUC, the following
other project executing agencies will participate in project implementation: (a) SAFE which will carry out
the subcomponent that supports the implementation o f the State Reform; (b) SEPLAN w h c h will collect
and process social indicators' data, and develop and implement models for monitoring and evaluation o f
public policies and expenditures, in particular as related to education; (c) the School o f Government    (
Escolu de Governo) w h c h will provide management training; and (d) the School Councils w h c h will
prepare and execute School Improvement Subprojects (PMEs) for both State and Municipal schools.
While Municipal Education Secretariats will not be directly responsible for project implementation, they
will select the PMEs to be fmanced among proposals presented by Municipal schools and oversee the
implementation o f the PMEs according to criteria and guidelines detailed in the project's Operational
Manual. In addition, selected Universities and NGOs will participate in the provision o f training services
under contract by SEDUC. The scope o f the participation o f each o f the project executing agencies is
described in the Operations Manual.
4.2 Project management:
The project will be managed by SEDUC through a small Project Coordination Unit (Unidude de
CoordenaGGo do Projeto - UCP) formed by eight Government staff (cargos especrj%cos): project
coordinator, lawyer, administrative coordinator, programming and monitoring specialist, procurement
specialist, procurement assistant, financial management specialist, and a technical specialist to support
implementing offices. An additional group of about 18 staff with temporary contracts (cargos temporurios
) is expected to make up the PCU. Additionally, SEDUC has formed a Special Bidding Committee
composed o f three members with experience on international bidding procedures and Bank procedures.
SARE will be responsible for its own procurement, under the guidance o f SEDUC and following Bank
procedures; SARE will submit the documentation to the P C U so that it can seek the Bank's non-objection.
SEDUC staff have some but limited experience with Bank disbursement and financial reporting policies
and procedures, based on the implementation o f the PHRD which financed project preparation and the
FUNDESCOLA project. Thus, technical assistance will be provided to strengthen the managing capacity
o f the PCU in the areas o f financial management and procurement. The Management Information System
(MIS) is well developed, adapted to Bank requirements and expected to be fully operational before the end
o f this year.  The legal establishment o f the PCU and the appointment o f the project coordinator,
procurement specialist, and financial management specialist --a condition for Effectiveness o f the Bank
Loan-- has already been complied with. All project management and operational procedures are included
inthe project's Operational Manual.

4.3 Procurement issues:
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004; and "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions
stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description o f various items under different expenditure
category are described in Annex 6. For each contract to be financed by the Loadcredit, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior
review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project team in the
Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the
actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.        The only procurement
issue relates to subprojects financed by the project, as discussed below.

The subprojects (PMEs) financed by the project will be carried out by School Councils constituted as civil
society organizations. In carrying out these subprojects, these agencies will procure goods and services o f
small value following established commercial practices, consistent with para. 3.15 o f the Bank
Procurement Guidelines. The subprojects will be defined according to a menu o f activities specified in the
project's Operational Manual and may include training,          acquisition o f didactic materials and small
equipment. The grant amounts will be determined by the enrollment in each school and other criteria; the
average is US$ 1,800 per subproject with a maximum o f US$ 5,000 for Municipal schools and US$2,500
per subproject with a maximum o f US$5,000 for State schools. The Conselho Escolar will prepare a list
o f goods and services to be procured with the proceeds o f the grant and will use the procedures set forth in
the national law (convite) for the small purchases and training. Most o f the activities and actions under the
component consist o f hring training - generally teachers from a local Funda~ijo- and purchase o f
equipment including data show and screen projectors, photocopier, TV and video, equipment, consumables,
and books. SEDUC will hire independent reviewers to audit the procurement aspects o f these small
purchases on a sampling, and yearly basis. Payments under these subprojects will be made by as
grant-transfers from SEDUC to the School Councils/ Executing Units (UEX), whichever is the legal entity
representing the school community. Disbursements o f the grants will be made on the basis o f progress
reports, specified inthe project's Operational Manual.

In addition, Universities and NGOs that are competitively selected, will provide training services under
contract with SEDUC, following the applicable contracting legislation o f the State o f Pemambuco,
satisfactory to the Bank. Payments under these contracts will be made in accordance with the conditions
set forth in the respective contracts, and will generally include advancements and reimbursements against
certified expenditures as described in the project's Operations Manual. The value o f these contracts is
estimated at US$ 1,000 to US$ 30,000 each.
4.4 Financial management issues:
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Brazilwas completed in September 2002.
The CFAA report was widely discussed with Brazilian government officials, was posted in the Planning
Ministry website, and is available for consultation by civil society. The overall conclusion o f the Brazil
CFAA is that, although some desirable improvements are suggested, the Brazilian system of public
financial management provides reliable information. An adequate system exists to manage and track the
receipt and use o f funds at the national level and there is a high degree o f fiscal transparency.      This
conclusion supports any program o f investmenUadjustment lending financed by the Bank inBrazil.

Taking into account that SEDUC will be responsible for the coordination o f project activities and for its
financial execution, further strengthening o f financial management capacity o f the agency is necessary.
Furthermore, the financing o f decentralized subprojects calls for specific financial management control
mechanisms. Such mechanisms will be spelled out in the project's Operational Manual and in the P M E
Manual. To this end, SEDUC has formally established a PCU with competent staff and put in place a
financial management information system especially designed to track physical, procurement, and financial
aspects o f project implementation. This office will also manage funds going to Component 3, including
funds to finance project activities carried out by SARE and SEPLAN.              The financial management
information system will be used as a management tool to complement the existing financial management
capacity already inplace at SEDUC.

The annual financial audit o f the project will be carried out by independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank
to perform audits o f Bank's financed projects. The Project Coordination Unit will be responsible for
preparing the Financial Management Reports (FMRs) and submitting the audit report to the Bank no later
than June 30th in the year following the year for which the project accounts have been reported. The
Auditors' TOR has been submitted to the Bank for final review and approved. It will include the issuance
of a management letter on internal controls six months after effectiveness. The format o f the project
financial statements has been established.

5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and E M P preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.


The proposed project does not involve financing o f any construction o f new infrastructure or other
activities likely to have significant environmental impact. The school remodelinghenovation that will be
financed by the project will be camed out in according with FUNDESCOLA I1 Bank-approved
environmental guidelines for small rural schools and SEDUC's own construction guidelines. The
environmental safeguards established inthese guidelines will be included incontractor biddingdocuments.

6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.


As in most educational projects in very poor areas, the proposed project poses several social issues, all o f
them key to equitable and sustainable human capital development and promotion.              Annex 11 (Social
Analysis and Indigenous Peoples Development Plan) provides more details on each o f the issues
summarized below. The fist social issue is associated to the presence o f nine different e t h c groups inthe
State o f Pernambuco    - the Fulni-6, Xukuru, Truka, Kambiwh, Kapinawa, Pipipii, Pankararu, Atikum,
and Trukh. These groups are key stakeholders of the project which aims to expand access to quality
education to Indigenous peoples. Presently, these groups have precarious access to education and their
specific cultural background requires the design o f specific interventions, which are detailed in Annex 11
and incorporated inthe project design. The second issue is that one o f the Indigenous groups is bilingual
(the Fulni-6)--others speak Portuguese--thus the project faces the challenge o f providing specific teachmg
methodologies and materials, and trained teachers, in a second language to that specific group. Third,
Pemambuco has 39 Quilombola groups (founded since 1604 and formed o f descendents o f slaves).
Although not legally recognized as a separate ethnic group, these groups have different cultural traditions
and their children and youth present special educational needs given the abysmal exclusion they have lived
during several centuries. Of the 39 groups, children from 35 o f them attend Municipal schools outside of
their villages while four have a school in the community. Fourth, gender inequality is an issue at stake.
Although econometric exercises conducted as part o f the social analysis have shown that there i s no
significant gender bias in school enrollment and dropout rates, qualitative field work revealed extreme
degrees o f domestic violence and severe alcoholism, particularly among adult Indigenous males. These
factors influence for worse the capacity o f children to leam and enjoy life. Fifth, there is still a substantial
number o f children and youth who have never attended schools: 178 thousand aged 5 to 25; 126 thousand
aged 5 to 17; and 57 thousand aged 7 to 17. Sixth, repetition and dropout rates are severe problems that
point out to lack o f quality o f the educational system but also to family and poverty constraints. As shown
inAnnex 11, by age eleven, 18.4 percent of students already present an overage gap ofthree years; by age
twelve, 15 percent o f students present an overage gap o f three years while 13 percent present an overage
gap o f four years. Almost one-third o f those aged 5 to 25 have been enrolled but dropped out o f school at a
point in their lives; almost 200,000 o f those aged 7 to 17 had dropped out o f school, a 10 percent o f the
total age group. Finally, the system is unequal and discriminatory, with the social analysis showing
household income, parents' education, and premature entrance inthe labor market as the main factors that
explain educational exclusion and dropout.

Social development outcomes

Equity ineducational performance is key to achieve the social development outcomes of the project. It will
be measured by SAEPE results, disaggregated by schools, which will permit the evaluation o f progress in
the educational performance o f Indigenous and Quilombola students. Specific improvements are expected
from investments to be made inIndigenous schools and schools serving Quilombola students. Inaddition, a
more prevalent gender equity attitude is also expected given the stress that will be placed on the issue inthe
development o f teaching materials and teacher's training, including for Indigenous and Quilombola
schools.

6.2 Participatory Approach: H o w are key stakeholders participating inthe project?
As mandated by law, Indigenous representatives are expected to participate in the organization of their
schools and in the design o f teachng materials for Indigenous schools, an initiative already initiated by
SEDUC. During project preparation, Indigenous leaders identified priority schools for rehabilitation, for a
total o f 24 indigenous schools which are included in the group o f schools that will be rehabilitated under
this project. Second, as a result of the project, the qualifications of Indigenous teachers are expected to
increase as they will benefit from the proposed in-service teacher training. Third, community and family
participation at the school level will be enhanced in all schools through School Councils, and training for
Council members.       School communities, represented by School Councils will have the authority to
implement PMEs, including managing P M E resources. Thus parents, teachers and school managers will
together play a fimdamental role in the school decision making process. Fourth, universities and NGOs will
be involved in the design and implementation o f training programs and teaching materials, and in the
monitoring and evaluation o f the project. Finally, Beneficiary Assessments, periodically conducted, will
allow for needed adjustments duringproject implementation.


6.3 H o w does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
As mentioned above, NGOs and universities will participate in the implementation and monitoring and
evaluation o f the project, particularly in relation to those more excluded and voiceless. NGOs will deliver
the activities targeting youth at risk. School Councils at the school level will also be critical for the
successful implementation o f the project, given their responsibility for implementing the PMEs which
account for 13 percent o f total project cost.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
Institutional arrangements for Indigenous schools are defined by law. In parallel, the project includes
subcomponents that encompass and organize activities that benefit Indigenous and Quizombola students,
facilitating implementation, disbursement, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation.        Five o f the 17
Regional Management Offices o f SEDUC (GERE) also have responsibility for overseeing Indigenous
education across the state and those will support project implementation, particularly interms o f inclusion
o f Indigenous people. The GEREs will work together with local teachers, parents, Municipal Governments
(particularly important in the case o f Quizombola schools, which are run by the Municipalities, whereas
Indigenous schools are runby the State) and civil society organizations in the monitoring o f the project and
in following-up its social development and educational outcomes. In addition, the recent change of
responsibilities for Indigenous education from local to state governments will facilitate the implementation
o f the project.
6.5 H o w will the project monitor performance interms o f social development outcomes?

The monitoring and evaluation system comprises all key indicators to measure the social development
outcomes o f the project, including (a) increases in enrollment; (b) improvement in student learning
achievements as measured by official standardized tests (SAEB and SAEPE); (c) decrease indropout and
repetition rates; (d) reduction in leaming gaps between ethnic minorities and the rest o f the student
population; (e) decrease inmale dropout; and (9decrease inthe educational gap that favors girls over boys
interms o fleamingperformance, repetitionand dropout.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The project objectives support Government policies and are the product o f an extensive consultation
process.  The project preparation team included the staff from the Secretariat o f Education, who will
continue to be involved inthe implementation o f the project, as well from the Secretariats o f State Reform
and Administration, Finance, and Planning. Project actions complement actions developed andor being
implemented by the Government, as well as Federal efforts under other programs such as FUNDESCOLA.
Project components, with the exception o f the accelerated program and institutional strengthening of
SEDUC, are part o f the SEDUC and will continue to be carried out after the project i s completed.
Moreover, the financial analysis (Annex 5) shows that the project is financially sustainable. The project
uses a participatory approach to promote the active participation o f schools directors, teachers and parents
in improving the education services. This partnership is an important factor inbuildinga sustainable and
effective education system that i s accessible and benefits all school-aged children in Pemambuco over the
longer term.

       BRAZIL: PERNAMBUCO INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT: EDUCATION QUALITY
                                       IMPROVEMENT PROJECT

The overall objective for World Bank's work in the state o f Pemambuco is to support the Government's
agenda o f improving effectiveness and efficiency in service delivery w h l e ensuring social inclusion and
human development.

The development objective o f the Pernambuco Integrated Development: Education Quality Improvement
Project is to (a) improve the quality, efficiency, and inclusiveness o f the public education system; (b)
modernize and strengthen the managerial, financial, and administrative capacity of the Secretariat o f
Education to set policies and guidelines for the sector and deliver public education efficiently; and (c)
support the overall state modernization effort.

percent o f total project cost without contingencies). This component seeks to improve the quality and
efficiency of the 1,086 state schools inPemambuco./l

1.1      Strengthening School Autonomy Subcomponent (US$ 7.3 million or 13.9 percent o f total
project cost without contingencies).      Thls subcomponent seeks to increase school efficiency and
accountability by giving the school community more autonomy and responsibility in managing the schools.
Inaddition, it also seeks to make schools more culturally relevant to their students, particularly inthe case
o f Indigenous schools 12, by giving them the autonomy to diagnose their own situation and prepare a
strategy to address the identified concems. This would be achieved through: (a) providing management
training to school directors and other school administrative staff; (b) supporting the preparation o f the
School Development Plans (PDEs),        whereby schools diagnose their problems and outline strategies to
address those problems; and (c) transferring funds directly to schools to finance school subprojects
(PMEs).    School development subprojects will include, but not be restricted to, in-service training for
teachers, equipment, library books, and didactic materials.      As part of the PDEs, whenever appropriate,
schools will be asked to include a strategy for inclusion o f disabled students and, as such, ensure that those
concems are addressed in the PMEs. The school plans and subprojects are intended move the school
towards achieving minimum operational standards and to improve the quality o f education. Specifically,
this subcomponent will finance:

    0    Training on school management for 6,293 elected directors and school administrative staff,
         including on the e-government modules developed for school management;
    0    Training and training materials for 7,896 school            council members on their rights and
         responsibilities in an autonomous school;
    0    Supporting the preparation and implementation o f PDEs and school improvement subprojects
         (PMEs) in all 987 state schools plus 99 Indigenous schools;
    0    School subprojects (PMEs) in 400 schools and 99 indigenous schools each year, for a total o f
         1,996 PMEs during the project's life.

1.2      Ensuring Minimum Operational Standards at Schools Subcomponent (US$ 20.9 million or
39.8 percent o f total project cost without contingencies).    This subcomponent seeks to ensure that state
schools, including those serving Indigenous students, meet minimumoperational standards in terms o f their


                                                    -43-

infrastructure and inputs. The SEDUC has established Minimum Operational Standards, taking into
consideration the FUNDESCOLA model and adjusting it according to the State's needs and financial
capacity. The model consists o f a predetermined set o f essential inputs such as library books and student
materials, school furniture such as desks, chairs, and shelves, and physical facilities such as sound school
buildings, safety features, and sanitary facilities.        While the project will not finance any new construction,
to complement project activities, SEDUC has agreed to carry out the new construction o f three Indigenous
schools with other resources.             This subcomponent, however, will fmance school rehabilitation and
provision o f essential inputs. The specific activities to be financed include:

     e    School mapping, describing the location and physical conditions o f schools, to improve the
          capacity o f SEDUC to identify the specific needs o f each school and plan rehabilitation activities,
          and development o f management system o f the physical conditions o f schools;
     e    Rehabilitation works in 145 schools that serve about 160,000 students, 17 percent o f the state
          student population, and 24 Indigenous schools, covering 45 percent o f the Indigenous student
          population./3
    e     Procurement and delivery o f essential fumiture, equipment, and pedagogical materials for 244
          schools (145 schools and 99 Indigenous schools), as established in the Minimum Operational
          Standards;
    e     Procurement and delivery o f computers and software, including definition o f criteria to select
          educational software, to supply computer labs in 534 schools which did not get equipment under
          the Alvorada project. These schools have 500 or more students, deliver education for 5th graders
          or above, and have met minimum operational standards. Approximately 665,000 students will
          benefit from these laboratories, that is 69 percent o f the student population instate schools;
    e     Culturally appropriate pedagogical package for all 99 indigenous schools;
    e     Pedagogical materials to 16 regional centers for disabled students serving approximately 6,780
          disabled students; and
    e     Procurement and delivery o f 4 vans equipped to transport disabled students to school.

1.3       Improving Teachers Qualifications Subcomponent (US$ 0.4 million or 0.8 percent o f total
project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent aims to improve the quality o f the state public
schools and to address the shortage o f teachers in grades 5 through 8 and in secondary education. The
project will finance a pilot higher education training for 300 state teachers who do not have a tertiary
degree usingthe revisedteacher curricula. Such pilot will enable SEDUC to determine the appropriateness
o f the new curricula before negotiating its formal introduction in all teacher training colleges. Ensuring
that teachers complete tertiary education is particularly important given the expected growth in enrollment
in the upper grades o f the fundamental cycle that will result in part from the expansion of accelerated
classes in the lower grades. However, since research has shown the lack o f correlation between teachers
with tertiary degrees and student performance, a new curricula should be piloted before greater investments
are made to ensure teacher certification.

12 Quilombola schools are under the responsibility of the municipal govemments.          As such, they will receive financing to
    carry out similar activities underthe second component of this project, which supports the development and implementation
    of education policies in the whole state of Pemambuco, in all education networks.
13 The criteria for selection of the 145 schools includes: (i)facility must belong to the govemment or have a lease longer than
    I O year; (ii)they must serve more than 1,000 students or serve special education students --an exceptionwill be made for
    schools located in extremely impoverished areas; (iii)schools that were not rehabilitated in the last three years; and (iv)
   geographically locatedinthe municipalities with the lowest humandevelopmentindex. The indigenousschools that will be
   rehabilitatedwere identifiedand selected by representativesofthe differentethnic groups as the priority ones.

The specialization will be offered in subject areas identified by SEDUC as those areas in which there is a
shortage o f teachers --mathematics, Portuguese, physics, chemistry, and biology-- and will take into
consideration enrollment simulations carried out in the first year o f project implementation. Specifically,
the project will finance:

    0    Pre-service higher education training/scholarship pilot for 300 teachers operating in the State
         system who do not have a university level degree. Teacher eligibility criteria includes: (i)     teacher
         has to be at least 13 years away from being eligible for retirement; (ii)teacher has to pass selection
         process at state accredited tertiary institution; and (iii)
                                                                   degree has to be in state-defined priority
         areas. This activity would be implementedonly after the pre-service teacher curricula is revised.

Component3. Supportingthe State Reform (US$4.8 million or 9.1 percent o f total project cost without
contingencies).     The State o f Pemambuco is committed to carry out a broad administrative reform to
improve efficiency in delivering state services.     This component is divided into two subcomponents. The
f r s t subcomponent deals with broader public sector issues and will support SARE in developing and/or
adapting administrative and managerial models consistent with the reform to be piloted at SEDUC. The
second one focuses on the education sector and will promote the introduction o f the administrative reforms
inSEDUC, includingthe aforementionedmodels andprocedures, thereby helpingto imrpove effectiveness,
efficiency and quality o f education, andproviding the State with concrete lessons that might help extend the
reform to other sectors, such as health and public safety. Complementary to the administrative reform and
over the medium-term, the State is also pursuing fiscal reform aimed at streamlining the budget and
reducing recurrent expenditures without negative impacts on service coverage and quality thus sustaining
fiscal soundness. l k s effort will be supported by this component through the analysis o f potential fiscal
savings in the education sector. Additionally, by promoting greater efficiency in the delivery o f education
(Component 2), the project will also contribute to fiscal savings. These objectives will be pursued through
the activities described below.

3.1       SupportingImplementation of the State Reform Subcomponent (US$ 1.6 million or 3 percent
o f total project cost without contingencies).       The objective o f this subcomponent is to support the
implementation of reforms recommended in the PDRE through the development o f public administration
models and procedures, which would then be piloted at SEDUC, to improve effectiveness, efficiency and
quality o f education.    By carrying out the reform o f the education sector, SEDUC will pioneer the
implementation o f the State Reform Program and will provide a valuable example that can be applied to

Component 4     - Project Management (US$ 2.32 million or 4.5 percent of total project cost without
contingencies). This component finances the management o f the project and supports the institutional
strengthening of the SEDUC through the provision o f t e c h c a l assistance and consultant services to
SEDUC to adapt its administrative structure to better integrate and gradually absorb project functions.
The contracting of specialized consultants in the areas of financial management, procurement, and
monitoring and evaluation, among others, is planned. Component expenditures include technical assistance,
consultants services, the project's annual audits, and incremental recurrent costs.

Sector issues and project objectives

Education coverage at the hndamental level has increased steaddy in Pernambuco in the last five years,
but, at 90%, it is still below the national average (94%). The municipalities manage the largest system in
the state, answering for roughly half o f total enrollment, concentrating in initial, primary and lower
secondary education. The state government, which manages the second largest system with 35% o f total
enrollment, is largely concentrated in (lower and upper) secondary education, although it still answers for
14% o fprimary education enrollment.

The education system in Pernambuco i s plagued with a highproportion o f overage students at all levels o f
education. As shown in Table 4.2, although age-grade distortion rates in Pernambuco are somewhat lower
than the regional average, they are consistently above the corresponding national figures. As in the rest o f
the Northeast, age-grade distortion is a particularly serious problem in rural areas and in the public
education system. Inupper secondary public schools ("ensino midio"), three-fourths o f the students are at
least one year older than they should be, considering the grade inwhich they are enrolled.

These high age-grade distortion rates are largely explained by the high rates o f repetition that mark
Pemambuco's school system (in addition to late entry in the school system). As shown in Table 4.3, 31%
and 23% o f the students inthe fundamental and upper secondary cycles, respectively, repeated the year in
2000. Repetition rates are particularly hgh in the first year o f primary, lower and upper secondary
education. Indeed, if the dropout rate was not disproportionately concentrated in overage students,
age-grade distortion would be even higher than it actually is. The positive side of Table 4.3 is that system
efficiency seems to be improving, with a consistent decline in repetition and dropout rates throughout the
1990s. This by itself will cause a reduction inage-grade distortion inthe coming years.

As a result o f high repetitionrates, Pemambuco presents a numbero f dimeducation indicators. Using 2000
transition rates, we estimate that:

     0     Expected completion rates in the fundamental and upper secondary cycle are just 54% and 65%,



                                                   -51  -

        respectively;
        Only 3.1% o f the students are expected to complete the fundamental cycle ineight years, against a
        mere 1.2% who are expected to complete upper secondary education at the right age.
        On average, students are expected to take 11.5 years to complete the fundamental cycle and 3.6
        years to finishupper secondary school.
        Students are expected to leave the education system after completing an average o f 7.1 years o f
        schooling.
        High repetition rates have not assured, though, that students adequately leam what they were
        supposed to. While ostensibly students are asked to repeat to ensure appropriate leaming, the
        results from the National System for Basic Education Evaluation (Sistema Nacional de Avaliaqcio
        da EducaccioBasica.

        -SAEB) show that students inPemambuco receive alowerquality educationthaninthe rest of
        Brazil. Taking the average o f Mathematics and Portuguese results, we see that students in
        Pemambuco scored below the national average, which is already considered inadequate.

Analyzing the current situation o f Pemambuco's education system, the team concluded that behind these
poor outcomes are:

  0     Insufficiently trained teachers, especially regarding classroom practices;
  0     Inadequate infrastructure;
  0     Inadequate coordination between State and Municipal govemments;
  0     Poverty related factors.

Consistently with t h s diagnosis,      the Pernambuco Integrated Development: Education Quality
Improvement Project has as its main objectives to:

  1. Support the overall state reform effort, modemizing and strengthening the managerial, financial and
  administrative capacity o f the Secretariat o f Education to set policies and guidelines for the sector and
  deliver public education efficiently.

  2. Increase access and inclusion.

  3. Improve education quality.

  4. Improve efficiency through reducing repetition and age-grade distortion.

  5. Modernize and strengthen SEDUC's institutional capacity, shifting the focus to the school.

More specifically, it is expected that once the Project is completed, it will result in:
  .
  .     Increasedgrade 4 completion rate from 81YOto 86%, the Brazilian level.
        Increased fundamental level completion rate from 54% to 6O%, the Brazilian level.
        Increasedfundamental level approval rate from 69% to 78%, the Brazilianlevel.
  .     Improved student learning achievement test scores (SAEB) inState schools to reach the national
  ..    average.
        Decreased percentage o f overage students inthe fundamental cycle from 53% to 46%.
        Decreased percentage o f overage students in the secondary cycle from 68% to 60%.
        Decreased repetitionrates inthe fundamental cycle in State schools from 31%to 23%.

         Complete SEDUC's state personnel census and formulate a medium-term staffing strategy.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:


costs

The Project foresees direct expenditures o f US$ 52.5 million, to be disbursed over four years, and has three
main components (Table 4.4). The first component    - Improving Quality and Efficiency in State Schools     -
accounts for 54.5% o f the total cost and, like the Project as a whole, its execution is concentrated in the
first three years o f implementation. Component 2 accounts for 29.1% o f total expenditures and its
implementation is also concentrated in years 1 through 3. As shown in Table 4.5, the major types o f
expenditures are civil works (24.7%), acceleration classes (17.3%), training (15.9%), grants and transfers
(13.6%), computer equipment and software (12%) and other equipment and furniture (6.5%).

once the Project ends. This i s the case, for instance, o f the acceleration classes or the rehabilitation o f state
schools. Other interventions, however, will have expenditure implications that extend beyond project
completion. This is the case, for instance, o f maintenance o f the rehabilitated schools and computer
equipment, and the replacement o f equipment, furniture and books acquired by the Project. To estimate the
expenditures implied by the project we assumed that:

    [a] Civil works and installations depreciate exponentially at 1percent per annum.

    [b] Computers are replaced at every five years.

    [c] Furniture and other equipment are replaced at every ten years.

    [d] Annual maintenance of computer equipment costs 5% peryear (including the cost o fprintingpaper,
    ink andreplacement o fparts), andthat o fphysical facilities, installations other equipment and furniture
    costs 1% per year of their original cost.

    [e] 70% o f the books bought are replaced every four years.

    [fl Licenses for the use o f software will continue to be paid throughout.

    [g] Each air-conditioner will generate annual electricity expenditures, net o fVAT taxes, o fUS$ 120.

    [h] Initiatives financed with grants andtransfers (e.g., school development and management plans) will
    be financed inthe future (i.e., after project completion) using resources currently transferred to schools,
    withno need for additional funds.

    [i]Teachers and other school and management personnel who receive training will not benefit from any
    pay increase directly accruing from such training.

Using these assumptions, we derived the project's total costs, including those drectly incurred during its
implementation and the ones implied by it, including maintenance and replacement o f facilities and
equipment. Those costs are shown for the 2004-2035 period in Table 4.6. The data show that new
replacement andrecurrent expenditures stemming from the implementation o f the Project are not large.

Benefits

We estimate three types o f benefits accruing from the project. First, as a result o f the acceleration classes
and with the decline inrepetition rates, students should advance to a more advanced grade before leaving
school or reach the same grade younger, entering the labor market better prepared. Second, higher learning
achevements, as indicated by the results o f the SAEB, should lead to higher earnings. Third, by moving
faster through the education system, students cost less to educate and inthis way create room to reduce the
overall cost o f education.

To measure these two effects we estimated a Mincer equation using household data for Pemambuco,
extracted from the 2001 P N A D (Pesquisu Nucional por Amostru de Domicilios). Table 4.7 reports the
regression results for the state as a whole, the Recife metropolitan region, and the rest o f the state. In the
following analysis we use the first regression, estimated for the state as a whole. Int h s first regression, the
return to one extra year o f basic education is consistently positive and particularly significant for the eighth
and eleventh year o f schooling.

In the 2001 SAEB, Pemambuco scored worse than the Northeast region as a whole in the exams for
students in the final years o f fundamental and upper secondary education, and better in the case o f 4th
grade students. Inthe three cases, though, Pemambuco scored below the national average: between six and
ten percent less. The Project is expected to bring Pemambuco's scores up to the national average, which
would entail an average 8% increase inthe state's results. We assume that inthe long runt h s would cause
an increase inproductivity and eamings o f students leaving the education system, starting with a 1% rise in
2005 and increasing an additional 1%each year untilreaching a 5% increase in2009.

The expected increase ineamings accruing from the project is shown in Table 4.9. This is decomposed into
the impact of the acceleration classes, the reduction in repetition and dropout rates in fundamental
education - from 31% and 5.1% in 2000 (assumed to be the same in 2002) to 23% and 4.7% in 2007,
respectively-  and the increase in earnings resulting from higher learning achevements (as measure by

 opportunity cost o f the students that stay longer in the educational system, essentially as a result o f lower
 dropout rates. Over time, though, this is fully compensated by increased eamings. Initially, the only
positive impact on income results from better education, but starting in 2008 the acceleration classes also
produce a net rise in earnings. The improvement in quality and the rise in efficiency, in t h s order, are the
 dominant effects inthe long run.

We also investigated how the reduction in age-grade distortion resulting from the speedier passage o f
 students through the education system - on account o f the acceleration classes and the decline inrepetition
 and dropout rates  -- would impact the public sector's expenditures on education. With that purpose, we
used the per student public expenditure estimated by the Ministry o f Education for Pemambuco in 1998,
for fundamental and upper secondary education. These values were corrected for inflation using the IPCA
and transformed into May 2003 US dollars using an exchange rate o f R$ 3.00/US$. These calculations
resulted in estimates per student expenditures in fundamental and upper secondary education o f US$223
and US$275, respectively. We further assumed that enrollment in private schools would stay constant at
the 2002 level throughout.

As indicated in Graphs 1 and 2, there are two effects at play. First, the project allows for a reduction in
age-grade distortion and therefore total enrollment declines vis-&vis a scenario o f no project. Second, the
project leads to an increase inthe share o f upper secondary education intotal enrollment. Both graphs show
that the acceleration classes have the dominant influence in the short-run, but that in the long-run effect
comes exclusively from the improvement inefficiency. Moreover, Graph 1 also highlightsthe fact that total
enrollment is expected to decline in any circumstances, as a consequence o f a declining population o f
seven-year-old children and the significant improvements in efficiency that were obtained in the nineties,
andwhich have not yet beencompletely reflected inenrollment.

Table 4.10 shows that the project initially increases public expenditures, as dropouts decline, relatively to a
scenario inwhich the project is not implemented, and especially due to the fact that the number o f students

inthe more expensive uppersecondary education increases very substantially, notable inthe first few years
after the project is implemented. With time, though, this initial effect o f flow correctionrecedes andthe cost
savings arising from lower enrollment more than compensates the effect o f a higher share o f the students
attending upper secondary education. Note that these cost savings are in addition to what is expected to
occur ina scenario o f no project, as a result o f the decline inenrollment expected inthe projection period.

This exercise relies, though, on an assumption that may not necessarily hold true: that per student costs will
stay constant throughout. That is, there are legal provisions that establish minimum total expenditures on
education in Pemambuco, a minimum that varies with tax collections. As GDP expands so will likely do
tax revenues, and the minimum expenditures with education should increase rather than fall. As a rule, the
public sector in Pemambuco spends little less than the minimum required by law, so that the scope for
reducing expenditures is not large. Seen from this perspective, the actual benefit stemming from the project
might not be a reduction in expenditures, but an increase in per student expenditure, which should be
expected to result inhigher quality o f education and inthe hture higher earnings.

   As shown in Table 4.10, the project's costs          --including direct and implied costs, the opportunity cost o f
   students and the hgher fiscal costs - exceed its benefits until 2010, with net benefits turning positive and
   increasing after that. The economic rate of return (ERR) corresponding to these net benefits is 15.8%, and
   the project's net present value, using a 10% discount rate, is US$60.2 million.


   Main Assumptions:
   Listed above.

   Sensitivity analysis / Switching values of critical items:
   We also conducted Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses, using 2000 data, to estimate the empirical
   distributions o f the economic rate o f return and the net present value, and to assess how robust the results
   were to changes in the main assumptions underlying our economic analysis. In Table 4.1 1 we present a
   summary o f the values and distributions used in these exercises, which were assumed to be mutually
   independent. Table 4.12 presents the results o f the Monte Carlo simulations for the project's ERR and the
   NPV. Inmore than 95% of the situations simulated, the ERR is above 10% and the NPV positive. This
   indicates that the project is attractive even if some o f the assumptions made above prove to be too
   optimistic.

Main assumptions:
  Table 5.1 gives a summary o f Pemambuco's fiscal numbers in 1995-2002. As shown, total expenditures as
  a share o f GDP have fluctuated considerably, from a low o f 12.1% in 1997 to a peak o f 20.5% in 1998
  (highexpenditure to GDP ratios in 1998 and 2002 are likely to be explained by the gubernatorial elections
  held in those two years). Expenditures on education and culture, o f which education answers for some
  98%, averaged 1.83% of GDP and 11.5% o f total expenditures in 1995-2002.

Table 5.2 shows projections for annual disbursements by the State Government on account o f the project.
To estimate loan services annual interest rates o f 6% and constant annual service were assumed, including
interest and amortization. These flows indicate that:

   0     Indirect expenditures arising from the project (maintenance and replacement o f structures,
         equipment and others) rival inimportance with the debt service payments.
   0     The financial cost o f the project is small as a proportion o f GDP and total projected expenditures,
         peaking at 0.056% and 0.88%, respectively, in2014.12
   0     Compared to typical expenditures on education (roughly 11% o f total expenditures and 1.8% o f
         GDP), the project financial cost is not large either.
   0     Finally, it is worth noting that according to Pernambuco's Secretariat o f Finance (SEFAZ), the
         state has room, according to the Law o f Fiscal Responsibility (LFR) and other pertinent legislation,
         to increase its over debt by roughly US$225 million.

Procurement


A. General

Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:
Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in
the Legal Agreement. The general description o f various items under different expenditure category are
described below. For each contract to be financed by the Loadcredit, the different procurement methods
or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements,
and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project team inthe Procurement Plan. The
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

Procurement o f Works: Works procured under this project, would include: major rehabilitation in 15
schools and small rehabilitation and improvement o f existing 130 school facilities as well as small facilities
improvement at the SEDUC offices. Most o f the works will procured in lots through NCB procedures. The
procurement will be done using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all ICB and the model
standard bidding document issued by Secretariat for International Affairs (Secretaria de Assuntos
Internacionais - SEAIN), for NCB.

Procurement o f Goods: Goods procured under this project would include : furniture, information
technology equipment, software, licenses, printing, events (such as seminars and workshops), textbooks,
didactic materials, air conditioning, laboratory equipment, and publicity services. The procurement will be
done using Bank's SBD for all ICB and the model standard bidding document issued by Secretariat for
International Affairs (SEAIN), for NCB. In addition, the electronic pregio established by the national
procurement law may be used as an altemative to shopping o f off-the-shelf items.

Procurement o f Non-Consulting Services: SEDUC will use administrative procedures (where shopping is
not appropriate) consistent with the national law (reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable) to hire
logistics and support services for the multiple training activities. These services will include rental o f
equipment and facilities, payment o f utilities, and photocopying and printing, generally in service orders o f
very small amounts (less than US$3,000). The Operational Manual will spell out the administrative
procedures mentioned above and their applicability.

The proposed Project will fmance technical and logistics services under this category o f investment. These
services consist o f rental o f space, per diem, trainer's fees, transportation, workshops and training material.
The largest investment in these tasks consists in the hiring o f facilities and mobilization o f teachers.
SEDUC will carry out these tasks using different modalities as presented in the Procurement Plan,
including:

         (a)  technical selection o f training centers, generally universities and joint ventures o f technical
              and educational institutions that will be assigned geographcal regions as service providers      -


                                                       - 64 -

               generally hired by de-centralized regional units (GEREs). The centers will then develop the
               training programs under the guidance o f SEDUC and will charge a fee per capita. The Bank
               will disburse a fixed rate against individuals trained on a per capita basis. Seemingly, the
               teachers trainees will receive per diem andtransportation;

         (b)   participation o f collaborative partners as Fundu&o Ayrton Senna and Fundupio Roberto
               Marinho that will not receive proceeds from the loan. The loan proceeds will pay for the
               space rental, transport o f the trainees, per diem, and training material associated with the
               participation o f the teachers inthe programs developed by the partners; the counterpart funds
               will pay for any fees or expenses incurredby the collaborative partners;

        (c)    instruction given by the state officials; the expenses related to transport, rental o f facilities,
               and ancillary expenses o f the trainers and trainees will be made through administrative
               expenses.

Selection o f Consultants: The proposed Project will finance consultant services by f m s and individuals.
These services consist o f training activities, technical, performance and financial auditors, independent
procurement reviews, studies and advisory services. Short lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost
less than $500,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants inaccordance
with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines. The Bank's Standard Request for
Proposals will be used for the Bank-financed consultant services. Most o f the project's studies,
implementation supervision, and performance, fmancial and procurement audits will be camed out
following Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) method. No other methods, except for selection based
on consultant's qualifications for very small assignment (estimated to cost less than $1OO,OOO), were
identified inthe initial procurement plan.

Procurement under School Grants:          The school grants recipients are the School Councils (director,
teachers, parents with administrative, pedagogical, and financial responsibilities) constituted as civil society
organizations in about 1,200 schools through the P M E (Projeto de Melhoria du Escolu). P M E is regulated
by Fundescola (200 schools already benefiting by the Fundescola Program of MEC inseveral Pemambuco
micro-regions are not eligible). The grant amounts will be determined by the enrollment ineach school and
other criteria; the average is US$ 1,800 per subproject with a maximum o f US$ 5,000 for Municipal
schools and US$ 2,500 per subproject with a maximum of US$ 5,000 for State schools. The School
Council will prepare a list o f goods and services to be procured with the proceeds o f the grant and will use
the procedures set forth in the national law (convite) for the small purchases and training which are
consistent with par. 3.17 Community Participation o f the Guidelines o f Procurement as described in the
Operational Manual. Most o f the activities and actions under the component consist o f hiring training
providers -  generally teachers from a local FundqGo - and purchase o f equipment including data show and
screen projectors, photocopier, TV and video and other equipment, consumables, and books. SEDUC will
hire independent reviewers to audit the procurement aspects o f these small purchases on a sampling, and
yearly basis.

Operational Costs:      Incremental operational costs refer to the incremental expenses incurred in the
management and supervision o f the Project, including UCP (Unidude de CoordenuqGo do Projeto) staff,
maintenance and supplies, office furniture, communication services, spare parts for office equipment and
vehicles, office rental, and the project's annual audit. It may include travel and subsistence expenses for
UCP staff. These costs are estimated to amount to US$ 1.9 million equivalent, to be financed on a
decreasing basis in accordance to annual plans subject to Bank's approval. Inquiries in the local market
will identify suppliers o f sundry items and minor services. A minimum o f 3 quotations will have to be


                                                      - 65 -

received. Once the suppliers are established, who will be generally the suppliers offering the lowest cost o f
lists o f items, a purchase order will be issued following regular administrative procedures. The market
inquiries will be updated periodically. The project's Operational Manual will detail these procedures and
the inquiryprocess, including the frequency o f the updates.

B. Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto Implement Procurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by SEDUC. It will organize a procurement team of, at least, 2
full-time procurement specialists.

An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for the
project has been carried out by Efiaim Jimenez on May 19, 2003.                The assessment reviewed the
organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the project's staff
responsible for procurement Officer and the Ministry's relevant central unit for administration and finance.


Most o f the issues/ risks concerning the procurement component for implementation o f the project have
been identified. The results o f this review indicate that thejudicial protests or "recursos " continue to be a
major difficulty in government procurement. Another finding indicates that the use o f "pregiio" and other
modem procurement methods will add efficiency and transparency to the government's procurement. On
July 1, 2003, the Bank initiated a state review o f the government procurement inthe state o f Pemambuco;
the fmdings and recommendations o f this study will be incorporated for the benefit the Project's
implementation. The corrective measures which have been agreed are described inthe action plan attached
to the capacity assessment report.

The overall project risk for procurement is High.

C. ProcurementPlan

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation which provides the
basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been updated and agreed between the Borrower and the
Project Team on September 2004 and is available at the project files. It will also be available in the
Project's database and in the Bank's extemal website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement
with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements ininstitutional capacity.

D. FrequencyofProcurement Supervision

Inaddition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity assessment of
the Implementing Agency has recommended a minimum of two supervision missions per year to visit the
field to carry out post review o fprocurement actions.

FinancialManagement
1. Summary of the FinancialManagementAssessment


CountryIssues

The Country Financial Management Accountability Assessment          -  CFAA for Brazil was concluded in
September 2002. The CFAA report was discussed in a workshop in Brasilia with the participation o f
Brazilian government officials where representatives from MP, SOF, STN, SEAIN, SAIN, CGU/SFC,
SPI, TCU were present. Furthermore the C F A A Report was included in the Planning Ministry site for
access and consultation by the civil society. The overall conclusion o f Brazil's CFAA is that,
notwithstanding some desirable improvements suggested in the assessment report, the Brazilian system o f
public financial management provides reliable information and adequate systems do exist to manage and
track the receipt and use o f funds at national level, and there i s a high level o f fiscal transparency.
Therefore, these conditions support any program o f investmenuadjustment lending financed by the Bank in
Brazil.


Strengths and Weaknesses

The financial management risk rate for the project is considered "high" for the purposes o f this assessment.
This rate was given because SEDUC demonstrated that project implementation capacity needed substantial
strengthening, as required by the Bank guidelines to fmance projects. However, since then SEDUC has
implementedthe Action Plan recommended by the Bank and there is strong indication that its capacity has
improved.    A later assessment was not carried out, as it is not costumary for the Bank to cany out more
than one such assessment during project preparation.

For this project to be implemented successfully, a financial management, procurement and monitoring
information system has to be operational inorder to better integrate the project financial, administrative and
monitoring functions. An action plan has been discussed with the project coordinator to remedy the current
situation, and once the actions have been completed the risk rate will be upgraded.


ImplementingEntity/Staffing

The implementing entity o f this project will be the Education Secretariat o f Pemambuco - SEDUC, which
will carry out the administration o f the project as whole. The following organizational chart has been
discussed and arrangements to allocate staff have been discussed with the project coordinator. The financial
manager will be responsible for reporting on all financial related activities, including preparation o f
Financial Management Reports (FMRs), reconciling the special and operational account, preparation o f
Statements o f Expenditure (SOEs) and its submission to the Bank for replenishment o f the Special
Account.

Accounting Policiesand Procedures

SEDUC adopted SIAFEM as a financial and accounting system that complies with the Public Sector
Budgetary law. SIAFEM is fully operational and runningunder the responsibility o f the Financial Unit o f
SEDUC. Its main function is to record all budget and its financial transactions executed, and it operates
based on a chart o f accounts that reflects the Plano PlurianuaZ (PPA).

Two levels o f accounting control will be established to record the project financial and accounting
transactions. The first one will be operated by SIAFEM which will record the expenditures at category
level according to the State budget, which identifies the funding source through specific account codes.
The second one will be the management accounting, which will work on a more detailed manner, recording
the project financial transactions at activity level. For thls purpose the project has designed its specific
chart o f accounts which reflects the project design and it will be operated through SIIG, which is a system
developed to manage SEDUC's education projects. Inaddition to the financial management arrangements,
a financial management chapter will be prepared and included in the project's Operational Manual and it
will contain all financial management and disbursement procedures, instructions and policies orienting and
defining the responsibilities o f the financial management team.

Reporting,Monitoringand Information Systems

At the time o f appraisal, the financial and accounting system in place at SEDUC could only generate the
traditional accounting reports such as trial balances, general ledger and balance sheet accounts. It has been
discussed with the Project Coordination Unit o f the necessity for the project to operate with a specific
project management information system in order to monitor the progress o f project implementation, as well
as the flow o f information and funds through FMRs. Currently, the M I S i s in place and expected to be
operational by project effectiveness so that FMRs can be generated on a quarterly basis.

FinancialCovenants

The Project will have to :

          have in place financial management systems capable o f generating records, accounts and
          financial statements. The records and accounts for the Special Account for each fiscal year will
          be audited in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to the Bank, consistently applied by
          public auditors acceptable to the Bank;

          furnishto the Bank as soon as available, and no later than six months after the end o feach fiscal
          year: (A) certified copies o f the financial statements audited; and (B) an opinion on such
          statements, records and accounts and report o f such audit, by said auditors, o f such scope and in
          such detail as the Bank shall have reasonably requested; and

           fumish to the Bank other information concerning such records and accounts and the audit, to
          enable Bank representatives to examine such records, and ensure that such records and accounts
          are included inthe annual audit.

          The package o f aforementioned FMRs, covering expenditures and disbursements, procurement
          and contracts, and information related to fmancial audits, will be updated each quarter and will
          be available to the Bank supervision team as needed.

SupervisionPlan

The task manager will ensure that early in the project start-up phase there will be a Bank sponsored
financial management and procurement workshop for the PCU. It is recommended that at the beginning o f
project implementation supervision missions be undertaken three times a year due to the high risk rate.
After the first year of project implementation supervision should be undertaken twice a year. The
supervision responsibility for procurement and financial management and client assistance will be provided
through the Country Management Unit (CMU) Implementation Team which is hlly staffed to carry out
these functions.

2. Audit Arrangements


ExternalAudit

The project will be audited by independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank. They will prepare their audit
report based on the Terms o f Reference (TOR) submitted by the PCU and reviewed by the Bank. The audit
reports will be submitted to the Bank no later than June 30th o f the following year in which the
expenditures have been incurred. The audit TOR will contain a specific paragraph on the issuance o f a
management letter reporting on the adequacy o f the intemal control mechanisms in place for the project.
According to the new audit policy as laid out in the "Guidelines: Annual Financial Reporting and Auditing
for World Bank-Financed Activities" o f June 30, 2003, a single audit opinion on project's financial
statements will be required.

3. DisbursementArrangements

The Government o f Pernambuco opted from project outset to disburse using traditional disbursement
mechanisms (SOEs, direct payments, reimbursement, replenishment o f Special Account, as appropriate)
on a transaction basis. However, the borrower may consider converting to report-based disbursements,
once the production o f FMRs are a well established timely routine, ensuring a smooth transition from
traditional disbursements to disbursements on the basis o f reports and a steady flow o f funds to finance
project activities.

A Special Account will be opened in Banco do Brasil         - N e w York office by the Borrower which will
receive the funds transferred from the Loan account. According to the project financial needs, SEDUC will
withdraw from the Special Account, as needed for payments in the short term, (thus, without generating
significant balances on this account ) to the Operational Account in R$the amount required to pay for the
Bank's Loan share o f eligible expenditures. Based on the expenditures incurred, SEDUC, through the PCU,
will prepare the SOEs and will submit to the Bank for replenishment o f the Special Account. Grant
transfers to the participating schools will be against the "conv8nio" for State schools or "Termo de AdesCo
" for Municipal schools. The eligible schools will open a specific bank account to receive the funds. The
actual expenditures incurred by SEDUC under the categories works, goods, consultants, and training will
be the basis for the SOEs and replenishment o f the Special Account, while the transfers to the schools will
be the basis for replenishment as per disbursement arrangements.

Table C shows the allocations o f the loan proceeds. The proceeds o f the Loan will be disbursed over a 48
months project life span, ending December 2009. The annual estimated disbursements are indicated in
Table B: Schedule o f Disbursements.

As per the Financial Management Assessment, by effectiveness, the project is likely to be ready for
report-based disbursements. Nonetheless, disbursements will be made using transaction-based mechanisms
such as direct payments, special commitments, reimbursement and a special account until c o n f i i e d that
report-based disbursements are operational.

The expected Project Completion Date is 05/31/2009 and the Loan Closing Date is expected to be
12/31/2009.

According to the new Financing Parameters approved by the Bank in M a y 2004, retroactive financing will
be available for the following categories: Works, Goods and Consultancies, procured in a satisfactory
fashon and incurred w i t h twelve months before the signature of the Loan Agreement, up to a maximum
o f 20% o f the Loan. We recommend that, once the Loan is declared effective, such expenditures be
immediately claimed from the Bank, on a reimbursement basis.

 Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):

Disbursements will be made on the basis o f SOEs for contracts with an individual valued less than those
requiring IBRD's prior review (see Annex 6(A)).        Thus, all applications to withdraw proceeds from the
loan account will be fully documented, except for contracts for goods, works and services for which prior
review o f procurement is not required in the procurement plan, under terms and conditions as the Bank
shall specify coinciding with such procurement plan. Procurement o f the first two NCB contracts for
works and goods, regardless o f the estimated cost, as well as procurement under the subprojects for
individuals items exceeding the above thresholds will also be subject to prior review and full
documentation.

Schools Grants will cover School Improvement Projects (PMEs). Schools both under the administration o f
the State and under the administration o f the Municipalities will compete for P M E funds up to twice during
the life o f the project. The average value o f a subproject is estimated at US$1,800.00 with a maximum o f
US$5,000.00 for Municipal schools and US$2,500 per subproject with a maximum o f US$5,000 for State
schools. Disbursements o f the whole amount o f the grant will be made to eligible schools from the
Operational Account (Counterpart funds) and from the Special Account (Bank's Loan proceeds), to the
schools which fblfill the selection criteria as laid out inthe project's Operational Manual. These grants will
be disbursed either against "Conv&io" for the State Schools or "Termo de Adesfio" for Municipal schools.
Based on the terms o f the "Conve^niosffand "Termo de Adesfio," SEDUC will transfer funds to specific
bank accounts established by each school, which will be the basis for SEDUC to prepare SOEs and claim
reimbursement o f the amount transferred to the schools. The schools will be responsible for keeping the
supporting documentation o f the expenditures they incurred for hture audits or monitoring purposes.
Schools will only be eligible to compete for a second PME once they have completed the first P M E and
submit an implementation report to SEDUC on the progress o f the grant received. This approach is inline
with the "Community Driven Development Projects - CDD' guidelines. The PCU, through its financial
unit, will consolidate SOEs, as applicable, and claim replenishment o f the Special Account to the Bank.
Supporting documentation will be maintained at each school for audit and requests from the Bank and
SEDUC as needed.

Special account:
Inorder to ensure timely provision o f funds available to finance the project, SEDUC, through the Project
CoordinationFinancial Unit,will establish, for the purpose o f this project, a Special Account inUS dollars
inBunco do Brusil (New York office) under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. Funds in an
estimated amount equivalent to 4 months o f the Bank's Loan share o f project expenditures will be deposited
inthe Special Accounts. The authorized allocation for the Special Account is US$ 3 million; however, this
Special Account will be limited to US$ 1 million until cumulative disbursements for all categories reach
US$ 2 million equivalent. The PCU will be responsible for submitting regular replenishment applications,
preferably monthly, with appropriate supporting documents for the actual expenditures. Management o f the
fimds will be guided by procedures detailed inthe project's Operational Manual.

CounterpartFunds

In order to ensure the timely provision of counterpart funds, in addition to the Operational Account,
SEDUC will open and maintain an Operational Account, in Reais, for the Government's                share o f
expenditures for the Bank's loan funds. Given the decentralized nature o f the school grants, there is an
equal need to decentralize disbursement procedures and financial management responsibilities to improve
accountability. Therefore, the participating schools will open and maintain new separate accounts, in Reais
in commercial banks, specifically for each "Convinio" for State schools and "Term0 de Adesiio" for
Municipal schools; these accounts will be independently managed, for the purposes o f receiving funds and
control o f each Conv&nio/Termo deAdesiio expenditure and balance.

     BRAZIL: PERNAMBUCOINTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT: EDUCATIONQUALITY
                                        IMPROVEMENT PROJECT

Introductionand Objectives

Backmound. The development process experienced in Brazil during the last century has not been able to
reach the poorest segments o f the population, particularly expanding income, assets or job opportunities to
traditionally excluded groups, such as the rural poor, landless peasants, African descendants and
Indigenous Peoples.      Income inequality and poverty are pervasive throughout Brazilian society, and are
particularly acute in the Northeast, including the state o f Pemambuco. In Pemambuco, as in Brazil, low
income is associated with low educational achievement, the inability o f individuals to secure economic
opportunities, and the inability o f the economy to produce employment commensurable to the size o f the
labor force.

Inthis context, one of the main challenges for educational policy-makers is to reach those children who
cannot fully access the educational system, either because they do not attend school at all or when
attending, repeat grades several times, eventually giving up and dropping out entirely. Notwithstanding the
challenge, the Brazilian government made substantial progress by increasing school attendance and net
enrollment rates at the primary level from 89 percent to 96 percent from 1996 to 2000. Ths Annex seeks
to understand how and why educational exclusion persists inPemambuco in light o f expanded educational
coverage and significant progress towards the goal o f universal coverage. It also makes recommendations
for those more excluded, on the basis o f extensive consultation with concemed communities.

Obiectives. Poverty is the most common reason for educational exclusion. Certain groups among the poor
are still less able to take advantage o f the increasing educational opportunities given specific deprivation
due to their ethcity, gender or some other socioeconomic or historical characteristic. T h ~ Annex and the
                                                                                             s
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) that it contains, analyze the interaction among the many
socio-economic elements that lie behind educational exclusion and explores specific constraints affecting
the young Indigenous and African-descendent population living in Quilombos. Inthis context, the specific
objectives o f this analysis o f social issues and the IPDP are to:

     1. Establish the extent and determinants o f educational exclusion inPernambuco;
     2. Identify the characteristics o f Indigenous and Quilombola educational exclusion;
     3.  Recognize the perceptions o f Indigenous and Quilombola students regarding exclusion in general
         andracial prejudice specifically;
     4. Determine what are the gender issues inthe educational system inPemambuco; and
     5. Propose actions addressingkey constraints.

Data Sources. The analysis utilizes qualitative data and quantitative measurements. The 1999 National
Household Survey (PNAD), was used as the quantitative data source along with the 1999 Census o f
Indigenous Schools.      As the P N A D sample does not allow for desegregation between e t h c groups,
qualitative fieldwork was carried out in part to fill the gap o f the quantitative information and was
undertaken by interviewing parents, teachers, and students in Indigenous villages and Quilombola

communities. In addition, all Indigenous schools were visited and evaluated as part o f the Borrower's
responsibility, as stated in OD 4.20. In the case o f Quilombos, since there are practically no schools in
their areas (out o f the 39 recognized groups only four have schools within their villages while others attend
Municipal schools), communities themselves were visited and interviewed about the education system
serving their children and youth.

Determinantsof EducationalExclusioninPernambuco

What is Educational Exclusion.        The process that leads to lack o f coverage, repetition, or dropout i s
complex and includes factors such as low quality o f schools, lack o f incentives for families and students to
enroll and succeed, and/or factors associated with the socioeconomic and cultural characteristics o f the
household. Key results from the quantitative analysis indicate that educational exclusion is manifested
through three different forms inPemambuco: lack o f coverage, repetition, and dropout.

a.       Coverage is not yet universal. Three percent o f 7 to 17 year olds (mandatory school age) in
Pemambuco have never attended school, comprising a total o f 55,000 individuals. However, loolung at
coverage in different age cohorts (Table 1) it is clear that educational coverage increases as age decreases,
and the proportion o f those who never attended school is smaller inthe 7 to 17 age cohort than inthe 5 to
25 cohort. Table 1 also reveals lack o f preschools, since 4.7 percent o f children between the ages o f 5 and
7 have never attended school./l

b.       Number of Dropouts is signijicant. In the state o f Pemambuco, 10.2 percent o f the school-age
population, the equivalent o f 190,000 individuals, attended school inthe past but no longer did so in 1999.
 To analyze the factors that account for the likelihood o f children dropping out o f schools, a regression
 equation was used in which the determinant variable was binary in a Logit, Probit, or Ordered Probit
model. Explanatory variables included inthe model were: (a) household location, (b) household structure,
 (c) household income, (d) parents' education, (e) number o f siblings, (f) ethcity, (g) gender, (h) child or
 youth labor, and (i)  migration. For all age groups in Pemambuco, regression exercises have shown that
 household income, parents' education, and premature entrance in the labor market are the most important
 determinants o f dropout. A full report o f the econometric exercise is inthe project's files.

c.      Age-Grade Gap is Substantial. In Pemambuco, thirty percent o f all students are at least three
years older than the age expected for the grade they are attending. This widespread overage enrollment is
costly to the education system and has a strong negative impact on the self-esteem o f these youth and
children, often leading to dropping out.

The combination o f the three factors that define education exclusion -never having attended school, having
dropped out o f school, and having a large age-grade gap           - lead to the conclusion that in Pemambuco,
approximately 40 percent o f the population in the 7-17 age group are at risk o f educational exclusion.
Currently, 13 percent o f school-age children and youth are not attending school in Pernambuco, the
equivalent to 245,700 people.

Strategiesfor ReachingIndigenous and Quilombo Students/2

Scope for Indigenous Students. The 2000 Census reports that the Brazilian Indigenous Peoples comprise a
population o f 700,000 individuals. According to the 1999 Census o f Indigenous Schools conducted by the
Ministry o f Education (MEC) there are 1,392 Indigenous schools inBrazil, more than half o f them located
inthe Northern region, where the majority ofthe Indigenous population lives. Among the 93,037 students
enrolled in Indigenous Schools throughout Brazil, 80 percent attend the first four grades. According to the
census, most o f the schools do not operate according to the minimumstandards set by law. For instance, o f
the 4,000 teachers worlung inIndigenous schools throughout Brazil, only 1.5 percent hold a college degree,
a requirement to exercise the profession, and only 17 percent o f teachers have training inIndigenous culture
and history.

In the state of Pemambuco, there are nine distinct Indigenous groups comprising a population of
approximately 20,000.       There are 99 Indigenous schools in the state,           with 288 teachers and 6,336
studentsJ3 Inalmost half o f these schools, Indigenous culture is not part o f the curricula, only a third use
specially designed and culturally adequate material and generally there is no connection between what is
taught in school and the cultural tradition o f the students. Inthe majority o f the cases, Indigenous schools
offer only the first four grades o f the fundamental cycle, within a multi-grade format taught by teachers
who have not been trained inthis pedagogy.

Scope for Ouilombos. Quilombos are formed o f descendants o f slaves who ran away from plantations and
upto today continue to live inisolated communities. The most notorious o fall Quilombos, Palmares, dates
from 1604 and today consists o f several smaller Quilombos, spreading across a territory that now
comprises the states o f Pernambuco and Alagoas.               For almost one hundred years, Palmares was
successfully able to resist the Portuguese and the Dutch colonizers, and its leader, Zumbi, became a revered
national hero and a symbol o f resistance against oppression.          There are 743 Quilombola communities
already identified and located inrural areas o f Amazonas, Maranhiio, Sergipe, Bahia, Pernambuco, Mato
Grosso, SBo Paulo, Goias, and Minas Gerais, yet only 42 have been officially recowzed, and as such,
merit official attention by policy-makers. Inthe state o f Pemambuco, Quilombos comprise a population o f
approximately 33,300 people distributed among 39 communities, but only four o f them have a school.
This does not imply that children are not enrolled in some school, but points out the lack o f concem for
providing them easily accessible services./4

Legal Framework for Indinenous Peoples. Up to the 1980s, the Brazilian government had aimed at
linguistic and cultural integration o f all the population into a presumed single national identity. To a large
extent, the ideal since the colonial period has been the establishment o f a homogeneous Brazilian identity,
subsuming into it all cultural specificities that came from different groups in one o f the most diverse
societies inthe world. This stance changed with the 1988 Federal Constitution, Article 231, which moved
from considering Indigenous Peoples as an "almost extinct category" to recognizing them as a differentiated
ethnic group with subgroups with their own particular social organization, language, culture, customs,
traditions, and beliefs.     The 1988 Constitution states that Indigenous culture is a Brazilian heritage
belonging to all, part o f the national identity, and thus it is the duty o f the state to preserve and protect it.

The 1988 Constitution guarantees the right o f Indigenous Peoples to free education that is intercultural and,
whenever necessary, bilingual. It provides the legal support for the 1996 National Education Law (Lei de
Diretrizes e Bases da Educapio Nacional -- LDB), which guarantees to Indigenous peoples the type of
education defined in the Constitution. The National Education Council complements the legislation by
creating the category `Indigenous Schools,' defined as "schools located in areas inhabited by Indigenous
peoples, which provide exclusive services to Indigenous communities, where teaching is done in the mother

language o f these communities with an adequate schooling organization."          The Council also established
norms and procedures for the operation o f the schools and defines administrative responsibility for their
management and funding.

Starting in 1991, the M E C assumed the responsibility for planning the education o f Indigenous schools.
Since 2002, fimdamental level Indigenous schools are the responsibility o f the state government, where
funding depends on federal transfers that are allocated according to enrollment numbers for the
maintenance and development o f education. The state government also has the mandate to supervise the
implementation o f the intercultural guidelines and to train Indigenous teachers. Textbooks and teaching
guides are expected to be developed through a partnershlp among universities, NGOs, and Indigenous
organizations. Indigenous schools may also benefit from other federal programs, such as Fundescola or
others that finance infrastructure, equipment and long distance education.                 Finally, Indigenous
organizations, together with civil society, universities, and the state government, are expected to design
teaching guides and material and participate in decision-making processes at the school level through
programs to enhance community and parental involvement financed by MEC.

Legal Framework for Quilombos. Although Quilombos have had a formal recognition o f their cultural,
economic, and historic rights, these have not been easily translated into titling o f the land where they have
lived and survived for several centuries. Furthermore, they are not legally recognized as a distinct ethnic
group.   Since the Afonso Annos Act o f 1951,        racial discrimination is considered a criminal act, and
according to Article 5 o f the Federal Constitutional o f 1988, "racism is a crime for which bail is not
available." Paragraphs 1 and 2 o f article 212 read that "the state shall protect all expressions o f popular
Indigenous and African culture as well as all o f those that contributed to Brazilian civilization," whereas
Article 68 o f the transitory constitutional provision states that "the definitive ownership o f the descendants
o fthe Quilombos to the land they are occupying will be recognized and the state shall make efforts to issue
them titles to their land." The Palmares Cultural Foundation, in the Ministry o f Culture, in conjunction
with other ministries, is responsible for major policy issues related to Quilombos. An inter-ministerial
working group was created in 1995 and is responsible for the advancement o f the Brazilian black
population. They are entrusted with formulating public policy to foster the rights o f African descendants
and make proposals for compliance with the prevalent legal dispositions, including reassessing e t h c and
racial stereotypes in educational curriculum./5

A detailed legal framework for the Indigenous and Quilombola groups is included inAnnex 12.

Baseline. The 1999 Census o f Indigenous schools and the Diagnostic o f Indigenous Schools o f Pemambuco
conducted by the state government 2001 consist the baseline through which improvements in Indlgenous
schools and learning will be measured.        The qualitative fieldwork carried out in 2002 in Quilombola
schools is the baseline for this group. For both Indigenous and Quilombola schools, current data shows:

a.       Lack o f emphasis on multi-culturalism, characterized by:

    0    Lack o f connection between what is taught in schools and Indigenous and Quilombola traditions
         and history.
    0    Absence o f sufficient bilingual teachers in the case o f the Fulni-6, the only bilingual group in
         Pemambuco.
   0     Culturally inappropriate school material. Only one-thrd o f Indigenous schools use specifically
         designed and culturally adequate materials.       Only four of 39 Quilombola communities have
         schools intheir areas.



                                                     - 88 -

b.      Poor teachindlearningmethodology:

    0   Too much emphasis on making students memorize information rather than stimulating individual
        thinking.
    0   Absence o f playful activities as part o f the teaching process.

c.      Institutional irregularities among schools and between the Municipal, State and Federal
govemments, with none taking full responsibility for the following up o f policies and regulations in
Indigenous education.

d.      Insufficient supply o f textbooks, poor infrastructure, lack o f electricity, clean water, and
bathrooms. The 2001 Diagnostic o f Indigenous Education examined the condition o f functioning schools
located withm the Indigenous communities. As shown in Table 4, only two schools have sufficient school
materials available for its students, including the minimum materials required for learning activities, such
as pencils and blackboards. The study also revealed that many classes are taught in a multi-grade format,
where students o f different grades sit inthe same classroom and are taught by the same teacher.

e.      Poor academic performance, characterized by low enrollment rates, high dropout rates and hgh
age-grade distortions.

Indigenous Students

    0   Students tend not to advance past the fourth grade. The reasons they do not proceed are: (i)
        Schools in Indigenous villages do not offer the secondary cycle o f education, forcing students to
        leave their communities in order to complete their education;/6 and (ii)by the fourth grade,
        repetition has already taken its toll and overaged students lack incentives to proceed and, at this
        time, they are considered as adults and expected to perform adult roles in their villages.        In
        addition, Indigenous students manifested feeling discriminated by non-Indigenous students with
        whom they should attend school after the primary cycle o f education.

   0    As indicated in the census, o f the Indigenous students in Pemambuco, 43 percent are in the first
        year o f the fundamental level, 23 percent inthe second year, 15 percent inthe third, 9.4 percent in
        the forth, and the remainder 9.6 percent in the fifth grade and above.

Quilombo Students




                                                      - a9 -

    0    Distant location of schools from their communities is one o f the main constraints to move to fifth
         grade.

    0    According to students who complete the eight grades o f the fundamental education, racial prejudice
         i s not felt as strongly.

         Age-grade distortion is particularly high among Quilombola students, as shown by the field work,
         whereas in the schools, only 6 o f the 16 students in the 8th grade were 15 years o f age or under.
         The age-grade distortion is less acute for Indigenous than Quilombola students, which may be
         attributed to the fact that neither Indigenous boys nor girls are engaged in the labor market.
         Age-grade distortions among the Quilombola students can be explained first by their entrance in
         school later than the officially prescribed age o f 7; second, by frequent repetition; and thrd, by
         temporary dropouts from school -- a behavior more frequent and for longer periods among boys.

f.       Interms of gender, there is a sharp distinction between the female and male domains, especially
among Indigenous peoples. Girls show highlevels o f dissatisfaction with gender relations by claiming that:
(i)boys unanimously enjoy greater social freedom; (ii)women are mistreatedbymen and experience
"humiliation, abandonment, sexual abuse and domestic violence;" and (iii)   men are violent and egocentric.

It should be noted, however, that the precarious situation o f schools serving Indigenous and Quilombola
students is not necessarily exclusive to these groups, as the problems listed above tend to be common and
recurring among the poorest more isolatedrural communities.

Consultation.     All Indigenous communities were visited during project preparation with participatory
school-based assessments undertaken by the staff o f the Secretariat o f Education (SEDUC). In addition,
in-depthqualitative work was carried out with a Quilombola community (situated ina rural area about 150
miles from Recife, the state capital) and a bilingual Indigenous community, the Fulni-6 (located in Aguas
Belas, about 180 miles from Recife).      Sixteen Quilombola students (8 boys and 8 girls) and sixteen
Indigenous students (13 girls and 3 boys) responded to a very detailed qualitative survey and participated in
local meetings conducted with SEDUC and some with the Bank staff. In general, students consistently
revealed a perception o f living ina highlyunequal country where the major problems faced are violence --
particularly domestic violence -- unemployment, racial prejudice, corruption, and, for the girls, gender
inequality. For these communities, whenever there is a school available, such school is far from meeting
their expectations and needs.

Strategy for Local Particiuation and Recommendations for Proiect Design. The analysis o f social issues
and the IPDP recommend the design o f a set o f comprehensive activities to address the following issues
deemed indispensable:

    Improvement in infrastructure. In the Indigenous communities, improve the infrastructure o f schools,
    including the provision o f water, electricity, ventilation, bathrooms, and kitchens. In the Quilombos,
    conduct an assessment o f school conditions, including if they are located at a reasonable distance,
    planning the establishment and construction o f schools whenever necessary; reform the existing schools
    that do not meet the minimumstandards.

    Establishment o f the entire Fundamental Cycle. In the Indigenous communities, offer the last four
    years o f fundamental education (fifthto eight grade) by the end o f the project. Presently, only the first
    four years are offered, forcing students to sometimes travel long distances to attend schools that are
    culturally inappropriate for them.


                                                    - 90 -

     Inthe case of schools or grades not being offered inthe community, locate new schools in places of
     easy access.       Until these are established, design and implement a plan that provides students
     transportation whenever necessary.

     Involve parents in school matters. Create active parent and teacher associations. Discuss with parents
     and teachers a maintenance plan for the schools, including cleaning and small repairs. Involve parents
     in the definition and monitoring of schools lunches. Offer bilingual education in the only Indigenous
     community that requires it inPemambuco.

     Work inpartnership with universities and NGOs in order to: (i)       train teachers so they can offer quality
     education that is culturally appropriate, and (ii)conduct the monitoring and evaluation o f the
     Indigenous and Quilombola schools.

     Conduct two beneficiary assessments during implementation to evaluate the status o f the project and
     need for adaptations.

     Address gender issues among boys and girls through special interventions in the training o f teachers
     and school material. Take to the classroom discussions about domestic violence andalcoholism.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&EI. The following indicators should be included and monitored in the
M&Esystem:

0    Enrollment rates, particularly after the first grade, o n a yearly basis;
0    Student performance as measuredby SAEB;
0    Dropout and repetitionrates, disaggregatedby gender, on a yearly basis;
0    Learning gaps between schools located in Indigenous and Quilombola areas and the rest o f the state
    population (SAEPE);
0   Educational gap that poses disadvantages for boys in terms o f leaming performance, repetition, and
    dropout rates.

GeneralConclusions

Indigenous and Quilombola children and youth, in their condition o f e t h c minorities, find themselves at a
disadvantaged position in terms o f educational opportunities and quality o f life prospects.             From a
statistical point o f view, the main determinants o f such educational exclusion are socioeconomic. They are:
household income, parents' schooling, and child and youth labor. School and education conditions in
Quilombola and Indigenous communities are not suitable for a meaningful learning experience.                Very
often, age differences in the same classroom are large, classes are overcrowded, school buildings are
precarious and safe water, latrines, and electricity are often missing. School lunches, mandatory by law,
are unpredictable. Although parents are critical o f these schools, they face income, schooling, power and
time constraints to act as an active pressure group to improve their childrens' situation. Thus, specific
interventions to improve the educational opportunities o f Indigenous and Quilombola children and youth
should be carried out.

ProposedProjectActions to Address Recommendations

The proposed project has incorporated the recommendations listed inthis IPDP inthe following way:



                                                      -91 -

 a.       Improvement in infrastructure. Twenty-four indigenous schools, representing 45 percent o f the
 indigenous student population will be remodelled, f i s h e d , and equipped under this project.         These
 schools were selected by indigenous leaders representing the nine distinct ethnic groups. Additionally, in
 coordination with project implementation, SEDUC will buildnew indigenous schools inareas determined to
be still laclung them. Such construction will be carried out with SEDUC's resources. Finally, the project
will finance the distribution o f culturally-appropriate pedagogical materials to all Indigenous and
 Quilombola schools, to complement other pedagogical materials to be distributed with project financing.

b.        Establishment o f the entire Fundamental Cycle.         Through increasing coordination with the
municipalities, including promoting municipalization o f primary education, SEDUC expects to open up
new vacancies for 5th through 8th grades. The project will support actions to increase efficiency in the
delivery o f education, expecting that greater efficiency will allow SEDUC to expand the offer o f secondary
education inthe more remote areas, including for Indigenous students.

C.        Inthe caseofschools or grades not beingoffered inthe communitv. locatenew schools inplaces of
easy access. SEDUC is currently offering transportation to Indigenous and Quilombola students to attend
schools outside o f their community.

d.        Involve Darents in school matters. All State schools are legally required to have a School Council
formed by parents and school community members. The project will foster these School Councils by
financing training in school management to all members, including training on how to prepare a School
Development Plans (PDE). Additionally, all Indigenous schools and those serving Quilombola students
will receive financial resources, on a yearly basis, to finance activities identified by their school councils in
the School Improvement Projects (PMEs). PMEs will be made up o f discrecionary resources (to finance
small repairs and other activities) and resources for activities related to school quality.           The PME
mechanism will enable school communities to identifytheir priorities as well as determine how those should
be addressed ina culturally appropriate manner.

e.       Work in partnership with universities and NGOs in order to: (i)       train teachers so they can offer
quality education that is culturally appropriate, and (ii)    conduct the monitoring and evaluation o f the
Indigenous and Quilombola schools. Indigenous and Quilombola teachers will receive training through the
regular in-service teacher training financed by the project --focused on literacy and mathematics for 1st and
2nd grades. Additionally, with resources from PMEs these communities will be able to determine and
finance the additional training needs of their teachers.       All public schools, including Indigenous and
Quilombola ones, will be closely evaluated through the SAEPE exam.

f.       Conduct two beneficiaw assessments during implementation to evaluate the status o f the project
and need for adaptations.      These assessments will be carried out by independent consultants and/or
universities under contract with SEDUC. The project will finance these assessments, w h c h will provide
feed-back for the mid-term review and project completion report.           A detailed description of how such
assessmentswill be carried out will be detailed inthe project's Operational Manual.

g.       Address gender issues among b o w and girls through special interventions in the training o f
teachers and school material. Take to the classroom discussions about domestic violence and alcoholism.
The pilot program addressing youth at risk in schools identified as "critical" due to problems with violence,
drugs, and teen-age pregnancy, will include interventions such as the ones listed above.

h.       Monitoring and evaluation. Indicators will be disaggregated by gender and e t h c background.
Indicators for Quilombola students will be collected to form the baseline.

12 This section is organized in accordance to the guidelines o f OD 4.20, the IndigenousPeoples Development Plan.
I3 The data pertaining to Indigenous school teachers and enrollment are for 1999 and comprise information on 96 schools.
   Since then, the State created three more Indigenous schools for which data are not yet available.
14 There is no existing data on the exact size o f the Quilombo population. However, data show that there are 8,3 18 families
   in Quilombo communities, and it is hereby estimatedthat each family comprises on averageo f4 members.
15 The fact that legal dispositions exist has not been a guarantee that they will be implemented.The Organization o f American
   States, OAS, comments that courts tendto be condescending, as shown in a notorious case in 1990, one o f the few ever to
   come to trial. The plaintiff was a teacher, who was prevented from entering the school by the principal because she was
   black. Further evidence showed the principal's record o f discrimination, denying black and pardos entrance to their
   school. However, the higher court o f SZo Paulo overtumed the lower court's decision against the teacher.
16  According to the qualitative fieldwork, the age-grade distortions are very acute among Indigenous students as a result o f

1.       Constitutional Provisions


The 1996 Brazilian Constitution includes several articles that set forth rights for Indigenous peoples
relating to education:


         Article 210 requires the establishment o f minimum curricula for primary (first four grades o f the
         fundamental cycle) education which should ensure respect for cultural and artistic values, both
         national and regional, and in paragraph (2) requires the primary education to be delivered in the
         Portuguese language, "ensuring the use o f the mother tongues and the learning processes o f the
         Indigenous communities."


         Article 23 1 recognizes the social organizations, customs, languages, beliefs, and traditions o f
         Indigenous individuals, as well as their original rights to the lands they traditionally occupy.
         Beyond this overall rights recognition, article 231 also describes the characteristics o f the rights
         associated to Indigenous lands.


         Article 215 requires the Government to guarantee to all Brazilians the full exercise o f their cultural
         rights and access to the sources o f national culture, and to support and provide incentives for
         valuing and disseminating cultural expressions. Inparagraph 1there is a specific protection o f the
         popular, Indigenous and Afro-Brazilian cultural expressions, as well as those o f other groups.


         Article 216 contains a definition o f the Brazilian cultural patrimony which covers material and
         immaterial goods, expressions o f identity, and actions and memories o f different groups. The
         patrimony includes: expressions; ways o f being and lifestyle; scientific, artistic and technological
         creations; and works and objects used for artistic-cultural expression. The Government is required
         to promote and protect, together with the communities, the Brazilian cultural patrimony.
         Traditional knowledge related to genetic resources is protected by legislation also in Provisory
         Measure No. 2186 o f July 26,2001.


         Article 68 o f the Transitory Constitutional Provisions gives land protection to the remnants o f
         Quilombolu communities that are occupying the lands o f such communities, as a group with
         separate rights than those o f other Afro-Brazilians.


Even though there are no specific education provisions for Quilombola communities in the Constitution,
article 210 requiring respect o f cultural and artistic values, and the two articles dealing specifically with
culture described above (215/216) provide cultural protection to Afro-Brazilians and would call for a




                                                     - 95 -

respect o f the Quilombola culture inthe provision to education.


2.      Federal Legislation and Policies


Articles 78 and 79 o f the 1996 Education Law (LDB), following the Constitutional requirements, set forth
special provisions for Indigenous peoples educati0n.A


The LDB requires that:


    0   the use o f the Indigenous languages and learning systems; /2 and
    0   the implementation o f integrated research and education programs to provide bilingual and
        intercultural education to Indigenous students./3

The objectives of intercultural and bilingual education are:

    0   to provide Indians and their communities and peoples, the recovery o f their historic memories, the
        reaffirmation o f their ethnic identities, and the valorization o f their languages and sciences; and
    0   to guarantee access to Indians, their communities and peoples, to the information, and technical
        and scientific knowledge o f the national society and other Indigenous and nonhdigenous
        societies.14

The LDB also requires the intercultural and bilingual programs:

    0   to strengthen the socio-cultural practices and mother tongues o f the Indigenous communities;
    0   to train Indigenous teachers;
    0   to develop specialized curricula according to the different cultures; and
    0   to develop and publish specialized didactic materia1s.h

The LDB also requires that the bilingual and intercultural education be technically and financially
supported by the federal government.

A 1996 Federal Decree establishes, following the requirements o f the LDB, an Indigenous education policy
separate than the general education, with the culturally appropriate features required by the Constitution
and the LDB.16

Two 1999 Directives o f the Basic Education Chamber o f the National Education Council (mentioned
below) set forth the national guidelines for Indigenous educationh

Resolution No. 2 of April 19, 1999 refers to the specific requirements for the education o f Indigenous
communities, which should be cognizant o f the different identities involved. The Resolution sets forth a
separate structure for the functioning o f basic education in"Indigenous schools" with an intercultural and
bilingual curriculum, andvaluing the culture and ethnic diversity o f the groups concerned.w

The requirements to qualify as an "Indigenous school" are:

    0   exclusive delivery o f service to the Indigenous community;
    0   mother tongue education; and


                                                      - 96 -

        0   its own school organization.

   The 2001 National Education Planis also contains directives and benchmarks for Indigenous education, and
L. recognizes that the differentiated Indigenous schools require from the agencies involved a definition o f new
   concepts and mechanisms appropriate to ensure that such Indigenous schools benefit from the official
   school system, but with respect o f their specific diversity.iio

   There are no special provisions in the LDB dealing with Quilombola communities that would require an
   education system different than that o f the general student population, and no special policy for
   Quilombolu students is inplace.

   Federal, State and Municipal APencies


   1.       Federal Agencies


   At the federal level, the Ministry o f Education (MEC) is in charge o f the coordination o f Indigenous
   education at all levels, taking into account views o f Fundupio Nacionul do Indio (National Indigenous
   Foundation -- FUNAI) in respect o f indigenous peoples education and other culture promotion agencies.
   The secretariats o f education o f the states and municipalities are responsible for the delivery o f such
   education.ii I


        (a) MinistrvlNational Council


   At the federal level, the national policies are developed by the MEC with the policy guidance and
   supervision o f the National Education Council.ii2


        (b) Culture Promotion and Protection Agencies


        FunducZo Nucional do Indio (FUNAI)


   FUNAI is the federal agency in charge o f coordination and promotion o f cultural values o f Indigenous
   peoples.    FUNAI was established by Law 5371 o f December 5, 1967, and is operating as a federal
   foundation, with by-laws approved by decree o f 1992, linked to the Ministry o f Justice.m       This decree
   revoked prior decrees under which FUNAI hadbeen operating.


   It is among the current powers o fthe foundation: (a) to promote the education o fthe Indigenous individuals
   with a view o f their progressive integrationto the national society; and (b) to promote surveys, studies and
   research o n the Indigenous peoples, taking into account the preservation of their cultures and the adequacy
   o f the assistance programs.114 The Directorate for Assistance is empowered to promote and manage at the
   national level, the assistance to indigenous peoples on education policies.il5


   As mentioned earlier, the M E C is in charge o f Indigenous education as such, and the role o f FUNAI has
   been substantially reduced (similarly as for health matters) as a general oversees or consultant on
   Indigenous education issues. The specific coordination role o f FUNAI is not analyzed inthis report due to



                                                         - 97 -

lack o f information.


    Fundaciio Cultural Palmares (FCP)


FCP is the agency responsible for promoting the preservation o f the cultural, social and economic values
derived from Afro influences in the Brazilian society, and in particular the selected needs o f the
Quilombola communities. The creation o f FCP was authorized by law in 1988,116 and the by-laws o f the
public foundation formed were registered in 1992.117 FCP is under the jurisdiction o f the Ministry o f
Culture.


FCP is govemed by a Council composed o f six representatives from Afro-Brazilian communities, and one
each from Indigenous communities, the Women's Rights Council, the Secretariat o f Science and
Technology and the MEC, all nominatedby the Ministry o f Culture.iis


In2001, a decree was enacted to set forth regulations for the administrative procedures to be followed for
the identification o f the African descendants living in Quilombola communities and for the recognition o f
their lands. Even though identification i s cited in the objectives, in the decree there are no provisions
dealing with identification o f the groups as such. All deal with titling and limit coverage to the lands in
possession and continued occupation from 1888 to 1988.119


Even though as the agency in charge o f the promotion o f the culture o f Quilombolas, it would be
appropriate for the MEC, and the States and Municipalities to coordinate with the FCP on issues related to
the respect and protection o f cultural values o f Quilombolas, there is no specific requirement for FCP's
involvement in education matters as such. The specific coordination role o f FCP is not analyzed in t h s
report due to lack o f information.


2.        State and Municipal Agencies


There is no clear distinction in the LDB as to the specific role of the States and Municipalities in the
provision o f education services. Article 8 calls for all actors to deliver education ina collaborative manner.
The proposed project will serve both State and Municipal schools for the general student population, and
Indigenous schools, and the collaboration and coordination between their respective education Secretariats
(through Convenios) i s contemplated. As a matter o f recent national policy, education to Indigenous
students is to be delivered by the States with technical and financial support from the Federal government.
No information was found as to criteria for the transfer o f responsibilities o f Municipal Indigenous schools
to the respective States.      Service provision for Indigenous schools was previously decentralized to
Municipalities.

Pernambuco State LegalFramework


 1.      Constitution


There are two main articles in the Pemambuco State Constitution, one dealing with indigenous education
(Article 180) and the other with culture (Article 197). Article 180 addresses fundamental and secondary
education ingeneral, andrequires:


    0    a national curricula, with respect for regional variations;
    0   the language o f the education respecting the ethnic and linguistic diversity o f the society; and
    0   the use o f mother tongues and learning processes o f Indigenous communities.ho

Article 197 requires:
    0   the protection in integrity and development o f the cultural expressions o f African origin and other
        groups; and
        the respect o f the Indigenous cultures intheir autonomous character.

2.      Legislation

In2001, the State o f Pemambuco following the 1999Directives issued by the National EducationCouncil,
transferred to the State jurisdiction the basic education o f students o f Indigenous communities previously
handled by municipalities.12i

Indigenous schools are to follow their own norms and procedures with a multicultural and bilingual
curriculum, and are to decide on its organizational structure and management according to the respective
indigenous culture, socio-cultural and religious practices, and economic activities.

The indigenous community's participation is required at the school level, and also at the State level as
decided upon by a State Indigenous council.^^:! This Indigenous Council has not been formed and the State
Secretary o f Education confirmed that there are no plans to establish it. Instead, representation of
Indigenous peoples will be ensured through a representative committee appointed to the Education Council.
123


Indigenous schools are granted special treatment as to:

    0   The school activities can differ from those o f other schools and can vary as per the economic,
        social, religious or cultural characteristics o f the community, and the duration o f school periods
        can also vary.
    0   The school curricula and plans must follow the national curricula directives, incorporating the
        specific characteristics o f the community.
    0   Teaching should be inthe hands o f Indigenous teachers.124

The Secretariat o f Education o f the State o f Pemambuco is implementing the transfer o f jurisdiction over
the Indigenous Schools through Convenios (technical and financial cooperation agreements) entered with
the Municipalities. Such Convenios refer mainly to the assignment o f personnel and the conditions thereof
for a one year t e r "

Conclusions


The Brazilian legal framework at the Federal and State levels provide an enabling environment for a
culturally appropriate education o f Indigenous peoples, with respect o f their cultures, leaming processes
and customs, and with recognition o f their languages. The policies o f separate indigenous education in
place at the Federal and State level are also meeting the culturally appropriate standards.


The legal framework is not specific about the transfer o f service provision responsibilities from the
Municipalities (more generally in charge o f delivery o f basic education) to the States for the Indigenous
schools or about the role o f FUNAI.There is no requirement inthe legal framework (Constitutional, Federal
or State) that would call for a separate education for Quilombola, except for the required respect o f
cultural values o f such communities. As they are not considered Indigenous but a separate group, mostly
for cultural and land recognition purposes, the special features o f Indigenous education do not apply.
Delivery o f education services to Quilombola communities remains the responsibility o f the Municipality,
and is not being absorbed by the States.


It is a great challenge for the project to deliver education to indigenous and Quilombola students as
required by law and policy and to monitor the achievements, ensuring that the cooperation and coordination
agreements are in place between the State and Municipalities concerned, and that the views o f the
indigenous communities and o f FUNAI are considered for indigenous schools, and of FCP for schools
serving Quilombolas.

 Additional Annex 13: The Government's Strategic Priorities and State Reform Agenda
     BRAZIL: PERNAMBUCO INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT: EDUCATION QUALITY
                                      IMPROVEMENT PROJECT

 PlurianualPlan(PPA) 2000-2003 "Change and Development"
                                      -

Duringthe first term o f this Administration (1999-2002), the Government o f Pemambuco carried out an
 impressive transformation in the quality o f state govemance. Policy challenges were numerous, ranging
 from the fiscal disequilibrium and deficient social outcomes to chronic underinvestment in physical
infrastructure and the worrisome trend in crime and violence. To arrest these trends and exploit the state's
development potential, the State Government focused its four-year plan(PPA) on four strategic options and
several "macro objectives" within each:

 1. Citizenship and the Quality o f Life
      i.Ensuresocialprotectionforthemostvulnerablepopulation
     ii.Expandandimprovebasicsanitationservices
    iii.Universalizationandpromotionofhealth
    iv. Education and citizenshp: Ethical commitment to social inclusion, diversityandjustice
     v. Culture as a State identity
    vi. Guarantee o fpublic safety andjustice as a fundamental condition for citizenship
   vii. Expandsupply o fhousing andinfrastructure, especially for low-income families
   viii. Improve the quality o fpublic transport and urban transit

2. Development and Competitiveness
      i.Promoteprofessionalqualificationandsupportemploymentgeneration
     ii.Expand and modernize supply of transport, ports, airports, energy and telecommunications
         infrastructure
    iii.Promotearticulateddevelopment ofscience andtechnology asthe state'seconomic development
         strategy

3. Economic, Cultural, and Ecological Diversity
     i.Promoteeconomic dynamismofthe statebystimulatingeconomic segments withthe greatest
         potential and competitiveness
     ii.Stimulatesmallproducersasameansofeconomicdevelopmentandemploymentgeneration
    iii.Strengthentourismasaleadingelementinthestate'sdevelopment
    iv. Promote restructuring and vitalization o f agriculture andfishery and strengthen municipalization o f
         agriculture and fishery

4. Participation and Transparency

Within these policy priorities, the Government placed particular emphasis on (i)    renovating the run-down
physical infrastructure using the proceeds from the privatization o f the state utility company, and (ii) the
participatory regional planning (Governo nos Municllpios) and financing o f priority investment projects in
the 11 Development Regions based on the Regional Development Plans. Governo nos Municllpios is an
innovative participatory approach to regional development planning based on the Govemor's previous
experience with Municipal participatory budgeting as Mayor o f Recife. The Government also prioritized
fiscal adjustment during the first term, and managed to reduce the ratio o f personnel expenditure to the net
current revenue from above 70% in 1998 to around 60% by 2001, as required by the law Camata and



                                                   - 101 -

subsequently by the Law o f Fiscal Responsibility (LRF).

PPA 2004-2007: ComplementingInfrastructurewith Social Inclusion

Since August 2002, the Bank intensified its dialogue with the State o f Pemambuco. A series o f meetings
were held to discuss the state's overall development challenges and policy priorities. These culminated in a
workshop in November 2002 where four strategic priorities were identified as bases for the next PPA,
which the Govemment is currently preparing with Bank financial and analytical support. The four priority
areas identified through this dialogue are (i)enhance economic dynamism, especially o f small and
medium-sized economic agents; (ii)improve living conditions (habitabilidade), especially low-income
families' access to quality o f water and sanitation services; (iii)
                                                                  social inclusion, especially o f the youth at
risk; and (iv) strengthening of governance and management o f essential public services, especially
education, health, and public safety.

Faced with the reality that the Government can no longer count on the extraordinary revenues from the
privatization proceeds to finance a large investment portfolio, the Government has stressed the importance
of social inclusion as a cross-cutting theme and priority for all government actions. At the same time, the
need for fiscal adjustment continues or even has a higer importance inthe next term as the Government will
have to fund "more with less."          The Government has begun preparing its next PPA with the
above-mentioned emphasis on social inclusion. Utilizing the institutional infrastructure o f Governo nos
Municllpios, the Government is encouraging its Development Regions to prepare a "social inclusion plan"
focused on improving social inclusion and human development rather than a regional development o f the
previous PPA, whose focus tended to be o n identifyingregion-specific infrastructure investment needs.

Inthis context, the critical importance o f a comprehensive public sector reform is accentuated both as a
way to improve government efficiency and thus contribute to its overall fiscal reform and also a backbone
of its sector-specific strategies for service delivery improvements and greater social inclusion.          The
Government has been developing a conceptually sound state reform proposal since the previous term.
There has been some progress, but a major challenge o f the next four years is to adjust the reform's focus
given the changed circumstances and government priorities, and accelerate the pace o f reform
implementation, especially inthe key sectors o f education, health and public safety.

State ReformAgenda in the FirstTerm

Since the first term o f the current Administration, the Government o f Pernambuco has pursued an
ambitious state reform agenda. The reform vision and priorities were expressed inthe Master Plan for the
State Reform (Plano Diretor da Reforma do Estado) o f January, 2000. The Plan echoed very closely the
earlier State Reform proposal by the Federal Ministry o f Administration and State Reform (MARE) in
terms o f its conceptual basis. The reform plan departed from the assumption that the Brazilian public
administration had attained the "Weberian"         model o f compliance-oriented bureaucracy, which is
sufficiently professionalized but lacks managerial focus or results orientation.        The reform plan is
composed o f a series o f policy and administrative measures to increase managerial flexibility, while
attempting to strengthen accountability for results by way o f such instruments as contracting o f staff in
certain areas under the general private sector Labor Code (CLT) and management contracts.

Inthe case of Pemambuco, the reform proposal was motivated strongly by the recognition of the State's
tight fiscal situation and the perceivedlow quality of public services, which necessitatedbold measures to
contain the cost o f government operations and improve their efficiency. Specifically, the Plan identifiedthe
following as the principal motivations for the reform:


                                                    - 102-

     Necessity of fiscal adjustment:       The weak capacity for revenue collection and the high shares o f
     personnel and recurrent expenditures limited the government's capacity to invest;

     Deficiency in public services: The inability to achieve universal access to basic public services and
     their low quality weakened the State's competitiveness and curtailed improvements inthe quality o f life
     o f a significant portion o f the population;

     Insertion of the country into the new pattern of global production: Reduction o f the "0 custo Brasil"
     and the creation o f a stable economic environment became critical for attracting private investments
     and for a new cycle o f sustainable economic development;

     Changes in the role of government: The role o f the state changed from an economic entrepreneurial
     state to a normative, regulator state whose main responsibilities would be to guarantee universal access
     to essential services such as education, health, and public safety, and create conditions favorable for
     economic and social development; and

     Control of the state by society: The processes o f government decision-making and service delivery
     should be transparent andthe results achieved should be duly evaluated.

The first-round reform agenda, however, led to little concrete progress. Part o f the plausible reasons for the
limited progress is the alleviation o f the fiscal pressure by the availability o f significant privatization
proceeds, w h c h the State Government used to finance a number o f priority infrastructure projects to close
the considerable "deficit"     the State had accumulated in the availability and the quality o f public
infrastructure.

The State Reform Agenda for the Second Term

During the first term o f the current Administration, the State adjusted its overall fiscal stance positively
from chronic deficitary situations in the past to a positive fiscal balance./l However, as the privatization
proceeds ran out, the State found itself once again with the prospect o f tight fiscal conditions. Thus in
preparation for the government plan for the eventual second term, the Government renewed its earlier focus
on the state reform, the substance o f w h c h was summarized in the document Restructuring and
Modernization of the State Apparatus (October 2002)./2             The new proposal continued to base its
fundamental rationale on the need to achieve greater economy (i.e., fiscal adjustment through expenditure
cutskontrol), and efficiency and quality o f public services, and highlighted four complementary areas o f
emphasis:

(i) Introductionaof neworganizationalandadministrativestructure:Theproposalconsistedmainly
o f reconfiguration o f the secretariats and rearrangements o f the number o f indirect administration entities,
with a view to reduce duplication o f functions, eliminate unnecessary or poorly executed functions (and
thus entities), improve coordination, and achieve greater economy.

(ii)     Containment of personnel expenditures and new personnel management:                 The proposal was
intended to correct the perverse consequences o f the current public sector personnel management regime as
established in the 1988 Constitution, whereby all public servants were given a series o f benefits and job
security irrespective o f types o f functions they exercised. The core o f the proposal was the definition o f the
exclusive state careers to be occupied by permanent civil servants and the non-exclusive careers to be

(iii)    Reductions in non-salary recurrent expenditures (custeio):        Custeios account for around R$1
billiodyear, or about 26 percent o f the State's net current revenue and are among the few expenditure items
over which the government has relative control. The proposal aimed at reducing R$50 million from custeio
in 2003 in such a way that the Government could avoid the traditional linear cuts to expenditures
irrespective o f their relative importance.    The cost reductions were predicated on a combination o f
information technology use (e.g., PregGo EletrGnico (Intemet Bidding System)), introduction o f certain
management approaches (e.g., centralized procurement o f certain goods), better regulations, and selective
cuts o f specific expenditure items.

(iv)     Restructuring and new management models in health, education, and public safety (areas
Jinalisticas):   These three sectors received substantial investments in the 1999-2002 period in terms o f
remodelling and expansion o f the school and hospital networks, and equipment for the police forces.
However given the tight fiscal condition, the proposal emphasized the need to change govemance and
management inthese sectors inorder to improve their efficiency, including making further advancements in
decentralization and introducing clear definitions o f responsibilities between the Union, the State and the
Municipalities.

This proposal, with some modifications based on the Govemor's decisions, became the basis for the
Government proposal for the state reform bill considered and approved by the State Legislative Assembly
on January 31,2003 (Complementary Law No. 049 on "Areas o f action, the structure, and the functioning
o f the Executive Power").

The 2003 State ReformLaw

The new Complementary Law opens the way for a number o f innovative govemance and management
approaches following the philosophy o f the 2000 Master Plan and the October 2002 reform proposal. Its
main characteristics are the following:

Organizational restructuring: The approved Law mandates the restructuring o f the Government structure,
by reducing the number o f Secretariats from 17 to 12, and the number o f indirect administrationentities
from 34 to 27, and by defining ingeneral terms their functions andresponsibilities./3 A decree will be
issued in2003 to define the internal structure o f each Secretariat and indirect administration entity, and the
Secretariat o f Administration and Reform o f the State (SARE) is currently worlung with each line
Secretariat to this end.

Human resource issues: Some o f the most significant changes were introduced inthe area o f the State's
human resource regimes. In particular, the Complementary Law defined (possibly for the first time in
Brazilian history) Careers Exclusive o f the State (to be govemed by their respective statutes) and Careers
Not-Exclusive o f the State (to be govemed by the general labor legislation as "emprego publico")./4        The
Careers Exclusive o f the State, as definedby the Complementary Law, are:

    (i)Seniormanagementpositionsinbothdirectandindirectadministration(i.e., Secretaries,Directors,
        Gergncia, Superintendgncia, Assessoramento, and CheJia);
    (ii) occupationalcategoriesthatareinvolvedintheexerciseoflawenforcement, and
        Those
        legal/judicial powers;/5 and
    (iii)
        Military Police and the Military Firefighting Force.

A new law will be necessary to regulate the management o f Exclusive State Careers (e.g., procedures for


                                                     - 104-

performance evaluation, promotion, dismissals).

The Complementary Law establishes that future vacancies in positions belonging to the Not-Exclusive
State Careers would be automatically converted into the "emprego publico" positions. Staff under this
regime would be subject to periodical performance evaluations, and could be dismissed under any o f the
following conditions:

     Serious faults (prcitica defalta grave) as established inthe Consolidated Labor Legislation (CLT);
     Illegal accumulation o f positions, functions and public employment;
0    Needto reduce staffing for expenditure reduction purposes;
0    Redundancy o f the functions;
     Inadequate or insufficient performance; and
     Without cause, following a due process and proper indemnity.

The staff under empregopublico will receive a variable pay o f up to 100 percent o f their base salary.

Decentralization, Contracting-out, Partnerships: The Complementary Law declares, without givingmany
concrete details, the Government's intention to decentralize or deconcentrate those non-exclusive functions
that can more adequately be carried out by other actors such as Municipalities, a "third" sector such as
civil society organizations, or private contractors (setor de serviqos).

Areasfinalisticas: Finally, the Complementary Law declares that "The Executive Power will pay special
attention to the areas o f health and education and public safety, reorganizing and modemizing their
structures, prioritizing performance o f their unitsthat provide direct services to communities, and
exercising constant monitoringo f results in order to allow for timely corrections o f strategies."16

11 It should be noted, however, that the use of the (extraordinary) privatization proceeds for financing capital expenditures
meant that in terms of the prevailing accounting norm, the State's primary balance worsened, in spite of the positive fiscal
adjustments in other key dimensions such as the revenue performance andthe control of personnel expenditures.

12 Specifically, strengthening governance and management of the key social services (education, health, and public safety)
became one of the four priority challenges under the umbrella slogan of "complementing infrastructure with social inclusion."
The other three "challenges" are (i)social inclusion, especially of the youth, (ii)improvements in living conditions in poor,
urban areas with particular emphasis on investments in water and sanitation facilities, and (iii)promotion of dynamic regional
economies to narrow intra-state gaps in economic development with special attention to supporting small and medium-size
enterprises.

13 Inthe original October 2002 proposal, the Secretariatof Administration and Reformof the State hadproposeda muchbolder
measure of eliminating entirely 11 indirect administration entities.

14 The inability of the Congress to agree on reasonable definitions of these careers was the major reason for the paralysisof the
Federal-levelAdministrative Reform initiated with the 19thConstitutional Amendment of 1998.

51 Specifically, these include Procuradoria Geral do Estado, Auditoria do Tesouro Estadual, Pericia Criminal, Medicina
Legal, Autoridade Policial, Invesigacdo, Preparacdo Processual, Identificacdo Pericial, Defensoria Publica, and others
"anticipated" ("previstos") inthe Complementary Law.

61 The Complementary Law offers greater details about the reorganization and modemization of the public safety sector,
including unification of the training functions of the three sub-sectors - the civil police, the military police, and the fire
department- under the newly created State Police Academy.

Recife, July 15,2003

Mr.Vice-president,

It is our pleasure to inform you o f the improvements inthe quality o f Fundamental Education in the State
o f Pemambuco     - a matter that has been worthy o f special attention during my term o f office.

The State o f Pemambuco's performance in the educational sector strictly abides to meeting the
requirements established in the Federal and State Constitutions as well as in Federal Law 9394 o f
December 20th, 1996. This Law - more specifically so in its 10th Article- rules over the federated states'
responsibilities inregards to education.

Inspite o f our efforts to ensure quality education in our state, and although data concerning fundamental
education in the State o f Pemambuco shows significant advances in attending to the needs o f the
school-aged population, the state average is lower than the national average. The performance o f the
students enrolled in the program is worrisome. Hence, we recognize that efforts to improve performance in
this educational level cannot be postponed. The analysis o f such data highlights the prevalence o f problems
that require immediate measures. Among such measures, we can hghlight those that pertain to students'
school performance, to the program's area o f coverage and inclusion, to overcoming o f high failure and
age-grade distortion rates, to adequacy o f teacher-training programs and teacher abilities, to the
implementation o f the minimum standard requirements to be met by the public school system, to
improvement in coordinating education-related measures between the State and municipalities, and to the
improvement o f education management by the state        - as per the Complementary Law that was recently
enacted by the Legislative Assembly and sanctioned by me.

In light o f this, the State Government, through its Secretariat for Education and Culture, has outlined a
Project for Integrated Development - Improvement inthe Quality o f Education inthe State o f Pemambuco.
This project's main objectives are to: (a) improve the quality, efficiency and inclusion in the public school
system, (b) strengthen and modernize the Secretariat's managerial, administrative and financial capacities
so as to render efficient education services, (c) to support the widespread efforts o f the State's current
reform through the implementation o f measures for institutional modernization in the Secretariat for

Education which would then be employed inother public entities o f the State.

Inorder to reachthese objectives, the followinglines o faction shall be observed:


   0     Attempt to include segments o f the population that despite having met the expected coverage level
         still face difficulties inhaving their needs fulfilled. Special focus shall be placed o n children o f
         low-income families, children from indian and village populations, and children with special needs
         for whom the availability o f schools that are more appropriate to their specific cultural needs must
        be ensured.


   0    Improvement inthe quality o f educational services geared towards improving the students' school
        performance, for w h c h it will be necessary to ensure better performance o f schools themselves as
        the place for rendering these services. This will require schools to: (i)  have minimumoperational
        andworking conditions inregards to facilities and services, (ii) autonomy inregards to
                                                                             have
        pedagogical, administrative, financial terms, whose management will count on community
        participationthrough the effective performance o f the corresponding School Councils, and (iii)
        offer a teaching staff o f qualified professionals, w h c h requires professional training review as well
        as corresponding adequacy o f in-service training;


   0    increasedefficacy o fthe state's educational system with the aim o f overcoming the so-called
        culture o f "school failure" and the age-grade distortion rate. These two factors result inadditional
        costs to the proper fimctioning o f the educational system. Inaddition, results o f national and state
        evaluations carried out show that these factors also contribute to the poor performance of students
        facing the situations mentioned.


   0    canylng out the sate modemization process, having the Secretariat for Education as a piloting unit
        for the application o f new management models andprocedures aimed at efficiency, efficacy and
        quality inrendering the educational services entrusted to the institution.

The Project at hand will be implemented duringthe 2004-2007 time period, at the end o f which a change in
the State's educational indicators, as listed below, shall have been attained:

9       increase inthe number o f students who conclude the basic education levels from 54% to 60%
        (percentage rate observed inBrazil);
9       improved performance o f students from public schools inthe learning evaluationtests (Testes de
        Avaliap?o de Aprendizado -SAEB);
P       decrease inthe percentage rate o f students that face age-grade distortion inthe basic education
        years from 53% to 46%;
9       decrease inthe percentage rate o f students that face age-grade distortion inthe MIDDLEeducation
        years from 68% to 60%;
P       reduction in school-failure rates o f students enrolled inpublic schools from 31% to 23%;
9       increase inthe approval rates o f students enrolled inschools for indian populations from 60% to
70%;
k       decrease o f the drop-out rates o f basic education students o f indian populations from 13% to 10%.

        With the objective o f increasing the efficiency and sustainability o f the mid and long term
        educational objectives, the project will make use o f the following            experimental and pioneer
        procedures and processes that modernize public administration among other activities aimed at

        supporting the program for State Reform:
(a)     strengthening human resource management o f personnel from the public administration system and
        making a more rational distribution o f human resources;
(b)     introducing standards for evaluating the performance o f teachers and other staffmembers;
(c)     usinge-government to foster greater transparency to andparticipation from the society inthe
        educational sector;
(d)     carrying out systematic studies to oversee public expenditures to promote better use o f the State's
        financial resources.

        These activities shall be undertaken by the Secretariat for Education in conjunction with the
        Secretariats for Planning, Administration and State Reform. In addition to contributing to the
        strengthening o f the State's fiscal situation, the reforms that will be experimented in the Education
        Sector will serve as a valuable model to be undertaken and disseminated in other Secretariats and
        public institutions o f the State.

        The State o f Pemambuco hopes to count on the World Bank's fmancial support for the
        implementation o f the Project described above. Such implementation represents the continuity o f
        t h s Secretariat's efforts to provide better living conditions for its population.
