moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            other states in Brazil had implemented accelerated classes\n            targeting overage students with successful results in terms\n            of reducing age-grade distortion caused by high repetition\n            rates and late entrance. Now, the preliminary results of the\n            Accelerated Classes Program implemented under the project\n            provide further evidence, albeit preliminary, to support\n            these programs. Results show a decrease in age-grade\n            distortion in the early years of fundamental education from\n            56 percent in 2004 to 51.4 percent in 2006, and in secondary\n            education from 71.6 percent in 2004 to 69.7 percent in 2006.\n            The project's heavy reliance on a sizable Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU), largely de-linked from the rest of\n            SEE (Secretaria de Educacao e Cultura - Secretariat of\n            Education and Culture) and operating to a certain extent\n            outside the framework of the Secretariat, is inadequate for\n            building institutional capacity in its main directorates,\n            and this is especially important for a project that has a\n            public sector management objective. While recognizing the\n            difficulties of selecting data sources for project level\n            indicators for monitoring progress, especially in areas such\n            as student learning achievement, the use of state- and\n            municipal-level indicators makes it difficult to measure the\n            results that are attributable directly to project-financed interventions."}, "docdt": "2010-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
