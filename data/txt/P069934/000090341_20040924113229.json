The project has\n            the following four components: 1) This component seeks to\n            improve the quality and efficiency of the 1,086 state\n            schools in Pernambuco. 2) This component aims to improve\n            education policy for the entire system and to support\n            programs targeted to areas of special concern such as less\n            than satisfactory teaching performance, high repetition\n            rates, large age-grade distortions, the need to consolidate\n            a culture of evaluation, and the exclusion of children with\n            disabilities in the education system. 3) This component\n            promotes the State reforms aimed at improving efficiency in\n            delivering public services through two subcomponents, one\n            that addresses broader public sector issues such as\n            supporting the development of public administration models\n            and procedures according to the master plan for the sate\n            reform (PDRE), and a second subcomponent that focuses on the\n            introduction of the more efficient models and procedures\n            into the education sector. 4) This component will finance\n            the management of the project and, at the same time support\n            the strengthening of State Education and Cultural\n            Secretariat (SEDUC) through the provision of technical\n            assistance and consultant services to implement the project\n            and to adapt SEDUC to better integrate and gradually absorb\n            project functions."}, "docdt": "2004-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
