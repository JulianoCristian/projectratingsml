1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
At the time of Appraisal of the Pernambuco Integrated Development: Education Quality
Improvement Project (the Project), the State of Pernambuco (the State), with 7.9 million
inhabitants spread across 184 municipalities, was the most urbanized state in Brazil's
Northeast region. The State's GDP per capita was R$3,279, well below the national
average (R$5,740), but above that of other states in the Northeast. Pernambuco's
education system comprised the Municipal and State systems, as well as private schools.
According to the 2001 School Census, there were about 2.7 million students enrolled in
11,970 schools at the different levels in the three systems. The State and Municipal
systems covered 35 percent and almost 50 percent of all students, respectively. At the
State level, the Secretariat of Education (Secretaria de Educação e Cultura ­ SEE) was
responsible for managing the education system and its 1,086 schools (of which 99 were
Indigenous), and delivering education to 963,056 students. SEE was organized into 17
Regional Management Offices (Gerencias Regionais de Educação ­ GREs) that provided
support and guidance to the schools.

Sector Issues:

Pernambuco faced several issues that impacted its ability to provide universal access to
quality public services, including education. These included:

¾      Deficient Public Sector Administration. The State's public administration was
heavy and inefficient and characterized by low quality of services delivery and lack of
accountability.
¾      Low Coverage and Exclusion of Disabled and Minority Children. Education
coverage at the fundamental level was not universal, and, at 90 percent, was lower than
the national average of 94 percent. Children with special needs and minority groups
such as Indigenous and Quilombola children tended to be disproportionately excluded
from the formal education system.
¾      High Repetition and Age-Grade Distortion. About half of all the students
enrolled in the fundamental cycle were at least one year older than the appropriate age
for their grade level, due to late entrance and high repetition rates. Only 3.2 percent of
students entering first grade managed to complete fundamental education within the
expected eight years.
¾      Low Student Achievement Level and Inadequate Teacher Qualifications and
Skills. In 1999, only three of the 27 Brazilian states scored below Pernambuco in the
Mathematics and Portuguese SAEB test (Sistema Nacional de Avaliação da Educação
Básica). One of the contributing factors to the poor student performance was the low
qualification and inadequate skills of the teachers. According to the 2001 School
Census, about half of the 117,852 teaching positions in Pernambuco were filled by
teachers without a higher education degree.
¾      Inadequate Infrastructure. At the time of Appraisal, it was estimated that about
40 percent of school infrastructure in Pernambuco was inadequate, with some schools
operating in rented buildings and without adequate furnishing and equipment.



                                           1
¾      Poor Coordination between the State and the Municipalities. Despite passage
of the National Education Law in 1996 (Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional
­ LDB), which specified roles and responsibilities in the delivery of education for each
level of government, significant overlap existed.
¾      Poverty-Related Factors. Pernambuco had the second highest incidence of
absolute poverty in the Northeast, with almost 2.6 million people living in poverty. The
poorest segments of the population tended to have the worst education performance in
terms of delays in entering school, repetition and dropout rates and education outcomes.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The development objectives of the Project were to: (a) improve the quality, efficiency,
and inclusiveness of the public education system; (b) modernize and strengthen the
managerial, financial, and administrative capacity of the Secretariat of Education to set
policies and guidelines for the sector and deliver public education efficiently; and (c)
support the overall state modernization effort through interventions to be carried out in
the Secretariat of Education and to be replicated in other state institutions. The Key
Indicators are listed and discussed in Section 3.2 and in Annex 2.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The Project's Development Objectives or key indicators were not formally revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project's direct beneficiaries were expected to be basic education students in both
State and Municipal schools and those that would enter those schools in the future. There
were approximately 2.17 million students enrolled in basic education ­ 1.8 million in the
fundamental cycle and 373 thousand in the secondary cycle at the time of Appraisal.
Another 1.17 million children between the ages of zero and six were expected to enter
school in the five years following Appraisal. The State Reform Component (Component
3) was expected to benefit all residents of Pernambuco that received public education
and, by piloting the State's Reform agenda in SEE, other Government agencies would
benefit from SEE's reform experience.

1.5 Original Components

The Project comprised four components, as described below.

Component 1. Improving Quality and Efficiency of the State Schools (US$28.6
million or 54.5 percent of total project costs without contingencies). This component
sought to improve the quality and efficiency of the 1,086 state schools in Pernambuco
through three subcomponents.
1.1     Strengthening School Autonomy (US$7.3 million or 13.9 percent of total
project costs without contingencies). This subcomponent sought to increase school
efficiency and accountability by giving the school community more autonomy and



                                           2
responsibility in managing their schools. In addition, it sought to make schools more
inclusive and culturally relevant to their students.
1.2     Ensuring Minimum Operational Standards at Schools (US$20.9 million or
39.9 percent of total project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent sought to
ensure that State schools, including those serving Indigenous communities, met the
minimum operational standards in terms of their infrastructure and inputs.
1.3     Improving Teachers Qualifications (US$0.4 million or 0.8 percent of total
project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent was to support pilot pre-service
teacher training under revised curricula and higher education training that aimed to
improve the quality of the State public schools and address the shortage of teachers in
grades 5 through 8 and in secondary education.

Component 2. Improving System Efficiency and Effectiveness and Expanding
Inclusion (US$15.4 million or 29.3 percent of total project cost without contingencies).
This component sought to improve education policy for the entire system and to support
programs targeted to areas of special concern such as less than satisfactory teaching
performance, high repetition rates, large age-grade distortions, the need to consolidate a
culture of evaluation, and the exclusion of children with disabilities in the education
system under two subcomponents.
2.1     Enhancing Educational Policies and Performance (US$0.4 million or 0.7
percent of total project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent sought to
improve the formulation and implementation of education policies that have an impact on
the entire education system, including the State, Municipal, and private schools.
2.2     Supporting Education Programs to Increase Quality and Inclusion (US$15.0
million or 28.6 percent of project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent
sought to improve the quality of education in Municipal schools with the worst
performance on SAEPE, reduce age-grade distortions at the fundamental level, and
diminish youth idleness and involvement in anti-social activities.

Component 3. Supporting the State Reform (US$4.8 million or 9.1 percent of total
project cost without contingencies). This component sought to promote the State reforms
aimed at improving efficiency in delivering public services through two subcomponents,
one that addressed broader public sector issues such as supporting the development of
public administration models and procedures according to the Master Plan for State
Reform (Plano Diretor da Reforma do Estado ­ PDRE), and a second that focused on the
introduction of more efficient models and procedures into the education sector.
3.1     Supporting the Implementation of the State Reform (US$1.6 million or 3
percent of total project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent was to support
the implementation of reforms recommended in the PDRE through the development of
public administration models and procedures, which would then be piloted at SEE to
improve effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of education.
3.2     Strengthening and Modernizing Education Management (US$3.2 million or
6.1 percent of total project cost without contingencies). This subcomponent sought to
modernize SEE by introducing changes recommended in the PDRE and developed under
the previous subcomponent.




                                            3
Component 4: Project Management (US$2.3 million or 4.5 percent of total project
cost without contingencies). This component was designed to finance the management of
the Project and support the strengthening of SEE through provision of technical
assistance and consultants' services to implement the Project and to adapt SEE to better
integrate and gradually absorb project functions.

1.6 Other significant changes

Two Project restructurings were processed during the Project's implementation. The first
restructuring on May 26, 2009, resulted in a reallocation of funds among categories of
Schedule I to the Loan Agreement. Then, a second order restructuring, on December 18,
2009, again provided for a reallocation of funds, as well as minor retroactive adjustments
to the Project Description to make it compatible with the PAD and actual Project
expenditures. It also extended the Closing Date to June 30, 2010 and incorporated
relatively routine modifications to the Procurement Schedule. In May 2010, a standard
amendment that was required across the board to all projects incorporated cross-
debarment provision in the Loan Agreement. On June 28, 2010, the Bank informed the
Borrower that it would honor withdrawal applications received by December 31, 2010 in
respect of eligible expenditures made before the June 30, 2010 Closing Date.

The Project's design included the delivery of accelerated classes to students in the 5th
through 8th grades of the fundamental cycle. At the State Government's request, the
Bank agreed to expand these programs to overage students in the secondary level as well.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis. The Bank was the chief external financing
institution for Brazil's education sector and through continuous previous involvement had
accumulated solid knowledge on national and regional issues and priorities, not only at
the federal level but at the state level as well. A strong program of economic and sector
work had also been carried out that contributed to this knowledge, and helped guide
design of projects. The Project also benefited from sector work that had been carried out
at the state level in the report "Growth and Poverty Reduction in Pernambuco:
Developing a Sustainable Policy Framework" (2000).

Lessons Learned from the design and implementation of numerous Bank-financed
education projects in Brazil at the federal, regional, and state levels were incorporated
into the Project's design. These lessons included: (a) that public sector reform efforts
that are clearly and directly linked to improving government performance in delivering
concrete services have a better chance of succeeding than projects that exclusively aim to
strengthen internal administrative functions without linking them to final policy/program
outcomes; (b) FUNDESCOLA standards have proven to be overly elaborate and
ambitious in the context of limited fiscal capacity of states; (c) cooperation with
municipalities is essential in order for the project to have a significant impact on



                                            4
education quality; (d) adequate monitoring and evaluation systems (the nationwide SAEB
and the State's SAEPE) are needed to continuously ascertain the quality of education in
State and Municipal schools; (e) School Development Plans (PDEs) have a significant
effect on student achievement, attendance and attainment, the longer a school has been in
the PDE program, the higher the test score gains, and early-entering schools have been
able to reduce dropout rates and grade failure compared to non-PDE schools; and (f)
accelerated classes targeting overage student, offering them high quality teachers and
materials, all aimed at reducing age-grade distortion have been successful in other states
in Brazil.

Adequacy of the Government's Commitment. There was strong commitment by the State
Government and the leadership of SEE to the challenging and innovative approach of
combining the objectives of advancing public sector reform and improving the quality of
education services, consistent with the Project's design. The Government of Pernambuco
was already committed to an ambitious state reform agenda. The priorities of this agenda
were outlined in the PDRE issued in January 2000 that included policy and
administrative measures to increase managerial flexibility, while strengthening
accountability.

For education, SEE had prepared a 10-year education strategy (Plano Estadual de
Educaçaõ, 2000-2009--PEE) at the beginning of the Administration's first term (1999-
2002) that identified two priorities: (a) improving quality of education through the
establishment of a student assessment system, providing school inputs, and adopting
strategies to reduce student dropout rates; and (b) reducing system-wide inefficiencies by
modernizing SEE's own structure under a decentralized school model, adopting an
accelerated program, improving coordination and quality assurance in the Municipal
school system, and promoting school leadership and autonomy.

Assessment of the Project Design. The Project's design responded fully to the State
Government's reform objectives, both within the broader state administration, as well as
to its specific objectives of improving efficiency in service delivery while at the same
time improving the quality, efficiency and inclusiveness of the public education system.
Yet, in order to address these double objectives, the Project's institutional arrangements
were somewhat complex. At the state level, SEE needed to collaborate closely with the
Secretaria of State Administration and Reform (Secretaria de Administraçaõ e Reforma
do Estado ­ SAD) and the State Planning Secretariat (Secretaria de Planejamento--
SEPLAG), in addition to the State Finance Secretariat (Secretaria da Fazenda--SEFAZ).
Within SEE, the Project was implemented through its several Directorates, including 17
Gerencias Regionais de Educação (GREs) that were responsible for overseeing schools.
Finally, School Councils, dispersed across the State, were to play a key role since they
were directly responsible for implementing the School Improvement Projects (PMEs).
While institutionally complex, the Project's design correctly included the several
components and activities needed for it to accomplish its objectives.

Assessment of Risks. The Project's design included an analysis of the risks it would face,
along with mitigation measures that centered mostly on participatory measures and



                                            5
activities that were taken during preparation or built into the Project's design during
implementation. One important risk that was not envisaged and that came to affect the
Project's implementation was the potential effect of a change in State Administration in
2007 on the State's public sector modernization reform.

Readiness for Implementation. Project preparation was supported by a Borrower-
executed US$243,200 Japanese Grant approved on April 2, 2001. A relevant results
framework was defined, for which baseline data was collected and expected outcomes
estimated on the basis of what the Project could realistically be expected to accomplish.
At the same time, issues that could affect readiness for implementation were addressed,
including: (a) the need to strengthen fiduciary capacity; (b) preparation of detailed
guidelines for channeling resources to schools through the School Councils; (c)
preparation of detailed technical aspects, including the PDEs and PMEs; and (d)
specifications for an Integrated Management System to monitor Project activities and
results.

2.2 Implementation

The Bank's loan for the Project was approved by the Board on October 14, 2004, signed
on June 27, 2005 and became effective on August 1, 2005. A Mid-Term Review was
held on April 22, 2008. The Loan closed on June 30, 2010, its closing date having been
extended by 6 months from the original December 31, 2009. The following issues
impacted the Project's implementation.

Start-up Delays. Following a long preparation process, once appraised, the Project
suffered important delays in negotiations (one year).           The transition in State
Administration in 2003 caused important additional delays, in part, due to turn over in
staffing, delays in appointments, thereby affecting the Project just when implementation
had begun. As a result, the Loan's disbursements were significantly below estimates
during the first two and one half years of implementation, and the Project's
Implementation Progress was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory before being upgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory at the end of 2007.

Project Design. Project preparation did not identify the legal constraints and bureaucratic
impediments related to transferring funds to Municipal schools. These legal constraints
were caused mostly by the enormous difficulties that many schools had in compiling the
required documentation to qualify for grants. To compensate for those schools that could
not/did not want to participate, the Government and Bank agreed to include an additional
15 municipalities with the lowest human development index to participate in the PME
program, in addition to the original 60 that had already benefited.

Institutional Issues. The institutional arrangements included a Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) that was to coordinate activities carried out by SEE under the Project. During
preparation, efforts were taken to avoid the difficult relationships normally caused by
coordination units that are perceived to be "special" (e.g., avoiding differentiated pay and
employment conditions). Nevertheless, the Project's implementation was initially



                                             6
impacted by difficult relations between the PCU and the rest of SEE. After 2007, this
situation improved markedly.

In addition, SAD was responsible for activities under the Project's Component 3, but
these activities involved changes in SEE and required SEE's active involvement. The
level of coordination required to make decisions and then later implement them required
an extraordinary level of cooperation and effort which were often lacking.

Government Changes. Preparation had not envisaged the possible risk that the public
sector modernization reform under implementation at Project appraisal could lose support
due to a change in Administration. The new Administration that took office in 2007,
while embracing the Project's objectives, changed its approach to public sector reform,
inter alia, by adopting results-based management, coordinated by the new Secretariat of
Planning and Management (Secretaria de Planejamento e Gestaõ, SPG). Many of the
activities under Component 3 were adjusted or implemented with alternative sources of
funding because the State Government hired a specialized firm with its own resources to
implement a much more ambitious reform than originally foreseen in the PAD.

More importantly, however, the change in Administration in 2007 brought major changes
in staffing in SEE and in the PCU that resulted in delays, and in a need for intensive
technical support by the Bank through increased supervision during the transition period.
It also placed a hold on Project expenditures between the date of the election in October
2006 and the new Administration taking office in early 2007.

Staffing of the PCU. In addition to broader institutional and staffing issues, those
specifically relating to staffing of the PCU affected the Project from its earliest
implementation. The majority of the Project's Implementation Status Reports mention
issues related to staffing of the PCU, particularly in the areas of financial management,
procurement and monitoring and evaluation.

Project Costs. The original Project cost estimates were affected by several factors. First,
the estimate of the average costs (R$300,000/school) for each of the 91 schools to be
brought up to minimum standards, turned out to be seriously under-estimated in view of
the schools' deteriorated conditions. Second, the strong appreciation of the Brazilian
Real vis-à-vis the US dollar resulted in reduced Project funding. At Project appraisal, the
exchange rate was US$1/R$2.9, at completion it is about US$1/R$1.69. These factors,
combined, resulted in fewer activities being financed by the Project, although not
necessarily in their not being implemented as alternative sources of funding from State
and Federal Governments substituted for Project financing. Finally, with the new
Administration's different approach to public sector modernization, that included as a
centerpiece results-based budgeting and financing, several activities under Component 3
were eventually carried out with alternative sources of funding available to the State
Government.




                                            7
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Increased capacity for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) was considered a requirement
for improved education sector performance. As a result, the Project's Component 3
included a specific activity aimed at developing a monitoring and evaluation system to
facilitate decision-making at SEE and the GREs.

During preparation considerable effort went into the establishment of baselines and
targets that could reasonably be achieved by the Project's activities for each of the
expected outcome indicators. The Project originally included 11 PDO Outcome
Indicators to measure the first objective (improve the quality, efficiency and
inclusiveness of the public education system). It included six PDO Outcome Indicators
to measure the second objective (modernize and strengthen the managerial, financial, and
administrative capacity of the Secretariat of Education to set policies and guidelines for
the sector and deliver public education efficiently). For the third objective (support the
overall state modernization effort through interventions to be carried out in the Secretariat
of Education and to be replicated in other state institutions), it did not include any PDO
Outcome Indicators (but did include intermediate indicators).

During project preparation, baseline data was collected using information from the
Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais (INEP). Following a change in
Federal administration in 2003, INEP changed the methodology for defining some of the
indicators in the school census, stopped collecting data for other indicators and sought to
measure some of them at both the State and the Municipal level. With this change in
methodology, the Project was required to recalculate the baseline data in order to be able
to track and monitor progress towards its objectives over time. The revised baseline data
is presented in Annex 2.

However, while much of the Project focused on specific activities financed in a limited
number of State and Municipal schools, the indicators tracked progress for all State and
Municipal schools, over and above those financed by the Project. While the Project did
finance several activities aimed at improving the management and efficiency of SEE, in
this sense, the Project's expected outcome on learning achievements especially, as
measured using a state- and municipal-wide indicator, was in retrospect overly ambitious.

 An important effort went into establishing baseline data for the Project, and using this to
estimate targets for selected indicators. However the PCU's efforts to monitor Project
activities were problematic due to SEE's lack of a culture of monitoring, and untrained
staff working on M&E within the PCU. The ISRs and Aide Memoires left by Bank
supervision missions reflect the Bank's continuous concern with regard to SEE's
difficulties in producing reliable progress monitoring information on outputs and
outcomes. To overcome this, SEE was provided with training of the PCU's staff
responsible for M&E. In the end, the Bank hired an M&E specialist to review all data
once the 2008 statistics became available (early 2009) and to also provide additional
training to SEE staff.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards. The only Bank safeguard policy that applied to the Project was OD 4.20,
Indigenous People. The Project was not expected to involve construction of new
infrastructure, only school remodeling/renovation that were to be carried out in
accordance with Bank-approved FUNDESCOLA II project environmental guidelines for
small rural schools and SEE's own construction guidelines.

The Project's IPDP prepared in a participatory manner during preparation included
actions that would be supported by the Project to address the needs of the State's
indigenous groups and their schools, and of the Quilombos (formed of descendants of
slaves who ran away from plantations and continue, to this day, living in isolated
communities).

Fiduciary Compliance. Project preparation efforts had identified that a further
strengthening of SEE's financial management capacity would be necessary under the
Project. Despite issues with staffing of the PCU with qualified financial management
staff, financial management arrangements and implementation were generally
satisfactory. Issues that affected financial management included: (a) difficulties in
preparing Financial Management Reports (FMRs); (b) delays by the PCU in following up
on transfers to schools; and (c) the auditors' Qualified-Exception opinion to the Project
Financial Statements in 2007 related to lack of proper internal control over the Project's
assets due to problems faced in traveling to review physical assets in the field. For each
of these, Bank Financial Management Specialists worked with the staff of the PCU to
prepare corrective action plans that were complied with.

The Project's procurement capacity was similarly affected by shortages of staffing,
insufficient qualifications, and lack of previous experience in working with the Bank, and
especially with experience on ICB. The Bank provided continuous assistance to SEE,
offering training for its staff, reviewing its processes, and providing general technical
assistance as and when needed. A procurement post-review end-2006 raised concerns
with respect to the procurement of works involving three processes for the rehabilitation
of schools. The Bank engaged specialists to assist in determining the eligibility of
expenditures due to non-compliance with procurement procedures and/or the verification
of the quality and extent of the rehabilitation of the schools by an independent
engineer/architect. This specialist carried out a technical audit by visiting each of the
schools and confirmed that no unauthorized modifications to the civil works projects had
been carried out in the visited schools.

The State's e-procurement system (Pregão Eletronico do Banco Real) for the acquisition
of off the shelf goods was reviewed and approved by the Bank. This affected the Project
positively as well as other projects financed by the Bank in Pernambuco.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

A US$154 million Pernambuco Results and Accountability Project was approved by the
Bank's Board on April 14, 2009. The Project is financed by a Specific Investment Loan
structured in large part as a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) that addresses activities
needed to improve outcomes in both the education sector and in public procurement and
financial management, and set the basis for future reforms in public sector management
in other sectors of the State Government. This new Project's objectives are a
continuation and deepening of those under the Project, namely to: (a) improve the
quality, efficiency and equity of public education in Pernambuco; and (b) introduce
management reforms that will lead to greater efficiency in the use of the State
Government's public resources in the education sector. Building upon the partnership
with the State under the Project, this new project was designed as a SWAp, in which
financing for the State Government's priority expenditure programs and related
institutional reforms embedded in its education reform agenda ensures the continuation of
important educational policies and programs under the Project while at the same time
addressing key issues that have affected its implementation. For example, in order to
ensure ownership and absorption of project-supported activities by SEE, the new project
will finance ongoing programs in SEE's Plano Plurianual that are implemented by the
Secretariat's existing structure, as opposed to through a PCU.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Project's objectives continue to be highly relevant to the Federal Government of
Brazil, to the State Government and to the Bank. The Federal Government's 2008-11
Economic Program's "Development with Social Inclusion and Quality of Education" is
based on three pillars: the social agenda, the Plan for Education Development (PED),
and the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC). The Project is fully consistent with PED,
which aims to improve the quality of basic education, tackling learning and student
attendance with an emphasis on reducing illiteracy rates, expanding the network of
professional and technological schools and increasing access to college. The Project's
objectives are also consistent with the first and third pillars since education underpins the
Government's social agenda and improvements in the management of public finance are
essential to support growth.

While the State Government's approach to addressing public sector management changed
when a new Administration came to office in 2007, the new team maintained its
commitment to improving public sector management in general and education in
particular, in fact elevating the priority that had been assigned to both of these in the past.
At the time the new Administration took office, the Bank agreed pragmatically to
continue to support implementation of specific activities in support of SEE's investment
program under the Project, while initiating preparation of a follow-on operation that
would respond to the State's new approach to public sector management while providing
continued support to its education system. However, in view of the Government's



                                              10
request for a follow-on operation, of the increase in the Project's costs especially under
Component 1, and of the time that it would take to prepare and secure Governmental
approval for a major restructuring, the Bank opted only to reallocate funds from
Component 3 to other Project activities.

The Project's objectives also continue to be fully aligned with the Bank's FY2008-11
Country Partnership Strategy for Brazil, both through the equity pillar (with an emphasis
on investing in people to reduce extreme poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion, and
to promote better knowledge and skills), and through the growth agenda (with an
emphasis on building human capital to increase opportunities for the poor and improving
the qualification and competitiveness of the work force and strengthening the quality of
services and spending to increase access and affordability and improving efficiency in the
use of public resources).

The design of the Project's components took into account lessons from previous projects
as described in Section 2.1. Its design was challenging, given the institutional
complexities. In addition to the Government's new approach to public sector
management, perhaps one aspect of the Project's design that is no longer relevant was the
decision during preparation to have Project coordination provided through a stand-alone
PCU, as opposed to mainstreamed through SEE's directorates, as is now the case for the
follow-on Education Results and Accountability Project. In retrospect, any project that
aims to support institutional strengthening and reform should likely involve all of the
involved departments and units not only as executing units, but also as fully involved
structures working towards a common goal.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Project's progress towards its development objectives is described below. Specific
Project outputs are provided in Annex 2.

OBJECTIVE 1: Improve the quality, efficiency, and inclusiveness of the public
education system

The Project's impact on education indicators in the State as measured by the respective
Key Indicators for its first objective showed notable results in some key areas although
the baselines, and therefore, the results differed from those included in the indicators.
The Project's activities had an important impact on learning achievements in both State
and Municipal schools in Pernambuco, as measured by SAEB test scores (see Annex 1a
and 1b). Activities aimed at strengthening school autonomy, including training of 2,224
school directors and 2,078 members of school councils, although below the numbers that
had been projected, were carried out to facilitate their participation in the preparation of
PDEs/PMEs. A total of 1,239 PMEs were prepared during implementation (including in
Indigenous schools), although the Project financed only about 150; the remainder were
financed under the Federal Government's FUNDESCOLA Program. The Project was
successful in achieving its inclusion objectives by protecting the resources allocated for
activities and schools targeted to indigenous and disabled students. It protected to a



                                            11
lesser extent resources for schools targeted to Quilombolo students. However, this was
especially important in ensuring that the Project met its inclusion objectives, and notable
in view of the increased Project costs that affected the Project as a whole. The State
Government's Completion Report notes that PDEs/PMEs, and especially the process that
their preparation entails has become a valued school planning instrument, that has
increased school autonomy and community involvement in school decisions, and thereby
contributed to the improved results described below. In general, the longer a school has
been in the PDE program, the higher the test score gains, as well as improved results
reduction in dropout rates over non-PDE schools. This increased school autonomy,
coupled with a strong effort at bringing State schools up to minimum standards though
rehabilitation and equipping of schools, increased satisfaction of students, teachers and
the broader school community, who were all provided with a better learning environment.
Specific results by Key Indicator are provided below:

                                            12
The Project also implemented several activities aimed at improving efficiency and
effectiveness, and promoting greater inclusion in education. These included studies to
estimate demand for teachers in the future, prepare a strategy for continuing education
programs for teachers, develop a standard Regime de Colaboraçaõ (a framework for
SEE's partnership with Municipalities in which activities aimed at improving school
quality are defined), and consolidate the SAEPE learning achievement tool in a revised
version that was developed in partnership with the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora.
This revised tool is being used to evaluate learning achievement for all students,
including those in programs aimed at addressing age-grade distortions.

The strengthening programs for accelerated learning: Se Liga and Acelera, and the
Travessia program for reducing age-grade distortions were extremely successful in
improving learning achievements at the secondary level, and especially in reducing age-
grade distortions at all levels--this was perhaps one of the Project's most notable
achievements. The State's previously high rates of age-grade distortions--at the time of
Project appraisal, three-fourths of all students in upper secondary public schools were at
least one year older that they should be, considering the grade in which they were
enrolled--were explained largely by high repetition rates that resulted in high
inefficiencies in the education system. By reducing age-grade distortions, the Project
improved efficiency of the system. In addition, students in age-appropriate grades are
less likely to fail. The Project financed the development, training of teachers, preparation
of materials, and delivery of these programs. Similarly, the continuous learning program
for teachers in the 1st through 4th grades, Alfabetizar com Sucesso, exceeded expectations
in terms of numbers of teacher trained, and no doubt contributed to improving learning
achievements at the fundamental level.

OBJECTIVE 2: Modernize and strengthen the managerial, financial, and
administrative capacity of the Secretariat of Education to set policies and guidelines
for the sector and deliver public education efficiently.

Initially, much of the strengthening in financial, procurement and administrative capacity
of SEE stayed concentrated in the PCU. These capacity improvements are now
benefiting the SEE, given that PCU functions were mainstreamed into the State
Secretariat when the Project was completed. PDO Outcome Indicators for this objective
(that did not suffer from measurement problems due to the change in methodology,
baseline and measurement levels) were met. Select results by Key Indicator are provided
below:

In addition, the Project financed some key activities as planned, as shown in the table
below. As noted in the table, several other activities have been implemented by the new
Administration with other/additional sources of funding that have had impact beyond
SEE. The most important of these activities included:

                                                 spelled out in annual agreements.

With the change in administration, some activities planned to be financed under
Component 3 were delayed beyond the Project implementation time-frame: (a)
development of education management training modules by the School of Government
and training of SEE/GRES personnel at the School of Government; (b) expenditure
reviews of the education sector; and (c) impact evaluations of key Project activities.
These activities remain relevant and the present administration still plans to carry them
out (with the exception of the impact evaluations) with alternative sources of financing.
In the case of SEE/GRE, personnel will be trained by SEE and not by the School of
Government.

3.3 Efficiency

The Project's economic analysis, as presented in the PAD highlighted its expected
benefits as: (a) a result of the acceleration classes and with the decline in repetition rates
students should complete a more advanced grade before leaving school or reach the same
grade younger, entering better prepared into the labor market; (b) higher learning
achievements, as indicated by the results of the SAEB, should lead to higher earnings;
and (c) by moving faster through the education system, students would cost less to
educate. It had been expected, very ambitiously, that the Project would bring
Pernambuco's SAEB scores up to the national average.

Education achievement increased, although not as much as had been projected, but still
very noticeably in all subjects and at all levels. Through the strengthening of programs
for accelerated learning (Se Liga, Acelera and Travessia), the Project had a very
important impact on reducing age-grade distortion at all levels, and in State and
Municipal schools alike, thereby increasing the flow of students through the education
system. However, the Project's impact on repetition rates was less than expected.
Although overall its expected impact on efficiency is probably less than projected based
on the assumptions used at appraisal, the Project still had some important results that
undoubtedly contribute to the education system and broader economic efficiency.

The Project also had a catalytic impact on mobilizing additional funding towards its
Development Objectives. As mentioned in Section 2.2, for several reasons, Project costs


                                              15
exceeded original estimates. The State Government was nevertheless still able to carry
out most of the originally planned activities under Component 1 with resources from
FUNDESCOLA and even expand some activities under Components 2 and 3, towards its
Development Objectives, by leveraging other sources of funding.

On an institutional level, most of the activities described under Objective 3 in Section 3.2
are expected to have a positive, efficiency-enhancing impact on the performance of the
State Government more broadly and of SEE, and consequently of the education system in
Pernambuco. Final Project costs, by component, are provided in Annex 1.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Project's Overall Outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Although the Project
did face implementation issues, and changes in its operating environment following a
change in administration in 2007, it nevertheless produced important education sector
impacts in a State that had previously struggled with improving performance. The
continued relevance of the Project's development objectives is very high, perhaps even
more so with the State Government's strengthened commitment to efficiency enhancing
objectives for the public sector, together with the effective delivery of public services,
especially education. Despite the issues it faced in implementation, it made a marked
impact at both fundamental and secondary levels on educational achievement, age-grade
distortion, and approval rates in both State and Municipal schools. Implementation of
activities under the Project's Component 1, Improving the Quality and Efficiency of State
Schools, and Component 2, Improving System Efficiency and Effectiveness and
Expanding Inclusion, represented by far the largest share of Project costs (Annex 1). The
activities under these two components were directly responsible for the results towards
the Project's objective of Improving the Quality, Efficiency and Inclusiveness of the
Public Education System, which was the objective that witnessed the greatest progress
towards expected outcomes. Despite any shortcomings, these results should have a
positive impact on sector efficiency, as described above. Finally, several originally
programmed activities were implemented with non-Project financing due mostly to
increased costs, making attribution of outcomes difficult. Nevertheless, the Project had
an important role in providing a framework for coordinating their implementation.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project's impact on building institutional capacity within SEE was rather limited
during implementation of the Project as a result of its institutional arrangements that
contemplated coordination through the PCU. It did, however, support the putting in place
and strengthening of effective processes for improving education performance, that have
now post-Project become routine aspects of SEE's business processes and efforts to
expand and improve both state and municipal education in the State. The PDE/PME
process and instrument turned out to be an effective instrument for improving school



                                            16
planning, and promoting school autonomy. It has also contributed to increasing
participation of the community in school decisions, and in improved results. Basic
standards have become a policy of SEE with respect to the construction of schools.
Improved schools have resulted in increased levels of satisfaction among students,
teachers, and communities alike. SEE has created and regulated the guidelines on
cooperation (Regime de Colaboraçaõ), that establishes the terms of partnership between
SEE and the SMEs. It includes the main activities that are to be agreed with the
municipalities to improve the quality of teaching in municipal schools. SEE has also put
in place a system of bonuses, that provide a financial incentive to teachers in state schools
that are able to comply with their stated goals and objectives, and to results in the Indice
de Desenvolvimente da Educacao de Pernambuco (IDEPE). Finally, with the new
Administration's renewed emphasis for public sector reform, SEE's legal structure,
policies and procedures were modified through the change to the institution's regulation
in 2007.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible

The Risk to Development Outcome is considered Negligible. The Project supported the
State Government in its initial push towards promoting greater school autonomy, the
putting in place of programs aimed at increasing quality and inclusion, and pursuing
efforts to modernize SEE. There has been widespread stakeholder support for the
activities at the school level, and the new Administration has adopted the models
supported by the Project, while building on the Project's achievements to place greater
emphasis on sustainability through strengthened efforts at institutional strengthening,
efficiency and modernization. The follow-on Education Results and Accountability
Project should work to ensure that the results achieved under the Project are consolidated
and internalized within SEE.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank's Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
The Project's preparation was thorough, and its design involved a new model of
addressing both sector issues and broader public sector management issues that affected
performance in the sector. It was based on extensive sector work, was responsive to the
Federal and State Governments' priorities and to the Bank's country assistance
objectives, and incorporated lessons from the Bank's extensive experience in Brazil's
education sector. The Project's framework for safeguards, especially its approach to
including indigenous and Quilombola issues, was well designed.




                                             17
However, there were a few areas where the Project's design was not consistent with the
objectives it sought to achieve, and that came to affect its implementation throughout. In
part to respond to the institutional capacity constraints that the Project sought to address,
coordination depended on a PCU that was distanced from SEE's main operating units.
While it is understandable why the Bank supported this PCU structure, and while it
served to put in place many of the sector policies and approaches the Project supported,
the PCU suffered from many constraints throughout implementation (especially staffing),
and it did little to ensure that the capacity building provided by the Bank during
supervision was eventually mainstreamed in SEE.

The Project's risk assessment did not identify the biggest risk that impacted the Project's
implementation---the effect of the change in the State's Administration. Although there
is little that can be done to mitigate a risk such as this, highlighting it could possibly have
served to prepare the Government and the Bank in advance for addressing issues that
arose.

The Project was subject to a Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA7) in fiscal year 2004-
2005. The QEA assigned a rating of 2 (Satisfactory), for all aspects in the assessment
with the exception of Implementation Arrangements for which it assigned a rating of 3
(Moderately Satisfactory). The lower rating for Implementation Arrangements was based
on low ratings for "prospects for completing the project within the prescribed time-
frame" (4, Moderately Unsatisfactory) and for "appropriateness of arrangements for
monitoring adverse poverty and social aspects" (3, Moderately Satisfactory).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. The Bank's supervision effort
focused almost continuously on keeping Project implementation on track, and addressing
issues that resulted in part from its institutional design mentioned above, and in part
through the change in administration and new approaches to public sector reform.
Supervision was focused and well targeted. The Bank's supervision team was proactive,
highlighting and addressing issues as and when they arose (e.g., procurement, issues with
indigenous schools not being able to handle funding directly, change in priorities by the
new Administration). The Bank also devoted a significant effort to trying to address the
PCU's staffing and capacity constraints through a program of repeated and intensive
hands-on training by Bank specialists, starting with a comprehensive Project Launch
Workshop. The Bank's Task Managers needed to work closely with not only the Bank's
fiduciary and safeguard specialists, but also to ensure the involvement of public sector
management specialists to supervise the Project's Component 3, which at times became
difficult, especially following the change in Administration when their involvement
became all the more relevant to the Project. Before and after the government transition,
the Bank intensified supervision: the Bank had three supervision missions in 2007, and
several visits from an educational specialist, as well as a visit from the PCU to the Bank's
Country Office in Brasilia.




                                              18
The Bank's supervision team also maintained a very strong focus on results. This was
apparent not only through the intensive follow-up to issues that arose with respect to the
Project's baseline and monitoring, but also through parallel efforts that the Task Manager
intermediated to bring in specialized inputs that could help improve results. In 2007, the
Bank organized training for technical staff in SEE on Classroom Observation methods
aimed as better preparing teachers to identify different methodologies of teaching-
learning practices and their results. Later, the Bank brought in specialists on policies
aimed at improving education quality through teacher incentives, and worked closely
with the State Government on the development of a performance bonus (Bonus de
Desempenho Educacional).

The Project's supervision reporting was comprehensive, candid as to issues and proposed
actions to address them, and realistic in Project ratings throughout implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Despite shortcomings
during preparation, the Bank's supervision addressed these to support effective
implementation. Despite the issues it faced, the Project's implementation was completed
with only a short, six-month extension that allowed it to meet important objectives. The
Bank's supervision team also worked closely with the preparation team of the new
Results and Accountability Project to ensure not only the continuation but also an
intensification of the activities supported by the Project.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government Performance--the performance of the State of Pernambuco--is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. Despite strong commitment, implementation quickly ran into
problems, accelerating after the change in Government administration. Despite a sharing
of the Project's objectives, and an intensification of public sector reform activities, the
Government financed these through alternative sources of funding, in part because of the
time-consuming process that would have been required to secure Government approval
of a Project Restructuring. More importantly, however, the State Government wanted to
approach public sector reform from a multi-sectoral perspective. Many of the activities
that were to be carried out by SEE now were being carried out in all sectors, and the
Government sought a coordinated and consistent approach across all sectors. As a result,
many of the remaining Project activities in support of SEE's reform under the Project
became redundant. The Project continued to focus on education sector priorities, even
though it did not continue to finance the new Administration's broader institutional
reform objectives. Although PCU staffing was ultimately SEE's responsibility, the
Government was slow to intercede to help address the persistent capacity constraints that
faced the Project. This was in part due to the transition in administration and then later
due to the Government's renewed approach to public sector management that envisaged



                                            19
an overall strengthening of SEE, as supported under the Education Results and
Accountability Project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Implementing Agency's performance is also rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
PCU maintained its commitment to the PDOs, worked intensively towards them, but
struggled throughout implementation with staffing shortages that resulted in it constantly
appearing to perform without resources, in this case qualified staff. The unit sought out
Bank assistance, and welcomed it when it was made available. But the continued
turnover and appointment of, at times, unqualified staff made for difficult
implementation. Despite its shortcomings, however, the PCU played an instrumental role
in sustaining implementation of key activities, especially under Component 1, during the
transition in the State's administration. Implementation issues were always addressed by
SEE, but often took several visits by the Bank, and recourse to alternative strategies such
as receiving supervision assistance by different specialists, before they were resolved
(e.g., monitoring indicators, procurement issues).         The Implementing Agency's
weaknesses resulted in the need for intensive Bank supervision, to sustain progress in
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Borrower's Overall Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based on similar
ratings for Borrower and Implementing Agency Performance.

6. Lessons Learned

Education Issues
¾       A need for flexibility in basic standards for education infrastructure. The
Minimum Operational Standards (MOS) for schools in the FUNDESCOLA Program
have proven to be too high and, in some cases, could preclude states and municipalities
from achieving MOS given funding and other constraints. Under the Project, SEE
revised and implemented a less ambitious MOS. Basic operational standards were
defined in terms of the minimum inputs required in a classroom for students to learn,
according to its needs and financial capacity, including for example library books and
student materials, school furniture, and physical facilities.
¾       Special Accelerated Classes Programs show promising results. Other states in
Brazil had implemented accelerated classes targeting overage students with successful
results in terms of reducing age-grade distortion caused by high repetition rates and late
entrance. Now, the preliminary results of the Accelerated Classes Program implemented
under the Project provide further evidence, albeit preliminary, to support these programs.
Results show a decrease in age-grade distortion in the early years of fundamental
education from 56 percent in 2004 to 51.4 percent in 2006, and in secondary education
from 71.6 percent in 2004 to 69.7 percent in 2006.



                                            20
Project Design Issues:
¾       The Project's heavy reliance on a sizable PCU, largely de-linked from the rest of
SEE and operating to a certain extent outside the framework of the Secretariat, is
inadequate for building institutional capacity in its main directorates, and this is
especially important for a project that has a public sector management objective.
¾       While recognizing the difficulties of selecting data sources for project level
indicators for monitoring progress, especially in areas such as student learning
achievement, the use of state- and municipal-level indicators makes it difficult to measure
the results that are attributable directly to Project-financed interventions.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

The Borrower has reviewed the ICR and authorized publication of the document, subject
to the following changes which were made: (a) update government acronyms: SEDUC,
SEPLAN, SARE, GERE should read SEE, SEPLAG, SAD, and GRE, (b) in Section 3.2,
implementation of e-Government has already happened with Government resources and
an expansion of the program has been scheduled, and (c) in Annex 2, the SEE has already
carried out an evaluation of budget management and an expenditure review of the
education sector has been planned.

1.   Introduction

This document presents the assessment of the Secretariat of Education of Pernambuco
(SEE) of the preparation, design, and implementation of the Pernambuco Integrated
Development: Education Quality Improvement Project (Programa Educação de
Qualidade­EDUQ), financed with resources from the Government of Pernambuco and
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) through Loan
Agreement 4754­BR.

2.   The Project

2.1 Background
The Pernambuco Integrated Development: Education Quality Improvement Project
(Programa Educação de Qualidade­EDUQ), is a project of the Secretariat of Education
of the State of Pernambuco (SEE) financed by the Government of the State of
Pernambuco and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ­ IBRD,
with the guarantee of the Federative Republic of Brazil, through Loan Agreement number
4754­BR, in the equivalent value of US$31,500,000.00 (thirty-one million and five
hundred thousand dollars), signed on June 27, 2005.

The period of implementation of the Project was planned to last four years, from August
1, 2005 through December 2009. On September 17, 2009, the Government requested
resource reallocation and extension of time to complete the project, which was approved
by COFIEX's on November 18, 2009. The closing of the project happened on June 30,
2010, with a grace period until December 31, 2010.

2.2. Context
In the late 1990's and early 2000's, the Government of Pernambuco, recognizing its tight
fiscal situation and the poor quality of its public services, established an ambitious
agenda of reforms, aiming to control the cost of public services and to improve
efficiency in the delivery of these services. The vision and priorities of the state reform
were outlined in the Master Plan of the State Reform (Plano Diretor da Reforma do
Estado ­ PDRE) of January 2000.

To finance the preparation of the project, the State of Pernambuco received a Japanese
grant, in the amount of US$243,200. With this grant, the Secretariat of Education carried
out a diagnosis of priority areas that would be addressed by the project:
(i)     Low coverage, particularly in secondary education and exclusion of the most
vulnerable population. Coverage in the primary level was not universal; it was only
90%, which is below the national average of 94%. Approximately 180,000 students,
between the ages of 7 to 14 years of age, were outside the school system and there were
various cities with lower enrollment rates than the State's average. Large numbers of
children with special needs as well as minorities (the indigenous and quilombolas



                                            35
children) were disproportionally excluded from the formal educational system. In
addition, a large number of adolescents and young adults were not enrolled or
participating in the job market.
(ii)    High rates of repetition and large age-grade distortion. Other educational
indicators also revealed the weaknesses of the education system, such as the high rate of
retention and large distortion in age-grade. Nearly half of all students registered in
primary education were, at least, one year older than the appropriate age for their school
level, well above the national average of 39% and only slightly below that of the
Northeast (57%).
(iii) Lower performance by students and inadequate qualification of teachers: In
1999, only three states in Brazil were below Pernambuco in Mathematics and Portuguese
in the SAEB assessment. SAEPE (Sistema de Avaliação da Educação do Estado de
Pernambuco) Pernambuco's Student Assessment System, carried out assessments in
2000 and 2002 that also showed the low performance of students in Pernambuco: 37% of
the students of 2nd graders could not read a simple text and no student of the 4th grade
was capable of answering at least half of the questions in the exam. The 2002 exam
included students in municipal schools, whose performance was similar to that of state
students, also with low results. Regarding the situation of teachers, despite high
investments in in-service training, there was no evidence that this training had had any
impact on the improvement of student performance.
(iv)    Inadequate school infrastructure. It was estimated that 40% of the physical
infrastructure of the schools in Pernambuco were inadequate, with some of them
functioning in rented buildings and the majority without appropriate furniture and
equipment. The promise of minimum quality standards for the schools of Pernambuco
was an important challenge to be faced by the Government. The schools that the
indigenous and quilombola communities attended had an even more deficient structure,
without electricity, drinking water, or restrooms.

2.3.Objectives and indicators
2.3.1 Objectives
The objectives of the Pernambuco Integrated Development Project were to: (a) improve
quality, efficiency, and inclusion of the public system; (b) modernize and strengthen the
administrative, financial and managerial capacity of the Secretariat of Education, in order
to establish policies and levels of action for the sector and to promote a public education
efficiently; and (c) support the general effort of modernization of the State through
interventions to be made in the Secretariat of Education and replicated in other state
institutions. These objectives were not modified and continued to be pertinent throughout
the implementation of the project.

2.3.2 Key Project development indicators3




3 It is mportant to highlight that the baselines were calculated as estimates. They were updated in 2004, applying official data from
      i
INEP and IBGE. The original and revised baselines (2004) can be checked in Annex 1 of the full document.




                                                                36
        The key indicators of performance of the Project were:
·   Increase in the completion rate of 4th graders from 81% to 86%.
·   Increase in the completion rate of primary education from 54% to 60%.
·   Increase in the approval rate of primary education from 69% to 78%.
·   Increase in the student's grades in the assessment test (SAEB) at State schools to
    reach the national average.
·   Decrease in the percentage of students with age grade distortion in primary education
    from 53% to 46%.
·   Decrease in the percentage of students with age grade distortion in secondary
    education from 68% to 60%.
·   Decrease in the repetition rates in the primary cycle at state schools from 31% to
    23%.
·   Increase in the rates of approval of the indigenous schools and of the quilombolas
    schools from 60% to 70%.
·   Decrease in the rates of evasion in the primary cycle at indigenous schools and in
    quilombolas from 13% for 10%.
·   Conclusion of the census of SEDUC staff members that are part of the staff of the
    State and design of a civil service strategy.
·   Compliance by SEDUC of the Law of Fiscal Responsibility (LFR) with regards to the
    ceiling of salary expenditures (60% net) each year, until 2007.

2.4 Main Beneficiaries
2.4.1 Original beneficiaries
The original beneficiaries of the project would be the primary and secondary school
students, registered at state and municipal schools and those who would be registered
until the end of the Project. There were approximately 2 million students registered in
elementary and high school, 1.6 million in elementary school and 360 thousand in
secondary schools. Approximately 1.17 million in the age range from zero to six years
old would enter school in the next five years. The assumption was that the students would
benefited from well trained teachers, improved infrastructure, adequate educational
material, more responsible and better administered schools and with more resources.

2.4.2 Present Beneficiaries
According to the data of the school census, enrollment in state schools, showed a
decrease of 30%. This was already expected due to the strong incentive to municipalize
primary education, particularly in 1998, with the introduction of federal policies such as
FUNDEF (later replaced by FUNDEB). On the other hand, an increase of 10% was
confirmed in the enrollments of the state's secondary education schools.

It should also be pointed out that the decrease in enrollments between 2006 and 2007
occurred mainly as a result of a change in the methodology of the school census. Since
2005, the Project benefited more than 2 million students of the municipal and state
networks, as well as more than 50 thousand teachers of the whole state and municipal
networks, through the training programs performed by the "Se Liga", "Acelera",
"Travessia" and "Alfabetizar com Sucesso" Programs. Approximately six thousand staff



                                           37
members, among them management staff, also benefited from the Project, through
seminars and training.

3.     Changes during Project Implementation

                                                     The key modifications that occurred
There were no changes in the original Project's objectives.
during the implementation of the Project are listed below:

3.1 Key indicators:
During project preparation, data from INEP were used to define indicators [targets].
However, since 2003, INEP has changed the methodology of the School Census;
modifying some data and dropping some. During Bank mission carried out in September
2009, that the SEE, based on the new official data of INEP, would revise the project's
intermediary and development indicators [targets].

3.2 Reallocations, extensions and other amendments to the Loan Agreement:
3.2.1. First Reallocation of Resources.
On April 08, 2009, the first resource reallocation among categories of expenditure was
approved by COFIEX (GTEC).

3.2.2 Second Reallocation of Resources and Amendment to the Loan Agreement.
On November 18, 2009, all activities that were not envisaged in the original Loan
Agreement were incorporated through the first amendment to the Loan Agreement. It
included: (i) a reallocation of resources among categories of expenditures, and (ii) an extension of Loan
closing.

4.     Main factors impacting project implementation

4.1 Preparation, Design, and suggestions to guarantee project quality during
implementation.
Considerations on the design of the project­The design of the project was considered
extremely appropriate to reverse deficiencies of the education system of Pernambuco.
The analyses carried out during preparation were extensive and incorporated many
lessons from other ongoing or already closed Bank projects in Brazil (Minas Gerais,
Bahia, Parana) and abroad. Specifically, the experiences of FUNDESCOLA were
incorporated into the design of the project.

Initial recommendations to guarantee the quality of implementation - For a good
Project implementation, there were specific recommendations made in the following
areas: (i) improvement in the fiduciary activities (Procurement, Financial Management);
(ii) guidelines for the School Councils4 ­ an Operational Manual containing details for
the creation of these institutions); (iii) technical aspects of the Project (Special Education,
Analysis of Public Spending, School Development Plan (PDE) and School Improvement
Project (PME).

    To receive the resources, the school should legally constitute its Executing Unit



                                                   38
Risk assessment- During project preparation several risk factors were considered
"moderate". This assessment was, most of the time, consistent with what happened
during implementation. The same was not the case when the assessment indicated a
"Substantial" risk. For instance, the PAD signaled as of "Substantial risk" the potential
opposition that could have been imposed by teachers rejecting the preparatory university
course. In fact no opposition was registered. Same with the potential opposition by
Municipal Secretariats to the direct transfer of resources to schools. The transfer program
suffered all kinds of difficulties, particularly legal constraints, but not from opposition
from the Municipal Secretariats. There was lack of support from the municipalities, but
actions from the SEE for instance to help schools directly with the administrative needs
and to train them mitigated, in part, the lack of municipal support. The little experience of
the SEE in the implementation of internationally financed projects ­ particularly in
fiduciary aspects ­ made the risk assessment related to these items high. A risk, which
was not identified during project preparation, was the potential impact of a change in
government administration. In 2007, a new administration introduced deep changes in its
public sector management model as well as in the staffing of the SEE as well as of the
PCU. Despite the changed directions introduced by the new administration, Project
objectives and activities were considered highly relevant. However, the administrative
changes caused a significant impact on the pace of project implementation and in the
achievement of many targets. Technical assistance provided by the Bank was essential
during this transition period as was the Bank's support in making the new administration
own the project prepared by the previous administration.

Key difficulties faced by the project during implementation
Among the many difficulties experienced during implementation, the following ones are
considered the most important by the implementation team: (i) delays in the formation of
the initial implementation team and training in Bank procedures, (ii) changes brought
about by the administration change; (iii) sharp devaluation of the dollar, from R$ 2.9 to
US$1 during the first year to 1.68 to US$1 at project completion, leading to
cuts/reductions in activities ; (iv) restructuring of the team starting in 2007; (v) complete
paralysis in the project for six months in 2008/2009 due disagreements with the Bank's
fiduciary team in regards to interpretation of civil works procurement guidelines.

Bank's technical assistance during Project implementation
In addition to the scheduled supervision missions and regular training offered by the
Bank to support the day to day Project implementation, the Bank offered technical
assistance to support various education policies of the SEE, particularly those aimed at
improvement of education quality. For instance, in 2007, SEE technical staff was trained
in classroom observation aimed at identifying teaching methods of teachers. In
2009/2010, the Bank conducted discussions with the SEE on policies to improve
teachers' performance and incentives to improve performance. This led to the
participation of the Bank in the design of the Performance Bonus (Bônus de Desempenho
Educacional - BDE), a program of incentives based on performance.

4.3 Monitoring and Evaluation



                                             39
The Project's M&E was structured with the aim to monitor the Project's indicators,
including development and intermediate indicators. Tables of physical monitoring, with
information received from executing agencies and compiled by the PCU were used in
activity monitoring. To monitor Project indicators, several sources of information were
utilized, including official sources from INEP, SAEPE, SAEB e information processed
by the SEE specifically for the Project as well as Bank supervision reports.

4.4. Safeguards and fiduciary issues
a) Safeguards policy. The indigenous safeguard policy of the Bank was triggered and
there was a need to prepare an Indigenous Development Plan. The activities in this plan
were carried out with Bank as well as SEE funding.

b) Fiduciary issues
(i) Audits and financial management. The Project was audited four times, in the years
2005-2006, 2007, 2008 e 2009-2010. Audits were carried out by independent external
auditors approved by the Bank., There were also some audits of internal control and by
the State Accounts Tribunal (Tribunal de Contas do Estado - TCE), which audited years
2005, 2006, 2007. For the 2008 and 2009 audits, account statements were delivered to
the TCE on time and the Project is still awaiting final approval.
(ii) Procurement. Annual Procurement Plans were submitted to the Bank, detailing all
procurement activity to be carried out and which reflected the actual needs of the Project
and reflected the capacity improvements made in the area of procurement. All
procurement processes were duly reviewed by the Bank's procurement specialists.
During Project implementation, the procurement function of the PUC was re-evaluated
and the procurement limits were raised (e.g., e-procurement).

5.   Assessment of results

5.1. Relevance of objectives and implementation
Relevance of Project objectives. The Project development objectives remained
extremely relevant for the education situation of Pernambuco. The new administration
that took over in 2007, considered the Project objectives fully relevant, despite the fact
that it introduced new management priorities for the state and sector.

 Project implementation. Most of the activities and programs supported by the Project
were of great relevance and appropriate to solve the problems identified during Project
preparation. While the Project met and surpassed targets in various components,
Component 3 ­ Support to State Reform--was the one most impacted by the change in
administration, not only because of its complexity but also because of the need for
continuous dialogue among all the involved agencies. In addition, the government
adopted a new model of managing by results and this led to significant changes in the
SEE operating model. This new model received technical assistance from new
government partners under the coordination of the new Planning and Management
Secretariat (Secretaria de Planejamento e Gestão ­ SEPLAG) which controlled the
reform activities previously carried out by the Secretariat of Administration and Reform
(Secretaria de Administração e Reforma). Many of the Project's Public Sector



                                           40
Management activities began to be carried out outside the Project. An amendment to the
Loan Agreement to incorporate these changes was prepared and approved by the Bank
and the federal government.

5.2 Project development objectives and results by component.
Results obtained from the student assessment system, measured through Prova
Brasil/SAEB, and SAEPE and census results demonstrate a gradual but persistent
improvement in the educational system. In the beginning the state was among the four
lowest states in educational results. Results of the 2009 IDEB confirm this improvement
trajectory in state school performance in both primary and secondary schools. The 2009
SAEB de 2009, for the initial years of primary education in state schools surpassed the
average of the Northeast region. IDEB results in the final years of primary education and
in secondary education in Pernambuco are still below the Brazilian average. This
justifies the decision by the state to continue to prioritize education and to continue to
pursue improvements in the quality of education and in support to state reform.

This improvement in student performance is also evident when we analyze results for
state schools against the average for state schools in Brazil. Pernambuco is following the
national improvement trajectory and is approaching the Brazilian average.
.
It should be noted that Pernambuco surpassed all targets set by MEC for primary and
secondary education. In 2007, for instance, the state schools of Pernambuco had already
reached the 2009 target for the initial grades of primary education. In 2009, 141
municipalities (77% of the total) fulfilled or surpassed the targets set by MEC for the
initial years of primary education and126 municipalities (68%) met the targets for the last
grades of primary education.

Regarding inclusion objectives for indigenous and quilombolas minorities, enrollment of
these groups experienced a 20% growth for indigenous students and 68% for quilombolas
students relative to 2007. Repetition and dropout numbers also diminished significantly
in these groups.

5.3. Analysis of Project results by component

COMPONENT 1 ­ Improving quality and efficiency of state schools
1.1 Strengthening school autonomy. The original targets for the activity of Training
in School Managers (6293) and Members of School Councils (7896) were not reached;
only a bit over one-third and one-fourth of the targets were reached, respectively.

PME targets were also not reached; of the originally estimated 1600 PMEs, the Project
only implemented 1239 with resources from EDUQ and FUNDESCOLA. Some of the
PME resources were redirected to other activities; mostly, resources were simply
insufficient to carry out activities due to cost underestimates and exchange rate
devaluation.

1.2 Ensuring Minimum Operational Standards



                                            41
 The Project met and surpassed the targets established for this subcomponent. A
minimum operational standard was a policy fully adopted by the SEE. Among benefits,
the SEE cites student and teachers' happiness to work in a fully operational school.

1.3 Improving Teachers' Qualifications. In coordination with the University of
Pernambuco, the SEE is carrying out a program to certify teachers in higher education
under a program named (Programa Especial de Graduação em Pedagogia-
PROGRAPE). By end-2010, some 521 teachers will have obtained this certification.

COMPONENT 2 ­ Improving System Efficiency and Effectiveness and Expanding
Inclusion

2.1 Enhancing Educational Policies and Performance. The following studies were
carried out: (i) Strengthening Educational Policies (ii) Education Demand Simulations for
the Next 10 Years; (iii) Development of a Strategy for in-service Training for Teachers,
(iv) Currículum for Initial Teacher Training and Teacher Accreditation; ( v)Proposal to
Strengthen Municipal Schools; (vi) Consolidation of SAEPE and Improvements in the
Information System and other Management Instruments. The new SAEPE, 2008 version
is an outside student assessment for public schools carried out by the Centro de Políticas
Públicas e Avaliação da Educação (CAED), an institution of the Federal University of
Juiz de Fora. This assessment system, evaluates student performance in Portuguese and
mathematics. All these studies and TA had a significative impact in the improvement of
education quality of Pernambuco, as evidenced by results in the Prova Brasil, SAEB e
IDEB as well as in the SAEPE results.

 2.2 Supporting Educational Programs to Increase Quality and Inclusion
a)       Implementation of acceleration classes; targets and results. (i) "Se Liga" and
"Acelera" programs: met about 84% of the targets originally set for students of the 1ª to
4ª grade; (ii) "Alfabetizar com Sucesso" Program: this program reached 511% of the
original target for teachers trained; (iii): Travessia"Program: resources for this program
for students of 5th to 8th grade were transferred to secondary education and had an
impact on the results in secondary education (iv) Apoio às escolas municipais: Targets
relative to PMEs/PDEs prepared were only partially reached; 25.9% of the target of 1200
schools was met; (v) Youth at Risk Program: reached its targets with technical training
carried out throughout the state in construction, nutrition, telephone systems, and
clothing, depending on the needs of each region. At the end, 605 students benefited from
this activity.
.
COMPONENT 3 ­ Supporting the State Reform

3.1 Supporting the Implementation of the State Reform. This sub-component was the
one most directly impacted by the change in state strategy for public sector management.
Many of the programmed activities were cut, redesigned or simply financed by other
sources. The following activities were financed by the Project: implementation of the
Modernization of Management Program, implementation of the e-Government Program;




                                           42
model of M&E of the public expenditures policy; development of studies and
conceptualization of a public complaint system with acquisition of software.

3.2 Strengthening and Modernizing Education Management. This sub-component, as
previously mentioned, was also directly affected by the change in administration. The
following activities were financed by the Project: Implementation of the technology
platform to support schools; MIS implementation; SIGP (System of Information and
Management) implementation. Reform of the SEE was also financed under this sub-
component including civil works, furniture and equipment. The state government
financed with its own funds: development of legal structure for the SEE, development of
policies and processes for the SEE; improvements in budget management; development
of civil service plan for the SEE; new career plan including performance based salaries;
construction of the new SEE building.
.
COMPONENT 4 ­ Project Management
Activities financed under the Project management Component: Purchase of
equipment, furniture, tickets, and services needed for the regular function of the PCU.
The following consulting services were contracted to benefit the PCU: consultancies for
translations of documents, consultancies in international biddings, consultancies in
financial management, consultancies in M&E; consultancies for audits, and general
training of the entire PCU team.

6.   Lessons learned

There were many lessons learned through this Project, most of which are now being
incorporated into the SEE. We underscore the lessons from adopting Bank norms and
fiduciary procedures as well as the education-technical lessons passed on to the SEE.
The following are the key lessons learned during the Project implementation.

6.1 The importance of acceleration programs to reduce the age-grade distortion and
to improve system efficiency. These programs have demonstrated an enormous capacity
to attract students with age-relevant curricula (it is a voluntary program and it needs to
find ways to attract students). The following lessons may be derived: (i) the pedagogic
work that needs to be developed must take a holistic view of the student; (ii) lesson
planning is fundamental for learning results; (iii) the methodology must include an active
participation of students in the construction of knowledge through attractive lessons and
relevant content; (iv) acceleration programs must coordinate well with the regular
programs to avoid the development of new cohorts of students with age-grade distortion
as well as to allow the student from an acceleration program to return to the regular
classroom to continue his/her studies; (v) continuous education for teachers is
fundamental in the learning-teaching process; (vi) student monitoring is extremely
important so that required corrections are effected rapidly and honed to the learning
problems identified; (vii) the coordination among teacher, supervisor, municipal
coordinator, regional coordinator and SEE central team is fundamental for the success of
the program.




                                           43
6.2 Use of the municipal PDEs/PMEs to improve school management. Among the
important lessons learned, we should highlight the need to perfect the use of PDEs/PMEs
in the following ways: (i) the Municipal Secretariats must single out for training, staff
which with sufficient background to absorb training, chosen purely on technical grounds;
(ii) it is necessary to have greater cooperation between staff in the state and in the
municipality so that support to the municipality is more appropriate. During
implementation it was observed that only after technical assistance was offered by the
SEE to the municipalities this activity was implemented satisfactorily; (iii) it is necessary
to have a more intense cooperation between the SEE and the municipality to ensure that
municipal secretaries become more involved with the PDE process; (iv) there must be
regular and systematic training of municipal staff regarding PDE methodology with more
workshops as part of the training program.

6.3 Direct participation by minorities is required in order to increase inclusion. The
architectural projects for the indigenous schools were discussed and approved by the
indigenous populations before construction began. With the acceptance of the
architectural model, the school became a reference point for the entire community and a
place for community meetings and other social events. The same inclusive process in
decision making was followed in the purchase of school materials and this led to
widespread acceptance of the culturally correct school kits purchased by the Project.

6.4 School construction. The adoption of clear criteria for monitoring reforms in Bank
financed works led to substantial savings by avoiding work extensions which usually
greatly increase the costs of infrastructure. This was welcomed and easily absorbed and
disseminated within the SEE. There were also important lessons regarding respect for
environmental norms during construction and the fitting of projects to the real needs of
the school community.

6.5 Importance to integrate the PCU with the regular functions of the SEE. The
creation of a PCU brought immense benefits to the Project, as it facilitated
implementation with staff completely focused on the Project. This is especially crucial in
a complex secretariat such as the SEE. On the other hand, if PCU management is not
conscious of the need to serve the SEE, the PCU might become insulated and isolated and
this will compromise Project execution. EDUQ's PCU evolved to show the importance of
the integration with SEE.

6.6 Procurement. The adoption of standard bidding documents, obtaining the necessary
No Objections to the bidding documents once completed, preparation of evaluation
reports prior to adjudication, and contracting are all part of a continuous communication
process with the Bank which helps avoid formal mistakes which might damage the entire
competitive process.

6.7 Contract monitoring. We have learned that the procurement process is not the end
but the beginning; the systematic monitoring of the entire process until delivery of goods
and execution of services is vital to avoid the non-observance of any contractual clauses
thus assuring the good utilization of project funds.



                                             44
6.8 Monitoring and evaluation. The Project monitoring system improved with the
implementation of the Project via progress reports and other reports prompted by Bank
requests for analysis. Regarding Project indicators, it was noted: (i) the need to have well
defined indicators; (ii) need of good measuring instruments; (iii) need to have regular
student assessments to better evaluate student performance and corrective actions by the
SEE as well as to provide the inputs needed for the teacher performance bonus program.

6.9 Financial management. These are the key financial management learning: (i) need
to control the individual resources from Bank and State sources to be able to monitor
expenditures and fulfill the Loan Agreement stipulations for contract financing; (ii) the
learning from Bank specialists re IFR preparations, financial missions, preparation of
disbursement documents; (iii) the migration during implementation from an integrated
financial administration system for states and municipalities to the e-fisco; have enriched
the reports prepared for the Bank; (iv) the daily registry of information in the state's
accounting management system (SIIG) required by the Bank, even though is a lot of
work for the entire financial team, does allow a managerial monitoring of project
information.

6.10 Asset control. The SEE, following the advice of audits carried out early in the
Project's life, which flagged problems in the delivery and receipt of materials and goods,
as well as storage of goods, led to a series of actions aimed at improvement of internal
controls and storage. Now it is possible to monitor, on line, all assets acquired by the
SEE under its various programs.

7.   Final considerations

To the Government of the State, in general, the Project has reached its objectives, not
only by reaching its development indicators but by also carrying out most of the priority
activities planned. We can observe a gradual and constant improvement in the
performance of students in the various grades. It was noted that, during implementation,
EDUQ carried out a real change in internal procedures which are having an impact on the
SEE, with many of these changes now completely inserted in the SEE.

The Project has contributed substantially to the improvement in student performance and
to the dialogue on education quality policies. It is specially noted, the contribution of the
acceleration programs in the improvement in performance in primary education. The
acceleration program has offered learning opportunities to those that, for various reasons,
did not study at the right age. The massive investment in teacher training, with adequate
learning content was another major Project contribution and surely contributed to the
observed results.

The adoption of minimum standards for schools came to complement the effort in the
improvement of school infrastructure so as to guarantee conditions for the operation of
schools so as to contribute to the improvement of quality of life of students and teachers
and quality of educational services.



                                             45
The improvement in the educational level of Pernambuco was done in a gradual but
continuous way during Project implementation. And that this information is even
available is testimony to the importance of EDUQ in the consolidation of the student
assessment system of Pernambuco (SAEPE). SAEPE and IDEPE are important reference
points in the formation of a culture of evaluation in Pernambuco.

We must also register the importance of EDUQ in the conceptualization of a technology
model for the schools of Pernambuco. EDUQ also had a relevant role in the
modernization of the SEE via the establishment of a technology platform to provide
support to the schools. The use of technology has been critical in the improvement of
communications and monitoring in the SEE.

The Project has become to the Government, and in particular to the SEE, an important
experience in the dialogue on educational issues, bringing new knowledge to face the
educational problems still facing us and that might be solved by the continuity of actions
in the coming projects and programs of the SEE.
