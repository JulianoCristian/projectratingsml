    1.1. Context at Appraisal

The period to be covered in the original three credit DPC series was mid-2006 to mid-
2008. By the approval of DPC 2 the closing date of DPC 3 had slipped to mid-2009.
However, the DPC series ended after DPC 2, as the security situation in the province
precluded a third DPC.

These operations were preceded by a two credit Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC)
series. The third SAC credit was substituted by the DPC series. DPC 1 continued much
of the SAC focus and the upcoming SWAp builds upon DPC 2.

Overview

The first decade of the new millennium has been tumultuous for Pakistan and the
North West Frontier Province (NWFP). Early in the decade, Pakistan's development
record improved and growth from 2003/4 through 2006/7 averaged 7.3 percent annually.
Because over 90 percent of provincial funding comes from the central government, the
provinces benefitted directly from Pakistan's strong economic performance. In FY05/6,
owing primarily to a devastating earthquake (see Box), growth dipped to 3.8 percent but
rebounded in FY06/7 to 6.3 percent. At the time of DPC 2 (May 2007), the province had
enjoyed five years of growth and improved governance. Nevertheless, in November,
2007 - six months after DPC 2 was approved by the Board ­ a state of emergency was
imposed and the Constitution suspended. In 2008, democracy was restored and a
president and new parliament were elected. However, a nascent insurgency took hold in
parts of Pakistan, including the NWFP increasing Pakistan's financial and security
burdens.      In addition, the worldwide recession hit Pakistan hard in 2008. The
deteriorating economic and political environment ultimately resulted in the cancelation of
the third credit in the programmatic series and substitution of DPC 3 by a multi-sector
SWAp which is currently under preparation.

                                  Box: The October 8, 2005 Earthquake

The 7.8 magnitude quake--considered one of the world's 15 most destructive--devastated about a quarter of
the geographical area of NWFP, affecting 3.5 million people or a sixth of the province's population. The
official death toll for all affected regions is 79,000. More than 22,500 people died in NWFP and twice this
number was injured. Nearly 4,000 schools were destroyed or damaged and thousands of school children
died. Extensive damage was caused to public infrastructure and private property. The loss in employment
and output in the affected districts of NWFP was estimated to be as high as 25 percent and overall impact
on the provincial GDP in 2005/6 about 3.6 percent. The replacement cost of the damage in NWFP alone
was estimated at $1.5 billion or 12 ½-13 percent of its GDP. The Federal Government stepped in and



                                                    1
shouldered the bulk of reconstruction but the drain on provincial revenue from reduced economic activity
and earthquake related expenditures created a huge NWFP fiscal burden.

The Bank responded swiftly with a PRSC Supplemental Financing of US$150 million, disbursed in
November, 2005. A damage and needs assessment was also undertaken. The quake and its aftermath
affected DPC1 preparation (Board date, April, 2006) and the credit's final configuration.

Poverty is widespread in NWFP. While there has been considerable progress since
2002 and social indicators have improved, the province is highly dependent upon the
Pakistan economic and political environment and upon Federal transfers. Reaching into
the districts to improve service delivery where poverty and social services lag is difficult,
and this has been exacerbated by the 2005 earthquake, a flagging economy and political
turmoil and insurgency. As a result, NWFP is the one of the Pakistan's poorer provinces.

Economic Developments

Pakistan's development record was strong for part of this decade. The economy
grew at 7.3 percent on average per year from 2003/4 through 2006/7, driven by solid
performances in the services and industrial sectors. The manufacturing sector grew fast
during the earlier part of the period, but slowed due to capacity, human capital and
infrastructure constraints. At the same time, the services sector, catering primarily to
domestic demand, grew steadily. The primary growth factors included a benign external
environment, availability of external financing, and political and macroeconomic
stability. External debt was renegotiated with the Paris Club creditors, debt was pre-paid
and there was a greater reliance on concessional borrowing for new loans and a
concomitant liberalization of the financial sector.       Growth translated into rising
household incomes, with per capital income growing to US$878 in 2006/7, an 18 percent
increase over US$742 two years earlier.

However, this growth was in part driven by heavy reliance on external financing
and on an expansionary fiscal stance, while revenues and savings remained
stagnant. A surge of capital inflows from abroad allowed the government to finance
rising fiscal deficits at a low cost. The consolidated fiscal deficit increased from 2.3
percent of GDP in 2003/4 to 4.3 percent by 2006/7 while domestic tax collection
remained weak.

The effect of expansionary fiscal policy was compounded by loose monetary policy,
which together led to a sharp increase in domestic demand from 2002/3 onwards.
Prior to 2003/4 economic growth had been sustained by external demand, thereafter it
was consumption-driven until 2006/7. Not surprisingly, strong growth in money supply
contributed to the acceleration of inflation from 3.5 percent in 2001/2 to 7.8 percent by
2006/7. Pakistan's savers continued to receive low returns, below the rate of inflation.
This discouraged private savings and fuelled asset-price bubbles as households sought
higher returns by buying shares and property.

With domestic demand outpacing domestic output, the current account deficit
reversed from a surplus of 4.8 percent of GDP in 2002/3 to a deficit of 4.9 percent


                                                   2
in 2006/7 which was financed by ample capital inflows. Reliance increasingly on
external financing left the economy vulnerable to external shocks. The IMF supported
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was concluded in December 2004 and
the Government of Pakistan did not request a successor IMF program. Between 2005
and October 2008 Pakistan was on a standard Article IV surveillance schedule which
concluded in December when the widening current account deficit was highlighted as the
economy's main vulnerability.

While not germane to DPC 1-2, the deterioration of the economic situation after
2006/7, as well as deterioration of security situation and insurgency, contributed to
the decision to abandon DPC 3 in favor of a different credit modality. Growth in
2006/7 fell from 6.8 percent to 5.8 percent in 2007/8 and the economy lurched towards a
melt-down. The sharp rise in international oil and food/commodity prices (specifically
wheat) accounted for 80 percent of the increase in fiscal deficit.      Internal political
turmoil and policy inaction gave rise to worsening fiscal and current account balances--
the latter increasing to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2007/8 compared to 4.8 percent in 2006/7.
Growth slowed and inflation increased. The fiscal deficit grew from 4.3 percent of GDP
in 2006/7 to 7.4 percent in 2007/8 and by end 2008 the State Bank of Pakistan foreign
exchange reserves had dropped to US$8.6 billion, a fall of about US$5.7 billion since
October 2007. Following intense negotiations, the IMF agreed in November to a 23
month Standby Agreement and US$7.6 billion loan approved in November, 2008 to
avoid a balance of payments crisis and default on foreign debt payments. The program
supports the macroeconomic stabilization program in 2008/9 and 2009/10 to reduce
inflation and the external current account deficit and to support the medium-term
macroeconomic framework.

Political Developments

Parliamentary elections were held in 2002 with the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-
Q) winning a plurality in the National Assembly followed by Pakistan's other
leading party, the Pakistan People's Party. On November 3, 2007, the president,
acting as the Chief of Army, imposed the state of emergency and suspended the
Constitution. At the end of November 2007, the president relinquished the Army Chief
post and took the oath as a civilian president for another five-year term. Soon thereafter
the emergency was lifted, and Parliamentary elections announced. One of the leading
candidates, the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated at the end of
December 2007. Parliamentary elections were held in February 2008 and widely
considered to be free and fair. The main opposition parties won the elections by a wide
margin, and a new coalition government comprising the leading political parties was
formed. The new President of Pakistan assumed office in September, 2008.

Human Development

In 2006, when DPC 1 was approved, the total population of Pakistan stood at nearly 160
million (65 percent urban) and the GNI per capita at US$770. Some 35 percent of the
population was below the national poverty line and life expectancy was 65 years.



                                            3
The NWFP is one of the poorer provinces in Pakistan. With approximately 14 percent
of total population, it also suffers from political, social and institutional problems that
exacerbate development. The SAC operations targeted critical health, education and
governance/financial management sectors. Despite progress, at the time of DPC 1, the
NWFP's sectoral performance still lagged the Sindh and Punjab (see Table 1) and was
further compromised by the severe earthquake and worsening political situation. With the
existing frameworks/predecessor multi-sector approach of two SAC programs, the multi-
sector approach has been continued to support the NWFP government's effort in the
long-term investment in human capital.

The World Bank's efforts--which included 2003 and 2006 country-wide PRSPs--and
its DPC 1 and 2 operations played an important catalytic roll in NWFP's improving
education and health status. It should be noted that the improvement from 2001/2 to
2006/7 has been significant across all indicators and in a relatively short time frame.
Progress in four of the indicators over the five year period was very impressive as
follows:

     ·    24 percent increase in net primary female enrollment ratio
     ·    40 percent increase in female literacy rate
     ·    109 percent in pre-natal consultations at health care facilities
     ·    4.5 times more post-natal consultations at facilities
                                                                                          (Source: PSLM 2001/02 and 2006/07)


These are generally not indicators that improve quickly as they depend upon a myriad of
cultural factors and service delivery. Nevertheless, and despite the earthquake and a
worsening political climate, the improvements are surprisingly good. The NWFP
government responded well to the Bank's intensive engagement during the period
including the PRSPs, Structural Adjustment Credits, emergency and other operations.

The PRSPs were instrumental in orienting the NWFP reform agenda providing
comparisons across provinces and sectors and highlighting areas of particular
weakness. In response to increase demand for improvement in the highlighted weak

areas, the NWFP introduced a range of policy reforms to expand primary school
attendance, especially among girls. It also innovated tuition free education, free
textbooks, improved facilities such as classrooms, sanitation and boundary walls for
security, and increased numbers of teachers. Important steps were taken to improve
access to primary healthcare including expanding preventive services such as TB
observation and therapy sessions (DOTS), maternal and child health services, and family
planning.    Education and health budgets were increased substantially from 2002
onwards.1


DPC Precursors: NWFP Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) Projects

The Program Document (PGD) for DPC 1 in its "Objective and Description" section
defines the DPC in the following terms:
       "...a transition operation that will complete the series of three IDA credits that
       assisted the government's fiscal reform agenda, and will also commence a new
       series of IDA support for the government's medium-term reform program".

There were two NWFP SACs. Both were single tranche, US$90 million operations.
The first SAC was approved in mid 2002 and the second three years later in 2005. Both
SACs were fully disbursed upon declaration of effectiveness.2

These operations had as their overarching objective to support the medium-term
Provincial Reform Program (PRP 2001-2004). The PRP had five pillars: (i) fiscal
reforms, (ii) public financial management and accountability reforms, (iii) reforms to
accelerate human development, (iv) governance reforms to achieve an efficient,
accountable and service-oriented civil service, and (v) measures to promote growth and
private sector development.

The SAC operations significantly influenced the structure of the two DPC
operations that followed. Ten of fifteen DPC 1 indicators are closely linked to the
proposed SAC 3 indicators ­SAC 3 essentially merged into DPC 1. Three of eight DPC
2 indicators are also closely linked to these DPC 1/SAC 3 indicators. In Table 1 below,
the SAC linked indicators are denoted with an asterisk (*). Continuing the work
launched in the SAC series supported the NWFP's efforts to consolidate reforms and is
one of the DPC series design strengths.

  Both education and health budgets have significantly increased every year since 2002. For instance, the
provincial education budget allocated to the districts increased annually by about 14 percent on average
since 2002-03. This trend is consistent with the recent increases in total provincial level current expenditure
for education and health: education increased from Rs. 3,070 million in 2008-09 (revised estimate) to Rs.
3,942 million in 2009-2010 while health expenditures increased from Rs. 2,704 million to Rs. 2,989
million over the same period. (Source: White Paper 2009-2010)

 A US$50 million supplemental SAC 2 finance was quickly prepared and approved following the
earthquake, part of a Bank emergency support package totaling nearly $500 million.

   1.2. Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The DPC 1 and 2 were designed as a series o f three DPCs at the beginning to assist the
NWFP policy reform program. The central goal of the NWFP reform program was to
improve living standards through policy reforms that accelerated human development,
improved fiscal stability, strengthened governance and promoted growth. It was aligned
with the Provincial Development Strategy and adopted the Strategy's four pillars: (a)
accelerating human development (education and health); (b) improving fiscal stability
and reform and public expenditure management; (c) strengthening governance; and (d)
promoting economic growth. Each of the pillars is subdivided (DPC 2) into key themes
enumerated below.

   I.    Accelerating human development to reduce poverty and raise the quality
        and standard of life of the people. Specifically this meant improving the
        coverage and quality of education, health and social protection services which
        were seen as critical for sustained and inclusive economic growth.
            o Improve access, equity, quality and governance of the education system
            o Increase the utilization and quality of care, and strengthen stewardship
                 functions in the health sector, and
            o Reduce the risk and vulnerability to the human capital of the poor through
                 a sound social protection system.
   II. Improving fiscal stability and public expenditure management to strengthen
        and sustain investment to support the medium-term reform program. Sustained
        public investment over a number of years--required to improve human
        development and reduce poverty--was seen to demand prudent management of
        fiscal resources.
            o Improve macroeconomic stability
            o Improve fiscal sustainability of the reforms
            o Improve planning and monitoring of public expenditures.
   III. Strengthening governance by improving accountability, especially in financial
        management and procurement.
            o Improve public financial management and accountability
            o Improve transparency and accountability in public procurement, and
            o Obtain reliable and timely human resources data for planning, budget
                 preparation and control of establishment expenditure, and to monitor
                 compliance with legal and policy stipulations.
   IV. Promoting private sector development to raise incomes and reduce poverty, and
        to increase employment opportunities in productive and sustainable economic
        activities within the province.
            o Institutionalize the public private dialogue
            o Reorient the role of the state from operator to facilitator, and
            o Improve private participation in economic activities

In the DPC 1 PGD, there are 15 prior actions plus 16 "selected monitoring indicators". In
DPC 2, there are 11 prior actions/triggers and a similar list of 11 "key performance and
monitoring indicators". In what follows the 27 (16 + 11) key performance and
monitoring indicators are termed "PDO/key performance indicators" and they are
enumerated in Table 2 below.


                                           6
In Section 1.4, we provide a panorama of the broad policy areas supported by the DPC
series. Hence, it includes the prior conditions, the 27 key performance indicators and
summarizes the numerous policy matrix activities from Annex 2 (Policy Matrix) that are
neither prior conditions nor key performance indicators. In the ICR, we refer to these as
"monitoring indicators" and they number 74 for DPC 1 and DPC 2 ­ DPC 3 was not
included in the count. While information is not available to confirm whether these
indicators were met, the mere fact that they figure in the DPC series and were being
discussed with the NWFP government is indicative of the series' very broad and deep
scope.

Improving Fiscal Stability and Public Expenditure Management
                      Common indicators:
                      · Provincial GDP growth rate
                      · Provincial tax revenue growth
                      · % of budget spent on development expenditures
                      · Reconciled fiscal data using the new accounting model
   · Poverty head count
   · Pro-poor PRSP expenditure
Accelerating Human Development: Education
                    Common indicators:
                    · Gross Enrollment Rate--Primary school (male & female)
   · Primary school dropout rates                     · Ratio of girls to boys in primary and
   · Girls schools with essential facilities             secondary school
                                                      · Transition rate from primary to middle
                                                         schools by gender
Accelerating Human Development: Health
                    Common indicators:
                    · Full Immunization among children 12-23 months
                    · % of population with access to TB DOTS
                    · Contraceptive prevalence rate
      ·    Antenatal consultations                     ·   % of births attended by skilled health
      ·    Access to safe drinking water                   personnel

The 15 DPC 1 prior actions and 11 DPC 2 prior actions/triggers are enumerated in Table
3.   Key performance indicators reasonably reflected the DPC series objectives are
congruent with NWFP's reform program pillars. When prior conditions/triggers are
added (see section 1.4 below), this conclusion is reinforced.

1.3       Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key
          Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
There was no change in overall DPC series objectives. There were some changes in Key
Performance Indicators and prior conditions between DPC 1 and DPC 2. This is because
Bank DPC guidelines changed and the number of prior actions and PDOs/Key
Performance Indicators was limited (see Section 1.5). Also, DPC 2 dropped Urban,
Agriculture and Water sectors and indicators from the DPC 1 formulation. After DPC 2,
the DPC series was discontinued because the IMF program for Pakistan did not go


                                                7
through in FY08. Instead, a Sector Investment Credit using a multi-sector Sector-Wide
Approach (SWAp) has been proposed because, in addition to political instability and
risky economic environment which NWFP has faced, the province needed close
implementation support and dedicated technical assistance which can be provided better
through a SIL than a DPC.

Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
The four pillars with their themes, prior actions and triggers defining the policy agenda
addressed by DPC 1 and 2 are summarized in the preceding sections. In what follows,
prior indicators plus the key performance and 74 monitoring indicators (from the DPC1-2
policy matrices -Annex 2) are presented. Note that --at the risk of adding too much
detail-- this is the only place in the ICR where we have presented all of the indicators. It
is expressly done to demonstrate the impressive breadth and debt of the DPC series scope
and its support of CAS objectives and client pillars.

Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
During the preparation of DPC 2, the Bank guidelines for DPCs was changed to state that
a DPC should have no more than 10 prior actions and 20 key performance indicators
The Government of NWFP, too, complied of the excessive complexity of the DPC series
with a large number of prior actions and milestones. As a consequence, the Bank team, in
discussion with the Government of the NWFP, reduced the number of prior actions and
milestones in the DPC 2 operation. The strategic focus on human development was
retained in the choice of DPC 2 prior actions and key performance indicators. The DPC 1
areas "Urban Management" and "Agriculture and Water Sector" were dropped from
Pillar 4 in DPC 2.

Also, as explained above, DPC 3 was rejected owing to the deteriorating economic and
political situation, the absence of an IMF program in FY08, and the need for close
implementation support to improve the human development outcomes in NWFP. Instead,
a policy decision was made by Bank management to provide future support to the NWFP
though investment lending and technical assistance. A performance based SWAp
operation which continues much of the DPC series sectors and emphasis is currently
under preparation.

Key Factors Affecting Policy Matrix and Key Performance Indicators
The positive impact of economic growth in the early part of the decade followed by the
earthquake, political instability and economic decline are documented elsewhere.
Notwithstanding the changing environment, DPC 1 and 2 performance across the four
pillars and multiplicity of prior conditions, key performance and monitoring indicators
was impressive. All prior conditions for disbursement were met and many of the key
performance indicators--the milestones reflecting desired progress across the four pillars
of the policy reform program at the end of the third DPC--were met by the second DPC
(see Section 3). This was possible in large measure because the earlier SAC operations
had clearly established and consolidated the direction and measure of the desired sector
reforms. The provincial government understood the Bank programs and that they were
supporting its own policy reform agenda. The SAC operations allowed DPC1 and DPC2
to continue and deepen the desired reforms, working with a committed and experienced
counterpart.

Pillar I: Accelerating Human Development by Improving Delivery of Education and
Health Services.

Education. By the conclusion of SAC 2 the government had achieved significant
progress in providing missing facilities for girls' schools including latrines (96 percent),
boundary walls (90 percent), water supply (64 percent), and additional classrooms (50
percent). Free public education was expanded through secondary level and provision of
free textbooks to girls of all grades and boys up to grade-2 in all government primary
schools was achieved.        Systems to monitor teacher attendance to reduce chronic
absenteeism were being implemented including EDOs taking disciplinary action based on
timely reports and in turn forwarding reports to the Directorate for Schools and Literacy.
Finally, hiring of teachers was devolved to the District level.

Under the DPC series the government provided free textbooks to all primary school
students and girls through middle and high school. Furthermore, textbooks were
distributed prior to the commencement of the school year in 2006-7 which was not the
case in previous years. It also focused on strengthening PTAs, ensuring that they were
functional in all primary schools and receiving recurrent budget funds that had been
increased. In addition, PTAs of almost 50 percent of all middle and secondary schools
were made functional. DPC 2 added new dimensions to education with the inauguration
of a stipend program for girls enrolled in grades 6-10 in seven districts where girls'
enrollment rates were below 12 percent. DPC2 also focused more on deepening
education management reforms through interventions such as partnership agreements
regarding education sector reforms with 50 percent of district governments, a policy
framework for teacher development, revised guidelines for PTAs governing utilization of
their development budgets, and established an education sector reform unit with planning
and monitoring functions under its Department of Education.




                                            15
Health. Under the SAC 2 operation the TB DOTS program was expanded from 10 to 17
districts. In addition, 1,800 new lady health workers were deployed and 200 new female
nurses were employed at district hospitals. DPC 1 extended daily TB observation therapy
sessions (DOTS) from 17 to all 24 districts and deployed 2,500 new Lady Health
Workers to district hospitals. In addition, contracts were consummated between the
government and at least three NGOs/private sector organizations for the provision of
HIV/AIDS preventive services. Under DPC 2, DOTS was deemed functional in all
districts through service provision by public health facilities and joint programs being
implemented with private and non state sector entities. Provision of HIV/AIDS services
had all been expanded to IDUs, jail inmates and other high risk populations. Also under
DPC 2 expanded healthcare management was further emphasized by (i) executing
partnership agreements with at least five district governments and a designated NGO in
the provinces to implement certain management innovations, and (ii) contracting baseline
studies of quality-of-care assessments in primary and secondary health-care facilities at
the district level.

Pillar II: Fiscal and Expenditure Reforms

SAC 2 undertook a number of activities relevant to the DPC 2 series including
reprioritizing the project portfolio in the FY04 investment project budget to reduce the
throw-forward ratio to below 3.2 years, transfer funds for district government staff
salaries to districts via account IV, raising the monthly financial reconciliation rate of
provincial activities (receipts, expenditures, suspense accounts, intergovernmental
accounts) and diminishing reporting lags.

Building on this, DPC 1 incorporated a number of prior actions. The throw-forward
ratio was reduced to below 3.0 years. Fiscal sustainability and accountability were also
emphasized. DPC 1 contained the overall fiscal deficit within the target level of 0.8
percent of GDP and establishment cost within the FY2004/5 level of 3.6 percent of GDP.
It improved tax administration by approving a system of bonus payments for staff linked
to revenue collection and launched tax facilitation centers for the collection of selected
taxes. DPC 2 continued and in some cases institutionalized the DPC1 policies--for
instance, the revenue measures in the DPC 1 trigger were established in policy and
practice. The bonuses to excise and taxation staff continued to be linked to revenue
collection performance and Tax Facilitation Centers continued operations with new ones
coming on line.

Pillar III: Governance Reforms

SAC 2 launched procurement reform with a new law, regulations, and Standard Bidding
Documents. It also revised District Rules of Business and devolved recruitment authority
of teachers to district governments. Under DPC 1 further progress was made in
procurement reform building on the new law: a time bound, resourced roadmap for
revising and better aligning the law with international best practice was developed. DPC
2 extended this work, implementing a third phase of reform in procurement rules while
taking action to adopt current market rates to substitute the composite rates schedule in



                                           16
use at the time for government contracts. In the area of human resources, work continued
on removing inconsistencies in the designation of appointing authorities for different
levels of officers and staff of the departments devolved to the districts. Furthermore, the
provincial cabinet took steps to create a district cadre of professional/managerial staff
(BPS 1-15) as well as ensuring that provincial secretaries were kept in their posts for at
least 20 months. A human resources management database was created and operating
including important improvements in payroll capability. Under DPC 1, the NWFP
provincial budget for FY2005 was published in a format based upon a new chart of
accounts and this was consolidated through DPC 2 to be presented in this way. DPC 2
further ensured that at least 20 District Accounts Offices had achieved operational IT
connectivity and introduced uniform charts of accounts under a New Accounting Model.

Pillar IV: Accelerating Economic Growth and promoting Private Sector Development

Under SAC 2 the importance of private sector lead growth was recognized by publishing
a private sector development policy statement and approving an agricultural growth
strategy. As part of this effort three small hydro projects were leased to the private
sector and work was progressing on processes for five more and the refurbishing of a
sixth. DPC 1 was especially active in expanding private sector initiatives. Public
expenditures for agriculture were aligned with sector priorities established in the
Agricultural Policy and steps were taken to establish an autonomous agricultural research
system consistent with those priorities. Furthermore, at least 75 Farm Services Centers
were established and District Agricultural Coordination Forums were established in all
districts. DPC 2 was somewhat restricted in its follow-on activities due in large measure
to new rules restricting the numbers of DPC triggers. Hence, no new agriculture sector
initiatives were included among prior actions.            DPC 1 introduced important
organizational reforms to enhance private sector development including the creation of an
Investment Facilitation Council and an Investment Facilitation Committee. The Sarhad
Development Authority was restructured to include an investment facilitation center. It
was also designated the secretariat to the Investment Facilitation Council and the
Committee. To further this work, management committees were created for the industrial
estates that were lead by private sector representatives. Private sector representatives
were also included in and appointed chairpersons of the management committees of
technical and vocational training institutes. One significant new DPC 2 contribution
under this pillar was the establishment and operationalization of a single-window
investment facilitation center coordinated by the private sector and corresponding line
agencies within the provincial government.          Finally, under DPC 1 government
shareholding in the Bank of Khyber was reduced to 65 percent. While not a DPC 2
trigger, the government continued to divest shares in the Bank of Khyber and government
holding was restricted to 51 percent.

Summary of Achievements. The two DPC programs built upon the earlier SAC programs,
successfully meeting 15 prior actions in DPC 1 and 11 in DPC 2 and disbursing within
two weeks of signing the credits. Many key performance indicators were met or nearly
met after only two of the three DPC operations. And an impressive array of monitoring
indicators was also addressed (see Section 1.4). The quality of the indicators is congruent



                                            17
with good practice operations elsewhere. Moreover, the program impacted importantly
on poverty, gender, social and institutional strengthening (Section 3.4) and the gains were
incremental -- without the DPC series it is likely that significant portions of the program
would not have been carried out or would have experienced significant delays (Section
3.2).


Major Factors Affecting Implementation
As has been amply documented above, DPC 1 was a continuation of the SAC 1 and 2.
Hence, it benefitted enormously from the SAC program and all of the accumulated
preparatory work and implementation experience. The SAC operations strengthened the
province's financial management and facilitated work under all four of the pillars as
demonstrated above. The DPC series            also benefited from strong ownership and
commitment by the NWFP Government resulting in all prior actions being met prior to
signing in addition to substantial progress in meeting the key performance and numerous
monitoring indicators. DPC 1 also had the benefit of a two year preparation period, the
PRSP work and earthquake emergency operation all of which assisted the Bank and
client to better define and support the DPC. In the end, the fact that the reforms were
firmly embedded in the NWFP pillars and built upon the SAC operations were doubtless
key factors affecting successful implementation.

The operation also benefitted from a capable and competent NWFP management cadre,
and a country-wide consensus and commitment to reform dating roughly from 2002.
This was abated by economic growth a corresponding increase in GoP financial support
to the provinces for high profile education, health and management reforms.


Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
As was noted above, the DPC series built upon the SAC operations. Hence, many of the
prior conditions and key performance indicators continued what had been done in the
SACs and a culture of monitoring and reporting sector results presumably had been
implanted. Consequently, reporting outcomes for the discrete DPC indicators should
have posed few problems. In fact, as we shall see in Section 3, there are anomalies in
progress reporting against key performance indicators in the documentation. For prior
conditions was evidence of compliance satisfactory to the Bank presented by the client
and vetted by the Bank and in both operations disbursement was effected soon after.
Because these DPLs,
Two issues need to be discussed here, the Bank's reporting and DPC M&E. Regarding
the Bank's reporting of results, there are anomalies in reporting on Key Performance
Indicators ­they are not all included in the ISRs and consequently what is downloaded in
the ICR does not always match what is in the PGD and the Credit Agreement. A
subsidiary issue is that one of the pillars--supporting growth through private sector
strengthening--does not have any Key Performance Indicators-although it does include
significant prior conditions and monitoring indicators. With regard to the DPC series, it
would have been very useful to know what sort of permanent M&E reporting
arrangements had been installed in the NWFP to track the very rich venue of indicators,
including the 74 monitoring indicators, throughout the DPC series and afterwards.


                                            18
M&E was the responsibility of the Department of Finance's Reform Support Unit. This
arrangement reportedly worked well. More importantly, the Health and Education MIS
systems were strengthened to support monitoring and environment over the course of
DPC 1 and 2. Organizationally, the establishment under the DPC of the Education and
Health Reform Support Units contributed to the consolidation of a `M&E' culture.
Monthly progress reports were emitted and information compiled and reported on
specific issues relating to sector progress. Hence, improvements were made but whether
this was sustained and covered the rich menu of DPC indicators is not clear.

Finally, related activities were taking place in NWFP and in Pakistan that contributed to
a growing awareness of the need for data, monitoring and evaluation. These included
surveys, censuses and Bank operations like PIFRA.       The Bank's Project to Improve
Financial Reporting and Accountability (PIFRA) in the provinces strengthened
monitoring and evaluation capability. NWFP's performance was especially strong in
improving the reliability and accuracy of financial information using the new chart of
accounts, achieving 100 percent IT connectivity, reducing reporting lags and
strengthening audit capacity and timeliness.

Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)
The DPC series was originally to be three operations. However, DPC 3 has been
replaced by a Sector Investment Credit using a multi-sector Sector-Wide Approach
(SWAp) modality which is currently under preparation. This was necessitated by the
deterioration in the federal and provincial fiscal environment, and to bring greater focus
on strengthening implementation of reforms and achieving the results. The Sindh and
Punjab education DPCs were also truncated and converted to SWAps for similar reasons.
The type of SWAp instrument chosen for all three credits is a variation used fairly widely
in Brazil and increasingly elsewhere. It is more performance based incorporating
disbursement conditions that apply to (i) actual government expenditure of targeted
budget programs (eligible expenditure programs-EEP) and (ii) performance indicators. It
also allows for much needed directed technical assistance. The SWAp and DPCs target
essentially the same sectors and the disbursement conditions, currently under
development, will draw upon the original DPC pillars, prior action and key
performance/PDO indicators. Hence, the NWFP investment operation is expected to
provide continuity to the NWFP DPCs as it will prioritize the education, health and social
protection sectors and also focus on strengthening key institutions.


Assessment of Outcomes
Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory
The DPC series is fully aligned with the Board approved June, 2002 CAS, the April,
2004 CAS Progress Report, and the June, 2006 CAS as well as the PRSP. Summarizing,
these documents essentially support Federal and provincial level strengthening of
macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness, improving the business



                                           19
environment for growth and reducing poverty and improving equity through pro-poor and
pro-gender equity policies and programs aligned with the PRSP.

Several strategic principles for aiding provinces were advanced in the CASs including (i)
client `pull' and selectivity based upon a credible track record of fiscal and economic
reform and desire for Bank assistance; (ii) adoption of a programmatic approach; and (iii)
reliance on partnerships. NWFP had demonstrated a good track record, desire for Bank
assistance and a willingness to undertake a programmatic approach through the SAC
series and this was continued with its willingness to undertake the DPC series. The DPC
series also has numerous instances of partnerships embedded in its approach and
monitoring indicators. In the health sector this includes piloting greater autonomy for
hospitals and expansion of NGO and private partnerships for health service delivery. In
education the role of PTAs were expanded including budgetary authority to forge closer
community partnerships and PPPs were to be expanded especially for secondary and
university education. Both PGDs affirm that DPC 1 and DPC 2 are fully aligned with
their respective CASs and with client priorities. And a review of the DPC series' prior
actions/triggers, key performance and monitoring indicators confirms this.

Undertaking a multi-sector DPC series with a combined 26 prior actions, 27 key
performance indicators and 74 monitoring indicators was very ambitious -- probably
there are very few such DPC programmatic operations. The two credits are noteworthy
also for the relevance and quality of their indicators and their potential sectoral impact.
The choice of sectors is judicious and builds upon previous SAC operations and a clear
understanding of social inclusion and growth priorities. It is also noteworthy that multi-
sector SWAps done elsewhere also customarily include health and education and often
add public sector management and growth components which speaks to an emerging
consensus regarding priorities in multi-sector operations.

Achievement of Program Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

Monitoring Results for Key Performance Indicators
DPC 1, which was also SAC3, carried forward the key performance indicators/PDOs
from the SAC series. DPC 2 modified these indicators in line with the Bank requirement
that a DPC have no more than 10 prior actions and 20 milestones. As such, all indicators
in DPC1 which reflected the old SAC series and were not relevant to the DPC series
going forwards were omitted.

The key performance indicators for the two credits are presented in Table 5 below and
discussed in what follows. The overall conclusion is that progress through DPC 2
probably justifies a "Satisfactory" rating even with incomplete information and using
DPC 3 key performance indicator targets. This is reinforced by the fact that all of the
prior conditions were met.

Improving Fiscal Stability and Public Expenditure Management
The key indicators tracked under this heading and results included the following.

·    Provincial growth rate. Evidently, the growth rate is determined by factors that go
     well beyond the scope of the NWFP DPC series. This is exemplified by the high
     statistical correlation between Pakistan and provincial transfers and growth and the
     impact of externalities such as political instability, recession, and natural disasters.
     DPC 1`s baseline was set at 4 percent based upon inputted 2002 data--it is not clear
     why more recent data was not used as the baseline. In mid 2005, growth was 6.2-6.3
     percent (DPC 1 Board approval was mid 2006). The end of series target (December,
     2008) was projected at 7 percent. At mid 2007, corresponding to DPC 2 Board
     approval, provincial growth stood at a respectable 6.3 percent. The provincial growth
     rate for 2008-09 is not available. However, the national GDP growth rate is revised at
     2.2 percent due to bleak economic situation for 2008-09, therefore, it is expected that
     the provincial GDP growth rate is also decreased.
·    Provincial Tax Revenue. The baseline is 8 percent in mid 2004 and the target for is
     18 percent by mid 2008. The end-March, 2007 percentage is reported as 18 percent
     indicating that the target had probably been met by the close of DPC 2. This indicator
     is not used in ISR for monitoring purpose.
·    Share of budget spent on development expenditures. The mid 2005 baseline is 31
     percent and the end of series 2008 target is 33 percent. The target was met by mid
     2007 at the time of DPC 2 approval. The trend has been sustained and reached to 39
     percent in 2009.
·    Reconciled fiscal data using the new accounting model. The mid 2005 baseline was
     96 percent reconciled. Both the DPC 3 target and the DPC 2 actual are 100 percent



                                                              21
    indicating that the new chart of accounts and accounting model had been successfully
    implemented.
·   Poverty head count and Pro-poor PRSP expenditure (DPC 1 only). There is no data in
    Section F of the ICR nor in the ISRs on the targets or actuals baselines were recorded
    at 46.2 percent (2002) and 38 percent (June 2004-05).

While the incomplete reporting is unfortunate--and taking into account that these
indicators were dropped from DPC 2--the performance of the DPC series through DPC 2
against the end-of-DPC 3 target is satisfactory. While the provincial growth rate
indicator is doubtless beyond the scope of a DPC to influence, increase in tax revenue,
budget spent on the development agenda and successful implementation of a new
accounting model resulting in 100% reconciliation are both under the control of the
provincial administration and significant and demanding improvements.

Accelerating Human Development: Education
Health and education are the two areas contributing key performance indicators/PDOs.
Under education the following indicators were tracked.

·   Gross primary school enrollment ratio. DPC 1 provided a 2002 benchmark of 77
    percent. The end of series target in 2008 at DPC 1 was 83 percent and 85 percent at
    DPC 2. By the time of DPC 2 in mid 2006, 83 percent had already been achieved. In
    fact, the DPC 1 ISR indicates that 83 percent was achieved at the time of DPC 1, so
    apparently there was little improvement in the period between the two DPCs.
    According to the latest data, the target value of 83 percent has been sustained but with
    no further improvement.
·   Gross middle school enrollment ratio (DPC 1 only).             Once again, the DPC 1
    operation provided a 2002 baseline of 38 percent. The ratios at the close of DPC 1
    and DPC 2 stood at 52 percent.
·   Ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education (DPC 2 only). The baseline
    at the end of 2005 at DPC 1 is 47 girls to 100 boys. The 2008 end of series target is
    set as 50 girls to 100 boys. As of October 2008, the level achieved is 60 girls to 100
    boys, which has greatly surpassed the original target.
·   Primary school dropout rate and girls schools with essential facilities (DPC 1 only).
    This is one of the key performance indicators that appear in the PGD, however, its
    progress was not monitored in ISR, and the indicator is dropped from the DPC 2 key
    performance indicators list.
·   Transition rates from primary to middle school for boys and girls (DPC 2 only). This
    indicator is presented in the ISR as an intermediate outcome indicator. The baseline at
    mid 2005 was 75 percent for boys and 67 percent for girls. The 2008 end of DPC
    series target was set at 77 percent for boys and 70 percent for girls. The available data
    from the EMIS indicates that transition rates for boys and girls reached 80 percent
    and 74 percent respectively for 2007-08 indicating that both targets were exceeded.
    However, the 2008-09 EMIS signaled that boys and girls rates dropped to 75 percent
    and 70 percent, respectively. The girls' DPC3 target continues to meet the DPC3
    target despite the decline. For boys the DPC3 target was met in 2007-08 but
    declined thereafter to 75 percent which is the 2005 baseline. One may speculate the
    provincial recession brought on by the global recession and the insurgency may have


                                             22
    contributed to lower rates but without further study it is not possible to know at this
    time.

While the missing key performance indicators are troubling, progress measured by key
performance, against the target at the end of DPC series in 2008 is probably reasonable in
2006-7 when data is recorded.

Accelerating Human Development: Health
The key health performance indicators are likewise presented below. Given the
insurgency and macroeconomic issues in NWFP, the result is considered to be
reasonable.

·   Full immunization among children 12-23 months of age. Once again a 2002 baseline
    is provided at 54 percent. The end of series 2008 target is 100 percent. In mid 2005,
    the rate had climbed to about 76 percent which is the percentage registered in mid
    2007, and the current rate is 74 percent for 2008. While 100 percent is very likely too
    optimistic for NWFP, the 50 percent increase between 2002 and 2008 is impressive.
    What is more difficult to explain is why the rate did not increase after 2005. It should
    be noted, however, that the full immunization coverage at the national level has been
    also stagnated in the recent years.
·   Percentage of population with access to TB DOTS. DPC 2 reports a benchmark of
    100 percent for the end of 2004. The target for 2008 was likewise 100 percent, and
    the DPC 2 reported rate in mid 2007 was 99 percent. Hence, it appears that access
    was nearly sustained throughout the DPC series.
·   Antenatal consultations of pregnant women by health professionals (DPC 1 only).
    DPC 1 records a baseline 2002 level of 34 percent. The DPC 1 rate in mid-2006 is 46
    percent, and the level achieved in 2008 is 48 percent. The end of series target in 2008
    is 50 percent, thus, it has apparently made a good progress towards the goal.
·   Contraceptive prevalence rate. This indicator is proposed as a key indicator in both
    DPC 1 and DPC 2 PGDs but there is no extant data to confirm baselines or progress.
·   The percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel and quality of water
    (DPC 2 only). These indicators are also proposed in the PGD with no baseline or
    progress recorded.

While these achievements are remarkable, is should be noted that there has been some
inconsistency in reporting progress on outcome indicators in ISR between DPC 1 and 2,
as some indicators were omitted in DPC 2 and the baseline or target values or dates did
not always match across the two operations.

`Incremental Contribution' of DPC Series
While not a part of the standard ICR format, the `incremental contribution' of the DPC
series is worthy of mention. In researching this operation it became apparent that the
two year development period prior to the first DPC and the intervening year prior to the
second were used to develop with the client a program that essentially did not exist prior
to the DPC. In other words, the DPC program's 15 prior actions (DPC 1) and 11 triggers
(DPC 2) innovated, reorganized and reoriented activities and hence can be said to have
been in large measure incremental to existing programs. For example, a number of the


                                            23
education reforms were developed prior to or simultaneous with similar work carried out
in the Sindh and Punjab education DPC series which also morphed into SWAps. The
table below briefly summarizes NWFP SWAp prior actions that appear to be innovative.
A great deal was going on during the period spanned by the DPC series and better
reporting of progress, perhaps including monitoring indicators, would doubtless have
enriched the list of incremental contributions.

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

"Relevance" and "Achievement of Objectives" are rated `Satisfactory' in Sections 3.1
and 3.2 respectively. The DPCs are impressive for their ambitious and opportunistic
multi-sector design, the relevance of the prior actions/triggers, the impressive array of
key performance and monitoring indicators and the progress made despite the DPC series
having been terminated after only two operations. The rating might have been higher
except that the reporting of a number of key indicators appearing in the PGD were not


                                           27
adequately monitored and reported on by Bank staff.            In Section 3.4 a/b below
institutional interventions in support of poverty reduction and gender equity, social and
institutional impact are found to have generally significant impact and involve
appropriate risk taking. In Section 3.6 the indicators are found to be innovative and
contributing incrementally to reform. Finally, the continuance of the DPC series using a
different credit modality under extremely stressful circumstances also is evidence of the
high value accorded the DPC framework by the Bank and NWFP Government.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development:
The education and health components (Pillar I) were by definition poverty targeted. It is
also noteworthy that girls' stipends, textbook delivery and school upgrading clearly
targeted girls in a society where it is needed and not easy. Reviewing the Prior Actions
table (3.4-b) below, the actions contributing to poverty (P), gender (G) and social impact
(SI) impact are indicated. Four DPC 1 and six DPC 2 prior actions directly generate
such impacts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening:
Important changes have been introduced under this program, many with longer-term
capacity and institutional development impacts. In support of this finding, each prior
action has been rated in the table below according to social inclusion content (poverty,
gender, social impact) and institutional content (impact and riskiness in terms of
sustainability). The first rating assesses the potential social impact, e.g. the extent to
which the indicator will contribute to an important policy change and/or overall related
institutional strengthening. The second rating assesses the potential institutional impact
of the intervention and the risk of its being reversed, ignored, under-funded or otherwise
diluted and hence not achieving its expected impact. There are enough high impact
ratings and medium to low risk ratings to give comfort that longer term capacity and
institutional development will result from the DPC series. Similar ratings if applied to
the numerous secondary indicators enumerated in 1.4 above would reinforce this
conclusion. The conclusion is that the operation contributed significantly to institutional
change/strengthening.

·    Institutions: High Impact, High Risk

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative):
Certainly attitudes towards delivery of education and health services ­and especially to
women, fiscal management and accountability and governance have improved. With
improved results come expectations that gains will be consolidated and further
improvements should be forthcoming. That the follow-on SWAp operation is able to
build on the DPC framework and indicators despite the insurgency and economic stress
speaks to a general acceptance and ownership of the program. The question is whether
and to what extent improved management, service delivery and governance lends support
and credibility to the NWFP government in these difficult times.

Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
There was no Beneficiary Survey or Stakeholder Workshops. The political instability and
growing insurgency in Pakistan and the NWFP precluded the conducting of beneficiary
surveys and stakeholder workshops.

The credits did benefit from a number of studies including a nationwide rural factor
markets study, the national Growth and Competitiveness Study, the Country Gender
Assessment and the nationwide Administrative Barriers study--all in 2005-6. Also in
2005 a NWFP Economic Report was done which underpinned the DPC series. In 2003-4



                                                       31
there were a number of supporting studies including a PFAA, CPAR, Devolution Study,
Pakistan PER, and a Damage and Needs Assessment of the October, 2005 earthquake.


Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Satisfactory (Assessment), Modest (Development Outcome)
The DPC 2 Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures were comprehensive and the risk
rating was `moderate'.        Essentially, the same risks to sustainability persist:
macroeconomic, fiscal, political and fiduciary management, implementation capacity for
provincial and district governments and external shocks. The scaled up insurgency and
worldwide recession came afterwards and could not have been predicted. Hence, the
matrix and assessment is rated `Satisfactory'.

The risks to the Development Outcome are more complicated. Most of the institutional
strengthening and policy interventions encompassed by the prior actions/triggers and
monitoring indicators have been institutionalized and will be permanent. However, the
macroeconomic situation and the insurgency will doubtless curtail the reach and depth of
these reforms, especially in the FATA agencies and some NWFP districts where the
insurgency is strongest. Displaced persons will also pose new financial and service
delivery burdens.

The new NWFP SWAp operation is probably going to have to triage unstable districts
and rely upon NWFP and third party supervision. However, since most of the population
resides in districts firmly under government control, the decision to proceed with
preparing the SWAp and incorporating many of the same programs and reforms targeted
by the DPC series gives comfort that the policy and institutional reforms and many of the
service delivery improvements can and will continue. Hence, given that DPC series
policy and institutional reforms are institutionalized, service delivery improvements
should be continued in most of NWFP and the SWAp should be delivered this fiscal year,
the Development Outcome is rated `Modest'. The one caveat is if external shocks--the
insurgency and political instability--significantly worsened.


Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

Bank Performance
 (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through
lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory
Given the Satisfactory ratings for "relevance", PDO achievement, overall outcome plus
the ambitious and innovative nature of the DPC series and the fact that it is being
continued using a SWAp mechanism despite a difficult political economy environment a
`Satisfactory' rating is justified.   The credit built on a solid SAC series and was
comprehensive and judicious in its design.


                                              32
(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)
Rating: Satisfactory
Supervision for a programmatic DPC series is relevant primarily in terms of validating
DPC 1 disbursement requirements and ensuring that DPC 2 indicators are congruent with
DPC 1 results.       The design and timely disbursement of both operations justify a
`Satisfactory' rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank put together an innovative and ambitious multi-sector operation that built upon
gains in an earlier SAC series, identified and addressed critical sectors and blanketed
them with 26 prior actions and 72 key performance and monitoring indicators that are
highly relevant. The indicators were met allowing for timely disbursement, were shown
to have impact, and will be continued in a SWAp operation which replaces DPC 3 giving
further comfort that the work was well done.       Hence Bank performance is rated
`Satisfactory'.

Borrower Performance

x    Click here if the Government and the Implementation Agency is the same or
     indistinguishable


The operation was implemented by the Government. The Departments of Finance, and
Planning and Development, were the focal points. Other key Government departments
involved in the implementation of the operation were Health, Education and Social
Welfare.      Consequently the government and implementing agency are deemed
sufficiently indistinguishable to justify rating only Overall Borrower Performance.

(a) Government Performance
See "Borrower Performance" below.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
This innovative and ambitious operation including the numerous and highly relevant
prior and complementary actions was only possible through the close cooperation and
support of the NWFP Government. Agreeing to such a program and then working to
ensure that the indicators were met in a timely manner to assure disbursement for both
operations warrants, similar to the Bank, a `Satisfactory' rating.


Lessons Learned
·    Including fiscal, and governance indicators in sector DPCs is also useful and
     feasible--too often sector DPCs neglect to use the credit vehicle as an opportunity
     to embrace cross-cutting PSM interventions.



                                                 33
·    There is no reason to constrain the number of prior indicators to an arbitrary
     number (#10) if client circumstances/sector needs and client capability dictate more.
     This is especially true of multi-sector DPCs.       If capacity constraints are the
     motivation behind constraining the number of indicators, this is mitigated and risk
     diffused by increasing the number of sectors, each with many fewer than #10
     indicators.     One of the strengths of this operation is that it had more prior
     conditions/triggers.
·    There is a huge benefit in requiring/working to include secondary conditions that
     have been met through credit preparation efforts. One of the strengths of this
     operation was the numerous secondary indicators that, combined with prior/trigger
     conditions, resulted in each sector having been accorded the same sort of
     comprehensive treatment that a single sector DPC might have received.


Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
Agencies/Partners
The only issue raised by the Government during implementation was the large number of
milestones and prior actions in the DPC 1 policy matrix. The Bank responded in DPC 2
by streamlining somewhat the number of prior actions and milestones in line with Bank
policy and to reflect the strategic focus on human development.
