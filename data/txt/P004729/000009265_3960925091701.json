The\n            overall outcome of the project was rated satisfactory; the\n            performance of the Bank and the borrower was rated\n            satisfactory. The project aimed to develop public lands\n            which had been encroached on by small farmers, intensify\n            rain fed agricultural activities and improve land use in\n            those areas, expand agricultural exports, and alleviate\n            rural poverty. Lessons learned are as follows: (a) land\n            reform projects that improve the security of land ownership\n            combined with the provision of economic and social\n            infrastructure, and services close to national standards can\n            improve farm incomes, and thus help reduce encroachment, and\n            deforestation; (b) the sustainability of infrastructure\n            maintenance cannot be assured by the Agricultural land\n            Reform Office (ALRO) in the long term unless efforts are\n            made to undertake early joint planning with agencies whose\n            core function is infrastructure development, ensure\n            standards equivalent to those of similar infrastructure in\n            other parts of the country, and transfer maintenance\n            responsibilities to the relevant agencies; (c) to induce\n            farmers to invest more in sustaining and raising land\n            productivity, it is necessary to improve accessibility of\n            institutional credit, possibly through conversion of the\n            ALRO 4.01 certificate into a full land title which can serve\n            as bank collateral; and (d) project design should be\n            flexible to allow changes in response to farmers, needs and\n            involvement of local people should be sought in planning and\n            implementation of rural infrastructure such as rock weirs,\n            and service tracks to ensure optimum utilization and\n            maintenance of these facilities."}, "docdt": "1993-09-07T00:00:00Z"}
