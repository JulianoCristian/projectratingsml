INDIA
SECOND KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01      The development of India's economy and the improvement of the
standard of living of its population are highly dependent on the
development of the power sector. Over the last two decades, India's power
demand has grown roughly twice as fast as the economy and the power sector
now takes the largest share of India's public investment resources. This
is mainly due to the rapid developm&nt of power-intensive industry, and to
the impressive expansion of rural electrification, especially for
irrigation.
1.02      In spite of an almost five-fold increase in the country's
generation capacity, from 5,600 MW in 1960 to about 33,000 MW at present,
power shortages were experienced in various parts of the country for a
number of years, and continuing gaps between supply and demand will be a
major constraining factor for the foreseeable future.
1.03      Until 1975, power facilities in India were planned, constructed
and operated by each State to meet local needs. With the rapid growth of
the power sector, the Government of India (GOI) recognized the necessity
to reorganize the power sector from the State to a regional level, and to
intensify centralized planning of generation and high voltdge transmission
with a view to ultimately centralize control through a national grid. To
this end, GOI established in 1975 two companies, the National Thermal
Power Corporation (NTPC) and the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC),
responsible for the design, construction and operation of large
centrally-owned power stations and the associated transmission facilities.
With the assistance of consultants, the Central Electricity Authority
(CEA) prepared a 400 kV system study to determine the configuration and
parameters for future interconnected national power systems. GOI also
decided to proceed with the construction of four large centrally-owned
thermal power stations located on coal fields and supplying bulk power to
the States through an interconnected 400 kV transmission system. The
construction of these power stations--the 2,000 MW Singrauli, the 2,100 MW
Korba, the 2,100 MW Ramagundam, and the 2,100 MW Farakka--started with
IDA/Bank financial assistance. This program comprises the first stage of
600 MW for each generation plant and associated transmission. In
addition, an IDA credit for the second stage of Singrauli (1,400 MW) was
approved. The second stage of Korba--comprising three additional 500 MW
units with associated transmission facilities--is the subject of this
report. An IDA credit of US$400 million is proposed.
Energy Resources
1.04      Commercial primary energy accounts for about 46% of total energy
in India with the balance (54%) coming from non-commercial sources (mainly
firewood, agricultural and animal waste). The main commercial energy
resources are coal, oil, natural gas and hydro power. There are also



-2-
resources of nuclear fuels, principally uranium and thorium. Some thermal
energy sites have been identified, but the potential appears to be
limited. Over the past ten years total energy consumption in India has
grown at an annual rate of about 4%. Consumption of commercial energy has
increased faster (about 5% p.a.) than that of non-commercial energy, thus
resulting in a steady decline in the share of non-commercial energy in
total energy consumption. This is mainly due to an intensive substitution
of commercial energy for non-commercial forms of energy.
1.05      Coal and hydropower have an important role in meeting the
country's commercial energy requirements covering at present about 70% of
total demand. The consumption of petroleum is relatively low in India in
comparison with other developing countries and accounts for less than 20%
of total demand for commercial energy.  Despite the low rate of petroleum
consumption, the extensive development of domestic energy resources such
as coal and hydropower and the recent development of offshore petroleum
resources, the country has not attained energy self-sufficiency and
remains dependent on imported oil to meet its primary energy requirements.
Moreover, in recent years there has been a growing demand for petroleum
products mainly because of difficulties in coal supply and inadequate coal
production resulting in a difficult energy situation. The impact of the
increase in world oil prices after 1973 on India's balance of payments is
evidenL from the following: while oil imports have grown by 17% (3 million
tons) between 1972/73 and 1979/80, the cost of imports rose by some 1,400%
from US$265 million in 1972/73 to about US$4 billion in 1979/80. In
1980/81 the imports are estimated to be US$6 billion, equivalent to more
than 60% of India's expected export earnings.  Domestic energy resources
such as coal and hydro are large enough to supply most of India's future
commercial energy requirements, particularly for industry and for power
generation. however, known oil and gas resources would not be sufficient
to meet the demand for oil in sectors (such as transportation and
residential) where further substitution by other fuels is not feasible.
Therefore, the exploration for new petroleum reserves and development of
existing sources is one of India's most pressing priorities.
1.06      Coal constitutes the main domestic source of commercial energy
in India.    Coal reserves to a depth of 600 m and of seam thickness of
more than 1.2 m are currently estimated at 85.4 billion tons, of which
17.9 billion tons are of the coking variety and 67.5 billion tons of the
non-coking variety. The Geological Survey of India has recently estimated
that an additional 26.1 billion tons of coal deposits exist at depths
below 600 m. According to current demand forecasts, India's coal
resources should be sufficient to meet expected demand for about 100 to
140 years.
1.07      From 1953/54 to 1970/71, the share of coal in commercial primary
energy supply declined from 80% to about 60%, while production increased
from 34 million tons to about 65 million tons per year.  Since 1970/71,



-3-
the share of coal has remained constant whereas production has grown at an
average annual rate of 5.5% (to 104 million metric tons in 1979/80).
Despite the production increases, shortages developed in 1977/78 and
reached an estimated 8 million tons in 1979/80. The main reasons for the
shortfalls are poor capacity utilization, shortages of explosives, floods,
labor problems, and bottlenecks in the transportation and distribution
systems.
1.08      The economically exploitable hydroelectric potential of India is
estimated at about 400,000 GWh of annual energy generation which might
sustain an installed capacity of 100,000 MW at 45% load factor. About
11,000 MW (one third of the total installed generating capacity), of hydro
potential is developed , 4,700 MW is scheduled for commissioning by 1984,
and a further 23,000 MW is under study for development. Some 70% of the
total hydroelectric potential is in the north and northeast.
1.09    India also has sufficient reserves of uranium (34,000 tons
equivalent of U308' of which  15,000 tons is considered economically
exploitable at current international prices) and thorium to meet the
foreseeable nuclear power program. The existing nuclear power plants
total an installed capacity of 860 MWe, consisting of two boiling water
reactor units at Tarapur (Maharashtra) and two pressurized heavy water
reactor units at Kot (Rajasthan). In addition, two units of 235 MWe are
under construction at Kalpakkam (Tamil Nadu) and two units of the same
size at Narora (Uttar Pradesh). It is planned to set up two new stations
of two units of either 235 MWe or 500 MWe each. The construction of a
prototype fast breeder reactor is in progress. It is expected that it
will be possible to commission fast breeder reactors, as part of the power
systems, by the mid-nineties. Beyond the year 2000, the fast breeder
reactors are expected to play a major role in the nuclear power
generation. An installed nuclear capacity of 5,000 MWe has been
visualised by the year 2,000. However, given the limited options
available for meeting the growing power demands and the likely role that
nuclear power may have to play beyond the year 2000, GOI considers that it
may become necessary to accelerate the nuclear power development to
achieve an installed capacity of 8,000 - 10,000 MWe by the turn of the
century.l/
1.10    India's remaining and recoverable reserves of oil and gas are
currently estimated at 6.5 billion tons of oil equivalent. Of this,
proven recoverable reserves are about 360 million -tons of oil equivalent,
of which 294 million tons are oil and 66 million tons are gas. Over 60%
of the recoverable oil reserves are offshore.
1/   See "Report of the Working Group on Energy Policy", 1979,
Government of India, Planning Commission.



-4-
1.11    Domestic oil production has increased from 0.5 million tons in
1961 to 12.5 million tons in 1979 and currently meets about 40% of India's
internal requirements. Gas production is currently estimated at about 2
million tons of oil equivalent, of which about half is used as fuel for
feedstock for fertilizer plants and about half is flared, mainly because
there is no market for it within a reasonable distance from the production
site. Due to the much higher economic value of natural gas utilized as
feedstock in industry, it does not appear practical to use the relatively
small and dispersed amount of gas which is now flared, for power
generation, but rather in future chemical plants.
1.12      In 1978/79 the power sector used about 44 million tons of coal
equivalentl/ (representing about 40% of total consumption of commercial
primary energy), of which 47% came from hydroelectric and nuclear plants,
47% from coal and 6% from oil. Over the past ten years the share of coal
in thermal generation has fluctuated between 85% and 90%, and this is
expected to continue in the future. The share of hydro and nuclear energy
has varied between 43% and 50%. It is expected that by 1987/88 the power
sector will no longer use oil for electricity generation.
Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.13      The Bank has made ten loans to India for power projects
amounting to US$359.5 million, and IDA fourteen credits totalling US$1,696
million, in aggregate US$2055.5 million.  Of this amount US$1,420 million
involves financing of generating plant; US$23 million the purchase of
construction equipment for the Beas hydroelectric project; US$380 million
the provision of high voltage transmission; and US$232 million the
purchase of rural electrification equipment. Fourteen loans and credits
have been completed, nine for generating plant, the Beas project (Credit
89-IN), the first three transmission projects (Loan 416-IN, Credits 242-IN
and 377-IN) and the first rural electrification project (Credit 572-IN).
The Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN) is nearing completion and
the major part of the credit amount of US$150 million has been committed.
The Third Trombay Thermal Power Project (Loan 1549-IN) was approved in
April 1978 and is well underway. The Ramagundam Thermal Power Project
(Credit 874-IN and Loan 1648-IN) and the Second Rural Electrification
Project (Credit 911-IN) are in the preliminary implementation stage. The
credit for the Second Singrauli Thermal Power Project (Credit 1027-IN) and
the credit/loan for the first stage of the Farakka Thermal Power Project
(Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN) were approved in May and June 1980,
respectively.
L/  The following conversion factors were used:  1 ton of coal
equivalent (or 7 million kilocalories) is equivalent to 0.72
ton of crude oil and 3,030 kWh.



-5-
1.14      The Singrauli, Korba and Trombay projects are on schedule.  The
Farakka and Ramagundam projects, the Fourth Power Transmission Project and
the First Rural Electrification Project are proceeding satisfactorily
notwithstanding initial delays in implementation and the substantial delay
in preparation of specifications and review of tenders for the more
sophisticated load dispatch equipment for the transmission project.
1.15    A Project Performance Audit Report on the Second Power
Transmission Project (Credit 242-IN) was issued on June 3, 1980. The
Report stated that the project was successful in assisting the nine
beneficiary SEBs in extending their transmission systems in order to help
to meet their growing power requirements over the extended project period.
Utilization of the generating capacity in the nine SEBs exceeded the
appraisal forecast. Institutional objectives mainly concerned the
rehabilitation of the finances of the SEBs, and while the results achieved
by the time of project completion were modest, the improvement effort was
continued by the Third and Fourth Power Transmission Projects (Credits
377-IN and 604-IN respectively). In FY 1980 seven of the SEBs reached
their target rate of return of 9.5%. This compares with three in FY 1977
(the latest year by which all of the SEBs were to have earned a 9.5% rate
of return). The conclusions of the Report pointed to: (a) the
impossibility of adequately supervising the work on the project which
consisted of many sub-projects scattered all over India, other than the
procurement aspects and (b) the absence of a close working relationship
with the beneficiary SEBs which denied opportunities for effecting
institutional improvements. The Report suggested that a more direct
involvement with the SEBs in projects of this nature would be beneficial.
1.16    Besides its involvement in the power industry, the Bank Group is
also involved in India's oil and gas subsector. In 1977, the Bank made a
loan of US$150 million (Loan 1473-IN) for Phase III of the Bombay High
Offshore Development. This was followed in 1980 by a loan of US$400
million (Loan 1925-IN) for Phase IV of the same development. In view of
the considerable impact on the economy of increasing oil prices, the
acceleration of production from existing fields, essentially Bombay High,
remains an important priority. The Bank Group is also assisting GOI in
entering into oil exploration agreements with foreign oil companies, in
particular regarding (i) Government approach to negotiations; (ii)
contractual matters; and (iii) monitoring of the oil companies'
exploration and development activities after permits have been awarded.
With regard to natural gas, the Bank Group is cooperating with GOI to
ensure that the development of the South Bassein gas field, which is
capable of producing 18 million Nm3/day of non-associated gas, is carried
out in an optimal manner, and that a basis for longer-term gas resource
strategy is prepared in order to maximize the benefits of this new source
of energy to the economy.



Sector Institutions
1.17      The principal agencies in the industry are:  (i) the State
Electricity Boards (SEBs); (ii) the Atomic Energy Commission; (iii) the
Central Electricity Authority (CEA); (iv) the Regional Electricity Boards
(REBs); (v) the two central power corporations NTPC and NHPC; and (vi) the
Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd., (REC).
1.18      The SEBs are constituted by the State Governments under the
provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, to promote the
coordinated development of the generation, transmission and distribution
of electricity within their respective States in the most efficient and
economical manner, and for the control and regulation of other supply
undertakings which are private licensees. These comprise municipal
utilities such as the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Undertaking, and
private utilities, the largest of which are the Tata Electric Companies
(Bombay), the Calcutta Electric Supply Company (CESC), and the Ahmedabad
Electric Supply Company. At the present time, the States effectively own
or control well over 90% of electricity supply facilities. While the SEBs
are corporate entities in their own right and enjoy some autonomy in the
management of their day-to-day operations, they are under the control of
their State Governments in such matters as policy, capital investment,
tariff changes, borrowings, pay scales and personnel policies.
1.19      The CEA was formally created in 1950 with responsibility for
developing a national policy for power development and coordinating the
activities of the various agencies involved in electricity supply. At
that time, it came under the Power Wing of the Central Water and Power
Commission (CWPC). As a result of administrative changes introduced in
October 1974, responsibility for power was transferred to the Ministry of
Energy, which was created to bring together ministerial responsibility for
coal and power. This involved the transfer of the Power Wing of the
former CWPC to the CEA, which now comes under the Department of Power of
the Ministry of Energy and is responsible for developing a sound national
policy for the electricity supply industry. The Department of Atomic
Energy, which is directly responsible to the Prime Xinister, deals with
nuclear power generation.
1.20      CEA's powers were enlarged through amendments to the general
provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, which were enacted on
November 30, 1976. In addition to its general responsibilities for
national power policies, it is now responsible for the formulation and
coordination of plans for power development, optimization of investments
in the power sector for the whole country, development of interconnected
system operation, training of personnel, and research and development. It
includes specialist engineering organizations which provide comprehensive
project engineering services to the electricity supply industry. The
Thermal Department also takes responsibility for monitoring the



-7-
performance and maintenance records of thermal power stations and for
organizing the training of power station personnel. The Economic and
CommeLcial Department accumulates data on economic, finance and accounting
aspects of the power industry in India, both at Center and State levels,
with particular reference to the operations of the SEBs. CEA is playing a
leading role in advising State Governments and their SEBs on measures to
be taken to implement the amendments to the financial provisions of the
Electricity (Supply) Act 1948, which were enacted in June 1978, and which
provide for the operation of SEBs on more commercial principles with a
financial objective of achieving a reasonable level of self-financing.
However, the introduction by the States of financial policies to give
effect to these amendments has been delayed pending the publication of the
recommendations on this subject of the Committee on Power, and Central
Government directives concerning implementation of improvement measures
for the sector. The CEA has also embarked on a program of reform of SEB
accounting practices and steps to introduce a standardized system of
commercial accounting are now underway. It is hoped to commence
implementation of the new system by April 1982. When universally
implemented, this system will bring uniformity to the procedures relating
to the preparation of accounts and will lead to meaningful comparison of
SEB financial results.
1.21      The SEBs and the other licensed electricity undertakings are
required to submit their investment proposals to the CEA for technical and
economic appraisal and to the Energy Division of the Planning Commission
for inclusion in the Five Year Plan. The Planning Commission is
responsible for the allocation of plan funds among the States and among
sectors. Planning of generation, transmission, and distribution
development has traditionally been undertaken by each SEB for its own
State rather than on a regional or national basis. However, with the
rapid growth of the power sector, GOI recognizes the necessity for an
integrated national approach to sector development.
1.22      As a means of improving collaboration between the SEBs and
establishing power systems on a regional rather than a State basis,
Regional Electricity Boards (REBs) were set up for each of the Northern,
Southern, Eastern and Western Regions. The chairmanship of each REB is
assumed in rotation by the Chairman of the SEBs within the Region and they
are staffed by engineers seconded from their constituent SEBs. The
general functions of the REBs are to plan integrated operation of the
power systems in the Region for the maximum benefit of the Region as a
whole, coordinate overhaul and maintenance programs, determine generation
schedules to be followed and the power available for transfer between
States and determine a suitable tariff structure for the transfer of power
within the Region. At present, the Boards function mainly in an advisory
role in relation to the SEBs. As mentioned, the REBs were established
between 1964 and 1966 by common resolution of the State and Central
Governments, to help develop integrated power systems in the respective



-8-
Reg:ions, and thus prepare for the transition from separate power systems
at State level to regional systems and finally to an interconnected
nat:ional grid.
1.23      With most of their facilities under construction, NTPC and NHPC
are at present not in a position to take a leading role in the generation
and sale of power. At the present time, the construction of four large
central thermal power stations has been started as mentioned in paragraph
1.03. NHPC will construct and operate large hydroelectric projects. A
transmission wing has also been established in NHPC to design and
construct the 220 kV and 400 kV overhead transmission associated with
hydro-projects, and any other transmission work which it might be
comaissioned to undertake. In most States, the SEB will continue for some
time to be the largest power undertaking.  However, as the future planning
envisages a larger share of additional capacity in the central sector,
NTPC and NHPC shall be playing an increasing role in the power sector.
1.24      REC was incorporated in July 1969 under the Indian Companies
Act, 1965, as a company wholly owned by GOI, under the general supervision
of the then Ministry of Irrigation and Power (now under the Ministry of
Energy). REC's chief objective is to finance rural electrification
schemes throughout the country, acting as a financial intermediary with
tectLnical expertise, and administering funds received primarily from GOI.
It is REC's function to ensure efficient allocation of these funds by
estaLblishing policies, procedures, and criteria for the formulation,
approval and implementation of such schemes. In doing so, REC is directed
to adopt a "project approach," coordinating electrification with other
inputs in rural development in order to achieve increased agricultural
production and overall economic development.
Existing Facilities - All India
1.25      The total installed generating capacity in the whole of India as
of March 31, 1980 was just above 31,000 MW, including 2,736 MW of non-
utility capacity, mostly thermal, which is owned by major industrial
consumers to meet their own needs. The generating capacity is shown in
Table 1.1 below:

1.26      Transmission is at 400 kV, 220 kV and 132 kV, and
subtransmission at 33 KV. Distribution voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 V.
The supply, in general, is reliable, but power shortages, especially
during the summer months, necessitate load shedding, shutdowns and
brownouts. System losses are still high, accounting for about 20% of
units sent out. This subject has been examined by the "Committee on
Power" (para. 1.55).
Power Supply/Demand Balance - All India
1.27      India's installed power generating capacity increased at an
annual rate of 10% during the 1950s and 1960s while gross electricity
generation grew at just under 12% during this 20 year-period due to a
better utilization of generating capacity. Although local and
intermittent shortages did occur during this period, system failures did
not present a major problem. However, by the early 1970s, the supply
situation had grown more serious, and potential unconstrained demand
consistently outpaced supply in a number of states. This situation was
due to several factors such as: failure to implement projects in
accordance with planned schedules; inadequate transmission development;
operating and maintenance problems leading to a low plant availability
factor that at one point fell to about 64%; inadequate budget allocation;
and the absence of monsoon rains, particularly during the early 1970s,



-10-
leading to lower hydro output.
1.28      The shortage situation was most serious in 1974/75, 1977/78 and
1979/80, particularly in the Eastern Region. The estimated deficit of
eaergy throughout India (calculated as actual supply compared to potential
unrestricted demand) during the 1970s ranged between 5 and 15%. Estimates
for the current year (1980/81) indicate that the deficit is of the order
of 10%.
1.29      Power shortages, particularly in the industrial sector, have
affected the output of the country, and the cost in terms of industrial
production foregone has been substantial (generally, energy restrictions
fall on industry and there is relatively little loss to the economy on
account of power shortages in either the residential or agricultural
sectors). Lost value-added due to lost industrial production because of
power restrictions has been estimated to be in the neighborhood of 3% of
GDP.1/
1.30      The growth of the power sector during the last 10 years and the
pattern of consumption during tnis period is shown in Annex 1. Sales to
agriculture and irrigation increased substantially during the 1970s,
mainly because of the rural development programs. Industrial demand as a
proportion of the total demand has declined, and there has been a small
but steady increase in domestic demand. It is expected that this trend in
demand pattern will continue with a gradual improvement in the annual load
factor.
Future Development - All India
1.31      The countrywide peak demand supplied in 1979/80 was 19,139 M1W
(after supply restrictions); according to CEA's estimates, unconstrained
demand is expected to increase to about 22,500 MW by 1980/81, 19,000 MW of
which are expected to be met by available capacity. Installed capacity by
March 1981 is expected to have reached about 33,000 MW of which 30,300 MW
would be utility plant with a balance of about 2,700 MW non-utility.
1.32    India's tentative development program in the power sector
anticipates an expansion of generating capacity during the 10-year period
1980/81-1989/90 (including nuclear power plants) by about 50,000 MW to
eliminate supply shortfalls by the end of the decade, so that installed
capacity by March 1990 would be about 80,000 MW, an increase by about 180%
over the March 1980 capacity. Only about 60% of this additional capacity
had been approved by GOI as of January 1981: further approvals are

(World Bank Report No. 2335-IN, paragraph 68).



expected as resource availability in future years becomes clearer. The
additional capacity scheduled for commissioning during this period is
shown in more detail in Table 1.2. Furthermore, the construction of some
15,000 km of 400 kV transmission lines is planned to enable full
integration of the regional systems and the evacuation of the output from
the proposed new power stations.

1.33      Annex 2 shows annual projections of planned installed capacity,
available capacity, potential peak demand, and the forecast of energy
requirements and availability (not taking into account diversity) until
1990. The data referring to tne peak demand and energy requirement in
1979/80 show the demand constrained by supply: the estimated unsuppressed
power and energy demand would have been higher (para. 1.28). The
forecasts of peak load and energy requirements are based upon continuous
monitoring of development trends during the preparation of the annual
electric power surveys of India.
1.34      Both unconstrained peak demand and annual energy requirements
are projected by CEA to grow at an average annual rate of about 10% until
1990. If the program of generation development can be achieved on time,
the present shortage of energy (about 12% of potential demand) would be
eliminated from 1984/1985 onwards, but there would still be a peak



-12-
capacity deficit throughout the 1980s, only to be eliminated by 1990. The
forecast capacity deficit decreases from the present 15% of potential
demand to about 2-3% in the late 1980s, a margin which is smaller than the
degree of accuracy of the forecast data input. In addition, the
projections by CEA employ a very low expected availability factor of
generating plant. The peak availability in India under present operating
conditions is about 65% of installed capacity: the norms used by CEA in
establishing future availability of plant reflect this situation (Annex
3). An improvement in the availability factor, however, is likely because
of the expected development of system interconnection and better
maintenance practices: a small improvement after 1965 may have the effect
of eliminating the capacity deficit even before 1990. In the short-run
until 1985, little can be done to eliminate the present shortfall of
capacity.
1.35    The All-India data of Annex 2 mask vast differences in shortages
in different Regions, which develop because of insufficient
interconnection. The bulk of the aggregate deficit in the late 1980s is
attributable to the Northern Region: its regional expected capacity
deficit amounts to 10-15% of potential peak demand. In contrast, the
remaining Regions show an approximate balance of supply and demand after
1985.
Regional Demand and Supply - Western Region
1.36     The major authorities supplying the Western Region are the State
Electricity Boards of Maharashtra (MEB), Madhya Pradesh (MPEB), and
Gujarat (GEB), the Tata Electric Companies, the Bombay Suburban Electric
Supply Company, the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking
(BEST), and the Ahmedabad Electricity Company. The three State
Electricity Boards are public corporate entities under the control of the
State Governments, while Tata, Bombay Suburban, and Ahmedabad are private
licensees, and BEST forms part of the Bombay Municipal Corporation. In
addition, numerous small licensees and municipalities are engaged in power
supply. Most of the major supply authorities own generation facilities,
and all entities supply electricity to final consumers (Tata only to large
industrial ones).
1.37      Interchanges of energy and capacity are common, mostly in the
form of short-term peaking assistance between authorities (Annex 4). The
exception are the licensees, who purchase most of the energy needed for
their sales from SEBs.  The Electricity Department of the Union Territory
of Goa has no generating capacity and receives power from both the Western
and Southern Regions. Interconnection of the Western Region is
established to some extent, but operations are not yet fully integrated:
Maharashtra and Gujarat always operate in parallel, but Madhya Pradesh
joins parallel operations only occasionally, if its operations are not
integrated with those of Rajasthan in the Northern Region.



-13-
1.38      The major regional load centers are the greater Bombay area in
Maharashtra, the Baroda area in Gujarat, and a few small areas in Madhya
Pradesh. The energy consumption of the Bombay metropolitan area alone
accounts for about 20% of the total Western Region consumption, and almost
40% of Maharashtra's total. In line with the national pattern, regional
consumption is heavily oriented towards industry. About 63% of total
consumption is attributable to industrial consumers, 12% to agricultural
consumers for irrigation purposes, and about 10% to domestic. Madhya
Pradesh has a significantly higher industrial share of about 75%, partly
due to the high weight of aluminum production in the State. Maharashtra
is the dominant State in the Region, with about 53% of total sales of
energy (Annex 5). Sales in the Region have been growing at a steady rate
of about 8% p.a. between 1970 and 1980, most of this in periods of supply
restrictions. Generation growth in 1979/80 was a minimal 2%, largely due
to widespread supply difficulties (Annex 5).
1.39      System losses in the Region have been increasing during the last
five years, but despite the increase, they are still at a level of about
18% of units sent out, a figure below the Indian average.  Losses are
compounded by the extension of rural electrification programs thereby
introducing a wide-spread distribution system. This is evident in the
large State of Madhya Pradesh, where losses reach almost 23% (Annex 26).
1.40      As of March 1980, the total installed utility capacity in the
Region was about 7,800 MW, consisting of 72% thermal, 23%.hydro, and 5%
nuclear plant (Annex 7). In addition, about 6bO MW of captive industrial
generating plant (above 600 kW per set) exists in the Region. About 50%
of total regional capacity is located in Maharashtra. While installed
capacity has grown at about 9% p.a. in the period 1970/80, actual
available capacity showed a growth rate of only about 5% p.a.. A
significant deterioration in availability to only about 64% of installed
capacity occurred in 1979/80 (Annex 6). Given the energy consumption
growth of about 8% p.a., the increase in the load factor from 51% in 1970
to almost 70% in 1980 appears to have been almost entirely due to
suppression of peak capacity demand.
1.41      As in previous years, supply restrictions were severe in
1979/80, ranging from 10% to 40% of potential demand, particularly in
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh (Annex 8). The restrictions mainly affect
large industrial consumers and domestic and commercial consumption above a
minimum level. Agricultural demand is subject to irregular or scheduled
load shedding, but a minimum supply per week is maintained.
1.42      Potential unconstrained peak demand in the Region is expected to
grow at about 10% p.a. until 1990. As total installed capacity (derived
from identified generation projects and limited by expected resources
constraints) is anticipated to grow at about 11% p.a., and ava_lable
capacity at 12% p.a., the present estimated overall capacity shortage of



-14-
a,bout 15% of potential demand will be reduced to 2-3% by the mid-1980s,
and practically eliminated in the late 1980s. An increase in plant
availability from the present 63% to about 67% in 1990 is anticipated
(Annex 9). Much depends on (i) timely approval and implementation of
generation projects, and (ii) the actual improvement of availability of
existing installed capacity. In this precariously balanced situation, the
proposed project's 1,500 MW by 1988 will constitute about 13% of regional
peak demand (8% if the average regional availability is assumed for the
project) and may make the difference between balance or shortage.
1.43      Presently approved capacity additions in the Region are
predominantly thermal in the early years of the coming decade (more than
90% of new capacity 1980-85), but are increasingly moving towards hydro in
later years (30% hydro of new capacity 1986-90). This may reduce the
vulnerability of the Region to shortage of coal supplies and establish a
better hydro-thermal balance (Annex 10).
Future Integrated System Operation
1.44    With the increasing size of the power sector in India and its
far-reaching impact on the country's economy) annual surveys and Five-Year
Plans at the State level have become insufficient as a basis for power
development planning. The larger size of power plants, their consequent
longer construction period--in average six to eight years for thermal
plants and eight to ten years for hydro plants--as well as their gradual
interconnection require a long-range perspective for investment decisions
on a regional and national level.
1.45    In recognition of the need for coordinated power development
throughout the country, provision was made in Credit 604-IN to help
finance the cost of consultants to study the technical, financial and
economic aspects of a long-range national plan for the sector. Such a
plan should include, inter alia, detailed demand forecasts, investigation
of power generation schemes to meet load growth requirements for a 15-20
y(ear period (including costs and sequencing of investments to optimize
resources), development of primary grid configurations, (including the 400
k'V system study which CEA has started but has so far limited to a 1987-88
perspective due to lack of overall long-term planning of power plants and
coordination with plans for other sectors in determining resource
requirements), and recommendations on responsibilities and needed
operational policies at the State, regional and national levels. Such a
sltudy is an essential prerequisite for formulating sound policies for
future development of the sector and GOI has indicated its intention to
complete such a study by April 1982, based on the terms of reference
suggested by the Association (para. 1.51).
1.46   The operation of regional systems, which will be integrated in the
future into a national grid, requires large numbers of personnel who would



-15-
have to be trained in the use of sophisticated load dispatch equipment and
interconnected systems operation. Programs for training staff to operate
the future load dispatch centers have been set up by CEA, and the
Association is being kept informed about the development of these programs
under the Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-lIN).
Bank Group's Strategy in the Sector
1.47    The Bank Group's strategy in its involvement in the Indian power
sector, has been one of cooperation with GOI in seeking solutions to the
many difficult and politically sensitive problems which have confronted
the Indian electricity supply industry since Independence.
1.48    The Bank Group's main objectives in the sector are:
(a)  assistance in accelerating the installation of generating and
transmission capacity and promotion of measures to improve
the operation and maintenance of existing plant, in order to
gradually eliminate the prevailing power shortages in the
country;
(b)  assistance in introducing long-range system planning on a
nationwide basis which would assure implementation of a
least-cost power development program;
(c)  promotion of appropriate measures with respect to improving
the sector organization and training; and
(d)  strengthening of the finances of the institutions involved in
the sector, particularly of the State Electricity Boards
(SEBs), through setting of rate-of-return targets or levels
of self-financing and advising in design of appropriate
tariff systems.
1.49    Under the Constitution, power supply is a "concurrent" subject.
This means that the responsibility for supplying electricity is shared
between the Central Government and the State Governments, requiring full
agreement between the Center and the States for the implementation of most
actions. The States operate, and develop, through their Electricity
Boards, most of the power facilities. The consequence of this arrangement
in many instances has been a local or State approach where a national or
at least regional approach would have been more beneficial. Given these
difficulties, the improvements achieved so far have been encouraging.
They are the following:
(a) with the establishment of the Regional Electricity Boards
(REBs para. 1.22) and later of NTPC and NHPC, the first
important steps towards an improved organizational structure



-16-
of the power sector have been made. GOI intends to gradually
strengthen the authority of the REBs and to increase their
role of coordinating tne SEBs in matters of power development
and operations;
(b) CEA was reorganized and had its powers enlarged through the
amendment in 1976 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948
(paras. 1.19 and 1.20);
(c) The amendment in June 1978 of the financial provisions of the
Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 requires that tariffs be set at
levels sufficient to enable the SEBs to finance from internal
sources a reasonable proportion of their investment program;
(d) During FYs 1979 and 1980, SEBs have, with some success, been
developing and implementing plans designed to improve their
financial performance at least to the extent of achieving a
rate of return of 9.5% as agreed under previous transmission
credits/loans. These plans consist of tariff increases,
rationalization of manpower requirements, improved
maintenance practices and other cost effective measures;
(e)  with a view to the reassessment of tariff policies, the
majority of the SEBs have recently completed tariff studies
based on marginal cost pricing principles. The Bank Group's
review of tnese studies recommended the standardization of
certain assumptions so as to produce a uniform methodology
for general application by all SEBs.
(f) NTPC's generation/transmission construction program (paras.
3.01 and 3.02), which is in the process of staged
implementation with Bank Group assistance, will make an
important contribution to the gradual elimination of the
present deficit in the country's power balance, and is
planned in the national interest, a move away from the
provincial attitude prevailing in the past with SEBs
constituting the almost exclusive source of power supply.
The proposed project would help to continue this program.
1.50    There are two specific areas which have been the cause of concern
to the Bank Group and also have been the subject of a continuing dialogue
with GOI. There are:
(a) the weakness of nationwide long-range planning for power
development; and
(b) the weaK financial position of some SEBs.

1.51    So far, long-range power planning on a nationwide basis has not
been carried out in India, a major reason for the unreliable power-supply
in the country. The only regular planning activities carried out in the
past were on a state-wide basis in the context of the various five year
plans and the Annual Power Reviews. Consequently, discussions were held
with the Indian authorities both on the content of a long-range power
development study designed to prepare a least-cost power development
program and on CEA's capability to undertake such a study with its own
staff.  GOI agreed with the terms of reference suggested by the Bank
Group.  The study is underway and is to be completed by April 1982 (para.
1.45).  During negotiations the status of preparation of the study and the
timing of the completion of its different parts was discussed with GOI
(para. 6.01a).
1.52    While the financial performance of some SEBs (the sole prospective
customers of NTPC) has been marginal in the past in achieving the 9.5%
rate of return, covenanted under previous lending operations for power
transmission and rural electrification projects, there was a big
improvement overall during FY1979 and FY1980 when, out of a total of
sixteen major SEBs, eleven and thirteen SEBs, respectively, reached or
exceeded the target. This compares with seven and six in FY1977 and
FY1978, respectively (see Annex 11, Attachment 1 for further details).
The implementation by these SEBs of action programs designed to restore or
maintain their target rates of return has proved effective in most cases.
In the case of Uttar Pradesh SEB, the subsidization by the State
Government of rural electrification losses 1/ under conditions of
eligibility for the Second Rural Electrification Corporation Project
(Credit 911-IN), has enabled the SEB to reach its target rate of return
for the first time. Overall, the SEBs' performance for FY1981 is expected
to be maintained at the FY1980 level.
1.53    In the context of this project, special attention was given to the
SEBs of the Western Region which would be recipients of Korba
power/energy. The Western Region comprises the States of Gujarat,
Aaharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and the Union Territory of Goa. The actual
results of these SEBs for FY1980 together with five year projections
through FY1985 are set out in Annex 11, Attachment 2. In each case, the
covenanted rate of return of 9.5% is assumed to be either maintained or
exceeded.
1.54    Considering its increasing level of involvement in the Indian
1/ In accordance with Credits 604-IN, 572-IN, and 911-IN,
subsidies in respect of rural electrification losses are
to be included in "operating income" in calculating the
annual rate of return.



-18-
power sector, more comprehensive information on the sector was requested
by the Bank Group during negotiations of the Farakka Thermal Power Project
(Credit 1053-IN/Loan 1887-IN). This request was formally made to GOI in
June 1980 when a suggested format for the monitoring of technical and
financial performance of the sector was forwarded to GOI for review and
approval. During appraisal, the reporting format was further reviewed
with CEA. GOI assured IDA that more comprehensive reports on both the
technical and financial aspects of the performance of the power sector
will be provided annually within one year following the close of the
Indian fiscal year to which they relate (para. 6.01b).
1.55    The Indian authorities have recognized that with the rapidly
expanding power sector in the country, all aspects of the sector have to
be reviewed and that satisfactory solutions have to be found for the
various sector problems. Consequently, GOI established the high-level
committee in November 1978, called the "Committee on Power" under the
chairmanship of V. G. Rajadhyaksha, former member of the Planning
Commission.  This committee was assigned the task to examine and make
recommendations for improvement of the power sector. It completed its
task. and submitted its conclusions to GOI in September 1980. They refer
to all major aspects of the power sector including: planning, project
formiulation and implementation; operation and maintenance; organization
and management; finance, financial management and tariffs; rural
electrification; and research and development. The recommendations of the
"Committee on Power," most of which are in line with the Bank Group's
strategy form a useful basis for improvement of India's power sector in
all its aspects.
1.56    Implementation of some of the Committee's recommendations is
already underway on those aspects which do not require GOI's approval,
e.g., better planning procedures and improved operating and maintenance
management. Although other important recommendations made by the
Committee may have considerable impact on long established structures and
deep routed habits, it is of the utmost importance that GOI acts
expeditiously in initiating the implementation of measures to bring about
the required improvements.
1.57    In addition to the actions already discussed with GOI (paras. 1.51
and 1.52), the Bank Group considers that actions to accelerate the
improvement in the following areas are of high priority:
(a)  Performance of thermal power plants:  the measures to be
taken should focus on achieving a better utilization of the
rated capacity through improving maintenance practices,
overcoming delays in the supply of spare parts, reducing the
duration of maintenance shut-downs, improving the quality and
flow of coal supplies and upgrading the skills of personnel
engaged in operation and maintenance;



-19-
(b) Co-ordination of power development and growth in other
sectors: in connection with the long-range power development
plan, demand forecasting which is currently done on the basis
of unrestricted power supply should be related to realistic
projections limiting the growth of demand to the available
supply; this would be accomplished by adjusting the
connection policy for new consumers and by stressing
conservation and demand management measures for existing
consumers in order to make the optimal use of the installed
generating capacity.
(c) Intensification of hydroelectric development: only 11% of
the economically exploitable potential has so far been
developed (para. 1.08); the measures to be taken should
include not only increased investment allocation, but also
appropriate project preparation procedures through
managerial, technical and administrative improvements.
(d) Strengthening of the role of the Central Sector in power
generation and inter-state high voltage transmission: the
current transition from local grids to regional grids and
then to a national system should go in parallel with the
implementation of adequate institutional structures, which
should permit gradual shifts of the responsibility of
planning and operating power plants and inter-state
transmission linkages of 220 kV and above, from State level
to national level.
(e) Establishment of financial objectives and policies for their
implementation, principles for evolving a rational tariff
policy and improvements in management information and
accounting systems for each SEB: to comply with the
provisions of the financial amendments to the Electricity
(Supply) Act 1948 (para. 1.20), in terms of improving the
SEB's self-financing capability to the extent of producing a
reasonable contribution towards future expansion, alternative
methods of financing of the SEBs must first be evaluated in
order to determine the impact both on consumers and on State
budgets.
1.58    The concern of the Bank Group with regard to the above-mentioned
areas of India's power sector is also reflected in the recommendations of
the Committee on Power. During negotiations, GOI accepted to provide to
the Bank Group, by April 1982, an implementation plan and schedule
outlining the steps to be taken in each of the five priority areas of
power sector improvements (para. 6.01c).

II. THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
Legal Status and Authorities
2.01]   NTPC, the beneficiary of the proposed credit, was established in
1975 under the Companies Act, 1956. The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948,
has been amended to give the Corporation statutory recognition. NTPC is a
company wholly owned by GOI under the general supervision of the Ministry
of Energy. Its initial authorized share capital of Rs 1,250 million
(US$149 million) was increased to Rs 8,000 million (US$1,000 million) in
June 1980. The Corporation has a Board of six Directors.
2.02    The Companies Act, 1956, confers broad powers on NTPC to carry out
its work.  However, the tariffs to be applied as well as any changes in
such tariffs, its investment plans and annual capital budgets, have to be
approved by the Government. NTPC is also subject to periodic examination
by the Committee on Public Undertakings--a body established by GOI to
monitor the performance of public sector enterprises.
2.03    The main objectives for which the Corporation was established are:
(i) to design, construct, and operate large central thermal power
stations and the associated transmission systems;;and
(ii) to transmit and sell the power generated.
NTPC will initially own and operate the associated 400 kV transmission
system over which power will be distributed from each plant and sold in
bulk to SEBs. Later these systems will be part of the 400 kV
interconnected regional systems which, still later, will be integrated
into the national grid.
2.04    NTPC's present program provides for the construction of four
thermal power stations (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka). It is
also possible that NTPC might ultimately take over ownership of the 510 MW
Badarpur station near Delhi which is at present being managed by NTPC on a
management fee basis. The station is presently planned for an ultimate
capacity of 720 MW. The feasibility of installing two more 210 MW units
which will increase the capacity of this station to 1140 MW is being
investigated. NTPC has also undertaken investigations for identifying
additional sites for thermal power stations in the central sector. Based
on these studies feasibility reports submitted by NTPC for pithead
developments at Wardham (Madhya Pradesh), Kehalgaon (Bihar), Talcher
(Orissa) and Pench (Madnya Pradesh) are under consideration with GOI.
Feasibility studies for other sites, i.e., Singrauli II (Uttar Pradesh)
and Mangur (Andhra Pradesh) are under formulation. The total capacity to
be installed at these sites is likely to be about 5,000 MW while the
ultimate potential is estimated to be nearly 14,000 14W. GOI is expected



-21-
to take decisions regarding time phasing of capacity installation at these
sites only after the finalization of the Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-85).
Organization and Management
2.05    NTPC's organization which at present is necessarily construction
oriented is shown in Annex 12, page 1. The complete range of management
systems for all disciplines implemented and under formulation are shown in
Annex 12, pages 2 and 3. The systems are being progressively implemented
at the corporate center and project sites. The organization is adequate.
2.06    NTPC has adopted a three tier organizational structure.  The first
tier consists of the corporate functions of Planning, Marketing, Personnel
and Finance which are entrusted with normal corporate level responsibilities,
activities such as the development and formulation of policies, and their
implementation. The other services relevant to the projects (second tier),
have been centralized as Service Divisions located at headquarters. These
are Technical Services, Contract and Procurement Services, Quality Assurance
and Expediting, and Project Management Services.
2.07    The third tier, which embraces project activities, consists of a
project organization for each of the four power plants under construction.
Each project organization is headed by a General Manager who is entrusted
with total responsibility for implementation of all aspects of the
project's construction program.
2.08    Good progress has been made in building up the organization since
1975 when NTPC was established. The Chairman and Managing Director was
appointed in early 1976 and the number of staff appointed by January 1981
was 3,119 comprising 885 executives, 213 executives in training and 2,021
non-executives. These include 145 executives and 493 non-executives for
the Korba power station. Out of this, 17 executives at Korba are for
operation and maintenance of the first 2OU MW unit scheduled for
commissioning in January 1983. NTPC has also taken over the majority of
the employees of the Badarpur Project and Power Station (para. 2.04).
2.09    To date, NTPC has developed along sound lines.  Although its
Chairman and Managing Director, who is a competent administrator with an
established reputation in the formulation and development of large
industrial undertakings, was appointed Secretary of the Ministry of Energy
and is only able to devote a reduced amount of time to NTPC, the well-
trained staff has been able to carry on the work without noticeable
interruption. Remarkable progress has been made in all activities in the
four years since his appointment and providing this impetus can be
maintained with no deterioration in management, NTPC should with the
assistance of consultants, be capable of handling the present large
development program. Site organizations are effectively functioning at



-22-
all projects. The centralized functions which, in addition to corporate
personnel, are planning and finance, provide the engineering, contracting
and project management input. They are organized to meet the project
requirements and to ensure an effective coordination of the projects under
construction.
Training
2.10    NTPC is a young organization which is growing rapidly to meet the
demands of its large construction program. The next phase of expansion
will involve the need to recruit and train operating staff. When all
current developments have been completed and commissioned, NTPC's
establishment will have grown from a present 3,119 to a figure in the
aeighborhtood of 15,000.  The importance, therefore, of implementing
training programs for the various expertises required during the
construction and operational phases cannot be too highly stressed.
2.11    Deliberately, NTPC has placed special importance on this aspect of
its organization, and training programs are being developed by the
Corporation which will, in due course, be backed by a training school
equipped with 200 MW and 500 MW simulators, financed from the proceeds of
Credits 793-IN and Credit 1053-IN, as well as other modern facilities for
instructing and training the operating staff.
2.12    NTPC's training programs which so far have concentrated on
preoperational spheres of activity such as Planning, Design, Construction
and Management, are now additionally being aimed at its operational
sphere. Some of the current major activities are:
(a) Professional engineering training for Executive Trainees
(Engineering).
(b) Professional engineering training for Supervisory Trainees
(Engineering).
(c) Management development programs.
(d) Seminars and lectures on selected topics.
(e) Familiarization courses for both accounting and managerial
staff on the accounting systems and procedures being
implemented.
Recruitment of young executive trainees is mainly from engineering
graduates belonging to mechanical, electrical and civil disciplines on
appointment, who are inducted into a one-year training program. The first
group of young executive trainees was recruited in February 1977, the
second in December 1977 and the third by mid-1978, comprising 35, 45, and



-23-
84 members, respectively. The fourth group comprising 131 trainees was
recruited in November 1979 and training commenced in November 1980. The
training programs have been well designed to provide exposure to power
stations under construction and operation, equipment manufacturing plants,
engineering descriptions and project management services. For these
purposes, assistance is taken from a large faculty of experienced
engineers and managers selected from all over the country. NTPC is also
utilizing the facilities of the Central Electricity Generating Board
(U.K.) for training of operation and maintenance staff.
2.13    With the first 200 MW generating unit scheduled to commence
commercial operation in FY1982, NTPC has finalized comprehensive plans for
training operational staff, particularly the non-supervisory staff in the
various technical and non-technical trades, to provide foremen for the
first two units at Singrauli. The manpower for these is being drawn from
experienced staff as well as from fresh recruitment. Recruitment of
manpower has commenced and key personnel, such as the station
superintendent, are already in position. Sixty-three executives including
those experienced in power plant operation and ninety-five supervisory
staff are in position at Singrauli. Recruitment of operation manpower
also commenced at Korba and seventeen executives are in position.
2.14    On-the-job training has high priority.  The methodology includes
classroom lectures, participation in group exercises and discussions
supported by direct reading, audio-visual presentations and plant visits.
Overall training plans and arrangements at this time are satisfactory.
Sale of Power from the Project
2.15    As in the case of NTPC's other projects being financed with Bank
Group assistance, GOI has undertaken to allocate at least 85% of the
proposed project's power/energy to the States in the region in which the
project is located. The remaining 15% will be sold in accordance with
priorities to be determined by CEA to States with the greatest need.
Consequently, agreement was reached to this effect during negotiations
(para. 6.Oid). Furthermore, undertakings confirming their willingness to
purchase 85% of the project's output were received from the SEBs of
Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. A similar undertaking from the
Union Territory of Goa will be made available shortly.
Accounting Organization and Systems
2.16    NTPC and its consultants continue to report good progress in the
planning of NTPC's finance and accounting organization (Annex 13) and in
the design and implementation of accounting systems and procedures. The
design of accounting systems for both the construction and operational
phases of NTPC's activities has been completed. Implementation of systems
for the construction phase is either complete or at an advanced stage both



-24-
at the corporate center at headquarters, and also at the sites, while the
consultants' proposals for the operational phase are at an advanced stage
of discussion with management. To familiarize staff with the systems and
procedures, training courses are being conducted by the consultants in
conjunction with staff members from NTPC's corporate center.
Audit
2.17    The audit of NTPC's accounts and records is undertaken by a
professional auditor appointed by the Company Law Audit Board, on the
recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The
auditor is normally a member of the Indian Institute of Chartered
Accountants, and his audit report on NTPC's financial statements is
subject to comment by the Auditor General. Auditors Messrs. V.K. Mehta
and Company, Chartered Accountants, Delhi have audited NTPC's accounts
since its incorporation up to and including FY 1979 and their audit
reports have expressed satisfaction at the state of the company's affairs
during this period. For the audit of the accounts for FY 1980 two
auditors were appointed, Messrs. Raghu Nath Rai and Company and Messrs.
Prasad Azad and Company, both firms of Indian Chartered Accountants.
There were no adverse comments from the auditors on the accounts for FY
1980. It should be borne in mind that NTPC's activities will cover only
project construction until FY1982 when power will be sold for the first
time. NTPC has already undertaken in connection with previous credits and
loans to furnish to the Bank Group audited financial statements within
seven months of the end of the fiscal year to which they relate, together
with a certified report by the auditors, and a review of the accounts by
the Director of Commercial Audits. This has been repeated in the
documents of the proposed Credit (para. 6.Ole).

III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01    NTPC's current development program, comprising the four central
thermal power stations of Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka, with
associated 400 kV transmission, is part of India's power development
program which is described in paragraphs 1.31 through 1.35. The four
power plants, totalling 8,300 MW, have been located at coal fields, since
it is more economical to transport electricity than coal to the load
centers.
3.02    The first stages of the four central power stations consisting in
each case of three 200 MW generating units and associated transmission are
under construction. The commissioning of the power plant units is
scheduled between February 1982 (first 200 MW unit at Singrauli) and April
1990 (last 500 MW unit at Farakka).
The Project
3.03    The project represents the second stage of the Korba development
comprising three 500 MW units with associated transmission totalling about
1,100 km of 400 kV lines. This extension would bring the power plant to
its final installed capacity of 2,100 MW.
3.04    The Korba development which is described in detail in Annex 14 is
being constructed on the right bank of the Hasdeo River in the Bilaspur
District of Madya Pradesh, just downstream of an existing barrage at Darri
(see attached maps).
3.05    The coal for the project will be supplied from the Government-
owned (Coal India Ltd.) Gevra open cast mines of the Kusmunda Block
located adjacent to the power plant. It is estimated that about 1,140
million tons of mineable coal is available in the area between the Hasdeo
River and Kusmunda village, about 10 km inland. There are two thick
seams, the Lower and Upper Kusmunda, within quarriable deposits on the
Western side of Hasdeo River, with proven reserves of 326 million tons and
51 million tons, respectively. The coal requirements of the power plant
will be met from the Kusmunda II mine, an on-going project approved by the
Government. This mine is expected to attain its rated output of five
million tons by 1987-88. Phased development of Kusmunda II is proposed to
meet the additional coal requirement above five million tons. The power
plant with its final installed capacity of 2,100 MW would require about
7.8 million tons of coal annually. Demand would build gradually to 2.3
million tons by 1986-87 for the first stage of three 200 MW units. The
additional requirement for the second stage of three 500 MW units (the
Project) would commence from 1986-87 reaching 5.5 million tons by 1991-92.
Additional output from the planned expansion of the Gevra mine would be



-26-
available from 1986-87 on and would be adequate to meet the coal
requirement of the Korba development.  As in the case of the first stage,
GOI agreed during negotiations that necessary steps will be taken to
ensure adequate coal supplies for the efficient operation of the power
plant (para. 6.01f).
3.0b    The cooling water for the power plant will be supplied from the
adjoining irrigation canal on the right bank of the Hasdeo River, which
can be used for direct cooling. The water from the condenser discharge
would be passed into a hot water pond and from the pond can be released
directly into the canal during the irrigation season.  Alternately, when
the canal is closed, it would be pumped to cooling towers for closed
circuit cooling. Studies of the availability of cooling water indicate
that the gross cooling water surface area available in the existing Darri
reservoir at water level of 286.5m (940 feet) above sea level is adequate
to sustain an installed capacity of about 1,800 MW by pond cooling
corresponding to a cooling water temperature of 34 degrees C. The present
installed capacity of the existing east bank power station owned by MPEB,
is 420 MW. Another unit of 120 MW, which is under installation, is
expected to be commissioned in 1981. Of this total capacity of 540 MW,
100 MYW is on cooling towers and the balance of 440 MW will be based on
pond cooling/direct circulation system. On the right bank of the canal,
in addition to the NTPC power plant, a 840 MW thermal power station is
Deing set up by MPSEB. The existing Darri reservoir could sustain by pond
cooling the existing 420 MW SEB plant and the 840 MW plant currently under
construction, plus the first stage of the NTPC Korba plant aggregating 600
MW. The Bango dam which is to be constructed for irrigation, about 35 km
upstream of the Darri Barrage, will increase the flow of water by an
additional 75m3/sec and 65m3/sec in normal and lean years, respectively.
This would provide sufficient water for the total capacity of the NTPC
power plant (2,100 MW) as well as for the existing and future capacities
of the MPSEB thermal power stations and local industry. The Bango dam
was approved by GOI in March 1980 and is being implemented by the Madhya
Pradesh Government. The construction period for the Bango Project is
expected to be about six years which would match the requirements of the
Korba development.
Estimated Cost
3.07    The estimated cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, duties and taxes, is Rs. 9,921 million (US$1,240 million).
On the assumption that most of the contracts will be won by Indian
suppliers, the direct and indirect foreign currency costs are estimated
at about Rs. 3,29b million (US$412 million) and the local currency cost at
Rs. 6,625 million (US$828 million).  The estimated costs of the project
are set out in Annex 15 and summarized in Table 3.1 below:

plants and on the costs of 400 kV facilities at various locations in
India. Physical contingencies of 10% on civil works and of 5% on plant
and transmission costs have been allowed to provide for unforeseeable
factors. In assessing price contingencies, it has been assumed that
contracts will be fixed price or with ceilings on price inflation for the
plant equipment as was the case for NTPC's other projects under
construction. Costs for equipment and erection have been escalated at 15%
for FY1981, 9% for FY1982, 8% for FY1983, 7% for FYs 1984 through 1986 and
b% yearly after FY1986.

Project Financing
3.09    The proposed credit of US$400 million, representing about 32% of
the cost of the project (excluding duties and taxes and interest during
construction), would be applied to the CIF and/or ex-factory costs of
plant and equipment, excluding the 500 MW turbines and generators and
associated equipment. The latter would be financed by Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau (KfW) of Germany which has been requested by GOI, and is
expected to extend a loan of US$150 million equivalent to support the
proposed project in financing those parts of the 500 SW turbo-generator
units which will be manufactured in Germany (para. 3.13). Civil works,
plant erection costs, inland transportation costs, interest during
construction, duties and taxes and any other costs not financed from the
credit or KfW, would be financed by GOI in the form of loan and equity
share capital.
Engineering and Construction
3.10    Consultants (United Engineers, U.S.A.) were appointed under
previous credits and loans granted for NTPC's program for 500 MW units to:
(i) review NTPC's basic engineering and design; (ii) assist in the more
sophisticated areas of design; and (iii) review specifications, as
required by NTPC and the Association. This arrangement will also benefit
the project. Supervisory services for erection and commissioning of the
main equipment, such as turbo-alternator units and steam generators, would
be provided by the manufacturers of the equipment. The engineering
services would also include overvoltage studies for NTPC's 400 kV systems.
NTPC has carried out comprehensive overvoltage studies by using digital
computer models. As the digital model is limited in the representation of
the various non-linearities, NTPC has proposed to conduct system studies
of various associated system components and analysis of overvoltages
through the transient network analyser (TNA) technique also. The TNA
studies would examine overvoltages likely to occur on the 400 kV system
under various conditions of switching, load rejection, line to ground
fault, rapid reclosures, etc., and would verify the amount of reactive
compensation necessary for the control of dynamic overvoltages. The costs
of these studies are proposed to be financed from the consultancy
provision in the proposed credit. The engineering consultancy
requirements are estimated at about 80 man-months, at an average cost of
US$10,000 per man-month, including salary, costs, fees, international
travel and subsistence.
3.11    The project comprises a number of major works which must be
carefully coordinated to ensure efficient progress. To this end, NTPC has
developed comprehensive project management systems, including program
coordination and supervision of construction of the power stations and has
already appointed a foreign consultant firm (United Engineers, U.S.A.) to
review these systems and their initial implementation. The review was



-29-
taken up in January 1981 and is expected to be completed in six to nine
months. To ensure an effective coordination of the projects under
construction, NTPC uses PERT charts, which not only plan the progress of
various physical activities but also indicate the phasing and quantum of
inputs such as financial resources, manpower of different types, scarce
materials, etc.
3.12    The project construction schedule is shown in Annex 16.  Project
completion is expected by December 1988.
Procurement
3.13    Procurement of all equipment to be financed from the proposed
credit would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Association's guidelines. Documents for individual
contracts above US$2,500,000 equivalent would be subject to prior review
by the Association. Bidding documents for such equipment, including
tender analyses and recommendations for award of contracts, would be
prepared by NTPC with the assistance of its consultants, and approved by
the Bank Group. To facilitate contract coordination, the invitation to
tender for major plant contracts would be on a supply, deliver and erect
basis. This could include civil works in certain cases where these cannot
be disassociated from the plant contract--i.e., coal handling, substation
structure, and transmission lines. Local manufacturers would be expected
to bid for all categories of equipment. A domestic preference of 15% or
the import duty, whichever is less, would be applied in bid comparison for
equipment contracts. To prevent administrative procurement delays, in
case the lowest evaluated bidder is a foreign manufacturer, GOI has agreed
that it would grant import permission for such items without further
review by any agency of the Government (para.6.01g). There are competent
local contractors in India and also manufacturing facilities covering most
of the equipment for the project. All goods not financed from the
proposed credit (and from the expected KfW loan) will be subject to local
procurement procedures, which are satisfactory. The 500 MW turbines and
generators are being built by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL)
under licence from Kraftwerk Union (KWU)-Germany. A considerable portion
of the first unit would be manufactured in Germany, while an increasing
part of the second and third units would be built by BHEL. KfW would
finance those parts manufactured in Germany.
Disbursement
3.14    Disbursements from the proposed credit would be made against 100%
of the cost of consultants retained for the 500 MW units and the TNA
studies (para. 3.10), and against the cost of the equipment to be financed
from the proposed credit on the following basis:
(a) 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment procured in India



-30-
after international competitive bidding; and
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of equipment procured from abroad. The
estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 17.
Ecological Aspects
3.15      The ecological and environmental aspects of the project were dis-
cussed during appraisal. GOI confirmed that the Kroba development had
received the approval of the Indian National Committee on Environmental
Planning for the final installed capacity of 2,100 MW and NTPC agreed to
comply with all environmental quality standards prescribed by this
committee in the design, construction and operation of the project.
3.16      As in the case of the first stage of the Korba development, the
principal environmental concerns with the proposed project are: (a)
location; (b) stack emission; (c) heat dissipation; (d) ash disposal; and
(e) effluent discharge. These are outlined below:
(a) Location. The proposed Korba power station is a pit head
station and is situated far from any urban area. Accordingly,
there are no problems other than the need to ensure the
health and environment of the operating staff who will be
housed in a residential area to be constructed some 4 km from
the power station.
(b) Stack Emissions. Electrostatic precipitators with an
efficiency of 99% will be installed and the stack will be
220 m high to ensure that emitted particulate matter will
be spread over a sufficiently wide area to reduce the density
of pollutants to an acceptable level. Dust emission at the
stack outlet will be limited to 300mg/m3. The sulfur con-
tent of the coal is in the range of 0.3% to 0.6% which is
low and does not present a pollution problem. The ambient
concentration of S02 and dust at ground level is estimated
0.07 mg/m3 and 0.05 mg/m3, respectively.  This is well
below the threshold limits. The above target figures of
stack emissions will be monitored after commissioning of
the power plant through analysis by chemical and physical
methods of carefully collected samples.
(c) Heat Dissipation. The cooling water system adopted for the
project is a combination of a once-through system and a closed
circuit system with cooling towers. The rise in temperature
of water in the right bank canal when the once through system
is being used is estimated to be only 1°C and would not affect
the marine life.



-31-
(d) Ash Disposal. The ash will be pumped as slurry through a
pipeline to an ash dump area located on the west bank of the
Hasdeo river. Water from the ash disposal area will also be
discharged in the river. Tests at other locations have shown
that this does not have any detrimental effect on the
ecological system and that the downstream water is fit for
irrigation purposes. To reduce pollution due to windblown
ash, trees are being planted around the ash disposal area.
(e) Effluent Discharge. The effluent from the water treatment
plant will be neutralized suitably in neutralizing pits and
discharged into storm water drains. Any oil spillage from the
fuel oil storage area and transformer yard will be drained
to a separate drain and absorbed in the ground through
percolation in soak pits. Sewerage from the plant and
township area will be treated before discharging it into a
natural stream.
3.17    With regard to the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating personnel
must confirm, will be strictly enforced. As far as noise levels are
concerned the turbine hall of a modern steam turbine power station, which
is the noisiest area of the plant, has a sound pressure level of less than
90 decibels which is well below the maximum acceptable threshold for the
normal 8 hour/day shift worker. All the control rooms will be provided
with sound proof doors, windows and walls.
Project Risks
3.18    The project represents one phase of an overall development program
which comprises 8,300 14W of generating plant and some 7,000 km of 400 kV
transmission. It is part of a tightly designed program with plant and
transmission coming in at phased intervals throughout the period 1982
througn 1991. Maintaining this program on schedule requires careful
coordination and expert supervision at all levels. The principal risk is
the possibility of slippage which could give rise to delayed commissioning
of plant and loss of revenues. With a program of construction of this
magnitude, there is no guarantee that some delays will not occur, but
these will be kept to a minimum through careful coordination and
supervision during construction and careful attention, when placing
contracts, to the capability of manufacturers to meet the delivery
schedules.
3.19    Other risk areas are in engineering design, equipment quality,
cost overruns and problems of commissioning and operation during the early
operational stage with resultant loss of revenues. There is also the risk
of damage due to fire, explosion, etc., but this is covered by insurance
provided by the respective contractors during the construction stage and



-32-
by G01 through its self-insurance policy after commissioning.
3.20    These risKs have been carefully assessed and the following
safeguards taken:
(a) NTPC is being assisted by consultants and sub-consultants,
and this should minimize problems due to error at the
engineering and design stage;
(b) plant and equipment costs are based on similar works
currently in progress in India; provision has been made for
cost escalation and there should be little risk of any
substantial cost overrun; and
(c) a number of large generating units will have been in
operation for some years before the project is commissioned,
thus providing experience and trained manpower for the
project.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Investment Program
4.01    NTPC is currently in the fifth year of an investment program which
originally envisaged the construction of four large thermal power stations
with an aggregate capacity of 7,300 MW, together with almost 6,000 circuit
kilometers of associated 400 kV transmission lines, at an estimated cost
of about Rs 41,000 million(US$5,125 million). The power stations and
transmission facilities were to have been commissioned on a phased basis
during the period February 1982 through March 1988. However, because of
slippage, rescheduling and expansion'of the construction program, the
investment program has been subject to continuous review during the past
five years, with appropriate revisions being made to the program for the
project appraisals of £amagundam (Credit 874/Loan 1648-IN), Second
Singrauli (Credit 1027-IN) and Farakka (Credit 1053/Loan 1887-IN).
Further updating was done during appraisal of the proposed project. The
revisions were necessary to reflect:
(a) increases in the expected base prices of equipment;
(b) increases in price contingency factors because of higher
expected rates of inflation for the period of construction of
the balance of NTPC's investment program;
(c) slippage and rescheduling in the commissioning dates of
individual generating plants;
(d) the addition of 1,000 MW (two 500 MW units) to the final
installed capacity of the Farakka station; and
(e)  additional transmission facilities at Singrauli, Ramagundam
and Farakka.
4.02    The financial impact of the latest revision is to increase the
estimated cost of the initial investment program by about 63% (Rs 25,720
million, US$3,215 million) with the additions to the generating capacity
and transmission facilities accounting for about Rs 10,700 million
(US$1,338 million) or 42% of the increase. Finance for the increased
investment program costs would come from increased internal resources
arising mainly during the three year period of the extended construction
program (from end FY1988 to end FY1991), and from GOI in a combination of
long term loans and equity share capital. Financial statements showing
both past performance and future forecasts of NTPC's operations are set
out in Annexes 18 through 20.



-34-
Future Earnings
4.03    NTPC will commence commercial operations in February 1982 when its
first 20U MW generating unit at Singrauli is expected to be commissioned.
Additional generating capacity, scheduled for commissioning during the
succeeding nine year period, is set out in Annex 21, page 1, para 2(a).
NTPG's projected earnings are based on the assumption that NTPC would
supply bulk power at 400 kV to State Electricity Boards at a tariff level
which would enable it to earn a reasonable return on its investment. This
was defined in connection with previous Bank Group support of NTPC's
projects as being a tariff level sufficient to produce a rate of return of
not less than 9.5% on the book valuel/ of the average net fixed assets in
service in FY19892/, and applied from the date of commissioning of the
first generating unit at Singrauli in 1981/82. However, mainly because of
the rescheduling of the 500 MW unit construction program, energy sales in
FYIS189 would fall to a level of only about 60% of maximum. Accordingly,
bearing in mind that establishing an acceptable tariff structure and level
with,out being uncompetitive is of major importance and considering that in
any event, NTPC's tariff level would be influenced more by actual
operating costs and investment program at the time when energy would be
sold for the first time, the extension in the rate of return qualifying
year to FY1991, when sales volume would approach 90% of maximum, was
agreed during negotiations.
4.04    The income statements set out in Annex 18 show the projected
operating results of NTPC from FY1982 through FY1992. The forecast
average bulk supply price would be 31.7 paise (US cents 4.0) per kWh,
excluding fuel surcnarge, on the basis of the FY1991 forecast. This price
is used to project the annual revenues each year from FY1982 through
FY1991 and has also been maintained thereafter. The price level compares
with 29.1 paise (US cents 3.6) per kWh calculated at the last revision of
the investment program in March 1980 for the appraisal of the Farakka
Project and based on a qualifying rate of return year of 1988/89.
Increases in projected operating costs, profit requirement (both because
of increases in the capital base brought about by increases in forecast
plant costs and additional generation and transmission facilities) and
interest costs (due to withdrawal of loan/equity capital on a 1:1
project-wise rather than program-wise basis, and the increase in the GOI
onlending rate from July 1, 1980 of 0.5% to 10.75% thereby increasing the
1/ There are no requirements within India, either statutorily
or for commercial accounting purposes, to note fixed asset and
depreciation data at current price levels. The equivalent in
real terms of a 9.57. rate of return on a rate base stated at
historic cost in FY1991 is about 7.0% (Annex 22).
2/ The first fiscal year in which all generating units at
Singrauli were projected to operate at their maximum capacity.



-35-
cost of financing the balance of NTPC's investment program) have been
partially offset by the increased sales volume of FY1991 and have resulted
in the increase in the bulk supply price and the impact on projected
future earnings. Minor losses in FYs 1982 and 1983 are acceptable as part
of NTPC's development program. NTPC will become profitable in FY1984 and
earnings will rise rapidly thereafter, following the rapid commissioning
of plant from FY1984 through FY1991, and will reach the stipulated rate of
return of 9.5% in FY1991 when the investment program will have been fully
commissioned. Because of the decision taken in 1980 to expand the Farakka
station's capacity by 1,000 MW, additional earnings will accrue from
FYl990 onwards on the incremental output. The rate of return would
accordingly rise to 11.8% by end FY1994 when all generating units in each
of the stations would be operating at maximum capacity. Earnings
performance is satisfactory.
4.05    The regulation of NTPC's annual earnings is a function imposed on
GOI by the amendment to section 75A of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948.
Under the amendment, GOI is required to specify the quantum of annual
surplus to be earned so as to provide from internal resources a reasonable
contribution to capital investment, after providing for dividends on
equity share capital. Under present assumptions, internal resources would
not be adequate to meet these commitments until FY1988. In any event,
earnings regulation would only commence in FY1982 when NTPC would become
revenue earning and when the appropriate amount of surplus would depend,
in part, upon NTPC's future investment program at that time. Accordingly,
it is premature to specify a surplus at this stage, other than to state
that the covenanted rate of return of 9.5% would be retained as a minimum
requirement in FY1991 and thereafter.
4.06    As in earlier credits and loans, it was restated for the proposed
credit that, as long as no different decisions, acceptable to the Bank
Group (emanating from the recommendations of the Committee on Power) have
been made, NTPC would achieve in FY1991 and maintain thereafter a rate of
return of not less than 9.5% on the net fixed assets in operation, and
would set tariffs from the time the first generating unit at Singrauli is
commissioned at levels not lower than estimated to achieve the required
9.5> rate of return in FY1991 (para. 6.01h).
Taxation
4.07    NTPC is liable for income tax under the Indian Income Tax Acts.
However, because of the large capital expenditure program between FY1979
and FY1991, liability to tax will not arise in the foreseeable future and,
accordingly, a tax equalization reserve is not necessary.
Internal Cash Generation FY1977-FY1992
4.08    Forecast source and application of funds statements covering



-36-
NTPC's current investment program are set out in Annex 19. Because of
slippage and the rescheduling of the commissioning dates mainly of the 500
MW units of the second phase station developments, the duration of the
initial construction program has been extended by three years through
FY1991. The rapid buildup of internally generated funds shows that by
FY1990 NTPC would be in the position of accumulating surplus funds, which
in tuarn, would build up rapidly thereafter. No dividends on equity share
capital are included in the forecasts on the assumption that surplus funds
would go towards the expansion of NTPC's activities beyond its current
investment program l/. Recently, GOI announced NTPC's activities would be
expanded in the future (para. 2.04). With the exceptions of the initial
three years of operation, internal cash generation would cover annual debt
service and working capital increases by at least 1.4 times, which is
satisfactory.
NTPC's Financing Plan FY1982-FY1989
4.09    The following table sets out the financing plan for the eight year
period during which the project would be under construction.
1/ Since March 1980 the investment program was expanded by some
Rs1O,700 million (US$1,338 million) for a 1,000 MW extension of
the Farakka station and additional transmission facilities at
Singrauli, Ramagundam and Farakka stations (paras. 4.01d and e
and 4.02).

4.10      The financing plan covers the proposed project construction
period, and being a time-slice of NTPC's total investment program covering
the period FY1977 through FY1991, provides for construction of the ongoing



-38-
Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam, Farakka and Second Singrauli Projects, and
the proposed Second Korba Project, together with the balance of the
generation and transmission construction program discussed at paras. 3.01
and 3.02. The investment cost of the proposed project represents almost
20% of construction expenditures in the financing plan.
4.11    The proposed credit would be onlent to NTPC by GOI in accordance
with an acceptable onlending agreement as a condition of effectiveness of
the credit (para. 6.02). As in previous operations, the terms of the
onlendLing agreement would provide for maturity in 20 years, including a
grace period of five years, and repayment of principal in equal semi-
annual installments, with interest payable on outstanding balances at
10.75% per annum. This is the rate of interest at which GOI currently
lends to industrial and commercial undertakings in the power sector. The
rate shows an increase of 0.5% since July 1980 and compares with about
13-15% from domestic lending institutions for similar types of lending.
The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government. Assurances
were received during negotiations that GOI would provide the balance of
funds required to complete the project on terms satisfactory to the
Association and to provide any additional funds which might be required
due to cost overruns or other unforeseeable factors (para. 6.01i).
4.12    IDA financing of the proposed project, US$400 million, together
with Bank Group financing of NTPC's investment program to date, in
aggregate US$1,550 million, represents about 21% of the total costs
involved, excluding duties, taxes, and interest charged to construction.
Future Finances
4.13    Actual and forecast balance sheets as at March 31 annually from
FY1977 through FY1992 are shown in Annex 20. The balance sheets reflect
the build-up of the construction program, the commencement of commercial
operations in February 1982, and the financing of NTPC's capital
requirements by GOI through a combination of long-term borrowing and
equity capital, in a ratio which would normally not exceed 1:1. Project
wise, equity would be released initially followed by loan capital later.
Table 4.2 shows NTPC's projected financial position at three significant
points in its development:
(a)  at March 31, 1982 - end of the year when NTPC would become
revenue earning;
(b)  At March 31, 1989 - end of the year following commissioning
of the proposed project; and
(c)  at March 31, 1991 - end of the year in which the last
generating unit in the investment program would be
commissioned.

4.14    These forecasts show that by March 31, 1982, just after the point
at which NTPC would become revenue earning, total capitalization would be
Rs 11,903 million (US61,488 million), divided between GOI loans (including
the onlending of Bank Group finance) and equity capital in a ratio of
19/81. Seven years later - end of FY1989, after the proposed project
would be completed - total capitalization would have risen to Rs 61,746
million (US$7,718 million) with a debt/equity ratio of 46/54. Due to the
completion of the current investment program, no new debt is forecast
after FY1989. This situation, combined with the significant increases in
internal cash generation, has led to the downward trend in the debt/equity
ratio to 40/60 by FY1991 when total capitalization would have reached Rs
62,709 million (US$7,839 million). NTPC's authorized share capital would
be raised progressively during the period FY1982 through FY1987 to reach a
figure of almost Rs 31,000 million (US$3,875 million). It is currently Rs
8,000 million (US$1,000 million).

Borrowing Powers
4.15    The Companies Act 1956 (Section 293.ld) restricts borrowing by
NTPC to within a sum equal to the aggregate of the paid up share capital
and "'free reserves" (i.e., those which are not set apart for a specific
purpose), except with the consent of the corporation in general meeting.
During negotiations, NTPC agreed to inform the Bank Group beforehand of
any proposal to alter or modify existing limitations on the borrowing
powers of its Board of Directors (para. 6.01j)
Commercial Arrangements for Sale of NTPC Energy
4.16    Under covenants of previous credits and loans NTPC has undertaken
to draw up bulk supply contracts for the sale of energy under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank Group. NTPC also intends to complete
all the necessary commercial arrangements prior to the sale of energy from
each project. In order to ensure that all the necessary commercial
arralngements are properly finalized prior to the first sale of energy by
NTPC (from Singrauli station in February 1982), GOI and NTPC agreed at
negotiations to forward to the Bank Group a final draft of the bulk
contract for the sale of energy from the Singrauli station, at the latest
by September 1, 1981. NTPC also agreed to sell the output of power from
the proposed project to SEBs under bulk supply contracts, satisfactory to
the Bank Group, (para. 6.01k), a final draft of which would be forwarded
to the Bank Group by July 1, 1982 (six months prior to the first sale of
ener,gy from the Korba station).
4.17    NTPC recognizes that the regionalization of its bulk tariff would
better reflect the nature of its individual thermal power stations as
integral parts of regional power systems, at least until a national power
grid is established. This could be achieved in a manner acceptable to the
Bank Group and compatible with NTPC's tariff covenant with the Bank Group
(para. 4.06) by applying the tariff formulation on an individual station
basis to better reflect different cost components as between regions. The
following regional tariffs would emerge:
Paise/kWh
Singrauli                Northern Region                       23
Korba                     Western Region                        30
Raiu,-vaundam             Southern Region                      41
Fara&ia                  Eastern Region                        34
Average                   All Regions                           32
Vari,ations in the above regional tariffs reflect regional differences in coal
prices, investment timing and lcvel of energy output in FY1991.

V. JUSTIFICATION
General
5.01    The proposed project, defined as the expansion by 1,500 MW of the
first 600 MW stage of the Korba thermal power station and associated
transmission investment, is justified as the least-cost solution to meet
part of projected base load demand in the Western Region from 1986/87 onwards.
The project's economic internal rate of return is about 15%.
5.02    The minimum of about 7,500 GWh (net of auxiliary use) sent out
per year from the project from 1991 onwards (first output is scheduled
for 1986/87) will contribute about 8% of total energy supply to consumers
in the Region. This is a significant marginal contribution if seen
against the precarious balance that is expected to be achieved in the
Western Region by 1990 even if all identified projects come on stream
on time.
Comparison of Alternative
5.03    Given the existing and forecast power shortages in the Western
Region (paras. 1.41 and 1.42), the need for additional capacity is
urgent. The necessary base load capacity addition of the required
size and reliability can be provided by thermal pit-head plant
of the type proposed under the project. Concurrent SEB and licensee
investment plans provide for complementary hydro capacity development to
cover peaking requirements (Annex 10). No additional nuclear capacity is
planned in the Region until 1990. A fully integrated system of regional
investment planning is now being created: steps have been taken by GOI
in consultation with IDA to formulate a least-cost long-term investment
plan for the Indian power sector by April 1982, a significant improvement
for purposes of future analysis of investment decisions (para. 1.51).
5.04      The only realistic alternative solution to the incremental 1,500 MW
of Korba is advanced implementation of smaller coal-fired stations that are at
present identified for later construction by individual SEBs. The
theoretically most attractive solution is the expansion of existing sites.
The obstacles in this approach are that the expansion potential of
existing sites is limited, and that many expansion projects are already
allocated to be developed concurrently with Korba.
5.05      The alternative consisting of smaller stations would encompass
one new site (Pench pithead site in Madhya Pradesh), expansion of two
sites under construction (Chandrapur pithead site in Maharashtra, and
Birsinghpur pithead site in Madhya Pradesh), and an expansion of an
existing site (Gandhinagar load-center station in Gujarat), with a



-42-
combined capacity equal to that of the proposed project. The Gujarat
site would require transport of coal. The three larger pithead stations
range in size from 400 to 500 HW, while the load-center station expansion
amounts to about 200 MW. An appropriate allowance for transmission
investment is included in the cost of the alternative solution, reflecting
the different needs for power evacuation in the case of scattered
individual stations (Annex 23).
5.Ob      All costs are expressed in economic terms, i.e. in CIF/FOB prices
where available, and adjusted by the appropriate conversion factors to
border prices where necessary. Unskilled labor has been shadow priced
at 75% of the market wage, skilled labor at full market wage. The economic
cost of coal was derived from production cost (as estimated by Coal India)
expressed in border prices (Annex 24). The cost of both the project and
its alternative are phased to provide capacity and energy in the same
pattern (Annex 25).
5.07      The present value of the cost stream of the project is lower than
that of the alternative at any discount rate. The project, therefore,
constitutes the least-cost solution for satisfying the future 1,500 MW
portion of base load demand in the Western Region gradually from 1986
onwards.  Annex 29 shows the present values of the cost streams of both
options, assuming an opportunity cost of capital of 10. as the discount
rate, with a discount rate of 13% as a sensitivity test. The cost
advantage for the project in present value terms amounts to about
Rs 1,500 million (US$188 million) at 10%, and about Rs 1,300 million
(US$163 million) at 13%. Under the most pessimistic assumption in the
sensitivity analysis (project cost increase by 10% and alternative cost
decrease by 10%), the cost advantage for the project remains intact.
Cost-Benefit Analysis
5.08      A two-stage approximation approach has been adopted for the
quantification of economic benefits arising from an expansion of
generating plant that is integrated into an existing and growing system:
(i) average retail tariffs in the Region have been assumed to represent
a proxy for the minimum willingness to pay for power; and (ii) in order
to quantify any additional consumer surplus beyond this minimum, the
cost incurred by industrial consumers in maintaining and operating standby
generating sets has been assumed to represent a proxy for industrial
consumers' maximum willingness to pay for continuous power supply.
Both of these assumptions are conservative.
5.09      The incremental amount of energy sold is adjusted to account
for ;system losses typical for the Region.. The weighted average of 1980
tariff revenue at retail level in the Region has been estimated at
Rs 0.32/kWh (US$0.04/kWh), and converted to border prices for purposes
of tl-e comparison with economic cost. The industrial tariff revenue



-43-
of about Rs 0.27/kWh (US$0.03/kWh) is replaced by the observed average
willingness to pay for continuous power supply, amounting to about
Rs. 0.40/kWh (US$0.05/kWh) in economic terms (Annex 26).
5.10      Corresponding to the definition of economic benefits as
willingness to pay at the retail level, additional costs of transmission
and distribution investment (including operating and maintenance expenses)
have been allocated to the cost of the project in line with the general
Regional investment pattern (Annex 27). This additional cost is net of
the transmission element already included in the project cost. Benefit
and cost streams are presented in Annex 28.
5.11      The minimum economic rate of return is about 15%, falling to
about 12% if more pessimistic cost and benefit assumptions are tested
(Annex 29). The true internal rate of return is likely to be considerably
higher than the minimum quantifiable estimate, if the derived consumers'
and producers' surpluses of industrial, agricultural, and commercial
output made possible by the alleviation of shortages is taken into account,
and if indirect benefits accruing to the Indian economy would be fully
considered. Furthermore, benefits accruing to domestic consumers are
likely to be understated by the use of the tariff as benefit proxy.
Tariffs
5.12      Using only retail tariffs as measure of the benefit, the internal
rate of return of the project is about 12%, falling to about 9% with the
most pessimistic scenario (Annex 29). These results indicate that retail
tariffs including electricity duty in the Region are econo.ically
approximately adequate to ensure an acceptable return on the proposed
project.
5.13      The expected financially justified bulk supply tariff of about
Rs 0.30/kWh (para 4.17) that NTPC intends to charge its consumers
receiving power from the project is compatible with the other bulk exchange
tariffs between SEBs that are expected to prevail in the Region, and, at the
time of stabilization and full output from the project, with the average
accounting cost of generation as calculated by SEBs (Annex 30). This
implies that, at the time of first sales from the project, no major
difficulties should be expected in the willingness of prospective NTPC
customers to pay a price that is financially satisfactory for NTPC.
5.14      Similarly, the economic marginal cost of NTPC operations
projected for 1986/87, the first year of sales from the project, is
close to the intended bulk supply tariff at about Rs 0.27/kWh in border
price terms, and about Rs 0.31/kWh if converted back to domestic prices.
The marginal cost recovery by NTPC, therefore, will be satisfactory in
economic terms if the presently planned bulk supply tariff will be applied
to project output (Annex 31).

VI.   AGREEMENTS REACdED AND RECOMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations the following issues were discussed with
GOI and NTPC and satisfactory agreements or assurances were obtained
with. regard to:
(a) the status of preparation of the long-term development
plan and timing of the completion of its different parts
(para. 1.51);
(b) regular reporting by GOI on technical and financial aspects of
the power sector (para. 1.54);
(c) measures to accelerate the improvement with regard to:
performance of thermal power plants., co-ordination of power
development and other sectoral growth, intensification of
hydroelectric development, strengthening of the role of the
Central Sector in power generation and inter-state high voltage
transmission, and establishment of financial objectives and
policies (para. 1.58);
(d) sale of power from the project (para. 2.15);
(e) audit (para. 2.17);
(f) provision of adequate coal supplies (para. 3.05);
(g) import permission without Government review (para. 3.13);
(h) rate of return and tariffs (para. 4.06);
(i) provision of the balance of capital to complete the
project, together with any additional funds which
might be needed due to cost overruns or other
unforeseeable factors (para 4.11);
(j) borrowing (para. 4.15); and
(k) commercial arrangements for sale of NTPC energy
(para. 4.16).
6.02      Effectiveness of the Credit would be conditional on the conclusion
of an acceptable onlending agreement between GOI and NTPC (para. 4.11).
6.03      Subject to the foregoing, the project forms a suitable basis for
a credit of US$400 million.

SECOND KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
CEA Norms for Estimating Capacity and Energy Availability
1. Thermal
(i) Effective Capacity: In the case of existing thermal generating
units the derated capacity, if any, is considered. In the case
of newly commissioned thermal units, no benefits are taken
during the first three months after the unit is commissioned
and subsequently 50% of the capacity during the next 9 months,
and thereafter full benefits are considered.
(ii) Retirement of old sets: Deduction on this account are made at
X percent ot the installed capacity available at the end of
the base year 1977-78 and it is increased cumulatively at ½
percent per year.
(iii) Planned Maintenance: The figures for planned boiler and
capital maintenance have been obtained from a computer study
conducted to optimise the maintenance schedule. A period of
4 weeks per year for boiler maintenance and an extra allowance
of a further 4 weeks once in three years to account for capital
maintenance have been considered.
(iv)  Forced Outages:  These are calculated at 18.5% of the balance
of capacity available each month after allowing for retirement, and
planned and capital maintenance.
(v) Partial Outages; This is calculated at 10% of the capacity
available for operation after accounting for the forced
outages.
(vi) Auxiliaries: This is calculated at 9%-.of the capacity available
for operation after accounting for the forced outages.
(vii) Norms for energy calculations: The basis on which the energy
on an annual basis is assumed for existing and new generating
units is as given below: -



-48-
ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 2 pages
For new units at 2,500 kWh/kW gross during the first year,
4,000 kWh/kW gross during the second year, 5,000 kWh/kW
gross during the third year and 5,350 kWh/kW gross during the
fourth and subsequent years. These figures account for
energy losses due to planned maintenance and all types of
outages.
2. Hydro
(i) Generating Availability: The generating availability figures
are based on the designed head conditions and water flows on
a month-to-month basis computed for a 90% dependable year.
(ii)  Retirement:  Deductions on this account are made at ½ percent
of the installed capacity available at the end of the base
year 1977-78 and are increased cumulatively at ½ percent per
year.
(iii)  Planned maintenance:   It is assumed that as
tar as possible the hydro generating units are maintained
during lean periods only, keeping in view the peak system
demand to be met vis-a-vis the hydro generating availability
obtainable in each month during the year.
(iv) Capital Maintenance:

SECOND KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Financial Performance of the State Electricity Boards
1.      The problems associated with the SEBs' financial performance have
been the subject of continuing dialogue with GOI. Under previous transmis-
sion credits/loans, the beneficiary SEBs undertook to achieve and maintain
rates of return after tax of 9.5% (on a rate base stated at actual cost), in
some cases on a graduated basis, in order to take account of individual cir-
cumstances (see Attachment 1). In all cases the 9.5% rate was to be achieved
in FY1979. Results have been moderately succcessful, but with a wide varia-
tion in performance between SEBs. By FY1977, seven 1/ out of the sixteen
major SEBs achieved their target rates of return, with a further two SEBs 2/
reaching their targets in FY1978 with the help of rural electrification sub-
sidies from their State Governments under the conditions of eligibility for
the First Rural Electrification Project (Credit 572-IN). Uttar Pradesh SEB
reached 9.5% in FY1979 mainly through receiving a subsidy from its State
Government on rural electrification losses, under eligibility criteria of the
Second Rural Electrification Project (Credit 911-IN). Eleven SEBs reached
their targets in FY1979 and preliminary results indicate that thirteen will
do so in FY1980. This represents a big improvement during FYs 1979 and 1980
and can be attributed to remedial action taken by the SEBs coupled with the
beneficial effects of direct subsidization of rural electrification losses by
State Governments in accordance with the conditions of the First and Second
Rural Electrification Projects (Credits 572-IN and 911-IN). Of the SEBs not
reaching their targets, Assam is affected by political unrest and is in a
difficult position; Bihar is under investigation with a view to implementing
a rehabilitation program; Haryana suffered unusually high RE losses because
of preferential allocation of power to agriculture in conditions of severe
drought (Haryana does not as yet benefit from a rural electrification subsidy
from its State Government). With the exception of the SEBs of Rajasthan and
Uttar Pradesh (where rates of return will probably fall back somewhat from
9.5% because of lumpy additions of fixed assets to the capital base in
FY1981), and the DESU, where electricity duty is extremely high at 8-10%
relative to a target of 1.5%, other SEBs are expected to maintain their
agreed 9.5% rates of return.

and Tamil Nadu.
2/ Andhra Pradesh and Punjab.

2.      The main reason for the poor financial performance of some of the
SEBs is that tariffs have not kept pace with increases in operating costs,
thus not ensuring that a healthy ratio between operating income and capital
base is maintained during periods of expansion. Other major factors which
have adversely affected financial performance are: low availability of plant
due to technical problems and difficulties in coal supply, and of power
imports from neighboring State systems, and increased cost of these imports
because of a higher proportion of expensive thermal power where previously
cheaper hydro power was available. It can be justifiably argued that the
situation faced by some SEBs did not constitute "normal circumstances" and
that the achievement of agreed rates of return could not realistically be
expected. The introduction of rehabilitation programs to achieve a corporate
rate of return of 9.5% have been relatively successful. However, from a com-
mercial point of view, even this performance is marginal in that a rate of
return of 9.5% was not sufficient to enable some SEBs to meet their debt ser-
vice requirements to their State Governments.
3.      The financial provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, were
recently amended to put the operations of the SEBs on a more commercial basis
by enabling them to generate internally a reasonable contribution to their
capital investments. Under the Amendments (Section 59(1)), the State Govern-
ments are now required to specify the level of annual surplus which should be
earned by their SEBs to enable them to comply with the amended legislation.
The manner in which this will be achieved is a subject which has been under
evaluation by both the State Governments, in conjunction with their SEBs, and
by the Committee on Power whose report and recommendations are currently
being reviewed by GOI. Complex issues are involved which will require
"tailoring" by each State Government to meet the particular circumstances of
its SEB, while at the same time giving due consideration to State resources
and impact on consumers. CEA has issued guidelines to the State Governments
and the SEBs explaining these issues and pointing out the measures that need
to be taken by each of them and the options which are available.
4.      The guidelines emphasize the following:
(i) special steps to increase sales volume;
(ii) economies in both operating costs and capital expenditures;
(iii) more efficient asset utilization;
(iv) timely commissioning of new projects;
(v) reduction in line losses;

ANNEX 11
Page 3 of 3 pages
(vi) improved financial management;
(vii) tariff revisions to reflect cost of supply;
(viii) capital structure adjustments - SEBs may now receive funds from
the State Government in the form of share capital, and State
Government loans may now be converted into share capital;
(ix) disposal of arrears of State Government loan interest; and
(x) basis for charging depreciation of fixed assets.
5.      Because of the far-reaching consequences of the above measures, the
State Governments and their SEBs are awaiting the formulation by GOI of sec-
tor improvement measures which will emerge from GOI's review of the report of
the Committee on Power. GOI has assured the Bank that new policy suggestions
will be discussed with the Bank at an early stage. The Bank's comments on
the recommendations of the Committee of Power will be forwarded to GOI
shortly.

INDIA
SECOND KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Description of the Korba Development
1.       The Korba development is the second of a series of large thermal
power stations planned by the Government of India to feed into a 400 kV
interconnected transmission system of the Western Power Region and supply
bulk power to the States of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and the
Union Territory of Goa. The 2,100 MW power station is being installed at
Korba in Bilaspur District of Madhya Pradesh.
2.       The development will include six generating units with boilers,
ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment and associated 400 kV trans-
mission facilities. The First Korba Project (Credit 793-IN) consists of
three 200 MW units, 650 km of 400 kV transmission network and a training
simulator. The Second Korba Project will consist of three 500 MW units and
1,082 km of 400 kV associated transmission network.
3.       The 200 MW turbines are three cylinders, 3000 rpm tandem compound
double flow exhaust type reheat units operating at 150 kg/cm with a steam
temperature of 535 C. The generators with a rated output of 235,000 kVA have
a direct water cooled stator and a direct hydrogen cooled rotor. The boilers
are natural circulation, pulverized fuel fired, dry bottom, balanced draft
type using direct firing system.  Each boiler will have a maximum 5ontinuous
rating of 670 t/h with a super-heater outlet pressure of 156 kg/cm and a
temperature of 540°C. Each 200 MW generating unit will be connected to a
240 MVA generator transformer and will feed power into the 400 kV system.
4.       The 500 MW turbines will be three cylinder reheat condensing type
having one H.P. cylinder, one double flow IP cylinder and one double flow
LP cylinder with initial steam conditions of 170 kg/cm2 (abs) and 537°C/537°C.
The generators are rated at 588 MVA and will be hydrogen and water cooled.
The boilers will be controlled circulation pulverized fuel fired, balanced
draft type using the direct firing system.  The boilers will have a continuous 2
evaporation rating of 1725 t/h with a super-heater outlet pressure of 178 kg/cm
and temperature of 5400. Each generating unit will be connected to its three
single-phase transformers of 200 MVA, 20-24/420 kV having one spare trans-
former for the three units of 500 MW.
5.       The salient features of the development are:
POWER STATION
Capacity -    2100 MW (3x 200 MW + 3 x 500 MW)
Fuel     -    Coal from the Gevra open cast mines

of the Kusmunda block located at a distance of
about 12 km from the project. Consumption of the
2100 MW power station at 5,500 hours operation
per year is 7.81 million tons per year.  The gross
calorific value of the coal averages 3,500 kcal/kg.
The coal has an ash content of 40 to 50% and a
moisture content of 6 to 7%.
Transport      A captive railway system with bottom discharge
of coal -    wagons which are unloaded while moving.
Cooling        The cooling water system envisaged for the project
system  -    will be a combination of once through cooling, as
and when water availability permits, along with
recirculating system employing cooling towers.
Cooling water will be drawm from the right bank
canal taking off from the Darri lake created by
the construction of the Darri barrage across the
Hasdeo river. During the period when the water
is released for meeting the irrigation demand,
circulating water will be drawn from the right bank
canal for cooling and hot water discharged down-
stream in the canal. During the period when there
is no irrigation release, the hot water will be
recirculated through cooling towers and only make
up water provided by the right bank canal.
A cross regulator is being constructed across the
right bank canal. A common intake structure and
channel will be provided for the water requirement
of the power plant. The intake channel will be
bifurcated to feed the two pump houses for the
three 200 MW units and the three 500 MW units.
The water will be pumped by cooling water pumps
into intake ducts to a seal well and then to a hot
water pond. From the hot water pond water can be
released either to the canal during direct circula-
tion or alternatively taken to the cooling tower
through the hot water pump house. Cool water from
the cooling tower will flow back into the right
bank canal to be pumped to the condensers.
Ash
disposal -   Ash is pumped as slurry through a pipe to the ash
disposal area of about 810 hectare (2000 acres)
situated at a distance of 4 km from the power station
between the right bank canal and the Hasdeo river.
A bund will constructed all around the ash disposal
area. The height of the bund will be raised in stages.

Land      -   A total area of approximately 1600 hectaie (3,750
acres) of land is required including 324 hectares
(800 acres) for the power plant and coal transport
system, 810 hectares(2,000 acres) for ash disposal
and 203 hectares(500 acres) for the residential
colony. Out of the above, over 1,134 hectares
(2,800 acres) of land is already in NTPC's possession.

(f) O&M Expenses
Power Station - 2.5% on original cost of 200 MW plant
- 2.0% on original cost of 500 MW plant
Transmission - 0.5% on original cost
(g)  Depreciation
Power Station - 3.1% of original cost
Transmission - 2.6% of original cost
NOTE: Section XVII(8) of the 6th Schedule of the Electricity
(Supply) Act 1948, provides for depreciation "from
the beginning of the year of account next following
that in which the particular asset became available
for use in the business." Under recently enacted
financial amendments to the Act, in the future,
depreciation is to be charged in accordance with
directions to be issued by GOI. GOI has issued
notifications annually which make no change as yet
in the 1948 Act provisions.
(h)  Tariffs.  NTPC has an obligation to achieve a rate of return
of not less than 9.5% on the forecast average net fixed assets
in service by FY1991, and from the commencement of its commer-
cial operations in FY1982 to set tariffs at levels not lower
than those required to achieve a 9.5% rate of return on the
forecast data for FY1991. On this basis, and bearing in mind
the time it takes for the generating plant to reach an operating
level of 5,500 hours a year, the average price of 31.73
paise/kWh calculated on the FY1991 estimates, is assumed as the
average price for all sales from February 1982.
(i)  Fuel.  Fuel costs are based on the prices per ton shown in
paragraph 2(c) and escalated until FY1982. Thereafter a fuel
clause is assumed in the bulk supply contract, to permit
adjustment to meet any further variation in fuel costs. The
effect of any fuel price variation is shown separately in the
forecast expenses and recovered by means of a fuel surcharge.
(j)  Rate Base
(i)  Singrauli.  Construction costs are based on 1980 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below except where
orders have been placed when escalation is applied from
award date onwards. The main plant equipment costs for
the three 200 MW phase are, however, based on the award
made in 1978.

(ii) Korba. Construction costs are based on 1980 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below.
(iii)  Ramagundam.   Construction costs are based on 1978 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below; however,
the main plant equipment value for the three 200 MW units
is based on the actual awarded value in 1980.
(iv) Farakka. Construction costs are based on 1979 prices
escalated at rates given in the schedule below.
(v) Escalation Schedule
Price Escalation:
a. 15% per annum for FY1980-81
b. 9% per annum for FY1981-82
c.  8% per annum for FY1982-1983
d.  7% per annum for FYs 1983/84 through 1985/86
e.  6% per annum for FYs 1986/87 through FY1990/91
The turbo-generators and boilers are, however,
subject to the following maximum price escalation from the
date of order:
Singrauli 200 MW units - 25%
Korba, Ramagundam and
Farakka 200 MW units   - 20%
500 MW units for all   - 15% turbine generators
projects                  20% steam generators
Physical Escalation:
Civil works             - 10% of construction costs
Equipment               - 5% of equipment costs
(k) Capital Requirements
(i)  The proposed loan and credit would be relent by the GOl
to NTPC for a period of 20 years from the date of with-
drawal of the first installment including a five year
initial grace period, and repayable in equal semi-annual
installments of principal, together with interest at the
rate of 10.75% per annum on unpaid balances.



-89-
ANNEX 21
Page 5 of 5 pages
(ii) Other capital requirements would be advanced by GOI in
the form of debt and fully paid up equity capital,
provided that the unpaid debt at the end of each year
would not exceed the sum of the issued share capital
and the "free" reserves, that is to say, those which
are not required for specific purposes. Advances would
be in the form of equity capital followed by loan
capital taken project-wise.
(iii) GOI loans (including the onlending of both the proposed
credit and also previously approved credits and loan)
are assumed to finance either defined projects or
individual generating units and transmission lines
included in NTPC's investment program. Interest on the
loans up to the date of commissioning of each unit of
plant would be charged to construction, and subsequent
interest accruals would be charged to revenue. Repay-
ment of principal is assumed in 30 semi-annual install-
ments commencing on the first anniversary following the
end of the five year grace period.
(1) Working Capital. Variations in working capital represent the
differences between the sums of the individual items making
up current assets less current liabilities at the beginning
and at the end of the year.
(m)  Balance Sheets (Annex 20)
Current Assets
(i)  Receivables are assumed at a level equivalent to one-
twelfth of the revenue for the year;
(ii) Inventories are assumed at 1% of gross assets at the end
of the year; and
(iii) Current liabilities are assumed at a level of one month's
fuel cost, plus 4% of the annual operating and mainten-
ance expenses.

SECOND KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Shadow Pricing of Cost and Benefits
Conversion Factors
1.         Where CIF or FOB prices of tradeable goods (or tradeable inputs
into only domestically manufactured goods) are not readily available, the
following factors are used to convert non-traded goods' domestic costs to
border prices:
Standard conversion factor:          0.87
Capital goods conversion factor:    0.78
Shadow Wage Rate
2.         Before converting labor cost to border prices, using the Standard
Conversion Factor, the following assumptions about the economic value of
labor are made:
Skilled labor:         100% of market wage
Unskilled labor:        75% of market wage
About 60% of the total labor cost of the project in terms of 1980 constant
market prices are assumed to be attributable to skilled labor.
Economic Cost of Coal
3.         Rather than using the domestic administered price of coals its
economic value is expressed by identifying the average production cost in
India, and converting the cost components by using appropriate conversion
factors.   Labor cost is assumed to consist of 50% skilled and 50% unskilled
labor; stores to consist of capital goods and local materials; costs of
capital goods are converted at the capital goods conversion factor, other
expenditure at the standard conversion factor. The economic cost of coal
is about Rs73 per tonne (in this case very close to the actual price expected
to be charged NTPC at Korba).

4.         For the alternative to the project, the cost of coal at the Gujarat
load center site includes transport from the closest location. The long-run
marginal cost of coal transport by rail, as calculated by NTPC, amounts to
Rs 0.08 per tonne-Km for diesel traction, and Rs 0.06 per tonne-Km for electric
traction.
Opportunity Cost of Capital
5.         A range between 10% and 13% is assumed to reflect the estimated
rate of return on public investment in the economy.
Benefits
6.         The alternative use of funds allocated to tariff payments by consumers
and to expenditure on other proxies for benefits of electricity supply, is
assumed to be expenditure on a basket of tradeable goods. Consequently, the
standard conversion factor is used to convert these benefit proxies to border
price equivalents.
Operation and Maintenance
7.         The components of O&M costs in the project and the alternative,
illustrated in the following table, are converted to border price equivalents
by using appropriate conversion factors and adjustment for unskilled labor.

SECOND KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Economic Benefits
Method
1.        The approach used is one of identifying a proxy for the minimum benefit
that reflects the willingness of consumers to pay for incremental power supply.
The traditional method uses tariff revenue for this purpose, bearing in mind that
actual, non-quantified benefits are considerably higher, both because of the
existence of a consumers' surplus, and because of the generally subsidized level
of power tariffs. Some of this surplus is identifiable if the cost incurred by
industrial consumers for the purchase and operation of diesel standby generating
sets (necessary in the case of not fully reliable power supply) is included in
the benefits. A further refinement would be to express benefits in terms of
industrial and agricultural output gained by the project's alleviation of power
outages that interrupt production. Additional benefits such as greater work,
leisure, and educational benefits accruing to domestic consumers are quantifiable
only with difficulty.
2.        At the time of commissioning of the proposed project, the Western Region
is still expected to face a tight power supply situation (Annex  8).  As shortages
affect the larger industrial consumers more than agricultural, domestic, and
commercial ones, it is likely that the use of industrial standby generating capacity
still will be widespread. Assuming a mix of grid supply and own generation of
industry (implying a downward-sloping demand curve for industrial energy input),
the result is a decreasing average valuation of the kWh unit with increasing
energy use or decreasing share of standby generation: a movement along the demand
curve. The average industrial willingness to pay is assumed to be the average of
the cost of own generation and the industrial tariff.
Energy Sales
3.        The amount of energy sold to final consumers is arrived at by reducing
the kWh sent out from the project (after auxiliaryuse) by the average regional
system losses:

Regional
State                Consumption          System Losses

Industrial Willingness to Pay
5.        Assuming an average 1980 purchase price of a generating set of Rs 3,350/kW
(including 10% installation cost), the total cost can be expressed per kWh as follows,
assuming that an industrial consumer satisfies his demand by using own generation
predominantly.
Life of set: 15 years
Average utilization
at 50% load factor: 4,400 hours/year
Purchase price: Rs 3,350/kW
Annual charge
at 10% discount rate:  Rs 440/kW/year    or        Rs  0.10/kWh
O&M cost             : Rs 180/kW/year    or        Rs  0.40/kWh
Fuel and lubricant
at 0.23 kg/kWh
and Rs 1.90/kg       :                             Rs  0.44/kWh
Total cost - financial:                           Rs  0.58/kWh
- economic :                           Rs  0.56/kWh
6.        The economic cost of Rs 0.56/kWh (at the assumed load factor) represents
the observed maximum willingness to pay for continuous power supply. The average
industrial tariff in the region is about RS 0.24/kWh, representing a lower limit
of value iattached to power supply by industrial consumers:

The resulting average benefit proxy for industrial consumers is
Rs 0.40/kWh in economic terms. If the benefits accruing to other consumer categories

SECOND KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Additional Transmission and Distribution Cost
1.         The tentative Western Region Investment Program 1980-85 (page 2
of this Annex) provides for about 63% of total regional investment expenditure
(excluding miscellaneous projects) to be allocated to generation, the rest
to transmission, distribution and rural electrification. Non-generation
expenditure, therefore, accounts for about 58% of generation expenditure.
During the later years, however, transmission and distribution investment
plans constitute a higher share, increasing to 64% of generation in 1984/85.
While this may be unusually high, it also may reflect specific regional
circumstances. For the investment years beyond 1984/85, therefore, a T & D
share of 60% of generation is assumed.
2.         The cost of the project already includes a transmission element
which accounts for about 9-43% of the generating plant component in individual
years. The difference between this and the regional share is, therefore,
allocated to the project to allow a comparison with tariff revenue and other
benefits at the retail level: it is an investment necessary to serve final
consumers.
3.         The comparative shares of transmission and distribution investment
are as follows:
T & D investment as % of generation investment
Year                 Project          Regional Average

86/87                  9                   60
4.         Operating and maintenance expenditure of the additional T & D
investment is assumed to be 2% of the cumulative value of the assets installed.
The split by cost components of the additional investment is expressed in
economic terms identical to those of the original transmission component
included in the project.

SECOND KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Regional Exchange Tariffs and Cost of Generation
1.        The implied NTPC regional financial bulk tariff of about Rs
0.30/kWh for suDply from Korba to the Western Region needs to be seen in-the geaeral
context of exchange (bulk) tariffs and costs prevailing in the Region. Sample
tariffs charged among supply authorities for energy exchanges in 1979/80 were
as follows for supply at 110 kV and above (daytime demand):
Paise/kWh (incl. duty)
MSEB sales to GEB, Goa, Himachal
Pradesh, and Karnataka                                     17.5 - 22.5
GEB sales to MSEB                                                   22.5
MPEB saLles to MSEB                                                 19.5
Nuclear power sales to MSEB and GEB                                 18.5
2.         An elaborate system of guidelines exists for power exchanges
in the Region, defining the method of calculating cost-related tariffs for
such instances as peaking assistance, short-term emergency assistance, and
wheeling. In practice, the exchange tariff levels are often arrived at by
negotiations between SEBs.
3.         The present average exchange tariff of about Rs 0.20/kWh, if
regularly adjusted for expected general inflation, could reach about Rs 0.30/kWh
in 1986/87, when the first energy from the second stage of Korba will be
supplied, and about Rs 0.40/kWh in the early 1990's, the time of full
output from the project. The projected NTPC tariff at Korba, therefore,
appears to be well within the range of expected general Regional bulk prices.
4.         The accounting cost of power supply at 11 kV has been calculated
by SEBs in the Region to amount to about Rs 0.16/kWh in 1980/81. Assuming
an accounting cost of about Rs 0.15/kWh for higher voltages, an adjustment
for future inflation would result in a cost of about Rs 0.23/kWh in 1986/87,
and about Rs 0.30/kWh in the early 1990's. While the expected NTPC tariff
will appear costly to SEBs calculating their own cost of generation in the
early y ears of the project, it will become comparable to their own cost at the
time oE full project output. The apparent reason for the compatibility of
the NTPC bulk tariff with Regional cost of supply and resulting exchange
tariffs is the high share of coal-fired thermal capacity in the Region,
that leads to a similar cost structure as in NTPC operations.

SECOND KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Economic Marginal Cost of NTPC Operations
1.         The following assumptions are necessary to make marginal cost
analysis for NTPC a relevant exercise that can enter as input into tariff
considerations:
(a) Each station is reviewed as an independent system selling
power in bulk to the Region concerned;
(b) NTPC at each of its regional stations will ultimately
operate at its capacity limit: this implies that any
incremental demand will have to be satisfied by further
investment, and justifies the inclusion of representative
marginal capacity cost in the tariff;
(c) All sales of energy will be at the level of 400 kV;
(d) There will be no seasonal and only minor daily variation
in NTPC's load demand: all stations will be operated as
base load for the participating SEBs, thus eliminating
any peaks in NTPC operations; and
(e) For each station, the program of commissioning of units
and annual hours of operation is taken as planned by NTPC.
2.         The method used for the computation of an approximation of long
run marginal cost is the concept of Average Incremental Cost (AIC), smoothing
out any fluctuations by averaging over the entire known investment program.
The results are expressed in terms of both (a) a uniform energy charge,-
incorporating both marginal capacity and energy costs; and (b) a two-part
tariff consisting of a capacity charge and an energy charge, recovering
marginal capacity and energy costs, respectively.
3.         The basic computation is performed in terms of constant 1980
costs. In order to arrive at marginal cost in future years when energy
will be sold to SEBs, it is assumed (in the absence of a longer-term
investment plan) that any investment necessary to satisfy incremental
demand beyond NTPC capacity at the time will have the same pattern as the
investment envisaged for the late 1970's and 1980's. For this purpose,
marginal cost for future years is arrived at by updating the 1979 marginal
cost by projected inflation rates, ranging from  9% p.a. initially to 6%
p.a. in 1986/87 and beyond. All marginal costs are expressed in constant
prices of the year in question, and discounted at 10% p.a.
