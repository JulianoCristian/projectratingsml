"The proposed project would include\n            construction of three 500 MW generating units at the Korba\n            thermal power station in the State of Madhya Pradesh,\n            together with ancillary equipment and related works, and\n            about 1,100 circuit km of associated 400 kV transmission\n            lines. The major risk is the possibility of slippage in the\n            implementation schedule, which could give rise to delayed\n            commissioning of plant with consequent loss of revenues.\n            Careful coordination and supervision during construction and\n            attention to the manufacturers' abilities to meet\n            delivery schedules should keep implementation delays to a minimum."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
