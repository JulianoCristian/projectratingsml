consists of four years\n            (1979/80-1982/83) of WAPDA's secondary transmission\n            development program which is essential for providing for the\n            transmission and distribution of power from existing or\n            planned generating facilities and for improving system\n            efficiency. The project comprises: (a) the construction of\n            about 2,700 miles of 220 kV, 132 kV and 66 kV tramsmission\n            lines; (b) the construction, expansion and conversion of\n            about 210 substations of 220/132 kV and 132/66/11 kV with a\n            total capacity of about 4,800 MVA; and (c) storage\n            facilities for project materials and equipment. The project\n            also includes studies for: (i) a load dispatch system; and\n            (ii) conversion of the 220 kV Karachi-Tarbela transmission\n            system to 500 kV operation. The principal risk is the\n            possibility of slippage in the construction program, with\n            consequent cost overruns and loss of revenues. This risk\n            will be reduced by the establishment of a project management\n            team which will be responsible for the efficient\n            implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
