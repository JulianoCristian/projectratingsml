Following Board approval in September 1987, the\n            project got off to a promising start. However, by 1990, the\n            security situation in Somalia began to deteriorate. This\n            culminated in a civil war which resulted in the ouster of\n            the Government in January 1991 and the cessation of project\n            activities. The project objectives were therefore partially\n            and only temporarily achieved. Infrastructure developed as\n            part of the project was nearly completed but subsequently\n            destroyed during the war. Bank performance was satisfactory\n            throughout the project cycle. Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory, complying with most legal covenants and\n            showing continued commitment. However, coordination between\n            Bank and Borrower was inadequate. In view of the unstable\n            socio-political situation as of the report date of 1994, the\n            sustainability of project initiatives is highly unlikely.\n            The three major lessons learned are as follows. First,\n            collaborative arrangements between key agencies involved a\n            project should be worked out at appraisal and their\n            finalization should be a condition for loan effectiveness.\n            Second, the project financing plan should carefully evaluate\n            the Government's ability to meet its counterpart\n            funding requirements. The evaluation should occur at\n            appraisal, prior to finalizing the financing plan. Third,\n            arrangements for collaboration between co-financiers in\n            areas such as joint supervision should be firmed up at appraisal."}, "docdt": "1994-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
