APPRAISAL OF SWAMP RECLAMATION PROJECT I
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of Indonesia (COI) has requested Bank Group assis-
tance in reclaiming and developing about 9,000 ha (gross) of swampland at
Karang Agung in South Sumatra, and in settling approximately 3,200 families.
GOl also requested a number of related studies including an inventory of
reclaimable swamplands; upgrading of existing swamp developments; ecologic
impacts; and the availability of groundwater for drinking purposes at Karang
Agung. The proposed project would provide for drainage, clearing and
development of the land; housing and public facilities; selection, transport,
settling and subsistence of settled families; and agricultural support
services and studies.
1.02      Tne potential reclamation and development of 200,000 ha at Karang
Agung has been studied by P4S /1 and consultants (under Irrigation Project
VII, Loan 1268-IND) and subsequently an area of about 9,000 ha was idertified
with the assistance of Bank missions as a first stage develcpment. This
report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission composed of
Messrs. I. Naor, J. Goldberg, W.P. Ting and J.K. Coiilter which visited
Indonesia in November 1979.
The Agricultural and Rural Sector
1.03      Objectives.  The Government-s major objectives for the agricultural
and rural sector are to: (a) create productive employment to raise incomes of
the rural poor; (b) increase domestic food supply to keep pace with rising
demand; (c) expand agricultural exporrs particularly of smallholder tree
crops; and (d) ensure productive, su n__nable use of Indonesia-s varied land,
water and other natural resources.
1.04      Despite a 4% average annual growth of production, agriculture's
share of GDP has declined from 40% to 30% since 1968, while its share of
exports dropped from 45% to 33% due mainly to the markedly increased
value of oil exports. Nevertheless, the agricultural and rural sector
remains of overwhelming importance to the great majority of Indonesians;
nearly 80% of the population lives in rural areas, and agriculture is the
major source of income for about two-thirds of rural households and

one-tenth of urban households. Some 15.6 million smallholder families produce
subsistence and cash crops on 15.8 million ha, while 1,800 estates occupying
2.2 million ha produce mainly rubber, sugar, tea, palm oil, and tobacco.
Development Strategies
1.05      Employment.  Agriculture-s share of total employment decreased
from 69% in 1961 to 64% in September 1971, while in 1976 it ranged between
66% in March and 60% in October./1 Nevertheless, agriculture remained by
far the largest single source (with 46%) of new employment during 1971-76.
Outside Java, employment prospects in agriculture appear quite promising,
given the sustained increases in the smallholder area, due to land reclamation
and irrigation development, including both Government-sponsored and spon-
taneous transmigration. In Java, rehabilitation of irrigation systems, which
generated significant employment in the last decade, should continue to
provide additional construction and farm work.
1.06      Food Crops.  Given its limited manpower and financial resources, GOI
has concentrated on increasing the production of rice, the preferred staple
food of the great majoritv of Indonesians. Rie-e production increased rapidly
(4.5% p.a.) between 1968 aad i974, chiefly due to irrigation rehabilitation
and the provision to irrigated rice growers of fertilizer and high-yielding
variety seed, financed largely through the BIMAS credit program. The growth
rate slowed markedly to 1.7% p.a. over 1974-77, in the wake of severe declines
in fertilizer usage (due to restrictions on private sector fertilizer trade),
successive seasons of untimely rainfall, and unprecedented attacks by pests
and diseases, principally the brown pla--  -aper and associated viruses.  In
1978 rice production increased by 10% with favorable weather, improved and
liberalized fertilizer distribution, and nationwide Government-sponsored
distribution of recently introduced pe-t-resistant varieties. Preliminary
estimates for 1979 suggest a rice production increase of only 2% over 1978
due, mainly, to insufficient rainfal - --ver the past decade, output of
secondary food crops (maize, cassava, soybeans, peanuts, and sweet potatoes)
grew more slowly, at an average of only 1.6% p.a., composed of a 1.1% p.a.
average decline in area (much of this land shifting to irrigated rice) and a
2.7% p.a. increase in yield. These gains in food output did not keep pace
with the 3.5-4.0% p.a. increase in demand due to rising population and
incomes. Indonesia became the world's largest rice importer, with a record
import of 2.3 nullion tons in 1977, about 1.3 million tons in 1978 and about
2 million tons in 1979.  Simultaneously, -heat imports rose to 1.4 million
tons in 1978, but dropped to 1.2 million tons in 1979; cassava exports
nearly disappeared, and soybean, maize, and coconut oil imports began to
grow. The -Indonesia Supply Prospects for Major Food Crops (Report No.
2374-IND of March 3, 1979) concluded that even with expanded irrigation, and
/1   The share of agrfcultural employment in March ranged between 63% in
java and 72% in the Other Islands. The corresponding fiTuixs in
October were 57% and 66% respectively. The seasonal differences
represented a drop of 6.7 million workers in agricultural employment.

improved technology, extension, credit and marketing, food production growth
would not exceed 3.5% p.a., leaving a basic food deficit up to at least
1990, of which a rice deficit alone would be 2-3 million tons a year.
1.07      Tree Crops.  The Government has embarked on a major effort to
develop smallholder tree crops outside Java as part of its national rubber
and coconut replanting and transmigration programs. The objective is to
improve production on existing plantations while developing large areas of
new land for settlement.  One of the Government's main approaches has been
to use public estate companies to plant tree crops on land to be settled by
local -1-andless families as well as by transmigrants. These companies clear
the land and provide settlers with planting material, other inputs,
processing and marketing facilities. This approach is appropriate in view
of constraining management and technical capabilities.
1.08       Future Strategy.  To prevent a widening food production consump-,
tion gap, productivity and area under rice and secondary food crops must be
increased. In Java, rice-cropping intensity could be raised through storage
and irrigaton projects although relocation of inhabitants of reservoir sites
may delay progress.  Yields and cropping intensity can also be increased by
constructing tertiary irrigation and drainage systems, developing ground-
water potential and improving support services. In the Other Islands there
is considerable potential for new irrigation and swamp reclamation and
development schemes which GOI is attempting to develop. Despite a scarcity
of high-yielding varieties of secondary food crops, yields of existing
varieties could be increased by improved husbandry, including fertilizers
and insecticides.  001 is just beginning to give serious  -- -ion to
marketing, credit, seeds and research aimed at varietal improvement of
secondary crops.
1.09      Area Development and Transmigration.  In 1978. about 85 million
people lived in Java, at a density approaching 650 perss --:sq km. The island,
with 7% of Indonesia's land area, has 45X of the cropped area and 63% of the
population. Java generally has more fertile soils and better infrastructure
than the Other Islands; however, its cultivable land is almost fully
utilized. In some watersheds where cualtivation already exceeds ecologically
safe limits, contributing to increasing erosion, flooding, and siltation of
reservoirs, irrigation canals and ports, GO  is preparing Integrated
watershed development projects to address this problem. The primary program
for new area development in the Other Islands, as well as for creating
employment and settlement nuclei for Javanese migrants, is transmigration. An
organized transamigration program is important for regional and natural
resource development in the Other Islands, production of food and export
crops, and creation of employment and decent living conditions for landless
Javanese. Unfortunately, this program has long been hampered by unrealistic
expectations of its potential for resolving Java's population problems and for
stimulating large-scale regional developmant, by overly ambitious targets, and
by weak, uncoordinated implementation. Confronted by management problems, GOI
reorganized the program in preparation for Repelita III, by transferring
implementation rf-3ponsibility from the Directorate General of Transmigration



-4-
to line agencies normally responsible for each sector (para. 1.15). This
measure needs to be complemented by continued attention to technical and
policy issues including: (a) the suitability of the land for food crops;
(b) the role of tree crops and livestock; (c) appropriate target incomes and
farm sizes; (d) the extent of Government financial, marketing and other
services to settlers; and (e) the role of spontaneous migration.
1.10      Role of Government.  While the private sector should be encouraged
to expand its role in agricultural input supply, marketing, and processing,
Government continues to bear the major responsibility for infrastructure,
resource conservation, and other services. Despite marked improvements over
the past decade, centralized procedures, weak regioral planning, and
technical and managerial manpower constraints have impeded planning and
implementation of agricultural and rural development. C-01s concern for area
development has also increased the need to strengthen provincial and local
planning capabilities. Future programs responaive to GOI's stated
objectives will necessarily be complex, requiring closely coordinated
implementation programs, agricultural research, extension, input supply,
credit, land development, transport, pricing policies and marketing. GOI
must therefore continue to strengthen its key rural development institu-
tions, particularly through education, recruitment, training and retention of
technical manpower.
1.11      Bank Group Lending Strategy.  GOI and the Bank Group generally agree
on overall objectives and strategies for the rural sector.  While views
sometimes differ on the relative emphasis to be given to different
investments, and on the technical design of some proife-e. such differences
are not impeding Bank Group operations generally and are ;sually resolved by
further analysis and dialogue.
1.12      Projects.  Since the first of 15 irrigation projects was approved
in 1968, the Bank Group-s agricultural lending has --:ldly expanded to
include estate and smallholder tree crops, fertilizer production and
distribution, sugar, livestock, fisheries, research, extension, training,
seeds, transmigration, and resource survey and mapping. The Operations
Evaluation Department-s Sector Operations Review of Bank Group agricultural
lending in Indonesia (Report No. 2166, dated August 9, 1?78) concluded that
despite deficiencies in some projects, the Bank's portfolio in Indonesian
agriculture was -of overall good quality and likely to contribute substan-
tially to increased production." Within the context of GOIs agricultural
objectives and priorities, as outlined in Repelita III, future Bank lending is
expected to focus on:
(a) a diversified irrigation, flood protection, drainage and swamp
reclamation program to intensify rice cropping on Java and to expand
water resources infrastructure in the Other Islands;
(b)  smallholder and nucleus estate tree crop planting programs
including industrial forest estates; and

(c) area development projects aimed at (i) watershed management to
conserve soil and ensure long-term productivity in the densely
populated areas of Java; (ii) rural works programs; and
(iii) transmigration.
Swamp Reciam&tion and Development
1.13      Introduction.  Indonesia-s land mass includes an estimated 35 mil-
lion ha of swamps, nearly equally divided among Sumatra, Kalimantan and Irian
Jaya. These include an estimated 30 million ha of seasonally or permanently
inundated inland swamps and an estimated 5 million ha of coastal and near
coastal swamps, some of which are inundated during high tides by fresh or
brackish water.  One of the main resources of swamps are their soils which are
covered by primary or secondary swamp forests. Although the aggregate arable
s,wampland has not yet beea assessed in detail, there is no doubt that it has a
considerable potential to produce rice and other food and tree crops under
controlled water management. Historically, coastal and near coastal swampland
along tidal river estuaries in Sumatra and Kalimantan has attracted migrating
sanjarese from South Kalimantan and Buginese from South Sulawesi who have
spontaneously reclaimed an estimated area of more than 300,000 ha by digging
shallow canals slightly above low tides, perpendicular to rivers where water
is fresn year round. Through these canals, tides irrigate (and drain) adja-
cent lands in the tidal range. This has enabled settlers to grow rice,
vegetables, and a variety of other food and tree crops. Planned swamp recla-
nation began by the Dutch as early as 1939 at Purwosari, near Banjarmasin, in
South Kalimantan, followed in the l'30s and early 1960s by six small Govern-
ment-sponsored projects in South and West Kalimantan; but it was only d` m
itS first five year program, Repelita I, in 1969-73 that the Gcvernment
began reclaiming large areas, penetrating inland from coastal rivers. It was
then that P43 was established within the Ministry of Public Works to construct
navigation canals connecting river estuaries, and open up contiguous areas for
agricultural development and settlements maialy by constructing draing-- --
caaals. During this period some 33,000 ha were opened up in Sumatra and
Kalimantan and about 8,700 families from overpopulated Java and Bali were
settled. Two universities - Gajah Mada of Jokjakarta (UGM) and ITB /1 of
Bandung - were enrolled to assist in designing reclamation projects, and each
followed a distinct design pattern. UGM, which designed projects for
Kalimantan, employed a 'herring-bone' or fork-like layout of canals, with
reservoirs at their ends (to flush out toxic water from the canal system
during low tides) whereas ITB, which designed projects for South Srmatra,
employed a rectangular grid layout of canals, but without reservoirs.
1.L4      These reclamation activities brought new problems to developers as
inLand penetration encountered unarable deep peats and soils that became
acidic and nonproductive when drying out. Nonetheless, the Government
reclaimed an additional 42,000 ha of tidal swamps during Repelita II (1974-78)

and plans to reclaim 0.4 million ha during Repelita III (1979-83). Though
the operation as a whole hao, been slow, it has been successful, as a
whole,in reclaiming swamps and in developing them agriculturally, demon-
strating their potential contribution to the transaigration program. The
major weaknesses in the reclamation program have been poor implementation
management, particularly delays in the settlement of transmigrants, which
resulted in considerable idle investments; poor land clearing, which delayed
agricultural production and benefits, and inadequate agricultural supports
which resulted in less than optimal crop yields. Table 1.1 shows tidal
swamps reclaimed and families settled by the Government during Repelita I
and Repelita II.
1.15      To overcome aanagement weaknesses in the transmigration program as
a whole and to enable its expansion and acceleration, Presidential Decree
No. 26 was formulated and issued on August 31, 1978 (para. 1.09).
Principally this decree allocated responsibility for implementation to the
various ministries ordinarily responsible for each sector, and the
coordination of implementation to the Junior Ministry of Transmigration
(JMT). In the swamp reclamation program, where the canals are the communi-
cation arteriee, various agencies within the Ministry of Public W7orks (para.
4.01) are responsible for the implementation of the hydraulic infrastructure
and land clearing; the Directorate General of Transmigration (DGT) is
responsible for housing, village development and settling of transmigrants,
and the Directorate General of Foodcrops Agriculture (DGFCA) bears major
responsibility to support agricultural development. To overcome technical
and administrative staff deficiencies in the impl+mentation of the transmi-
gration program, the Bank, under Transmigration P....,ect II (Loan 170-
919-IND) is now assisting a massive effort in institutional support, which
includes the training of staff of participating line agencies, strengthening
of the coordinating capacity of the JMT and the capacity of DGFCA to deLiver
agricultural supplies and services. A similar effort is planned under the
proposed project to train the staff of implementing agencies to czr- aut thie
reclamation and development program of swamp~z.
1.16      Agricultural Development.  Agricultural production records of
swamp developments indicate that swamp soils, excluding deep peaLs and
drained and oxidized potential acid-sulphate soils are capable of producing
field crops and tree crops. Of ten Governmer t-sponsored projects developed
during the past decade and many small, older, spontaneous developments, only
one has been practically abandoned when its potential acid-sulphate soils
became highly acidic and toxic as a result of overdrainage (Cinta Manis,
para. 2.18). Ten years of farming at Upang (in a delta adjacent to that of
Karang Agung) under minimum water management and low inputs produced an
average paddy crop of 2-2.5 t/:na of local and improved varieties and a test
farm, in the same area, produced more than 3.5 t/ha of improved rice
varieties under an application of 90 kg/ha of nitrogen fertilizers. While
these yields appear low compared to the 4-5 t/ha obtained on irrigated soils
in Java, they are well above the 1.7 t/ha yield of upland paddy with prcoper
inputs, projected for upland transmigration developments. Upang's
experience confirmed by other ongoing swamp developments, indicates the

capability of swamp soils (with the exceptions stated above) to produce
crops at moderate yields, giving settlers on small holdings in reclaimed
swamps a reasonable financial incentive. It is not surprising therefore
that no difficulties have been encountered in mustering candidates for
transmaigration to reclaimed swamplands.
Project Formulation
1.17     The proposed project was identified by DGWRD and a joint Bank/
FA0-CP and Government of Netherlands mission which visited Indonesia in
February 1976. As a result of- the mission, a master plan and feasibility
studies for the reclamatf on of 200,000 ha of- tidal swamps in South Sumatra
and Jambi and engineerint design of^an azea of 20,0D0 ha were financed under
Irrigation Project VII (Loan 1268-IND).  Additional funds were made available
in December 1978 under Irrfgation XII (Loan 1645-IUT) for mapping, detailed
designs and construction drawings of Karang Agung, as well as for data col-
lection, preliminary planning and feasibility studies of two other areas in
South Sumatra (Lalang - 180,000 ha, hesuji - 50,000 ha) and one area in
Central Kalimantan (Sebangau - 120,000 ha).
1.18      The main objective of the proposed project, which is to reclaim and
convert swamps into agricultural land and settle transaigrants, is reflected
in its formulated hydraulic infrastructure which would include a navigation
canal and a network of drainage canals regulated by tertiary control strut-
tures. The canals would evacuate excess surface water during the wet season
and maintain optimal water levels for the cultivation of rice while field
bunds and water levels controls on tertiaries would, during the dry season,
prevent harmful overdrainage of peat- -X of potential acid-sulphate soils.
The hydraulic system was originally planned to include dikes and a series of
tidal and tertiary control structures but was modified to delete expensive
tidal control structures and other dikes when it became apparent that about
85% of the project area was above high tide levels, and river water, which
could inundate about 15% of the a    during spring tides to a maximum depth
of 50 cm, was fresh year round.
1.19      Transportation in and out of the project area would be by navigation
and the planned canal system would facilitate access by boats to settlements.
In order to foster community activities which greatly contribute to a success-
ful agricultural development, settlements would be compact and spaced close to
each other. This would result in a reasonably short distance between homes
and services such as schools and clinics, and a distance of less than 2 km
from houses to farmers fields.
1.20      The management of implementing the proposed project, its infrastruc-
ture acd settlement by a number of line agencies, a weak point in past
developments, has been planned on the basis of past experience and improve-
meats in the management of transmigration projects introduced under Transmi-
gration Project II (Loan 1707/Cr. 919-IND). Coordination functions at the
site, in the region and at the central level have been defined (para. 4.04),
steps taken to ensure suitable staffing, and a consultant has been provided to
guide and assist in coordinating the implementation.  The quality of land
clearing, which in the past was usually unsatisfactory, would be improved as



- 9 -
under the proposed project transmigrants themselves would be engaged to clear
their own farm plots (para. 3.06). With a vested interest in cleared plots,
transmi.grants would be expected to perform better than transient
laborers did in the past, and the timing of the operation would close the
time gap between clearing and cultivation and prevent a regrowth of scrub
before planting. Agricultural supports and services have been planned on the
basis of experience in nearby Upang, and would be provided under the
management vehicle established under the Second National Agricultural
Extension Project (Credit 996-IND).
1.21      fhe size of the proposed projet- area .was limited-to a 9,00,O ha
block which could be rapidly implemented and its innovations in project
preparation and implementation readily employed in other Government swamp
xeclamation developments. Basically, agricultural development would focus on
a wet-season, rainfed, rice crop planted on all field plots, and on a dry-
season crop of other food crops on about 40% of the field plot area (para.
3.03). A higher cropping intensity coluld be expected on about 15%- of the
project area, benefitting from tidal irrigatica and possibly on larger areas,
by low-lift pumpage. However, benefits from such a development have not been
considered in the economic analysis.
1.22      The project has also been formulated to assist Government in
building its institutional capacity in order to cope with its targeted
swamp reclamation program and this is reflected in the proposed technical
assistance in project preparation and implementation. Consultants would
analyze and address staffing requirements of participating agencies, and would
train agencies- staff in reconnaissance investigatio-,  :roject preparation
and techniques of feasibility analyses, and in supervision of implementation
of physical project works.
1.23      Tne following consultants assisted P4S i' "roject preparation:
EXSA International - Topography and Mapping
IPB - Institut Pertanian, Bogor: Soil and Agronomic Surveys
ITB - Institut Teknologi, Bandung: Master Plan and Engineering design
SAE - Survey Agro Economi: Socio-Economic Surveys
NEDECO - Dutch Consultants:  Feasibility Studies, and general supervision
of engineering surveys, planning and design.
1.24     The formulation of the project is consistent with GOI and the Bank-s
short-term and long-term objectives and would assist the Government in
meeting national goals of providing productive employment, increasing food
production and promoting the development of the Other Islands. Though it
would not be a completely new type of development to the Government, which
is engaged in similar work in neighboring areas as w <1 as in Kalimantan, it
would be the first swamp reclamation development financed by the Bank,
introducing upgraded techniques and institutional building thus assisting the
Government-s efforts in implementing technically and economically
feasible swamp developments.

2. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.G1      The project area is situated about 70 km from the north coast of
South Sumatra, in the Musi Banyuasin district, about 80 km northwest of
Palembang. It is part of a flat, low-lying plain formed by marine and
alluvial deposits. The Air Hitam, a small tributary of the Calik, and
the Tungkal-Tenggulan, both tidally affected rivers, border the area on the
southeast and southwest respectively and slightly higher grounds border it cn
the north and northwestV.  The -pro-jecttareaisunderdense scrub and secondary
forest which limits access to its interior.
Climate
2.02      The climate is typically tropical, hot and humid year round, with
an average annual rainfall of nearly 2,500 mm. The wet season lasts from
October to April, with 15 rainy days per month and monthly rainfall ranging
between 230 mm and 300 mm. The dry season lasts from May to September, but
even then rains ranging between 170 mm in May and 102 mm in July fall during
about 8-10 days and heavy downpours are quite frequent. Table 2.1 shows
meteorological data of four stations located between 50-90 km from the project
area. Rainfall is uniform over the project area, and weather patterns appear
to be cyclic with dry years occuring about every four to five years.
Temperatures, relative humidities and potential evapotranspiration (recorded
at Palembang) are nearly constant throughout the year --d wind velocities are
low. Cloud coverage is also fairly constant, and bright sunshine prevails
more than 50% of the time.
Topography and Soils
2.03      Most of the area is a flat, swampy, lowland plain, rising gently in
a northwestern direction from an elevation of +3.10 m /1 to +3.70 m with
minimal micro relief. River banks are slightly higher than the surrounding
terrain, but semidetailed surveys did not discern the existence of large,
permanently inundated, deep swamps. In the absence of internal waterways
and of pronounced gradients, drainage is poor and portions of the area are
periodically inundated both as a result of rainfall and as a result of high
tides reaching about +3.25 m./2
/1 All elevations calculated from Karang Agung-s Datum (Bench Mark PUTL 101,
at Tangung Buyut) whose elevation is +1.930 m above mean sea level.
12  Spring tides reach an elevation of +3.58 m in the Calik-Tungkal River at
the eastern border of the project area where a proposed main navigation
canal would be connected to the river.

2.04      Dominant soils covering nearly 80% of the project area, are
periodically flooded, tidal floodplain soils, composed of nearly ripe A1
acidic sulfidic clays (cat clays)./2   In about 651 of the area they are
overlain by moderately decomposed acid peats 15-40 cm deep,and in about 15% of
the area by similar peats up to 90 cm deep. River plain soils, consisting of
poorly drained, nearly ripe acid clays, cover about 10% of the project area
and river bank and miscellaneous soils cover the remainder. These latter
sails have a relatively high degree of agricultural potential for rice and
palawija,/3 and tidal flood plain soils have a moderate capability for these
crops under controlled water management. Shallow peats, up to 90 cm i-n
thickness, have a moderate to high capability of producing a variety of tree
crops, including coconuts, and a moderate capability to produce rice.  Peats,
deeper than 90 cm, are considered' nonarable and  have been excluded 'to the-
extent possible in delineating the project area.
Hydrology and Hydrometry
2.05      Data on tides and salinities in the rivers surrounding the project
area indicate a tidal fluctuation of 3.50 m and a considerable seasonal longi-
tudinal movement of a saline, or brackish, front in the rivers. Table 2.2
shows the tidal ranges observed during spring tides (highest monthly tides) of
the wet and dry season respectively. Data recorded at CAL 2 reflect condi-
tions near the project area. Based on these data and on friction losses in
the project-s hydraulic networks, the high water level in the center part of
the project area will be about +3.25 a.
2.06      Table 2.3 shows the intrusion of salinity from ieasurements carried
out in 1977, during spring (maximum) tides and neap (minimuo) tide-  5-r total
dissolved solids (TDS), concentrations of 1,000 ppm 14 and 5,000 ppm rrom the

Though these data are preliminary, requiring verification by ad& - !onal mea-

2.07      The hydrologic, hydrometric, soil and topographic surveys confirmed
the following points:
(a)  The proposed project area of 9,000 ha is not extensively and
deeply inundated. Only about 15% of it is up to 50 cm below high
tide which limits the extent of tidal irrigation, but reduces the
need for protective dikes, eliminates the need for tidal control
structures, and enhances the possibility of surface drainage.



- 14 -
(b)  Surface drainage is required during the rainy season to remove
excess rainfall and accumulated river water from low-lying
areas.  This can be achieved by a shallow, gravity drainage system
which will, however, have to be regulated, preferably at the farm
and tertiary level to maintain an optimal depth of ponded water in
paddies during the wet season and to protect soils by preventing
their overdrainage during the dry season.
(c) The intrusion of brackish water into the Calik Tungkal-Tenggulan
rivers does not reach the project area-s southwestern border even
during the dry season., Conneting ..the proposed..pro.jectw.&.drainage.-
system to the river at that point would eliminate the need of
expensive tidal control structures.
(d) 7Jnder controlled land development (minimum disturbance of topsoil)
and controlled water management, the soils of the proposed project
area are capable of producing rice, various field crops and tree
crops.
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
2.08      A water balance for rainfed wet-season (six-month) rice crop and a
secondary dry-season crop shows that under average rainfall conditions a wet-
season rice crop and a dry-season secondary crop could be grown but water
deficits could be expected to occur during the dry season in about 25% of the
years limiting the dry-season cropping intensity. The shortage of rain would
cause a minor, gradual loss of peat top soil as a result of subsidence and
oxidation./1
Drinking Water
2.09      Analyses of alternative drinking water supplies in the proposed
project area indicate that rainwater would be the most economic resource;
groundwater could be more dependable, but its use would require investiga-
tions before it could be considered. River water was found to be
bacteriologically unsafe without treatment. Table 2.4 shows a water balance
based on dependable rainfall - as would occur 75% of the time, a potential
retention of rainwater from a 30 sq m roof (at a runoff coefficient of 0.85)
and a minimum consumption use of 10 1/capita/day./2 Considering the deficit
during the months of July through September, storage of about 1,400 1 should
be provided to each household to ensure sufficient drinking and cooking
water during dry periods.
/1 A much greater loss could be expected if field bunds and tertiary controls
were not provided.
/2 10 1/capita/day has been considered the minimal requirement at nearby
Upang Delta for drinking and cooking.

Population
2.10      Existing Population.  The existing popllation of the district of
Musi Bany-uasin, in which Karang Agung is located, consists of three major
groups: Malays - native to the province, Buginese - settlers originating
from the Bone listrict in South Sulawesi and migrating through large Buginese
settlements in Jambi province, Javanese and Balinese - chiefly concentrated
in Government-reclaimed and settled swamplands (Upang, Telang, Cinta Manis).
The population of Karang Agung (2,000 sq km) is about 12,000; approximately
52% are Buginese, 40% are native Malay, and 8% are Javanese. Over half have
settled in Karang Agung within the past decade. The local clan (marga) seats
of Penuguan and Tungkal Ilir, with populations (including surrounding
villages) of 2,500 each, serve as marketing, processing and administrative
centers for the upstream portion of Karang Agung, and would provide those
services for the settlers in the proposed project area, which is unpopulated
at present.
2.11      Characteristics of Transmigrant Famiiies.  A recent survey of the
Government-sponsored transmigrants in the four main blocks of the nearby
Delta Upang swamp reclamation scheme shows a typical transmigrant family at
the time of settleme-it to consist of five persons; a husband and wife aged



- 16 -
35 and 29 years respectively, and three children aged about 10, 7 and 3
years.  Within ten years, a typical family has one more child.  This implies
a family labor force of 1.7 adults in the year of settlement, increasing
SJowly to about 4 labor units in the thirteenth year after settlement.  This
s-oall family labor force is a major factor in the slow pace of land
&nvelopment in ongoing projects and explains the need for hired labor at peak
scasons in initial years. the development of the settler family labor force
is analyzed in Annex 2, Table 8.
2.12      Migratory Labor.  Large forces of migratory labor arrive annually
for the rice harvest in the reclaimed swamps of the district-from outside;
the district (Lampung Province, the Ogan Komering districts of South
Sumatra the upland region of Pangkalan Balai and nearby fishing villages), and
from upland areas within the district. These laborers, working on tradi-
tionally large holdings of Malays and Buginese (who are heavily engaged in
fishing and forestry) supply about one-third of the total labor input.
Land Tenure
2.13      Control of land and resources is complex, with local and govern-
mental syst-ms frequently operating side by side. The margas, traditionally
controlling resources in Sumatra, grant land ownership rights for nominal tax
payments to marga members and land use rights to other, nonmarga settlers.
They also control the planting of coconuts and other perennial crops on land
to which ownership rights had not been assigned, and auction annually the
exploitation of valuable common resources such as fishing grounds and the
right to harvest nipah palm groves. Government, in coordination with the
margas, grants timber concessions which now cover most of the primary forests
in the region. These concession agreements, however, are terminated by
conversion of an area for transaigration following a mandatory minimum of one
year-s advance notice to the concessionaire. The Government-s swamp recla-
mation program has not caused serious conflicts with the local population/l
because construction of na'rigation canals by the Government has opened up
labor opportunities and possibilities for settlement by local people, while
public services (health centers, markets, schools) have served also local
residents. The final step in the land tenure process, the granting of
official individual cadastral titles, has been largely confined to government-
sponsored settlers.
2.14      Land tenure would pose no constraint for development as an area of
1,500 sq km of Karang Agung has been declared a transmigration area /2 and
the proposed project area excludes settled lands along the river.
/1  Conflicts have, however, occasionally broken out between Buginese settlers
and local communities.

Access, Services and Existing Developments
2.15     Access.  All transport in the region is waterborne.  The rivers
connecting Karang Agung and Palembang 11 are plied by a varied, mostly
privately owned fleet which includes commercial cargo and passenger river
ferries of up to 50 tons capacity, sailing and rowing junks of 10-30 tons
capacity, motorized carrier vessels of 5-10 tons capacity and small speedboat
taxis. Many settlers of established settlements own rowing or motorized
boats. All the major rivers have sufficient draft during low tide for the
heaviest locally used barges, and river traffic is unimpeded year-round.
2.16-     Supporting Services.  Commercial facilities In Penuguan and
Tungkal Ilir are adequate to serve the proposed project area in the early
years.  Both towns have daily markets and large-scale markets two days each
week.  There are 12 small private rice mills in Tungkal flir, one cooperative
mill and two private rice mills at Penuguan. Nevertheless, about half the
rice surolus is shipped unhusked to Palembang.  Cooperative marketing and
agricultural input supply centers (BUbJD/KUD) are established in both towns,
but have not yet made a major impact in the area. Agricultuzal extension
services have been provided by one extension field worker (PPL)/2 who has been
visiting the Penuguan area from the subdistrict capital once a fortnight most
of the year and has been staying in the area during the rice planting season.
Technical backup for this PPL has been provided by a regional subject matter
specialist (PPS)i3 stationed in Sungsang, six hours downriver by boat. These
extension services, insufficient for the proposed project, would be expanded
(para. 3.03). Agricultural research, carried out presently at a station at
Upang would be supplemented by a substation to be establ-ished in the project
area. Education services are scarce in the project area. There are a few
elementary schools in the two marga villages with Government-supported schools
serving indigenous and Javanese settlers and other schools operated
independently by Bugiuese, whose teachers come from South Sulawesi and Jambi.
The nearest secondary school is in Upang, but affluent families send their
sons to Palembang for secondary schooling.
2.17      Existing Swamp Development in Neighboring Areas - Delta Uoang.  The
development of nearby Delta Upang 60 km downstream from Palembang on the
estuary of the Musi River began in 1969. After initial difficult years, the
area is fairly well established now with over 2,300 Government settled
families and several hundred spontaneous Javanese, local and Buginese settlers
farming the land. Upang now has a market town and a full complement of
social, agricultural and commercial infrastructure. Land development, and
particularly tertiary development, is still proceeding.
/1 Palembang is the largest metropolis in the southern half of Sumatra with
a population exceeding one million. It is the center of Indonesia's oil
refining and fertilizer industries and an important timber processing
and shipping port.

2.18      Cinta Mauis.  In 1971 an inland swamp at Cinta Man.s near Palembang,
some 80 km from the coast, was reclaimed and settled, but failed to reach its
objective of sustained agricultural production. The main reason for this
failure appears to have been insufficient attention to soil constraints,
manifested by a lack of water management which permitted soils to dry,
oxidize and acidify. Cinta Manis is now populated by 750 Government-
sponsored and 500 spontaneous settler families, most of whose labor force
work in nearby Palembang.
2.19      Telang Delta and Saleh Sugihan. The development of the Telang I
scheme, straddling the peninsula west of the Musi and east of the -Telang
River, started in the mid-1970s and settlers have been arrivilg-As-ot-f98'.
It has since accepted settlers at a faster pace: than any other swamp reclama-
tion project In Indonesia, with nearly 3,000 families now established. The
Telang II project, on the peninsula to the west of Upang between the Telang
and Banyuasin River estuaries, is in an advanced stage of land development.
Some 6,000 ha at two developments at Air Saleh and Sungei Sugihan, east of
Upang, are being reclaimed and cleared to receive the first groups of
settlers in 1980. P4S has excavated navigation canals across these deltaic
islands and peninsulas improving access and transport to settlement areas,
while facilitating spontaneous settlements along canal banks.
Existing Agriculture
2.20      At present, only a narrow strip of land along river banks on the
periphery of the project area is agriculturally developed. Buginese, who
settled this land spontaneously, grow paddy and fruits. A more intense
pattern is observed at reclaimed swamps at Upang and Telang where settled
transmigrants cultivate fruit trees, cereals, vegetables and some rice in
intensively cultivated houselots, while most of the rice is produced in farm
plots, usually several years following settlement. Most farm plots have no
water level controls and as a result farmers are forced to transplant rice
twice in low-lying areas to protect the young crop from excessive
inundation. Nurseries are usually prepared around the middle of October,
fields are prepared (with minimum hand tillage) till mid-December, and
transplanting takes place twice during December-January, The commonly used
local varieties require about 110-120 days to mature and are harvested
during May-June. Farmers apply little or no fertilizers, pesticides or
insecticides. Paddy yields range between 2-2.5 t/ha, corn yields average
0.7 t/ha, coconut yields average about 7,000 nuts/ha/year, and bananas about
1,200 bunches/ha/year. In addition to growing crops, some farmers
participate in a Government-supported cattle fattening program. The
Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB), under contract with P4S, operates a test
farm at Upang where fertilizer response and varietal trials have been
carried out for a number of years. The results of these trials indicate that
under proper water management and fertilizers (mostly nitrogen), rice yields
attain 3.5 t/ha.

3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01       The proposed project - a low-cost swamp development scheme - would
comprise land reclamation, settlement of transmigrants and agricultural
development. It would include a system of open canals for surface drainage of
a gross area of 9,000 ha and for tidal irrigation of about 15% of this area.
The canal system would evacuate excess surface water during the rainy season
while- field bunds would maintain an optimal depth of water for rice  <
cultivation during the wet season, and, together with tertiary controls,
would facilitate the maintenance of a high water table to prevent the drying
and oxidation of peats and potential acid-sulphate soil during the dry
season. The proposed project works Include the removal of trees and brush to
clear a net area of about 7,200 ha, for division into about 3,200 house and
farm plots, the construction of housing, the clearing of about 420 na for
village facilities and their construction, transporting and settling about
2,800 families from Java or Bali and about 400 local families, and support-
ing agricultural and community services. The project would include four
studies, monitoring and evaluation and provide technical and institutional
support to the main executing and coordinating agencies P4S, PTPT,/l DGT,
DGCK,/2 and JMT.
Project Works
3.02       The proposed project would include:
Hydraulic Infrastruetvre
(a) A navigation canal about 9 km long; about 6 primary canals of a
total length of about 24 km; about 102 secondary canals of a total
length of about 196 km; and about 185 km of tertiaries.
(b) About 204 km of small drains for about 100 hamlets.
(c) O&M roadways along the navigation and primary canals.
(d) About 800 tertiary control structures, 204 outlet structures for
hamlet drains, 10 pedestrian bridges on the navigation and
primary canals, 102 pedestrian bridges on secondary canals, 100
small jetties at hamlets, 2 navigation jetties and one primary
control structure to be built at the confluence of one primary canal
and the navigation canal (para. 3.04).

in preparing an inventory of coastal and near coasta_. swamps, in



- 21 -
assessing the viability of upgrading existing swamp developments,
in determining environmental Impacts in studying grouindwater avail-
ability anid in monitoring the proposed development (para. 3.25).
Ag-ricultural Development
3.03      The agricultural development plan of the project area is based on
the cultivation of a rainfed wet-season rice crop progressively covering 100%
of the area of all farm plots, and the cultivation of other food crops during
the dry season (drawing on residual soil moisture) progressively covering
40% of the area of all farm plots (para. 1.21). -Houselots would be
cultivated with a mixture of perennfal  n  aQnuat  rcips. -The project
(through DGFCA) would provide settlers with an initial seeds and agro-
chemical package (para. 4.08). Extension services would be provided by
DGFCA under the management vehicle established under the Second National
Agricultural Extension Project (Credit 996-INWi) and research and varietal
trials would be provided by AARD. Sufficient funds are available under the
Second National Agricultural Extension Project and assurances were obtained
that DGFCA would provide permaniently two middle-level extension workers
(PPMs) and six field ex -nsion workers (PPLs) under the part-time
supervision of a subject matter specialist (PPS), and AARD would provide
permanently adeqtuately trained staff, as required, to carry out agricultural
research.
Physical Development
3.04      The Hydraulic Infrastructure.  The proposed project would be served
by a centrally located navigation canal and a network of primary, secondary
and tertiary canals. The navigation canal commencing at the Tungkal-Tenggulan
River at the southwest border of the project area would be excavated to
-1.25 n (Karang Agung Datum) with 2:1 (H:V) side slopes and a bottom width
of 8 m. Six primary canals would branch off the navigation canal at right
angles, would each be about 4,000 m long, about 3-3.50 m deep (below average
ground levels) and have a minimum bottom width of 1.50 m. Their cross
section area would be determined by drainage evacuation requirements and
their near horizontal bottom gradient would   able two directional flow.
There would be no structures at their confluences with the navigation canal
(excepting one primary canal where a pilot tidal control structure would be
built) and hence water levels in canals would fluctuate with the tides.
The canals would be passable by small boats most of the time except during
low tides. Secondary canals would be constructed at a spacing of about 400
m, perpendicular to primary canals, each extending for 2,000 m. Their cross
section would be determined by drainage evacuation requirements or by irri-
gation requirements (for about 1,300 ha under the command of high tides).
Navigation, primary and secondary canals would be mechanically excavated,
and if dredged, be properly drained in order to minimize damage to farmlands
from dumped, potentially toxic subsoils. Excavating equipment would be
floated to the site on pontoons and, to reduce ground pressures, would be



- 22 -
operated from wooden mats. In view of the low consistency of excavated
soils, the shaping of embankments would be deferred by 6-12 months
(depending on rainfall) after excavation. Manually excavated tertiary
canals would be located along the boundaries of farm plots, and sized to
evacuate 4.5 l/sec/ha./l At the turnout of each tertiary a stop log
equipped wooden check would be built for the control of water levels.
3.05      Field Bunds.  Bunds would be constructed along the perimeter of
farm plots to facilitate the control of water levels in paddies during the
wet season and prevent soil water depletion (by horizontal movement through
highly pervious peats) during the dry season.  They would project about 30
ca above ground, founded on cThy 'sbsoiEs, oe                40 cm below ground
surface, and have an average cross-sectional area of about 0.28 sq m.
3.06      Land Clearing.  About 7,200 ha would be cleared manually for culti-
vation and settlement and 420 ha would be similarly cleared for village
facillties. This activity would include felling and cutting up of trees,/2
removal of swamp brush, windrowing and burning of all wood not usable in the
construction of houses. Felling and cutting would be done by workers using
chainsaws, axes and handsaws. Based on experience in ongoing clearing
operations at nearby Telang, about 65 man-days would be required to clear 1 ha
of which 30 man-diys would be expended by chain saw teams (each consisting of
I skilled operator and 9 unskilled workers) to fell and cut trees; 30 man-days
would be required to cut secondary growth and shrubs, and 5 man-days would be
required to burn the nonusable wood. Before the arrival of the transmigrants,
a strip of about 400 m on either side or primary canals would be cleared for
transmigrants hamlets by a contractor using imported laborers, while three
months after settling transmigrants would be employed (by a contractor) to
clear their farm plots (para. 1.20).
3.07      Subdivision.  Subdivision into plots would be carried out after
land clearing, and a peat survey, which would exclude from development any
plot in which the depth of peat exceeded 90 cm./3 Taking advantage of the
flat terrain, the area would be subdivided into rectangular blocks bounded
by secondary canals. Each secondary block would be subdivided into a 16 ha
(net) hamlet area located near primary canals, and a net farm area of 56 ha.
/1  This rate was calculated from a design storm of 134 mm, recurring on the
average every 2 years. Excess surface water would be evacuated from
paddies in less than 7 days under prevailing tides.
/2 But not destumping so as not to expose potential acid-sulphate subsoils.
/3 Although semi-detailed soil surveys already excluded most areas of deep
peats from the proposed development, this survey would ensure that no
farmers would be settled on isolated pockets of deep peats.



- 23 -
3.08      Houses and Couunity Facilities.  About 3,200 settlers houses
measuring approximately 34 sq i each (to BAPPENAS standard) would be built
of local wood on 0.5 ha houselots in about 100 hamlets located along primary
canals. Seven barrels or their equivalert would be provided to each settler to
collect and store about 1,400 liters of rainwater for drinking and cooking.
Sanitary facilities (pit latrines) would be provided for each house at a
minimum distance of about 15 m. About 14 hamlets would be served by one
village where a primary school of six classrooms (para. 3.20), a health
subeeater (para.  3.18), a place of worship, a village office, -a storage area
and staff houses would be constructed - Thet-e"'wou6dId" li  t&taT tfsven- 
villages, one of which would be a main village with expanded administration
facilities, a primary and a l.ower see2ondary school, a health center, plots for
artisans wishing to settle in the area and space for a market place.
3.09      Base Camp and Associat-J FacilXties.  A base camp would be buIlt
near the planned inlet of the navigation canal, to house construction
supervision and management staff./l This camp would include offices, mess
halls, living quarters, well water supply, generating and communication
facilities. At the completion of construction, the camp would be used to
house permanently stationed 0&M staff and visiting officials.
Settlement
3.10      Settlement of transmigrants under the proposed project would follow
procedures employed in other transmigration projects including recruitment,
selection, transport, provision of tools, subsistence supplies, assistance and
guidance during and after settling.
3.11      Recruitment.  Recruitment of transmigrants should pose no particu-
lar problem as more than 500,000 families in Java and Bali have registered for
transmigration. GOT criteria assigns priority to recruitment from:
(a)  ecologically threatened areas;
(b)  areas in the which population density exceeds 1,000 persons/sq km;
(c)  nonarable areas;
(d)  areas subject to recurring disasters;
(e)  areas made uninhabitable by development projects (Q.g. reservoirs);
and
11 Exclusive of contractor's personnel whose accommodations and office
facilities would be Drovided by the contractor adjacent to the base camp.

(f) the poorest Kecamatans /I of each Kabupaten./2
3.12       Selection and Transport.  The selection process ensures, inter alia,
that transmigrants are of reasonably good health, between 25 and 40 years of
age, are legally married and have had previous agricultural experience.
Transmigrants would be transported to the project area at a targeted rate
of about 128 families per month or at the actual rate of the construction of
houses and the availability of provisions and support services.
3.13      Provisions.  Prior to disembarkation, each family would be given a
standard package consisting of mosquito netting, sleeping mats-and
cooking utensl-ls- Upon arrival at; the -stite-,Aacifatt-woii reee-
agricultural implements, saws and barrels, or equivalent  to store drinking
water. In addition, each family would receive the first of 18 monthly
subsistence rations, containing essential foods and kerosene./3 Specifically,
a monthly ration would consist of 50 kg of rice, 5 kg of dried fish, 8 liters
of kerosene, 3 kg of sugar, 2 kg of salt and i kg of soap.
3.14      Training.  Settlers would be given information by DGT on the
characteristics of their new environment, on agricultural production,
marketing, use of local resources, appropriate technologies, health, education
and village participation. Javanese women who traditionally share
decision-maklng and responsibilities for agricultural production and marketing
with their husbands would be given information on credit, cooperatives, land
titles and cooperative conmunity work.
Commuaity Develonment
3.15      Once transm4grants are on site, DGT would coordinate and promote
community development which would include:
(a) registration of new arrivals and settling them on assigned plots;
(b) disseminating economic and social information to settlers;
(c) stimulating the organization and growth of village level administra-
tion;
(d) facilitating the establishment of village development organizations;
(e) record keeping;
/1  Kecamatan:  Subdistrict.
/2  Kabupaten:  District.
/3 The duration of the subsistence may be extended under adverse conditions
(crop failure, etc.).

(f) preparation of transfer of communities to provincial adudnistration.
3.16      DGT, in cooperation with the Directorate General of Agrarian
Affairs (DGA), would provide each family with  right of use title  (hak
pakai) to their houselot and to their farmplot, within one year of arrival.
-t twould provide the migrants with land ownership title (hak milik) to all
their land, provided it was farmed, witiin five years of their arrival on
site. In accordance with existing regulations, transmigrants would be
prohibited from transfering or selling land within ten years after occupancy.
An assurance was obtained at negotiations that each settler would receive a
certificate evidencing:v
(a)  "hak pakai  to his land within one year; and
(b) -hak milik- to all his land within five years after his
arrival on site.
3.17      Health.  The objective of the health component would be to: (a)
protect new transmigrants from the risk of malaria; (b) establish a basic
health infrastructure; and (c) insure start-up and utilization of services
by providing incentives. Health care facilities would be provided at the
health center and at the subcenters (para. 3.02). Health services with a
prinmary health care approach would focus on immunization, nutrition, health
education, family planning and environmental sanitation.  The project would
also provide for malaria control campaigns in the settlement areas.
3.18      Health Center arnd Subcenter.  Construction of a health center
-(PUSKES.MAS) at the project's main village would follow establfshed LNPRES
standards and include a building of 80 sq m, one separate area of 70 sq i
for doctors- quarters and two staff buildings of 50 sq m each.  The health
center would be provided with three sptedboats. In each of the other six
villages, the project would establish a subhealth center comprising one
examination room, sto-eroom, etc. (30 ssi m) and one staff building (50 sq a).
An assurance was obtained from GOI that the first subcenter would be
built, equipped and staffea before the settlement of the first transmigrants
and the other subcenters, and centers, as villages are built.
3.19      Malaria Control-  In view of malaria endemicity and the sus-
ceptibility of nonimmune settlers, the project would provide for malaria
control campaigns which would include spraying of houses, the detection of
passive cases and treatment. In general, the control component would try to
reduce malaria prevalence within five years to about 2% during the peak
transmission period. Houses would be sprayed before settlement and at
six-month intervals by hired spraymen and squad leaders. Passive case
detection and treatment would be carried out by the health centers.
Technical supervisior of the campaign would rest with the malaria staff at
the district level, while the provincial health service would administer it.

3.20      Education.  The project includes the construction of primary
schools (grades 1 to 6) in each of the six villages, and a primary and a
lower secondary school (SMP, grades 7 to 9) in the main village. Tne
Ministry of Rome Affairs would supervise the construction of the primary
schools; the Directorate General of Education would supervise the
construction of the lower secondary school, and be responsible for staffing
all schools.
Status of Field Data, Planning and Design
3.21      Field Data
(a)  Topography and Mapping.  Aerial photos to a scale of 1:20,000,
ground controls and mosaics were prepared for all of Karang Agungs
200,000 ha in 1976.  Ground surveys were carried out along
penetration axes opened at 1,000 m intervals which served as basis
for a 1:50,000 topographic map. Subsequent surveys discerned errors
in spot heights but due to difficult access to the densely covered
project area and time constraints, the 1:50,000 map was used in the
Master Plan and feasibility studies. In 1978, an additional
topographic survey was carried out along planned alignments of the
navigation and primary canals, serving the 9,000 ha proposed project
area.  This survey, correcting earlier errors. led to the deletion
of originally planned ring dikes and tidal control structures (para.
1.18), to the realignment of one primary canal and also served for
quantity and cost estimates of proposed works. Detailed surveys for
subdivision and tertiary design would be carried out after the
clearing of land.
(b)  Hydrometry.  Tidal levels in the river system surrounding Karang
Agung have been recorded since June 1977 under a Dutch-assisted
program (P4S-BTA60) (para. 2.05). After resolving a difference
between the hydrometric and the topographic data base, high and
low spring tides of +3.58 m and +0.08 m, respectively, have been
used in designing the hydraulic system.
0c)  Soils Si-rveys   A semi-detailed soil survey for the whole Karang
Agung are. of 200,000 ha was based on data obtained from samples
-en along' penetration axes mentioned above. Soil classification
were prepared from these data and the interpretation of
-' pnotos. Areas of deep peats (in excess of 90 cm) were
-ded from development, but a supplementary detailed peat
y would be carried out during implementation to avoid
-tting people on deep peats, unnoticed in past investigations
..ata. 3.07).
Master Plan and Feasibility Studies.  Master plan and feasibi-
'ity studies of Karang Agung-s 200,000 ha were carried out during 1976-78 and
an area of about 110,000 ha was found suitable for agricultural development.



- 27 -
3.23      Design and Contract Documents.  Engineering designs of the hydraulic
network and physical plans of the proposed project area were completed by the
end of 1979, prequaliflcation of contractors in September 1980, and contract
documents for the main and secondary hydraulic network in October 1980.
Designs were based on the Master Plan, and revised in accordance with
additional topographic alignment surveys. They include plans and profiles of
navigation, primary and secondary canals, typical designs of bridges, jetties,
tertiaries and tertiary structures, quantity and cost estimates. Plans are of
sufficient detail to serve as contract drawings. Construction plans for
tertiaries would be prepared following clearing and surveys.oLfarnareas=..
Implementation Schedule
3.24      With already completed designs, prequalification of contractors,
and contract documents for the main and sezondary hydraulic network,
implementation would start in mid-1981 and continue till the end of 1985
(Figure 3.1) mainly by three line agencies (para. 4.01). Most activities
would be carried out in parallel, to facilitate an early settling of people
aad an early commencement of agricultural development. As an innovation,
transmigrants themselves would be employed iP land clearing and on-farm
development (para. 3.06) which has been reflected in the implementation
schedule.  Should this arrangement be unsatisfactory, the schedule would be
revised to allow for contractors to employ imported laborers (from Java) for
the completion of the~se works. This, however, should not affect the overall
implementation schedule and project cost estimates (para. 3.26). Main and
secondary hydraulic systems would be constructed mechanically (para. 3.04),
and other works would be constructed manually. Starting with the excavation
of the navigation canal, the excavation of primary canals woul5 begin as soon
as the excavated navigation canal reached their branch-off points to be
followed in a similar manner by the construction of secondary canals. As soon
as work progress permitted, hamlet strips would be cleared and houses
coi2structed for transmigrants at a rate of at least 128 units/month. The
moving and settling of transmigr4nts would start about one month after
completing the first group of 128 houses and would continue at this rate or
that of housing construction. About three months after arrival on site, each
group of settlers would be employed (by a contractor) to clear their farm
plots. At a conservativelv estimated rate of 65 iandays/ha, this work would
require an average of 120 days by each settler. The operation would be
carried out progressively by each newly arrived group of settlers, until all
farm plots would be cleared, which would take about .wo years. After land
clearing of each block, the area would be surveyed, subdivided and plans
prepared for tertiaries.  Settlers would be employed in constructing
tertiaries and field bunds during the year following settlement.
Consulting Services
3.25      Services of local and internationally recruited consultants would be
provided to assist and train implementing agencies (P4S, DC Cipta Karya, PTPT,
DGT and JM`T) to carrv out designs, construction supervision and management,
and a number of studies. These services would include:

(a) P4S in field surveys, final construction drawings, tertiary
development, contract documents, construction supervision and
construction management;
(b)  DG Cipta Karya in subdivision work and in designing rural
developments;
(c)  PTPT in supervising and managing land clearing=
(d) DGT in supervising construction of houses, villages and communal

services;
(c) P4S in conducting an environmental impact study of selected swamp
developments;
(d) P4S in conducting a groundwater investigation at Karang Agung; and
(e) P4S, DGFCA and DGT in monitoring the physical, ecological and
socio-economic impact of the proposed development.
Assurances were obta'ned at negotiations that consultants whose qualifica-
tions, experience and terms and conditions of employment would be acceptable
to the Bank, would be engaged by P4S for itself and for DGCK, PTPT, DGT, and
by JMT. Foreign consultants for .JMT would be provided by modifying the terms
of reference of consultants already engaged in the Transmigration Management
and Monitoring Services (financed jointly by UNDP and the Bank). All othe
foreign consultants would be engaged by P4S. Local consultants for project
implementation and for studies (except for monitoring, where each
participating agency may hire its own consultants) would be engaged by
P4S. Consultants assisting P4S and DGCK in project implementation would be
engaged by March 31, 1981, those assisting PTPT, DOT, and JMT would be



- 29 -
engaged by March 31, 1982. Consultants for studies (a) (b) and (c) above
would be engaged by January 31, 1982, for (d) by March 31, 1982 and for (e) by
October 31, 1984. The estimated schedule of consultants' assignments and cost
breakdowns are given in Annex 1, Tables 8-9. Estimated base costs are given
in Table 3.1.
Cost Estimates
3_26      The total project cost is estimated at US$44.6 million (including
taxes on civil works, physical contingencies and expected price increases), of
which-US$18.9 million (42%) is the foreign currency component-.-Project.costs.
are expressed in end-1980 prices; unit costs of civil works have been based on
similar costs in outlying areas, land clearing costs on contract prices in
neighboring Telang and Saleh Sugihan (using Javanese laborers). Ouantities
for the excavation of the navigation and primary canals are based on detailed
plans supported by alignment surveys, those of secondaries and tertiaries, on
average ground surface elevations. Costs of houses have been based on
contract prices in neighboring areas without discounting any lumber which
would be available from land clearing. Costs of community facilities, schools,
health centers, etc., have been based on BAPPENAS standards and unit
construction costs obtained in similar projects.  Costs of relocating and
settling of transmigrants have been derived from similar projects. Estimated
monthly base costs of local and foreign consultants are USS2,062 and USS12,100
respectively for engineers and US$660 for technicians and draftsmen, similar
to recent contracts in Indonesia.  A 15% allowance for physical contingencies
and an additioral allowance for expected price iacreases, calculated on
project- t .u=-_al local cost inflation of 15% during 1981 and 10% during
following years and on annual foreign cost inflation of 9% during 1981, 8%
during 1982 and 7% thereafter, have been added to project costs./l Details of
project costs are given in Annex 1, and summarized in Table 3.2.
Financing
3.27       The proposed Bank loan of US$22 million would finance the foreign
excharge cost of US$18.9 million and US$3.1 million of local costs. This
would amount to about 50% of total project costs exclusive of taxes. The
remaining Rp 14,125 million (US$22.6 million) would be provided by GOT through
annual budget appropriations.
Procurement /2
3.28       Civil Works.  All mechanically constructed werks which would in-
clude the excavation of the navigation, primary, and  secondary canals,
clearing of right-of-way, blockage of creeks, and construction of the base
camp, bridges, jetties, and the tidal control structure, would be grouped
into one contract (US$6.3 million) and tendered on the basis of international

competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. The above
works include -.ll t e equipment-intensive elements in the project. All remain-
ing wcrks, which would be heavily labor-intensive, would not be appropriate
for ICB and hence would be tendered on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to
the Bank./l Among these, the following works would be procured as follows:
(a)  clearing of houselots and construction of houses and village
facilities (US$5.1 million) would be grouped into no more than
five packages, each consisting of land clearing and house
construction; and
(b)  construction of tertiary drain structures and hamlet drain
outlets (US$0.7 million) would be grouped into three contracts.
Under these conditions, threshold estimated contract values of civil works
requiring Bank review prior to tendering and award would be US$1.5 million.
3.29      Contracts for clearing of farm plots US$2.2 million; on-farm works
(excavation of tertiary drains and construction of field bunds, US$0.8
million) would also be inappropriate for ICB as they would be implemented
employing transmigrants, would not attract international bidders and hence
would be procured under competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance
with Government procedures acceptable to the Bank. To better synchronize
the clearing of houselots (managed by PTPT) and the construction of houses
(managed by DGT), and to facilitate the use in construction of any usable
timber from clearing. 9-' two agencies have agreed to advertise and evaluate
bids jointly and award each package to one contractor.
3.30      Equipment, Materials and Training.  A total of about US$2.0 mi_lion
worth of equipment and materials (including aerial photography and the provi-
sion of drilling esr-pment, supplies and training) would be procured under the
project (Annex 1, Table 10) in addition to US$0.4 million of farm tools and
supplies to settlers. Of this, boats, radios, generators, lab and testing
equipment (US$1.25 million) would be procured by P4S under ICE. A preference
limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the customs duty,
whichever is lower, would be extended to local manufacturers of such items in
the evaluation of bids. All remaining equipment and materials could not be
grouped in packages sufficiently large to attract international bidders and
hence would be procured through GOI procurement procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Under these conditions, threshold estimated contract values of
equipment and material requiring Bank review prior to tendering and award
would be $200,000.
/1 In mid-1980 Government introduced local procurement guidelines which
included measures to strengthen indigenous, small, contractors by
promoting their participation in Government sponsored work in their
district. These procedures will permit efficien.t procurement under the
project.

3.31       During negotiations for the fourteenth (Loan 1811-IND) and
fifteenth (Credit 995-IND) irrigation projects, ar. understanding was reached
with GOI on the use and content of standard contract documents for civil
works and equipment to be procured by ICB. The understanding on the use and
content of standard contract documents for locally advertised competitive
bidding was reached in September 1980. It is expected that implementing
agencies will use standard General Conditions in their contract documents.
Disbursements
3.32       Disbursements for equipment and materials required for construction
supervision and for studies would be at the rate of 100% of the foreign
exchange costs of directly imported equipment and materials, /1 95% of the
ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment and materials.  Funds for
remaining equipment and materials would be provided fully by GOI_ Disburse-
ments for civil works would be made only against the 1CB contract and the
LCB contract for land clearing of farnplots (specified in para. 3.28), at
the rate of 100% of total expenditures, with direct disbursement to the
contractors. Funds for remaining civil works would be provided fully by
GOI. Disbursements for consulting services, for project implementation /2
and for studies 13 would be financed at a rate of 100% by the Bank.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would commence
the groundwater investigation by March 1982 and monitoring by June 1984.
Estimated schedule of expenditures and disbursements and the proposed
allocation v_A loan nroceeds are presented in Annex 1, Tables 2, 4 and 5.
Accounts and Audits
3.33       Assurances were obtained from GGI that:  (a) all implementing
agencies would maintain separate accounts for the project; (b) these accounts
would be audited by independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank; and
(c) these audited accounts would be s4t.zitted to the Bank Group within six
months of the close of each fiscal year together with the auditor's comments
and opinion.
Environmental Effects
3.34       The environmental impact of swampland development, especially in
South Sumatra, has been studied by the Center for Natural Resources Management
/1  Except for equipment and materials required for an investigation of
groundwater and monitoring which would be wholly funded by GOI.
12  Except for consultants for DGCK who would be financed from funds
provided under Irrigation XII (Loan 1654-IND) and consultants for
DGT who would be financed by the Government.
/3 Except for an investigation of groundwater and monitoring of the
project. The Government would fully disburse the cost of consultants
for these activities.

and Environmental Studies of Bogor Agricultural University which concluded
that if mangroves were preserved in coastal areas, the reclamation of swamps
would have little adverse environmental effects. P4S follows this directive
in the ongoing swamp reclamation program. There is, however, a need to
collect additional data on water quality and soil productivity in settled
areas. The proposed project would study these aspects in a number of on-going
developments and in the project area itself (para. 3.25).
4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
ene~rai
4.01      The organization and management of the proposed project has been
formulated in line with GOI policies entrusting the implementation of
project components to line agencies normally responsible for those activities.
On this basis, three line agencies would implement the physical components
of the project: P4S would implemernt the hydraulic infrastructure; PTPT
would implement land clearing; and DGT would be responsible for the
construction of houses, village facilities, tr?nsport and settlement of
transmigrants, and coordinate social services for a period of about five
years.  Subdivision would be supported by DG Cipta KaTya which would plan
villages and DGA (Directorate General of Agrarian Affairs) which would
survey and register titles to individual plots. Agricultural support to the
project would be given by DGFCA from inception and throughout the lfe of
the project. In response to the needs nf this multiagency operation, lines
or authority and responsibility have vee. defined and specific coordination
responsibilities delineated at various activity levels.
4.02      Field Operations.  The first agency in the field would be P4S, whose
site manager would supervise the co^--truction of the hydraulic system and its
related structures.  As other operations would depend on the progress of
this construction, closely following it, the Government agreed to entrust !-he
field coordination of all other activities which include land clearing,
housing, and settlement of people to the P4S site manager until the
completion of main and secondary hydraulic infrastructure, in the fourth
construction year. The supervision of each of these activities would,
however, rest with the site manager of the respective responsible agency-
Thus from the second construction year, PTPT-s site manager would supervise
the clearing of houselots and farm plots, while DGT-s site manager would
supervise the construction of houses and village facilities, the supDly of
provisions and the settlement of people, and coordinate the field activities
of settlement supporting agencies (IXFCA, Ministries of Health and
Education). The latter would take over the coordination of all field
activities from P4S- site manager after the completion of the main and
secondary hydraulic network and until handing over the administration of the



-35 -
axea to local authorities. An assurance was obtained from GOI that P4S
would post their site manager by March 31, 1981 and that PTPT and OGT would
post qualified and experienced site managers by January 31, 1982.
4.03      Regional Operation.  Contract management and back-up services to
":>ld operations would be handled by regioaal offices of participating line
a;esz1es, lcated at Palembang, and coordinated by a Regional Coordinator
irs, the Junior Minister of Transmigration-s Office.  This official would
isoc coordinate the implementation of other Bank-supported transmigration
projects in the region. His main function would be to follow closely the
progress of contracning and implementation- of physical works and to plan and.
regulate the flow of transmigrants to the project area. Re would coordinate
the services to be rendered by regional agencies including tK  H4inistries of
Health, Education and Agriculture and would report monthly progress of
operations to the Junior Minister of Transmigration, alerting him of any
shortcomings or potential bottlenecks in the operation which may require
intervention at headquarters of line agencies or ministries. An assurance
was obtained that this official would be appointed by December 31, 1981.
4.04      Headquarters Operation.  Headquarters of line agencies would plan
the implementation of components of the project for which they are respons-
ible. Each agency, assisted by consultants, would prepare plans, designs,
contract documents, budgets, and assuming complete control of the quality
and timely completion of its contribution and operations of its regional and
field staff, take immediate action in case of slippages. The coordination
of headquarters activities would be .he responsibility of the Project
Coord>,r ~in the Office of the Junior Minister of Trausmigration, who has
been designated under Transmigration Project 11 (Loan 1707/Cr. 919) to
fulfill this function for all Bank-supported transmigration projects.
4.05      To strengthen project coordination furtner, a consultant would be
engaged to advise the Project Coordinator, Regioaal Coordinator and the
on-site field coordinator.  The consultant, who would be recruited from those
engaged by the Junior M-irtister of Transmigration (para. 3.25) would assist
in preparing timetables, follow up on implementing procedures, alert
participating or supporting agencies on actions to be taken, advise on
remedial action in case of slippages and establish a streamlined mechanism
of information exchange and decision making to reduce the workload imposed
by this and other projects. The consultant would also assess the manpowec
needs of participating agencies to execute GOI-s targeted swamp reclamation
program and propose a staffing recruitment program.
4.06      Annual implementation timetables would be prepared at the headquar-
ters of participa.ing line agencies in close collaboration with regional
managers, reviewed jointly and adjusted.  An integrated timetable would then
be prepared by the Project Coordinator and budgetary allocations based on it.
Each agency would be responsible for updating its work program on a monthly
basis and communicating any significant changes to the Project Coordinator



- 36 -
who would then readjust the integrated timetable in cooperation with other
concerned agencles. Critical slippages would be brought to the immediate
attention of all agencies, which would adjust their operations accordingly.
AgricriAtural Support Services
4.07      The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) and
Directorate General of Cooperatives (DGC) would provide the agricultural
support to the proposed project. As these agencies have presently no faci-
lities in the area, the provision of necessary infrastructure and facilities
for their staff would be constructed as part of, community facilities.  The
agencies would mobilize and prepare their--staff- to "Artrve in the area during
the settling of transmigrants.
4.08       Seeds and Agrochemicals.  DCFCA would supply each transmigrant
family upon arrival with an initial seed package of food and vegetable
crops and perennial seedlings .or their home gardens. Additionally, in
the first year of settlement DGFCA would supply 150 kg of urea, 100 kg of
?SP, 4 liters of insecticide and 1 kg of rodenticide (Table 4.1). rhe initial
seed package would contain sefficient food crop and vegetable seeds to enaLle
a farmer to repiant part of his area should he experieuce a crop failure in
the first year. DCFCA would ensure that inputs are made available to farmers
when needed.
4.09      Seed FarEs.  The central seed station (Kebun Benih Sentral) in Sout
Sumatra in cooperation with CRIA would be responsible for production of foun-
dation seeds. Two seed farms, one in Upang (10 ha) and one presently under
consti-<ction in Telang (25 ha) would produee stock seeds.  Prior to the
establishment of a network of seed growers in the project area the bulk of th
extension seeds would be produced by the two seed farms.  Assuming farmers
changed rice seed every fourth season, the annual demand for certified seed
would be about 50 tons and the agricultural office would coordinate its suppl
from the seed farms by alerting them six months in advance of actual s,aed
requireme.nts. REce and sezondary food crop seeds would also be available fro
the Palembang Estate and seed farms in Java.
4.10      Agricultural Extension.  A rural extension center (REC) would be
constructed by DGFCA under the Second National Agricultural Extension Pro  ct
(Credit 996-IND). Two middle-level extension workers (PPMs) and six field
extension workers (PFLs) would be appointed to provide extension services to
farixn2rs in the -roject area. As the local agroclimatic conditions differ fro
those at the transmigrants- place of origin, PPLs would advise farmers on
varieties, cultural practices and pest control (para. 3.03). The subject
matter specialist (PPS) stationed at Sungsang would make fortnightly visits
to the REC to train the PPLs on production techniques developed for swamps at
Upang-s test farm. He would also plan and supervise verification trials in
farmers- fields, familiarize himself with the production constraints in the
project area, and participate in adaptive trials with research staff at the
project substation (sec para. 4.13).

4.11      Farmers- Cooperatives.  The DGT would construct two warehouses,
one of 50 sq a for fertilizer storage and one of 100 sq m for grain storage;
a 500 sq a drying floor; one small rice will (1-2 ton rice/day); one 30 sq a
rice mill shelter; and 15 sq m office space for the KDD (village un-it
cooperative). The DGC would be responsible for tralning and staffing the
KUD with qualified personnel, and maintaining the village cooperative
infrastructure until the KlD is able to operate and maintain it on its own.
4.12      BRI.  The Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) wouid staff one village unit
(VU) bank in the main village of the project area. BRI would provide
short-term production credit under the BIMAS program through the VU.          -
4.13      Research.  AARD would be responsible to fund and carry out research
in the project area. A research substation (20 ha) adjacent to the REC would
be e6tablished under the project. The facilities would include one 20 sq m
general laboratory cum office, one 20 sq m store, one 70 sq A house and one 50
sq m house. The substation would be provided with field, laboratory, offlce,
and meteorological equipment; furniture; field inputs; bicycles and a speed
boat. Research and support staff would undertake testing of available
cropping patterns developed for swamps and modify them to suit local needs.
Research would be aimed at developing appropriate and feasible farming
practices for transmigrants and would include food crops, tree crops, cattle
and poultry. The siting of the research substation and REC in the same area
and sharing of common facilities would encourage closer interaztion between
research and extension personnel and ensure a two-way flow of information.
Operation and Maiw--=nce (O&M)
4.14      The hydraulic infrastructure (navigation, primary and secondary
canals) would be maintained by the regional office of the Public Works
Ministry (DPU) at Palembang, after a two-year 'running in  period following
completion of construction during which P4S would train DPU staff in
maintaining and operating the infrastructure. An O&M office would be
established at the base carp of the project area three years after the start
of construction. As the small size of the proposed project would not justify
the acquisition of costly draglines, manual labor would be employed where
feasible, supplemented by DPU-s own equipment or contract work. Assurances
were obtained from GOI that sufficient funds would be provided for operation
and maintenance, half of them by August 15 of each year, and the other half
in two installments until all budgeted amounts have been made available,
that a detailed annual O&M plan be worked out, the first by May 31, 1984
and that a project O&M office be staffed with qualified personnel by May 31,
1984.
4.15      On-farm works, tertiaries and farm bunds, would be operated and
maintained by the settlers with P4S assistance. Common elements of villages
and hamlets such as hamlet drains and outlets would be maintained by the
residents of each hamlet, as done in other ongoing developments.



- 39 -
4.16      Public buildings (schools, health centers etc.) constructed by DGT,
vould be operated and maintained by the appropriate ministries.  The Ministry
of Religious Affairs would supply religious leaders to places of worship in
each village.  The Directorate General of Education (Ministry of Education)
vould supply teachers and would supervise school curricula.  The Directorate
General of Community Health would supply staff and equipment for the sub-
centers and the health center, and would arrange for malaria control, and
nutrition activities.  The Ministry of Home Affairs would appoint village
heads and arrange the integration of the project-s new villages Into the
existiag administrative structi-re, after DGT completes its adfinistration,
about. five years after settlement starts.
4. 17     Agricultural support services would be operated and maintained by
DGFCA-s annual budgets. Facilities and equipaent of village cooperatives,
constructed by DCT, would be transferred to DGC, DGT, which would operate and
maintain them until cooperatives become financiaUy viable. The management of
co-ops would be turned over to their aembers, who would appoint staff for that
puxpose. The infrastructure would be turned over to KUDs, who would maintain
It and its equipment from earnlngs generated by its activities.
Mozm1toring and Evaluation
41-i       Implementation Monitorng8   The implementation of the proposed
-advelopment would be monitored and evaluated by the Regional Coordinator at
Palembang, focussing on the technical and administrative performance of each
participating agency and on identifying factors constraining the attainment of
timetables or causing cost overruns_
4.19       Physical, socioeconomic conditions of the proposed development and
its ecological impact would be monitored by P4S, DGFCA, DGT, and DC Fisheries
from fifth implementation year and on. An assurance was obtained from GOI
that it would provide funds, staff and equipment required for monitoring for
five years and report its findings annually. Monitoring activities would
focus on the following subjects:
(a)  operation and maintenance requirements of the hydraulic system;
(P4S)
(b)  cropping patterns and their response to soil-water management;
(DGFCA)
(c)  changes in water quality in the systems serving the project area
and in the neighboring river system; (P4S)



- 40 -
(d) subsidence of soils; (P4S)
(e)  changes in soil fertility; (DGFCA)
(f) effects on fish; (DG Fisheries)
(g) the incidence and prevention of pests; (DGFCA)
(h) actual farm budgets and farm incomes; (DGFCA),
(1) off-farm activities; (DGT) and
(j)  development of villages and of supporting and administrative
services (DGT).
5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
5.01      The project would bring into agricultural production aver 7,200 ha
of presently undeveloped swamp land, allocated to 3,200 settler families on
the basis of 2.25 ha per family. While the total land allocation per family
is the same as in ongoing swamp reclamation schemes in the region, the
portlon allocated to the houselot would be enlarged from 0.25 ha presently
allocated to houselots in other projects to 0.5 ha, and the field plot would
be reduced to 1.75 ha. This innovation is based on the repeated observation
in the older schemes that the houselot- is rapidly put into intensive year-
round cultivation, often with higher value crops, while the e'-ltivation of
field plots, at some distance from the house, invariably lags. There are
several reasons for this, the first being that a mother with small children
can much more easily work within eye and earshot of the house than at a
distance. The second reason is that work in the houselot avoids the time
invested in walking to the field plot and back, and is particularly amenable
to short period investments of labor. Finally, houseplots naturally benefit
from improved pest surveillance and from fertilization by household wastes.
The size of the houselot is limited, however, by the goal of providing
nucleated settlements for purposes of providing efficient access, social and
agricultural services, and coEmminity life.
Cropping Patterns
5.02      Based on previous experience, the houselot will be used for a
mixture of annual and perennial crops, while the field plot will be used
exclusively for annual crops. Bouselot crops grown in existing areas
include wet rice (during the rainy season), corn, soybeans, coconuts,
banaaas, cassava, taro, various beans, tobacco, peanuts, pineapple, sweet
potatoes, and various tropical fruits, depending on farmer preferences,



- 41 -
skills, and price expectations.  To simplify the agricultural and economic
analyses, it is assumed that the hboxselot would be divided into 0.25 ha
devoted to annual crops (wet rice in the rainy season, corn in the dry
season) and 0.2 ha to perennials, represented by 0.1 ha of bananas and 0.1
ha of coconuts. It is assumed that cultivation and planting of the entire
houselot would take place within the year following settlement, as
experienced in other projects and due to the fact that bouselots would be
cleared before arrival of settlers.
5.03       Starting about three months after their arrival, settlers would
devote at least one full dry season to participating in the clearing of
field plots (para. 3.06).  Thus, settlers would - -not- be -expected- to cowenee-
planting of these plots until between 6 and 15 months after their arrival.
Planting of field plots would begin with a wet-season rice crop, assumed to
cover only 60% (1.05 ha) of the plot area allowing for space taken up by
unburned stumps, logs, roots, windrows, and other debris. The proportion of
the field plot devoted to wet-season rice is assumed to approach
progressively 100% over the next four rainy seasons, as woody materials
gradually decompose or are burned and chopped away.  The assumption of wet-
season rice monoculture is in accord with both past experience and the
appropriateness of this crop to the climate, soil, topography, and planned
water regime of the project area, in the context of smallholder settlement.
5.04      A departure from, or acceleration of cultivation practices in
ongoing developments is projected in regard to an expected relatively rapid
initiation of a dry-season upland crop (soybeans) in field plots. In ongoing
developments, this cultivation has been hampered b-u lack of moisture
during the dry season, the widespread presence of uncultivable deep peats,
and attacks by pests from uncleared belts of forest intersecting
agricultural areas. The proposed project differs importantly from
other developments in the following aspects:
(a) an improved measure of water control with water level control
structures on tertiary drains and clay-to-clay field bunds to
prevent overdrainage during the dry season, as well as the poten-
tial capability to irrigate 15% of the area through tidal action;
(b) the intentional location of the project in an area without deep
peats; and
(c) clearing of the entire agricultural area during the construction
phase, relieving the settlers of subsequent years of difficult
clearing work without adequate tools, organization and direction;
also, the moderation of the pest (rats, boars, birds, insects)
menace by clearing the entire area.
Given these improvements, it is assumed here that IOX of the field plot will
be planted to a dry-season upland crop two years after settlement, rising



- 42-
progressively to an intensity of 40Z over the subsequent four years. A
higher final cropping intenslty is unlikely due to moisture deficiencies
(para. 2.08).
Cropping Calendar
5.05      Farmers would be expected to grow wet-season paddy from October to
June. Depending on available rainfall, seedlings would be transplanted
between December and January and the crop harvested fros May to June.
Secondary food crops would be grown from June to October.  The planting of
food crops in houselots would follow the same cropping calendar as for farm
plots.  Perennial tree crops and tropical fruits would- be- established in- the-e
houselots soon after settling. The proposed cropping calendar shown in
Figure 5.1 was based on climatic considerations and on demand and supply of
labor for each operation (Annex 2, Table 7).
Yields
5.06      Projected initial and final agricultural ylelds and periods of
yield development are presented in Table 5.1 below:

Soybeans (tons/ha)         0.5              1.0               6 years
Assumed yields and their development over time are based on actual experience
in nearby areas of potential acid-sulphate soils, particularly in the older
blocks of Upang, where agricultural development has proceeded for abcut
eight years. Details of yield development and assumed input usage by year
are presented in Annex 2, Table 11 for a representative settler family, and
on an aggregate basis for each crop, taking into account the phased arrival
of the settlers, in Annex 2, Tables 3-7. Assumed input usage is actually
greater than present settler practice and should enable settlers under the
present project to achieve higher final yields over the long term,

iatensity attempt to give adequate weight to the typical difficulties faced
by settlers anywhere, including the coastal swamp region of SumAtra, in
converting rough scrub-covered terrain into agricultural land. The pecullar
difficulties faced by settlers in the swamps include the control of soil
aoisture to prevent soil toxicity, and an almost total reliance on manual
cultivation and handsLashing of weeds, as the soils in the region would not
support conventional four-wheel or pedestrian tractors or even draft animals
until several years of cropping and drainage have passed. Erosion by water
or wind, a comon problem in the uplands, would not be a factor here.
Productlo_
5.07      Assumed production buildup of the various crops is presented in
the respective Annex 2 tables. Production and bc1me consumption at full
development is summarized in the following Table 5.2.

Bananas (bunches)          382,000               290,000          1992
Thus, by the 1990s the project area is expected to ship about 12,000
tons of paddy (7,300 tons of ailled rice), 2,000 tons of soybeans or other
secondary food crops, a million fresh coconuts and 90,000 bunches of
bananas (representing a variety of fruits) to food deficit points in the
region, chiefly to Palembang (para. 6.01).
Drying, Storage, and Processing
5.08      Farmers would be expected to sun-dry paddy in houselots and on mats
and store dry paddy in their bouases. The BUUDs/KUDs would be equipped with
concrete drying floors (para. 4.11), and private millers or traders, expected
to move into the area, would also provide paddv drying facilities. The
project would provide a warehouse suitable for grain storage, while milling
facilities would be provided chiefly by private millers (para. 2.16).

Livestock and Fisheries
5.09      The Directorate General of Animal fusbandrv (DGAH) is considering
the introduction of cattle fattening and breeding on a credit basis to
Interested farmers. The cattle could be fed in part with some of the
abundant weeds, and their nanure could be used to fertilize houselots. As
this scheme would be expected to be limited in its initial scope, no
specific actions need be taken under the project and no benefits were taken
into account in calculating project benefits.
5.10      Fishing would be expected to be an important activity of the
transmigrants both for the supply of protein as well as -a. source. of. incOAe..
Fishing areas would be in the estuaries of the rivezs and in adjacent man-
groves and would be leased from the narga at annual auctions. The project
itself would not include a special fishery component, as standing water
bodies in the project area would be drained, and fishing in the drainage
system could not compete with fishing in the nearby rivers.
6.  MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      Dle to its size and the effective demand generated by its large
growth industries, Palembang is, and would continue to be, the major market
for all surplus produce of the project area. Although there are secondary
markets close to the project area, particularly Sungsang, the ys- of most
agricultural products are set by the demands of Palembang. These prices are
in many cases much higher than elsewhere in Indonesia, due to Palembang's
locat0on in the middle of extensive swamplands, far from major agricultural
surplus regions. This is particularly true for products which are not
marketed or regulated by the Government-s logistics agencies, such as
coconuts, bananas and other fruit. For example, coconuts are currently
shipped fresh and unhusked to Palembang from the project area for a qu.ayside
price of Rp 100 (US$0.16) per nut, and bananas fetch an average of Rp 625
(US$1.00) per bunch for the same market. Soybeans and corn, which are also
not yet effectively covered by a Government procurement system, are also
relatively high priced in the swamp region at about Rp 250 (US$0.40) and Rp
90 (US$0.14) per kg, respectively. The local prices for most other
commodities which would be produced on houselots (para. 5.02) exceed those
in Java, and farmers apparently experience no difficulty in selling these
crops to traders even in small volumes.
6.02       Both Sumatra as a whole and South Sumatra Province in particular
are rice-deficit areas, with the total deficit of the province estimated at
over 100,000 tons of rice per annum or 20Z of provincial consumption. Aside
from Palembang itself, 7 of the provinces 11 districts must import rice
from the 4 surplus districta in the province (MUsi Banyuasin providing



- 45 -
about 30,000 tons per annum), from surplus districts in neighboring provin-
ces, and from overseas. At the margin, project area production would substi-
tute for foreign imports, a major agricultural policy goal in a country
which in recent years has been the largest rice importer in the world.
6.03       Alongside the thriving private marketing channels described above
(paras. 2.15-2.16), project area farmers would have access to the Government
logistical system which supports producer prices for paddy and, eventually,
for corn and soybeans as well. Under the system, the village cooperatives
(KUDs) function as purchasing agents for the Government-s food procurement
authority (BULOG/DOLOG), which maintains a floor price for paddy throughout
Indonesia.  This is currently Rp 105 (US$0.17)/kg for 14% moist paddy.  The
recently instituted BULOG support prices for soybeans and corn (Rp 210 and
Rp 70 per kg respectively) are below the actual market prices prevailing in
the region, and are thus anticipated to exert little influence on farm-gate
prices in view of the small impact of the production of the proposed project
on local markets. The BULOG rice price is expected to serve as a good
Irdicator of actual farm-gate prices, particularly once new KUDs are estab-
lished in the proposed settlement area. DOLOG, BULOG-s subsidiary in the
province, would arrange the transport of paddy purchased by the KUD from the
local KUD warehouse to its own warehouses in Palembang.
Prices
6.04      Farm inputs and outputs have been valued in terms of constant 1980
currency values for both the farm budgets and economic analyses. For rice,
soybeans, corn, and fertilizers, projections of economic prices were based on
world market price forecasts produced by the Bank-s Commodity Division,
adjusted for transportation, processing, and handling costs down to the
farm-gate level (Annex 2, Tables 1-2).  For coconuts and the local varieties
of bananas, which are sold fresh to the regional market, actual current
farn-gate prices were used for the 1980 base year, adjusted Gver time
proportionally with Bank projections of world market copra and banana
prices. The economic prices of agrochemicals (insecticides and
rodenticides) have been assumed to remain constant i- real terms, while
economic prices for seeds and coconut and banana planting materials have
been assumed to vary proportionally with the prices of the respective
agricultural outputs. In order to value the project output of paddy, it was
assumed that 30% of such output would be milled into high quality rice (5%
brokens); 50% into medium grades (25-30% brokens) valued at 75% of high
quality; and 20% into low grade rice (42% brokens) valued at 60% of high
quality.  A unit of project rice output would thus be valued in ec--omic
terms-at 80% of the world market price for 5% brokens. The economic price
for paddy at the farm-gate would, on this basis, rise from US$230/ton in 1980
to US$270/ton in 1990, in constant terms.
6.05      Ristorically, the Government has followed a policy of keeping
consumer food prices low by selling imported rice below its cost and keeping
domestic floor prices low. To mitigate the effect of this policy on farm



- 46 -
income, the Government has simultaneously subsidized fertilizer, pesticides,
and seeds. In the last five years, however, GOI has substantially raised
domestic floor prices to encourage paddy production.  This change in policy,
combined with the fall of world prices from the record levels of 1973/74,
has brought farm-gate prices fairly close to world market levels, taking into
account the quality differences. It is assumed that the BblOG floor price
for paddy will continue to rise with the world market price, moving propor-
tionally closer to it over the coming decade.
Farm Incomes
6.06      For farm income analysis a'detailed year-by-yeartmodel (Annnex 2,'
Table 12) has been prepared for a representative settler family arriving
during the second half of 1983. The cropping pattern and agricultural
development of this family farm (Annex 2, Table ll) is similar to that
described in Chapter 5, and its supply of casual labor for wages (Annex 2,
Table 9) and engagement of hired labor would follow the pattern discussed
in paras. 7.05-7.09. The model shows that the family requires considerable
subsistence assistance in the first 18 months of settlement, as its first
small crop of paddy in the houselot would not be harvested until May/June
1984, followed by a small secondary food crop (corn) in the houselot
harvested in September/October 1984, and augmented over that period by
earnings of between Rp 36,000 (US$58) and Rp 68,000 (US$109) for 45 to 85
days of labor on land-clearing and drain excavation operations. Estimated
conservatively, earned income during the first year of settlement could
amount to no more than Rp 76,000 (US$122), fa-m below the bare subsistence
level of Rp 110,000 (US$176) the family survived orn before it migrated.
During the second year of settlement the family would initiate planting of
the newly cleared field plots, with the first large rice crop ready for
harvest in May/June 1985. Thus, until this time the family would require
the subsistence provisions provided under the project (para. 3.13).
6.07      The end of the second year of settlement should see the family
in a markedly improved agricultural and financial positio.,  Its first large
paddy crop should be harvested, the 1,640 kg of paddy harvested being about
600 kg greater than the familys annual subsistence needs. Secondary food
crop production (corn and soybeans, or equivalently cassava, peanuts, sweet
potatoes, taro, beans, vegetables, etc.) should roughly equal household
consumption, while rapidly maturing fruits (bananas, pineapples) should be
meeting a large part of family needs, as should houselot poultry flocks and
part-time fishing in the nearby rivers. The household at this stage would be
largely self-reliant for food except for meat, and should have a net annual
cash income of about Rp 140,000 (US$220), half from labor earnings and half
from paddy sales, to purchase supplemental food, clothing, other consumer
goods and agr'cultural inputs. Subsequen, years should witness a rapid
growth (24% per annum) in the gross financial value of farm cutput, from Rp
269,000 (USS430) in 1984/85 to Rp 958,000 (us$1,530) in 1990/9i.  Net family
income, including labor earnings and payments for agricultural inputs and
land taxes, would rise at a slightly slower rate (19%) over this period,
from Rp 326,000 (US$520) in i984/85 to Rp 9i0,000 (iUS$1,460) in. 1990/91.



- 47 -
6.08      Settler family income would continue to rise slowly after 1991,
as slowly maturing tree crops in the houselot (e.g. coconuts, fruit,
cloves, coffee) come into full bearing, and particularly as maturing
children engage more heavily in labor activities off the family farm or get
married and form new families and farms of their own. The maximum settler
family net income, before departure of adult children, about 12 years after
settlement, would be about Rp 1 million (US$1,600) for a family of six
members, or Rp 167,000 (US$267) per capita, in 1980 currency values. This
level of income would compare favorably with incomes of settlers in other
transmigration areas.
Project Charges
6.09      As in all of the transmigration projects, settlers would pay no
taxes or project charges until DCT transfers administration of settlements to
the Provincial Government, about five years after settlement.  After that,
settlers would pay a national land tax (IPEDA), at a rate calculated on the
basis of the assessed 'with project- land capability and productivity. In
addition, settlers would operate and maintain all tertiary and hamlet drain
systems. This arrangement is similar to that in effect in irrigation
projects, with the exception of the initial grace period, which in this case
would release transmigrant settlers from financial obligations during their
settling period. The land tax would contribute towards the operation and
maintenance costs of the main and secondary systems and as it is assessed as a
percentage of the estimated value of farm production, it would increase as
crop yields rise. At full agricultural development, IPEDA would reach an
estimated Rp 9,000/ha or Rp 19,800 (US$32) per settler farm. GOI has tied
disbursements under its local infrastructure development program (INPRES) to
IPEDA collection and as a result IPEDA collection, as observed elsewhere in
Indonesia, is expected to be high.
6.10      In calculating cost recovery, all administration, infrastructure,
land development and settlement costs, and physical contingencies have been
included; on the basis of these costs the recovery by IPEDA taxes yields a
cost recovery index of 2%. The rent recovery index is 11% (Annex 2, Table
13). These rates, which are quite low if one considers only projects in Java,
are in liae with those obtaining in other transmigration projects (5% cost
recovery for Transmigration II Project - Loan 1707/Cr. 919-IND) and with
those in new irrigation projects in the Other Islands (3% cost recovery for
Irrigation Project XV, (Cr. 995-IND).  They are justified considering present
and projected income levels of settlers in this project, which are and will
remain below present and projected critical consumption levels (assuming an
average growth rate of 4.5% per annum)./l It would be counter productive to
the Government-s efforts to resettle people from Java if they were to be taxed
in resettlement areas more than farmers in other parts of Indonesia, where
lands are better and agricultural risks are much lower. As a matter of
policy, the Government has not contemplated recovery of costs in
transmigration projects; considering the low income projected and the personal
risks entailed, cost recovery during the initial years of settlement not only
would be unjustified on equity grounds but could also prove a disincentive to
parti- ipation.
/L Real consumption expenditure of the bottom 40% of the population is
expected to increase at 3.5% to 5.5% annually.

7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01         e.it benefits to be derived from the project depend to a large
zxtent ou -.;e wiay the settlers respond to the opportunities and challenges
offered then by the project, particularly in regard to water management, the
loice of c:ops to be cultivated, the intensity with which they cultivate
the land, the range or inputs, and the amount of off-firm work engaged in
during the long slack seasonrs when available labor supply exceeds the
pro,ect area's own agricultural demands.  The latter is a benefit of the
project, as the proJect its-lf locates the settlers in a region where labor
is scarce and seascual wages in agriculture, forestry, fishing, construction 
transport and other activities are much higher than in Java/Bali.
7.02      The benefits of timber extraction facilitated by improved access
provided under the project, which are qiite important in many settlement
projects, are negligible here due to the location of the project in an area
of secondary forest and scrub, and are not accounte' for in this analysis.
The social benefits of establish5ng self-reliant land-owring farmers from
dependent, economically marginal families are also not accounted for,
although they are significant. Independent surveys of established settlers
in nearby swamp reclamation projects, including some where agricultural
development has been unsatisfactory, indicate that an insignificant
proportion (2%) of the settlers leave a project area, and that nearly all
(99%) of those who remain feel better off than in their areas of origin,
which must reflect improvements in both their Financial and social status.
In general, the economic behavior of the settlers unde: the present project
has been projected on the basis of surveys and observations of older project
areas in the region (paras. 2.17-2.19).
Benefits
7.03      The pattern and pace of ptojected agricultuiral development of the
smallholdings, and final yields, production and input usage are discus-d In
Chapter 5 and derailed in Annex 2, Tables 3-7.  Yield development and
increases in 7set-season rice cropping intensity have been estimated on the
basis of trends in the region. The agricultural model is based on five
crops whi-ch are well known to the settlers, without livestock; in fact
cropping patterns will be more complex as individual farmers adopt different
crops which provide even higher returns.
7.04      As presented in Annex 2, Table 10, rice is the agricultural linch-
pin of the proJect, both in the early years, when it provIdes over 75% of
the net agricultural production benefits, and at full development, when it
still provides over 67% of such benefits.!L  A dry-season upland crop (corn)
/1  This, despite the fact that all hired labor required by the farms i-s
ascribed to rice production (Annex 2, Table 3).



- 49 -
on :7alf the bouselot area provides small but early benefirs, typical-ly
subsistence food for the wet season, while in the longer term, the
development of tne dry-season crop (soybeans) in the fields contributes 15%
of total agricultural benefits. Among the houselot perennials, a mixture is
projected of early producincg crops (bananas) and those with a longer
maturity per-tod (coconuts) requiring considerably less labor.
Labor Costs a -1 Benefits
7.05      Settler labor figures in the economic analysis of this project as
both a cost and a benefit.  The- apportunity. cost of. settler labor throughout
the project period has been assumed to be equal to their Incomes in their
point of origin, as the project itself would remove the settlers from the
Java/Bali labor force. On the basis of recent suirveys, these incomes are
estimated to average annually Rp 110,000/family (US$176/family)_/1 Real
vages are assumed to remain constant over time, in accord with several
village-level sociological studies in Java which have indicated this to Fe
true dturing the past decade. However, it is assumed that the opportunity
cost of settler family labor increases over time (Ainex 2, Table 9) as the
children mature and reach the age when they would have entered the labor
market in the home region.  In the economic analysis, it is assumed that the
children t-'ould have earned the same real wages as their parents, agricultural
or casual laborers.
7.06      The employment pattern in the settlement area represents a familiar
cycle. In the early years (1982-85), there will generally be an excess of
settler labor over and above the requirements of the slowly de--oping farms.
By 1985/86 new settler arrivals will cease, and most of the settlers will be
attempting to cultivate most of their land during the wet season and to ini-
tiate dry-season cropping on a portion of the field plots, in additior. to
intensive cultivation of the houselot. At this point, the need for hired
migratory labor during the peak seasons (May/June for harvesting the rice
crop and planting the soybean crop, November/December for transplanting the
rice crop) commences, reaching a peak of i27,000 man-days in 1987/88 and
declining to zero in 1991/92 (para. 7.07; Annex 2, Table  ).  Increasing
farm labor requirements over time follow from -he gradually increasing
intensity of land use, including the houselots, to a maximum of 153% at full
development, in 1990/91. Requiremsents for hired labor were determined on
the basis of a monthly analysis of settler labor supply and demand for the
various arriving groups. Family labor supply development was based on Annex
2, Table 8, while farm labor needs were derived from the scheJule presented
in Annex 2, Table 7 and the hectarage of various crops presented in Annex 2,
Tables 3-6.
/1 This could be earned typically by 160 days of labor by the father at
Rp 500/day (US$0.80/day) and 120 days of labor by the mother at Rp 250/
day (US$0.40/day).



- 50 -
7.07      The settler family labor force increases Inexorablv over
time (Annex 2, Table 8) as the children mature- Vhile considerable
settler surplus labor is available during the slack months (particularly
July-September and February-April) of even the busiest years, the lack of
need for any migratory hired labor during the peak operations after 1991 is
an indication of considerable underemployment of the family on the farm
itself after that year. Tle key parameters are obviously the assumed family
size (four children) and the amount of land given to a family. While a
larger farm plot would provide more on-farm employment in the long run, it
would also reduce the total number of families participating in the
transuigration program, demand increasing (and perhaps unfeasible) numbers
Of migratory laborers during the peak seasons of the middle years, and
represent a poorer return on investment in opening up the settlement area
due to slower increases in intensity of land use.
7.08      The farm size and agricultural model presented here, which provides
516 days of productive employment /1 per farm per annum at full development,
Ss considered a reasonable resolution of these tradeoffs.  The maximum
calculated amount of hired migratory labor required during the single peak
month of the development period (58,000 man-days in June 1988, equivalent to
1,000 migrant families) is estimated to be feasible at the margin, given the
very large flows of migratory labor in the region (para. 2-12). The final
farm income provided by the model is reasonable in the Indonesian context.
The total investment of settling one family on 2.25 ha of reclaimed swamps is
aDout USS7,300 (in end-1980 prices), including the cost of infrastructure,
site preparation, settling, supports and physfcal contingencies, and is close
to that of settling a family on 2.25 ha of cleared uplands.  7tal land
allocation is similar to that in other transmigration projects thus fitting
the Goveruimert-s overall program.  Finally, the pace of agricultural
development and cultivation of the land is both feasible and economically
attractive (para. 7.11).
7.09      Given the agricultcral model discussed above, settler families
would engage in a consi-ferable amount of nonfarm work in slack agricultural
seasons, and the rev.ards of this labor are accounted as benefits due to the
project (Annex 2, Tables 9-10). In the first instance, each settler
family head would be offered the opportunity to work at least 130 days
during the first two years after settlement on land clearing and drain and
bund construction within his settlement block. Contracts for those
activities would specify the payment of Rp 800/day (US$1.28) for settler
labor, which is considered a fair estimate of agricultural wage rates in the
Karang Agung region, and which is used in the economic analysis for both
peak-season labor hired by the farm and for all off-farm work by settlers.
Javanese laborers working with contractors, and local people and trans-
migrants working with timber and construction companies generally earn much
more, typically between Rp 1,200 (USSI.92) and Rp 1,800 (US$2.88) per day,
JI  Valued :n economic terms it an average of Rp 2,125 (US$3.40) per man-day
equivalent.



- 51 -
but this work involves weeks or months in remote jungle far from families,
and entails more hardship- After the first two years, settler families are
assumed to work an average of 50 days per year off-farm during their slack
periods until about 10 years after settlement, when grown children are assumed
to begin to engage heavily in off-farm work (fishing, logging, work in lumber
milLs and in transport) helping on the family farm oaly during peak seasons.
This projection accords closely with observed practice, except that it
abstracts from eventual formation of new families aad new farms by grown
children, which is economically much aore attractive than wage labor.
Investment Costs
7.10      All project base costs and related physical contingencies, including
those of infrastructure, settlement, subsistence provisions, administration,
and consultants working on project implementation, were included in the costs
for the purpose of economic ana'.sis. Such costs total US$27-6 million
(Rp 17.2 uillion) in 1980 Drices .i   In addition to the above costs, an esti-
mate of US$300,000 per year (hS$42/settled ha/year) has been charged to the
maintenance of the infrastructure and the provision of basic agricultural
and settlement services, commencing immediately after the investment period
and continuing throughout the life of the project. Foreign and local costs
aad benefits have been converted into border prices using the official
exchange rate of Rp 625 = US$1.00 and a standard conversion factor of 1-
Economic Rate of Return
7.11      Usiag the foregoing assumptions and discounting project costs and
benefits through 35 years, the economic rate of return is 13Z (Annex 2,
Table 10).
Sensitlvity Analysis
7-12      Sensitivity analysis -as used to determine which variables would
be crucial to the succoss of the project. To that end, crossover values
for a IOZ discount rate were calculated for a number of variables. The
crossover value is the valae of the variable tested for which the project's
ret present value, calcJlated at 10X discount rate, is zero, or, equivalently
the value beyond which the economic rate of return would be below lOZ.
Therefore, the greater the difference between the crossover value and the
value assumed in the analysis, the less sensitive the economic rate of
return is to the tested variable.

Minister for Transmigration, who would fulfill a coordination and
programming function.

7.13       Crossover values shown Inl Table 7.1 i-ndicate that :he vabi. itv o'
the project is relatively insensitive to substantia! departures from

agricultural benefit stream by 33 months, while maintaining Ohe original
investment schedule, would be required to invalidate pro-,ect t easibility.
The results of these analyses show that the Project is i-zdeed viable even
under adverse conditions.

Ri sks
7.14      Risks pertaining to the proposed project are environmental and orga-
nizationdl. Environmental problems could develop by ignoring constraints
imposed by soils in the project area while organizational problems could
develop by poor implementation management.
7.15      Environmental Factors-  The achievement of targetted rice yields
on potential acid-sulphate soili as found in the project area, requires a
high soil moisture in order to prevent these soils from oxidizing and acidifi-
cation.  The project addressesrthis requirement-and provides. nec.essary safe-
guards:  impervious bunds along perimeters of farm plots and checlks on
tertiary canals to maintain sufficiently nigh water levels in fields.
Experience on similar soils in neighboriflg areas shows that with these
arrangements risk of soils acidification is minimal.
7.16      Organizational Factors-  The project has made arrangements for
properly coordinated implementation of works, settlement o' people and support
services. Although agricultural development and benefits could be delayed by
the failure on part of management to coordinate activities of participating
agencies, heavy input of Government staff and consultants, the advanced stage
of project preparation and a strong commitment to the transmigration and swamp
reclamation program should cininize this risk.
8.  AGREENENTS REACHED AND RFCOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with the Govern-
ment on the following points:
(a)  DGFCA would provide pernanently two PPMs and six PPLs under the
part-time supervision of a PPS for extension services, and AARD
would provide permanentl-: adequately trained staff, as required,
to carry out agricultural research (para. 3.03);
(b)  DGT in coop'ration with DGA would assign "Right of Use  (hak
pakai) certificates for houselots and farm plots to settlers one
year after settling, and assign titles (hak milik) to their land
within five years after settling (para. 3.16);
(c)  Vae first health subcenter would he built, equipped and staffed
before the settlement of the first transnigrants and the other
subcenters and centers, as villages are built (para- 3.18);
(d) A suitably qualified regional coordinator would be appointed by
JMT not later than T)ecember 31, 1981 (para. 4.03);
(e) Consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and

Consultants assisting P4S and DGCK in project implementation would
be engaged by March 31, 1981, while those asisting PTPT, DGT, and
JMT would be engaged by March 31, 1982. By January 31, 1982 P4S
would engage consultants to assist in (i) carrying out a nationwide
inventory of coastal and near-coastal swamp developments;
(ii) carrying out a survey of selected existing developments to
assess the viability of their upgrading; and (iii) carrying out an
environmental impact study of selected swamp developments. By
March 31, 1982 P4S would engage consultants to assist ln carrying
out an investigation of groundwater at Karang Agung. By October 31,
1984, the Government would engage consultants to assist P4S,
DGFCA, DGT and DC Fisheries in monttoting the physiea1, ec:6ogfcal
and socio-economic impact of the project (para. 3.25).
(f)  Separate project accounts would be maintained by each implementing
agency which would be annually audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and submitted to the Bank within six month
after the close of each fiscal year (para. 3-33);
(g) P4S would post a qualified and experienced site manager by March 31,
1981 and PTPT and DGT would post qualified and experienced site
managers by January 31, 1982 (para. 4-02):
(h) GOI will allocate adequate funds to properly maintain the con-
structed project infrastructure including the navigation, primary,
secondary canals and all structures providing half of annual funds
by August 15 of each year, and the second half in two installments
until all budgeted amounts have been made available. Annual
detailed O&M plans would be prepared and a project O&M office
with suitably qualified staff would be established by May 31, 1984.
(i)  The physical, socio-economic conditions and ecological impact of the
development would be monitored by GOT during 1985-1989 and reported
annually (para. 4-19).
8.02      With the above assurances the project would be suitable for a Rank
loan of ITSS22 million with a 20-year maturity including a grace period of
five years. The borrower would be the Republic of Indonesia.

The average age of marriage among local trausmigrant families is 23 for men and 18 for wmen, and the f
two children may actually leave the home after their 21st year to establish their own homes,   in that
event. the familv labor force would level off at 3 labor units., as the inheriting chfild and his spouse
sume nore work responsibilities and the aging parents gradually less.  To simplify calculation of long-
term settlement benefits, all children are here assumed to remain on original farm through project
perfod, and to engage in wage labor rather than forming new farms.

SWAMP RECLAMATION PROJECT I
STUDIES AND INVESTIGATIONS
Terms of Reference
I. Nationwide Inventory of Coastal and Near-Coastal
Swamp Developments
1.        The object of the study, which would be conducted by P4S and
consultants, is to prepare a nationwide inventory of potentially reclaimable
coastal and near-coastal swamps and rank the priority of their development.
A second object of the study is to train P4S- staff in the interpretation of
remote sensing techniques, in establishing criteria of reconnaissance surveys
and in programming and planning swamp developments. The scope of the
inventory is to collect, collate and screen available data, eliminate
unsuitable sites, investigate, on a reconnaissance level, sites of an
apparent development potential and rank the priority of their development
according to their physical characteristics, available data, etc.
2.        P4S and consultants would analyze and interpret satellite imagery,
aerial photos and maps, collate and analyze reports on soils and land
capability, existing land use, morphology, forests, tides, floods, water
quality and fisheries. After screening the data and eliminating unsuitable
sites, supplementary field data, on a reconnaissance level, would be
collected for apparent, promising, sites, and analyzed. In this process,
particular attention would be given to the dynamics of settlement (through
time ser!e' of satellite Imagery and aerial photos), and to morphological
changes.
3.        At the conclusion of this work phase, a list of potential
development sites wouild be prepared, ranked by their development priority.
Consultants would also prepare terms of reference for master plan and
feasibility studies, detailing needs for minimum additional data required at
each work phase, and feasible techniques of obtaining them, and establishing
necessary manpower requirements.
4.        P4S would provide all available data to consultants conducting the
study, review all consultant reports, follow the progress of works and
evaluate results prior to the departure of the consultants. Work is expected
to be completed within 36 months of the arrival of the consultant staff.

II-  INVESTIGATION OF EXISTING SWAMP DEVELOPNF1:XS FOR UPGRADING
1.        The object of the investigation, which would he conducted by P4S
and b, consultants, is to determine upgrading needs of about 12 existing
Government-sponsored and about 6 spontaneous swamp developments In Sumatra
and Kalimantan. the investigations would primarily focus on the Infra-
structure, soils, cropping patterns, pest and weed controls, and yield
responses to water management and other inputs. Socio-economic conditions in
the satne areas would be investigated separately under a study funded under
Trans=igration 1I (Loan 1707/Cr. 919-IN')) by teams from local universities
(Sriwijaya University in Smatra and Lamhung Mangkurat TJniversity in
Kalimantan).
2.        P4S and consuitants would examine characteristics, operational
features and conditions of the hydranlic infrastructure in the selected
developments and note deficiencies and upgrading requirements.  They would
collect and analyze data on the extent and depth of inundations resulting
from tides, floods or rain; the quality of tidal water during the dry and wet
season, and its effect on soils and crops. Consultants would monitor
periodically quality of drainage effluents, soil pli and study the subsidence
and oxidation of peats-
3.        P4S and consultants would determine past and present cropping
patterns, cropping intensities, inputs a.-_ yields and assess factors
constraining the attainment of higher yields. They would prepare a short
feasibility study of upgrading three selected developments, including two
Government-sponsored and one spontaneous (development.  Finally, they would
prepare a work program for follow-up surveys, desions and implementation,
specifying data requirements and site specific methodologies for surveys and
designs.
4-        P4S would coordinate this study with the socio-economic survey
and the ecological impact study, follow and review the consultants- work and
all their reports, and evaluate it prior to the consultants- departur-?. T!ork
is expected to be completed within 36 months after the arrival of
consjltant staff.
