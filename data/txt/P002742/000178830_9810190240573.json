The project would finance construction of pit\n            latrines and replacement or conversion of existing on-plot\n            sanitation units; improvement of the Dar es Salaam City\n            Council (DCC) pit emptying service; establishment and\n            development of a Sewerage and Sanitation Department (DSSD)\n            in DCC; provision of offices, workshops, equipment and spare\n            parts; and technical assistance and training both for DSSD\n            and the National Urban Water Authority.
