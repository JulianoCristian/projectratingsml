Implementation Status and Key Decisions

   The Regional Coordination on Improved Water Resources Management and Capacity Program is a multi-country Adaptable Program (APL)
   financed under is to improve water resources and agricultural management and planning within and across beneficiary countries based on
   quantitative and spatial-based decision making tools. The overall APL1 program is to support activities in Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia
   and the Arab Water Council.
   The key PDO performance indicators include: (i) WISP operational in at least three of four implementing agencies; (ii) number of major water
   resources decisions made on improved agricultural and land use management taking into consideration outputs of WISP tools; and (iii) regional
   and country project data portal developed and operational.
   The project components include: (1) Improved Local Water Resources and Agricultural Management; (2) Capacity Building and Project
   Management; and (3) Regional Integration and Capacity Building.includes (a) financing of workshops organized by AWC for knowledge sharing
   with regional stakeholders; (b) development by AWC of an online portal to share local and regional results arising from the use of the WISP
   Tools; and (c) support to AWC for the preparation of regional reports on applications of regional significance including the use of data provided
   by Beneficiary Countries or Local Implementing Entities under the Project. All country PMUs are participating in all regional activities organized
   by AWC as planned.
   Although there were delays in the project implementation, the review of the overall project implementation revealed that the substantial
   improvement of the project implementation has been achieved for all components since the last MTR mission in April 2014, including (i) great
   efforts have been made in modeling studies on flood monitoring and forecasting, snow cover, crop and irrigation mapping, hydrological and
   aquifer modeling, and the climate change downscaling at the national level, and the primary results have been achieved in the respective
   studies; (ii) the overall disbursement progress has been improved from 18 % in April 2014 to 47% in December 2014. According to the existing
   procurement and disbursement plan, all remaining budget has been committed to be fully disbursed by the completion of the project in May
   2015; (iii) the PDO and the key outcome target values will be expected to achieve by the project completion in May 2015 ( see the detailed
   information In the section of the project results in this ISR); (iv) the project related end-users (the technical line ministries) are fully committed to
   the participation of the modeling studies; (v) all project country PMUs had signed 3 to 5 MOUs with related line agencies/ministries for the
   participation and application of the study results; (vi) the regional coordination has been strengthened by increased number of regional and
   country knowledge exchange workshops and technical trainings. However, the mission noticed that delays on ET, drought and ground water
   studies are still presented due to the lack of available technical tools, and the mission had agreed the need to work on the alternatives as
   identified during the last mission by the respective country PMUs. In order to fully achieve the Project output and outcome targets before the
   Grant’s closure date, the mission agreed with all country PMUs that it will be necessary for all project implementation agencies to accelerate the
   implementation progress for all ongoing studies and training programs along with procurement of equipment, and initiation of all pending
   activities. The detailed follow-up action plan has been identified and agreed with all implementation agencies, which will assist countries to
   complete the ongoing project activities and disbursement, and achieve the Project PDO targets by the project closing date on May 31, 2015.

 Overall Comments

 The project implementation has been improved dramatically since the MTR mission, although there was a delay started at the beginning of
 implementation. The disbursement progress has been improved from 18% in April 2014 at MTR to 47% in December 2014, and 50% in January
 2015, and all remaining funds have been committed and will be fully disbursed by the completion of the contracts through March to May 2015;
 Especially the most of the modeling studies had achieved primary results, and some of the modeling results have been applied by the end
 users/technical line agencies, although all PMUs are still working very closely with all project related ministries to achieve the final expected
 targets and PDO (under the on-going contracts). At the recent Arab Regional Water Forum in December 2014 in Cairo, all 4 country PMUs and
 Arab Water Councils had presented their existing technical study results and related applications by the end users (Ministries of Water and
 Agriculture). At this stage, we are confident that the project P117170 should be able to achieve the expected results and the PDO by the project
 closing date.
 The target value in 2014 for the main PDO indicators has been achieved: (i) the result indicator for the number of WISP systems operating is
 fully achieved in 2014 (160%), especially by Jordan where the system has been installed and operational in both remote sensing center and the
 Ministry of Water Resources; (ii) the achieved target value (for the indicator on the number of major water resources decisions made on improved
 agricultural and land use management taking into consideration outputs of WISP tools) show that 83% of 2014 target is achieved. The
 implementation of the PDO targets is still ongoing in all countries especially in Lebanon where the decision making platform has been developing
 and implementing including a creditable database for the major climatic parameters (rainfall and temperature) and for the major hydrologic
 parameters (including stream flow, selected springs and groundwater, reservoirs); and (iii) the third PDO (data portal) is also 130% achieved.
 AWC has completed the regional project data portal and is available on line, and all country portals are developed and/or on-going to be available
 on line.
