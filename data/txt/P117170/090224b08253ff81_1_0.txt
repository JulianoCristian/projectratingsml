                         The GEF Global Objective of the project is to better manage local and regional water resources and reduce the threat of land degradation and climate change to
                         vulnerable agricultural production systems and water resources in and across the project areas while developing options to address land-based pollution affecting the
                         Mediterranean Sea.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project comprises 5 TF Grants, with complex project implementation design (multiple countries and donor agencies). The project implementation progress is moving forward,
                         even though the implementation progress is still behind schedule. The World Bank MTR mission was conducted from April 5-14 in Morocco. The detailed MTR adjustments had been

                         proposed by all project PMUs, and discussed and agreed with the mission team during the MTR mission in the field. The PDO of the project continues to be valid and achievable,
                         and the project is expecting to be completed within the current grant closing date, because all PMUs are fully committed and taking actions to speed up their respective country
                         program. A project MTR restructuring paper with detailed description of the main changes has been proposed and being processed, and also attached to this ISR.

                         The latest ISR, dated December 31, 2013, rated the progress towards PDO as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The overall implementation progress was unsatisfactory from the beginning
                         as the project has suffered delays from early on. However, the recent Mid-Term Review mission noticed the substantial improvement of the implementation progress in the field. The
                         upgrade of IP rating from MU to MS is being proposed based on: (i) the improved implementation capacity/progress after the delivery of various trainings and improved coordination
                         between the recipients and donors; (ii) procurement plan and package updated and committed; (iii) all activities finalized and have been implementing at the regional and country
                         levels as planned, although the disbursement is not yet fully visible (some government funds used); (iv) project funds reallocated and fully committed, and more disbursement in
                         progress; (v) key M&E indicators updated; (vi) improved prospects as there is improved coordination and cooperation between all country PMUs and regional coordination office; and
                         (vii) close follow-up of agreed actions will further assist countries to accelerate completion of ongoing studies and achieve outcome targets before the grant's closure, and facilitate the
                         NASA team to deliver the agreed technical products over coming months.
