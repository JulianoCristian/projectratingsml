     country Regional Coordination on Improved Water Resources\n            Management and Capacity Building Program Project for Middle\n            East and North Africa were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to global environment outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: on balance, the fact that the project handled a\n            group of countries rather than a single one was probably a\n            strong positive factor in its success. The countries\n            excelled in various aspects of the project, and thus they\n            can truly learn from each other. Project performance, and\n            its marked improvement from the initial stage to the later,\n            shows the importance of applying World Bank protocols during\n            project preparation, so that the project starts well and\n            quickly. For projects other than specifically education or\n            training projects, fellowships for very long courses of\n            study (for example, PhD programs) should not be a major\n            project component. A good coordinating body can be extremely\n            useful, particularly for a regional project."}, "docdt": "2016-03-29T00:42:05Z"}
