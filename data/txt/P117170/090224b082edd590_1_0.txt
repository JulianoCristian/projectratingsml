Implementation Status and Key Decisions

   The Regional Coordination on Improved Water Resources Management and Capacity Program is a multi-country Adaptable Program (APL) to
   improve water resources & agricultural management and plan within and across beneficiary countries using quantitative and spatial –based
   decision making tools. The overall APL1 program is to support activities in Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and the Arab Water Council.
   The key PDO performance indicators include: (i) WISP being operational in at least three of four implementing agencies; (ii) number of major
   water resource decisions made on improved agricultural and land use management, taking into consideration outputs of WISP tools; and (iii)
   regional and country project data portals developed and operational.
   The project components include: (1) Improving Local Water Resources and Agricultural Management; (2) Capacity Building and Project
   Management; and (3) Regional Integration and Capacity Building, including (a) financing of workshops organized by AWC for knowledge
   sharing with regional stakeholders; (b) AWC development of an online portal to share local and regional results arising from the use of the WISP
   Tools; and (c) providing support to AWC for the preparation of regional reports on applications of regional significance including the use of data
   provided by Beneficiary Countries or Local Implementing Entities under the Project. All country PMUs are participating in all regional activities
   organized by AWC as planned.
   Although there were delays in the early stages of project implementation, the review of the project completion status revealed that the overall
   project implementation progress has been substantially improved following the MTR mission in April 2014. The project had made significant
   progress towards achieving the objectives and outcome results in all project countries and all project activities are completed or will be
   completed by the closing date (with the completion of the on-going contracts by May 31, 2015, see the details in the paras. below). The mission
   reviewed and assessed the final project’s physical and financial implementation progress, and the expected results achieved under each
   component for the respective project countries, and agreed on the following results achieved at the project completion:
   (a) by the project closing on May 31, 2015, all project components/activities will be fully completed as planned, with the final completion of the
   remaining on-going procurement packages/contracts by the end of May. The expected modeling study results/output targets under Component
   One have been achieved as agreed at the MTR in all project countries (except the groundwater study in Tunisia).Great efforts had been made
   by all country PMUs in order to complete and achieve the expected output results on various modeling studies, which included flood monitoring
   and forecasting, snow cover, crop/irrigation and ET mapping, hydrological and aquifer modeling, climate change downscaling, forestry fire
   monitoring, locust monitoring, and groundwater monitoring studies at the national level. So far except the Tunisia groundwater study (which had
   partially achieved the results), all study results have been achieved as planned, and presented and reported to all stakeholders through the
   capacity building activities under Component 2.The expected output targets of Component 2 had been fully achieved and exceeded for the
   number of training, dissemination and the national knowledge sharing workshops, the consultant services and technical assistant activities in all
   project countries.The expected regional coordination activities under Component 3 had been also fully implemented and completed, and the
   regional knowledge dissemination and exchange among project countries had been organized by the regional project coordination office (AWC)
   as planned, and the related expected output targets had been fully completed and exceeded;
   (b) according to the existing procurement and disbursement plan, all remaining budget has been committed to all procurement packages, and
   will be completed by May31, 2015 and further disbursed afterwards (during the grace period);
   (c) the expected 2015 target values of the three PDO result indicators have been fully achieved and exceeded as follows: (i) the target for “the
   number of WISP systems operating” is fully achieved and exceeded in 2015 (175% of the target value), especially by Jordan where the system
   has been installed and operational in both national remote sensing center and the Ministry of Water Resources; (ii) the target of “the number of
   major water resources decisions made on improved agricultural and land use management taking into consideration outputs of WISP tools” is
   achieved at 125% of 2015 target value.All project country PMUs had signed MOUs with related line ministries for the application of the study
   results. By May 2015, several countries had made the policy decisions (total about 10 decisions) based on the results of RS studies. For
   example, Jordan Ministry of Water had issued an amendment to groundwater law based on the RS study results on crop/irrigation/ET mapping
   in selected irrigation pilot areas. The amendment indicated that remote sensing will be used as a tool to calculate the cropped area and
   groundwater abstraction. In Lebanon, the RS operational room and the early warning system (for flood and forest fires) had been developed
   and operational, which is directly linked online to the national operational room (NOR) located at the Prime Ministry. The database and real
   time information collected and treated by SUNAR in the PMU’s operation room (both from space and ground measurements and interactive
   output maps and early warning information), linked directly to the NOR for the decision making at the level of the NOR for all
   ministries/directorates; [QL1] and (iii) the established number of data portal had been achieved by 130% of the target value in 2015. AWC had
   completed the regional project data portal and it is available online, and all country portals had been also developed and will be available online
   by the project completion on May 31, 2015. Detailed information on the intermediate results achieved by each component is available in the
   results section of the ISR (compared to targets in 2015), and all target values have been fully achieved or exceeded by May 2015; and
   (d) the regional coordination had been strengthened through the increased number of regional and country knowledge sharing and exchange
   workshops and technical trainings. Although 10 major decisions were made recently taking into consideration outputs of WISP tools in the
   respective line ministries in each project countries, and the impact of these decisions has not been fully showed in the field yet. The project is
   expecting to improve the water and agriculture management in the respective project countries and at the regional level in the near future
   through the implementation of these major water and agriculture management decisions made under the project.
