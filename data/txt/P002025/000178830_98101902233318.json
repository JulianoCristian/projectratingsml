infrastructure, support services and farm inputs; including\n            1,500 km of low cost agricultural roads; 85 small and medium\n            size earth dams and 160 ponds to provide water supplies to\n            humans and livestock; 77 farm service centers; rehabilitate\n            and equip two seed multiplication farms to produce improved\n            high yielding seed; and expand and create new training\n            facilities for project staff and farmers. The project will\n            also provide better support services in the form of a\n            tenfold increase in extension staff, introduce new credit at\n            project level for farm credits and marketing services to the\n            farmers; and the associated staff houses, offices and\n            transport facilities required to support these services. The\n            project will procure farm inputs to sell to farmers for cash\n            or credit, and will finance the cost of the Evaluation\n            Section of the Project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit."}, "docdt": "1974-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
