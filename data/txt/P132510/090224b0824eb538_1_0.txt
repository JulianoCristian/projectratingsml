                         The Second Private Sector DPL for US$15million for was approved on March 27, 2013 and is declared effective on July 12, 2013. The loan was fully disbursed in April 2014. This is
                         the third and the final ISR before the project closes in June 2014.
                         The development objective of this PSC DPL programmatic series is to strengthen the policy and institutional environment in Mauritius to support competitiveness and enterprise
                         development. The operation is achieving this by supporting reforms in around three integrated and mutually reinforcing pillars (i) improving enterprise growth and competitiveness; (ii)
                         improving access to finance; and (iii) promoting ICT usage and e-Government reforms for increased efficiency and transparency gains. Overall, steady progress is being made
                         towards the implementation of the policy areas under the three pillars.

                         Pillar 1:Improving enterprise growth and competitiveness:

                         To ensure that the Government receives value for money for its support through BDS schemes to enterprises, a robust Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system is vital. It was thus
                         agreed that the M&E arrangements put in place are introduced on a consistent basis for all BDS-related schemes being funded out of the NRF. This will allow relevant stakeholders to
                         compare the value for money achieved by the various mechanisms of support currently being funded, given the similar objectives. The main objective of this exercise was to provide

                         programs. The development of the M&E Framework is being led by MoFED in order to capture all the relevant BDS schemes. An international M&E consultant was hired in November
                         2013 who is in the process of developing the overall M&E Framework using inputs provided by all the relevant stakeholders.

                         Facilitating firm exit and promoting business rescue of viable firms: Strengthening the Mauritian credit environment through more effective debt resolution regimes has been identified
                         as a priority area in the Government’s efforts to improve competitiveness and growth of enterprises. Insolvency proceedings in Mauritius are significantly faster, cheaper, and return
                         more to creditors than those in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. However, according to the WBG’s 2013 Doing Business Report (DB 2013), Mauritius performs worse in the
                         ‘Resolving Insolvency’ indicator than it does in any of the other nine indicators. Part of Mauritius’ weak performance in this indicator is due to several reforms relating to the
                         Insolvency Act remaining outstanding or incomplete. Although the Insolvency Act represented a significant advancement in the development of Mauritius’ insolvency framework, in
                         order to be fully operationalized and implemented, it requires significant secondary legislation that remains outstanding. In particular, although insolvency practitioners were given a
                         greatly expanded set of responsibilities under the Insolvency Act, and commensurately, their regulation was contemplated, they remain largely unregulated. As part of the ‘Prior
                         Actions’ for DPL1, the GoM introduced regulations related to Insolvency Practitioners’ qualifications and appointment . The prior actions in DPL1 focused on operationalizing the
                         Mauritius Insolvency Act 2009 through more substantive regulations, in particular, in relation to insolvency practitioners. PSC DPL2 sought to build upon these reforms, better
                         implement the Insolvency Act 2009, and enhance the overall effectiveness of the country’s insolvency regime. In particular, the PSC DPL2 supported (i) the Publication of rules of
                         professional conduct for insolvency practitioners which will enhance transparency, fairness and professionalism amongst insolvency practitioners, and ultimately will enable more
                         effective processes under the law; (ii) the establishment of procedures by the Director of the Insolvency Service to deal with the suspension and removal of insolvency practitioners
                         from the Registry and (iii) the publication of Out-of-Court Workout (OCW) guidelines by the Insolvency Service to promote safeguarding viable businesses: seeking to keep viable
                         businesses alive can help maximize stakeholder returns, retain jobs and preserve supply networks. One Bank has reported using OCW guidelines and we are awaiting responses
                         from the other banks.

                         Pillar 2:Improving Access to Finance:

                         This project looked at addressing both the demand and the supply side constraints to access to finance. On the supply side, the DPL supported the restructuring of the Development
                         Bank of Mauritius and the establishment of a bank with a focus on MSMEs. Deloitte (India) has been appointed as the Transactions Advisor (TA) to assist the restructuring of the
                         DBM by the State Investment Corporation led steering committee. The TA has prepared a restructuring plan which was approved by the Cabinet on April 11, 2014. With regards to
                         the establishment of a new licensed commercial Bank with a focus on the MSME segment, GoM has hired an adviser who will prepare the application to be made at BOM. It is
                         envisaged that the application will be made by Oct 2014.

                         On the demand side, insufficient suitable collateral is cited as among the top constraints to accessing credit. Although the legislation in Mauritius provides for a wide range of
                         movable property that can be used as collateral, its secured transaction system is fragmented and different security rights are available for different types of grantors and different
                         types of assets. Credit is more readily available to businesses that have immovable property (land and buildings) to be used as collateral than those having movable assets as banks
                         heavily prefer immovable property such as land or buildings to secure a loan. For immovable assets, ensuring formal property rights is fundamental. Effective administration of land is
                         part of that. Around the world, movable assets, not land or buildings, often account for most of the capital stock of private firms and an especially large share of the assets for micro,
                         small and medium-size enterprises. The existing legal and regulatory regime for secured transactions in Mauritius has not been reformed in recent years to reflect the new financial

                         and commercial needs of the banking and business community. The Government has announced the decision to further facilitate the use of movable and intangible assets as
                         collateral and the establishment of a modern movable collateral registry. In order to do so a stakeholder committee has been set up to review the necessary legislative amendments
                         relating to secured transactions and collateral registries reform. The substance of this reform will address issues relating to the creation, registration and enforcement of security
                         interests over movable collateral. The government has taken the decision to amend the Civil Code Mauricien to implement the secured transactions reform.

                         Increasing coverage of Credit Bureau: Credit bureaus play an important role in financial stability by helping control over-indebtedness and are critical to the expansion of credit for
                         both individuals and small businesses. The Mauritius Credit Information Bureau (MCIB) was established in December 2005 by the BoM as a public registry of borrower information
                         with the main objective to ensure the development of an overall sound credit environment in Mauritius. The MCIB collects information from and shares information with financing
                         institutions to enable them to make more informed lending decisions, thereby lowering their default rate and improving the quality of lenders’ loan portfolio. The prior action for DPL1
                         was to expand coverage of the credit information bureau to include all non-bank financial institutions. This led to an increase in coverage from 407,160 customers in June 2011
                         representing 49.8 percent of the adult population to covering 554,809 registered entities representing 67.8 percent of the population in December 2012. Participants of the MCIB

                         Mauritius, the National Housing Development Co Ltd, the Mauritius Civil Service Mutual Aid Association, and the Employees Welfare Fund. Another critical source of data especially
                         for those who are outside the credit mainstream is utility companies. These include the Central Electricity Board and the Central Water Authority, waste water management and
                         companies offering information, communication and telecommunication services. In order to make it obligatory for these utility companies to share information with the Bank of

                         Mauritius, it was proposed that Section 52 of the Bank of Mauritius Act be amended to add the definition of the words ‘Utility Body’ as a corporate body which provides utility service
                         to the public and includes the Central Electricity Board, the Central Water Authority, the Waste Water Management Authority, companies offering information, communication and
                         telecommunication services, which is the prior action for this operation. Further, in order to facilitate the transfer of data from the utility companies to MCIB, there have been system
                         enhancements that have been undertaken to facilitate data transfer and decrease the transactions costs involved. Future enhancements would include the development of a file
                         transfer protocol to make the transfer possible online expeditiously. The amendment to the Banking Act, directly increases the coverage of the MCIB by including utility companies
                         which is critical towards achieving the objective as laid out in this component.

                         Pillar 3: Promoting ICT usage and e-Government reforms for Increased Efficiency and Transparency Gains
                         ICT is considered a key pillar for supporting competitiveness, and indeed the hope is that it will become a “fifth pillar” in the national economy contributing at least 7 percent of
                         national GDP. Given its potential to have significant positive spill-over effects on other sectors of the economy, the Government of Mauritius has prioritized the development of a high
                         performance broadband infrastructure on which ideas and services can be transmitted. Mauritius lacks strong Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that are independent of the main
                         operators. The ongoing work to define markets and determine which operators have SMP should provide the impetus for regulatory action to encourage the development of
                         independent ISPs by providing equal access to core facilities. A first step would be to carry out a study, and assess stakeholder opinions, on the possible need to consider structural
                         separation of the incumbent’s network, and to extend open access principles inland from the cable landing stations. This operation supports a more transparent process of spectrum
                         allocation. The civil radio frequency spectrum is an increasingly vital resource for information and communication services, especially for mobile broadband. The new legislation
                         recognizes class licenses and introduces a new section 24B on spectrum management. This inter alia creates a framework for allowing spectrum auctions, spectrum sharing and
                         even secondary spectrum trading. Further, ICTA published the tariff guidelines that will not only promote transparency but should, in the longer term, reduce the requirement for pre-
                         approval of tariffs by non-dominant operators, thereby promoting greater price innovation.
                         Meanwhile there is an increase in the number of public services that can be executed via secured online transactions that include online application and payments of services for
                         incorporation of a company, annual registration fees of a company, and ePayment for the lease of state land.
