development objective of the Second\n            Private Sector Competitiveness Development Policy Loan\n            Project for Mauritius is to strengthen the policy and\n            institutional environment in Mauritius to support\n            competitiveness and enterprise development. The operation\n            will achieve this by supporting reforms in three integrated\n            and mutually reinforcing pillars: 1) improving enterprise\n            growth and competitiveness; 2) improving access to finance;\n            and 3) promoting Information and Communication Technology\n            (ICT) usage and e-Government reforms for increased\n            efficiency and transparency gains. This Second Private\n            Sector Competitiveness Development Policy Loan (PSC-DPL2),\n            in an amount of US$15 million, is the second and the last in\n            a series of two annual programmatic operations in support of\n            the Government's medium-term reform program that\n            centers on competitiveness and equity as its twin pillars.\n            The series aims at strengthening the policy and\n            institutional environment in Mauritius to support\n            competitiveness and enterprise development. This DPL\n            operation will continue to focus on accelerating reforms in\n            support of private sector competitiveness by: a) supporting\n            the growth of new business enterprises through demand driven\n            business development schemes (BDS) and greater access to\n            finance; b) making business exit easier; and c) promoting\n            ICT usage and e-Government reforms for increased efficiency\n            and transparency gains."}, "docdt": "2013-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
