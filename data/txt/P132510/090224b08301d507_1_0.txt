   1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      This Implementation Completion and Results Report has been prepared at the conclusion
of the programmatic Private Sector Competitiveness (PSC) Development Policy Loan (DPL)
series, comprising two annual single-tranche operations of US$15 million equivalent each to the
Republic of Mauritius. The development objective of the PSC DPL series was to strengthen the
policy and institutional environment in Mauritius to support competitiveness and enterprise
development. The PSC programmatic DPL series was prepared in support of the Government’s
medium-term reform program that centers on competitiveness and equity as its twin pillars. The
way for Mauritius to continue its stride towards attainment of high income status through
inclusive growth is to further enhance its competitiveness. Mauritius was a predominantly
agricultural economy based on sugar production and has successfully diversified into textiles
exports, tourism and more recently financial services, offshore global business and Information
and Communications Technology (ICT). However, the manufacturing sector is facing
competitive pressure from increasing global competition in the export markets, exacerbated by
the ongoing slowdown in Europe, the main export market for the island economy. European
woes are also depressing tourist arrivals and revenues. The services sector are currently not high
value added sources of growth. The competitiveness agenda thus remains central. Mauritius
needs to improve on the quality of exported goods and services to serve new markets and also
needs to refocus on the SME sector, an important source of job creation and growth.

2.      Prior to the PSC DPL series, the Bank was supporting the Government’s competitiveness
and private sector development agenda through two investment loans (ILs): the Manufacturing
and Services Development and Competitiveness Project (MSDCP), and the Mauritius Economic
Transition Technical Assistance Project (METAP). METAP was approved on January 29, 2009,
and became effective on April 6, 2009 while MSDCP was approved on January 21, 2010 and
became effective on March 30, 2010. But in March 2011, these two sector ILs were still at an
early stage of implementation and were cancelled. Acknowledging the value of the World
Bank’s knowledge services, the Government requested the Bank to continue its support in the
area of competitiveness and enterprise development by reallocating the undisbursed funds into a
sector DPL operation. For the government, the main impetus for refashioning the delivery
instrument from an investment project to sector Development Policy Operation was (i) to allow
for the broadening and deepening the dialogue on a range of competitiveness issues facing the
island nation; (ii) to use policy dialogue as a means to support reform champions that can help
move forward politically challenging reforms and (iii) to align development partner support
around the government’s reform program. A programmatic approach, it was envisioned, would
help achieve the milestones required to make concrete advances in engendering a competitive
environment. In addition, the DPL instrument could play a catalyst role in Mauritius whereby it
brings together stakeholders from different government bodies and ministries, as well as the
Development Partners, to have a dialogue around common themes.

3.     The PSC DPL series was prepared in parallel with a Public Sector Performance (PSP)
DPL series. The PSC DPL series focused on strengthening the policy and institutional
environment for private sector growth, while the PSP DPL focused on improving the
performance of the public sector. Thus the two stand-alone operations were designed to be
mutually reinforcing and supported the twin competitiveness and equity pillars of the
government’s reform program.

1.1 Context at Appraisal:

4.      At the time of appraisal of the first operation in 2011, the economy was showing signs of
slowdown due to the current global economic uncertainty. Mauritius is a small open economy
and exports (i.e. textile, tourism and ICT-BPO sectors) are very dependent of the euro zone.
There was also some evidence that fiscal consolidation in advanced economies and increasing
debt and financial worries in Europe was having an impact on the Mauritian economy, with a
substantial fall in FDI in the first half of 2011; a decrease of 13 percent in total exports during
the first quarter of 2011 over the previous quarter; unemployment increasing to 8.3 percent
during the first quarter of 2011 compared to 7.2 percent at the fourth quarter of 2010; and the
stock market index value slightly reducing by 4 percent since June 2011.

5.       The predicted GDP growth though positive, remained below the level necessary to
achieve the country’s aspiration to become a high-income country by the next decade. Growth
prospects were vulnerable to the pace of implementation of domestic reforms as well as external
factors. The negative impact of the 2008/2009 global economic crisis was partially contained as
a result of a short-term fiscal stimulus package that also aimed to build long-term
competitiveness and enhance the investment climate. This package was made possible by the
Government‘s relatively comfortable fiscal position prior to the onset of the crisis. This fiscal
space allowed the Government to adopt an expansionary macroeconomic policy, with both fiscal
and monetary components. One salient feature of these targeted programs was the close
coordination between the public and private sectors in which the Government agreed to support
firms as they restructured while the private sector did its utmost to preserve employment. As a
result, jobs were maintained during the crisis, and the unemployment rate remained stable at 7.3
percent in 2009 compared to 7.2 percent in 2008. Critical constraints to economic development,
particularly with regard to competitiveness agenda, had become increasingly evident.

6.      The DPL series is consistent with the objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) (2007-13) and the CPS Progress Report of May 2011 that underlines improving
competitiveness and investment climate as its central theme of reforms, along with promoting
inclusion and fiscal consolidation. Although, the DPL series is the principal instrument identified
in the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for supporting the government’s reform program, a
sector DPL loan was not originally envisaged. However, it was recognized that in a middle
income country like Mauritius, the Bank had to maintain the flexibility to respond to the
Government‘s evolving priorities. The approach of the DPL series was to focus on reforms that
could be completed in the short-term while building the necessary foundations for broader
reform over the medium-term.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

The development objective of the programmatic series was to strengthen the policy and
institutional environment in Mauritius to support competitiveness and enterprise
development.

7.     The operation would achieve this by supporting reforms around three integrated and
mutually reinforcing pillars (i) improving competitiveness and growth of enterprises; (ii)
                                                16
improving access to finance; and (iii) promoting ICT and e-Gov for enhancing competitiveness
and transparency. The key outcome indicators were:

Pillar 1: Improving Competitiveness and Growth of Enterprises
    • Number of enterprises accessing ―generic and specialized business development
        services (BDS) increases;
    • Number of insolvency practitioners registered;
    • Number of businesses with an approved restructuring plan.

Pillar 2: Improving Access to Finance
    • Development Bank of Mauritius meets prudential requirements of the Central bank;
    • Reduction in the interest subsidy to DBM;
    • Increase in the number of loans to SMEs of less than Rs150,000;
    • Reduction in time taken to register property;
    • Increase in coverage of the credit information bureau.

Pillar 3: ICT and e-Gov Reforms
    • Increase in the number of homes that have access to download speeds of at least 10 Mbps
        and upload speeds of at least 5 Mbps;
    • Decrease in average monthly retail price of broadband ADSL 256 kbps with 3 GB
        allowance service to households;
    • Increase in the number of public services that can be executed via secured transactions.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification:

8.     The PDO was not revised during the implementation of the series. The results framework
was, nonetheless modified, to include more specific measurements which would be more
relevant to the reform undertaken.

9.      In Pillar 1, the Number of banks using out-of-court workouts replaced the Number of
businesses with an approved restructuring plan. This was considered to be a more reliable
indicator and easier to measure. Whereas restructuring plans are confidential, and therefore
difficult to count, it was easier to ask the banks whether they would use any out-of-court process
in order to achieve restructuring.

10.     In Pillar 2, the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) related indicators were replaced
by (i) DBM restructured by the sale of its non-banking assets; and (ii) A new licensed
commercial Bank with a focus on the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) segment
established. The indicators were changed to reflect the fact that the options could include a new
commercial bank taking over the assets of DBM and catering to the MSME space.

11.     The indicators for the third pillar were further refined as the prior actions went beyond
what was originally envisaged and made more elaborate. One of these was a supply side
indicator whereas the indications were that Mauritius’s problems were more on the demand side.


                                               17
12.       The key outcome indicators were as follows:

Pillar 1: Improving Competitiveness and Growth of Enterprises
      •   Number of enterprises accessing “generic” and specialized business development
          services (BDS) increases;
      •   Development of a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for BDS schemes;
      •   Number of insolvency practitioners registered; and
      •   Number of banks using out-of-court workouts.

Pillar 2: Improving Access to Finance
      •   Development Bank of Mauritius restructured by the sale of its non-banking assets;
      •   A new licensed commercial Bank with a focus on the MSME segment established;
      •   Reduction in time taken to register property;
      •   Completion of the necessary legislative amendments for the facilitation of secured
          lending transactions; and
      •   Increase in coverage of the credit information bureau.

Pillar 3: ICT and e-Gov Reforms
      •   Increase in number of broadband subscriptions with actual speeds of at least 10 Mbit/s;
      •   Decrease in the price per 1Mbit/s per month of broadband service, fixed and mobile; and
      •   Increase in the number of public services that can be executed via secured online
          transactions.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

13.       The program supported three main policy areas:

14.      Enterprise Growth and Competitiveness. The entry of new firms, their expansion in
the initial years in the life-cycle, and the exit of weak or obsolete firms is part of firm dynamics.
Research based on firm-level data supports the assertion that the continuous process of
reallocation of resources plays an important role for aggregate productivity and output growth.
The 2009 Mauritius Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) underlined skills and technology
deficiencies as one of the key constraints faced by enterprises. In this context, the Government
had undertaken several market-completing interventions in the form of Business Development
Services (BDS) to SMEs focusing on skills and training, technology development, and
information services gaps.

15.    These programs were considered as not meeting market needs of SMEs and were of
mixed quality. The effectiveness of these programs was further hampered by coordination
challenges among the multiple agencies and between programs with overlapping objectives,
roles and cumbersome procedures. There was also widespread agreement - both within the
                                                  18
private and public sector - that a multiplicity of service providers with overlapping roles and
responsibilities hindered the ability of firms to identify and obtain the required support.
Fragmented BDS assistance programs to small enterprises raised the overall cost and reduced
effectiveness of the programs.

16.    With a view to undertake a strategic reorientation of SME programs, Ministry of
Business, Enterprise, and Cooperatives (MoBEC) sought cabinet approval of consolidation of its
SME programs which was the agreed prior action for the first PSC DPL. The DPL was intended
to support the Government‘s efforts on the strategic reorientation of SME programs – through
Non-Lending TA and Fee-Based TA. It was envisaged that the output from this work would (i)
define a new strategic orientation of SME support institutions that are harmonized among the
concerned institutions so that there is limited overlap and duplication. Among other things, this
would include: (a) establishing an inter-agency strategic coordination mechanism; (b) developing
a framework that sets up guidelines on target groups and criteria, types of services, and where
applicable, cost-sharing rules; and (c) setting up a robust M&E system that monitors
performance and results.

17.     Facilitating firm exit: With firm exit being a necessary condition for economic growth,
there is a need to reduce the barriers to close a business and establish a cost effective and
efficient regime to allow business to exit a market or give the possibility of rehabilitating the
businesses without forcing them into bankruptcy. Under the Insolvency Act 2009, a number of
regulations, to supplement the primary legislation, were outstanding: Register of Insolvency
Practitioners (Section 374), Conduct and Performance of Insolvency Practitioners (Section 375)
Statement of Affairs (Section 25), Statutory Demand (Section 180), and the Proof of Claim
(Schedule 2).

18.          The Bank supported the Government‘s efforts on the following priority areas of reform:
      (i)       Approval of the registration guidelines and prescribed application form to register
                Insolvency Practitioners in Mauritius;
      (ii)      Publication of a code of ethics for Insolvency practitioners and establishment of
                procedures by the Director of Insolvency Service for the suspension and removal of
                Insolvency Practitioners from the register.

19.     Improving Access to Finance. Access to credit is an important driving force in
economic growth, and it ranked high on the list of factors emphasized by individual
entrepreneurs as critical to the survival and growth of their businesses. From the Mauritius ICA
(2009), almost 50 percent of all the firms surveyed considered access to finance as one of the top
three constraints to doing business in Mauritius and 59 percent of total SMEs cited access to
finance as a major constraint. Further analysis and consultation with stakeholders indicated that
the constraint may be linked to both supply side issues along with the demand side factors
outside the credit market. Insufficient suitable collateral was cited as among the top reasons for
difficulty in accessing credit.

20.     The PSC DPL supported demand side factors through reforms in land titling procedures
and through secured transactions laws and registries. An institutional assessment of the land
registries undertaken as part of the Doing Business (DB) Survey 2008 showed that it took 210
                                                    19
days to register land title in Mauritius. Among the government reforms supported by the Bank
would be to (i) amend the Transcription and Mortgage Act in order to prescribe a time limit
consistent with business standards to register property and (ii) enact legislative amendments to
the Civil Code and any other laws to allow the setting up of a modern movable collateral
registry.

21.     While addressing the demand side issues is a necessary condition for addressing access to
finance constraints, it may not be sufficient to get SME financing needs met. Directed and
subsidized credit programs offered by the public sector institution, DBM have done little to
achieve the fundamental objective of increasing the access of small enterprises to financial
services. DBM had performed poorly and over time fostered a nonpayment culture, as indicated
by the high volume of non-performing loans. To better respond to its policy development
objectives, the Government decided to restructure the DBM and turn DBM into a full-fledged
commercial bank with a focus on the MSME segment of the market.

22.    Credit bureaus play an important role in financial stability by helping control over-
indebtedness and are critical to the expansion of credit for both individuals and small businesses.
In particular, effective credit reporting can help by increasing the availability of financial
services and expanding access to credit, supporting the growth of MSMEs, replacing collateral
needs with reputational collateral in small ticket lending, improving borrower‘s repayment
behavior and reducing over-indebtedness which was a major issue with Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) and decreasing the overall cost of credit. The Mauritius Credit Information
Bureau (MCIB) was established in December 2005 by the BoM as a public registry of borrower
information with the main objective to ensure the development of an overall sound credit
environment in Mauritius.

23.    To further reinforce its contribution to the financial stability of the economy, the MCIB
needed to expand its coverage to include non-banking financial and credit-granting institutions,
and utility companies. Lack of information on overall consumer indebtedness was an area of
concern from the perspective of financial stability as borrowers may have accumulate large debts
through small facilities from credit providers other than those falling under the purview of the
Bank and related liabilities could remain hidden from lenders and lead to flawed
creditworthiness assessment.

24.     The priority areas of reform, agreed with the Government, were (i) the coverage of the
credit information bureau expanded to include all non-banking financial institutions and (ii) The
Bank of Mauritius to establish and publish eligibility criteria and licensing guidelines for the
setting up of private credit information; and (iii) Regulation from Ministry of Public Utilities to
enforce the billing accuracy so that the name of the actual end user is reflected on utility bills.

25.     Enhancing ICT and e-Gov Support for Increased Efficiency and Transparency
Gains. ICT is considered a key pillar for supporting competitiveness. Given its potential to have
significant positive spill-over effects on the other sectors of the economy, the Government of
Mauritius prioritized the development of an interconnected broadband infrastructure on which
ideas and services could be transmitted. To develop an interconnected broadband infrastructure
Mauritius would have to rely on large private sector investments in high bandwidth networks.
These networks have long lives, so investors have to see a long, stable and profitable future if
                                                20
they are to invest. An unpredictable business and regulatory environment makes operators more
risk averse and generally unwilling to invest. To entice operators to invest in these networks,
Governments have to signal their long-term intentions clearly, credibly and convincingly. The
purpose of the National Broadband Policy (NBP), whose recommended adoption by the
Government was the first prior action of this component of the DPL, was to signal the
Government‘s intentions clearly, credibly and convincingly.
26.     The following were the priority areas of reform, agreed with the Government: (i) Cabinet
approval of National Broadband Policy and (ii) Establish protocols to strengthen the
independence of ICTA. The second area of reform was to bring an amendment to the
Information and Communications Technology Act (ICTA) of 2001 that would provide ICTA the
required authority to regulate markets where an operator was deemed to have Significant Market
Power (SMP). SMP authority was a particularly appropriate regulatory tool to be applied in the
developing Mauritian ICT sector because there were substantial differences in the development
of many market segments across the country. SMP authority allows for competition to discipline
incumbents where possible and this authority to do the work where it is not. It allows the
regulator flexibility to react to recent market performance and does not constrain its actions since
it does not prescribe the regulatory remedy ex ante.

27.      While SMP authority would be an important tool to apply to correct market failures, the
objectivity and independence of ICTA can be called into question unless it can better separate
itself from the Government‘s policymaking and promotional bodies that exist for the ICT sector.
The Bank thus supported the Government to design and initiate reforms to make ICTA a more
independent and transparently objective applicator of regulations. This was achieved through
amendments to ICT Act to introduce a definition of SMP and equip the ICT Authority with the
appropriate tools to regulate markets in which there is evidence of SMP and the setting up of
system to collect market-level data to be able to assess the existence of significant market power
in five markets in Mauritius.

28.     This DPL also supported the Government‘s efforts to promote the widespread adoption
and use of public key infrastructure (PKI) to execute secure electronic transactions.
Accomplishing this would finalize a series of actions and initiatives that the Government had
undertaken to enable it to provide improved access, increased transparency, and more efficiency
to the Government‘s transactions with businesses and its citizens.

29.    To enable a secure electronic transactions operating environment, the Electronic
Transactions Act was amended and the Electronic Transactions (Certification Authorities)
Regulations 2010 came into effect on December 1, 2010, providing for the licensing framework
as well as the regulation of Certification Authorities (CA) activities in Mauritius. Parts of the
Electronic Transactions Act have also been proclaimed to enable ICTA to exercise the powers of
the Controller of Certification Authorities (CCA) and make the PKI operational. It was an
important step in providing for safe, trusted and secure electronic transactions and establishing
Mauritius as a trusted hub for e-commerce. In addition, a Data Protection Commissioner was
responsible for upholding the rights of individuals as set out in the Data Protection Act, 2004.

30.   In order to give momentum to the Government‘s data and information security initiatives,
the Ministry of ICT (MoICT) would take steps to ensure the widest adoption of the PKI

                                                21
technology and to set targets to increasing paperless Government to Business (G2B) and
Government to Government (G2G) transactions.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

31.      The policy areas were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):

32.    There were not any significant changes in design, scope and scale, implementation
arrangements and schedule, or funding allocations.

      2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance:

33.     The program was supported by two single tranche operations. The First and Second
Private Sector Competitiveness DPLs were approved subject to the implementation of the
respective prior actions (shown in the Table below). All prior actions were satisfactorily met
before their respective Board approvals on March 27, 2012, and March 27, 2013.

34.    The Private sector competitiveness DPL series was designed in the context of a broader
reform program that started in 2006 and addressed the need to boost competitiveness and to
ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium term. It was fully aligned with the priorities of the
Government’s reform agenda.

35.    The table below summarizes the prior actions for both operations, all of which were met
by the Government of Mauritius ahead of Board presentation.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

36.      Among the factors that contributed to the successful implementation and outcome of the
DPL series, we note (i) the adequacy of the Government’s commitment, (ii) the soundness of the
background analysis supporting the environment which incorporated lessons learnt from the
programmatic DPL series of 2006-2009 and flexibility in rapidly responding to the new
Government’s priorities to engage in a policy lending operation rather than an investment
lending one, (iii) appropriateness of the operation design, (iv) a strong coordination with other
development partners to deliver towards government priorities and (v) adequate identification of
risks at appraisal stage and effectiveness of mitigation measures.

37.    Adequacy of government’s commitment: The Government continues to regard DPLs as
an important tool for supporting policy reform in Mauritius, as opposed to an IL with a focus on
public investment and capacity building measures. While financing may not be a necessary
requirement, it is the technical assistance, policy dialogue and additional support to reform
champions that the Government most values in the World Bank engagement through DPLs.

38.     The DPL series was part of a reform continuum of the previous DPL series 2006-2009
which was very successful and effective. Progress in the current series was more challenging on
two fronts. First, compared to the previous DPL program in which MoFED played an active role
in leading and coordinating the reform, this new set of reforms was led in many cases by sector
ministries, who in many cases have less experience with such instruments. Second, a broader set
of stakeholders meant enhanced efforts for proper coordination. Moreover, some of the
stakeholders suffered from weak implementation capacity, which meant that the pace for reform
was slower.

39.    There were also challenges on the political economy front following a change in
borrower circumstances triggered by the resignation of the main partner in the ruling coalition in
June 2011. Development priorities for the government broadly remained same, but the focus was
more on political reform and amendment of the Constitution to create a Second Republic with
enhanced powers for the President. These political changes led to a delay in the implementation
of some of the activities under the DPL Series such as the implementation of the legislative
changes for the Secured Transaction Law and the restructuring of the Development Bank of
Mauritius.

40.    Sound background analytical work: The preparation of the PSC-DPL series was based
on analytical work carried out by the Bank, the Government and other development partners. In
addition, the design of the PSC DPL series benefited from the extensive dialogue and analytical
work that underpinned the Manufacturing Services Development and Competitiveness Project
(MSDCP) and Mauritius Economic Transition (Technical Assistance) Project (METAP)
investment operations that focused on private sector competitiveness, enterprise growth and
business environment matters.

41.    The second 2009 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) for Mauritius identified
obstacles that hinder firms’ competitiveness, particularly access to finance for small firms and
the lack of skilled labor. The Skills and Technology Absorption in Mauritius Report 2011
                                               26
pointed out constraints to increase the skills of the workforce to enable them to use new and
emerging technologies, including both the education system, and on-the-job training.

42.     With regards to the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM), there has been a number of
diagnostic reviews undertaken among which by the International Financial Consulting Group of
Canada (IFCC) in 2008 and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 2010. The 2004
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ICR ROSC) which benchmarked
Mauritius’ insolvency and creditor rights framework against international standards, found that
many aspects of the insolvency framework in Mauritius were inconsistent with international best
practice and the recommendations therein were partly used to design the DPL reform program.
The IFC had also provided a review of the legal framework governing credit information
reporting in Mauritius through the Feasibility Assessment for the Expansion of the Credit
Reporting Infrastructure in 2007.

43.    For the prior actions in pillar 3 of both operations, the Government’s mid-term review of
the National ICT Strategic Plan (NICTSP) 2007-2011, carried out with the support of the
African Development Bank (AfDB), and served to guide the preparation of the ICT and e-Gov
component of this operation.

44.     The Government of Mauritius (GoM) is aware of the challenge of coordinating
development partner assistance to unify policy recommendations and ensure that prior actions
and indicators are harmonized with Government priorities. The World Bank and European Union
(EU) collaborated closely on a joint diagnostic and results matrix for the World Bank‘s CPS and
the EU 10th EDF Country Strategy Paper and EU performance indicators of budget support
operations reinforce DPL triggers wherever possible.            The AfDB showed interest in
collaborating in joint knowledge products, particularly in the ICT and e-Gov areas. The Agence
Française de Development (AFD) focused on complementary areas: financing green technology
projects for the private sector and infrastructure (road infrastructure, water and wastewater
sectors). The EU coordinated their education dialogue with the World Bank DPL series. The
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) supported the government in, inter alia, the
formulation of strategic plans at targeted ministry/ department level and in their performance-
based budgeting processes.

45.    Assessment of operation’s design: The program was aligned to the priorities of the
Government and offered continuity in the reform areas. Implementation required the buy-in from
a number of actors, several agencies/ institutions/ ministries, some of which had weak
implementation capacity. During the design phase, areas where implementation capacity was
limited were identified and technical assistance was provided. Additionally, the DPL itself
helped to build bridges between the different ministries involved in the reform program, thereby
enhancing coordination.

46.     The project design was consistent with the project’s objectives and remains relevant in
the current context. The components and related activities were designed after consultations with
the beneficiaries, and addressed what needed to get done, closely aligned with the Government’s
own program. The operation was also flexible and adequately incorporated changes to the
indicative triggers to reflect the delayed time frame for the program while ensuring that the
outputs were of high quality and aligned with the substance of the reform. The program made
                                               27
efficient use of non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) through which support was provided to
develop a pipeline of financial and private sector development policy reforms for the series. This
proved to be a very useful tool, as it helped provide technical expertise and global best practice
on policy and institutional issues informing policy dialogue

47.     Assessment of risks: Four risks were identified during the appraisal stage of the
operations and mitigating measures were proposed. They were (a) the challenge of maintaining
macroeconomic stability as a result of uncertain global developments; (b) a slowdown in the
momentum of reforms, exacerbated by the withdrawal of one of the parties from the Government
coalition in July 2011; and (c) limited institutional capacity within sector ministries to lead and
implement the reforms; and (d) corruption. The risk of corruption was dropped during the second
operation, taking into consideration the 2010 PEFA assessment that the Mauritian financial
system was robust and entailed minimal risks to the proceeds of the loan.

48.    On the fiscal front, the government has made efforts to consolidate the fiscal deficit and
reduce public debt. Current account deficits, although high, have been adequately financed,
mostly by high FDI and inflows to the financial sector. To mitigate the risk of slowdown in
reforms, the DPL series took a pragmatic approach by supporting reforms that were backed by a
broad consensus and that would yield immediate benefits, while laying the necessary foundations
required to accelerate other reforms in the future.

49.     With regards to the risk of limited institutional capacity, the Bank helped the government
to mitigate this risk by involving specialized Bank staff in the DPL dialogue on selected areas
and by encouraging a public debate by publishing articles and technical notes. Additionally, the
DPL itself is a catalyst between the different ministries involved in the reform program, thereby
enhancing coordination. Also, the Bank’s portfolio in Mauritius is designed to strengthen
capacity in a way that is tailored to the needs of a middle-income country.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

50.     M&E Design: The indicators selected by this operation were carefully chosen to monitor
progress towards the program development objectives and were designed in collaboration with
the Government (MoFED and other sector ministries involved in the implementation). As such,
the M&E design was fully client driven and built on the development strategy of the country.
The accountability framework in the matrix was fully congruent with the Government’s
Assessment Framework developed for budget support operations. By aligning the reform
deliverables with the budget cycle, the series ensured that all sector ministries took direct
responsibility for the policy agenda. The operation and associated policy measures were
specifically tailored to the Government’s needs while the number of policy actions was limited
and sequenced to keep the momentum going. A few indicators were amended in the second
DPL. Under the first pillar, the indicator of “number of businesses with approved restructuring
plans” was amended to “number of bank using out-of-court workouts” as this is a more reliable
measure. Whereas restructuring plans are confidential, and therefore difficult to count, it is easier
to ask the banks whether they will be using any out-of-court process in order to achieve
restructuring, making the indicator more measurable. Under the second pillar on access to
finance, the DBM indicators were changed to reflect the fact that the options could include a new
commercial bank taking over the assets of DBM and catering to the MSME space. The indicators
                                                 28
were changed from (i) Development Bank of Mauritius meets prudential requirements of the
Central Bank; (ii) Reduction in interest subsidy to DBM and (iii) Increase in the number of loans
to SMEs of less than MUR150, 000 to (i) DBM restructured by the sale of its non-banking
assets; and (ii) A new licensed commercial Bank with a focus on the MSME segment established.

51.     Under the third pillar, two indicators were re-stated. The original indicator “Increase in
the number of homes that have access to download speeds of at least 10 Mbit/s and upload
speeds of at least 5 Mbit/s by 2013.” was not technologically-neutral as it failed to address
competitiveness because it is concerned only with residential usage rather than business usage.
Furthermore, it is a supply side indicator, whereas, the indications are that Mauritius’s problems
are more on the demand side. For these reasons, an alternative statement of this outcome
indicator was defined as “Increase in number of broadband subscriptions with actual speeds of
at least 10 Mbit/s”.

52.      The second indicator was “a decrease in average monthly retail price of broadband
ADSL 256 kbps with 3 GB allowance service to households”. Again, this indicator is not
technologically-neutral in that it presupposes that Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)
is the relevant technology as opposed to fiber to the home (offered by Bharat Telecom) or 4G
mobile (offered by EMTEL and Mauritius Telecom and soon by MTML). Furthermore, the
indicator accepts the notion of a 3GB per month bandwidth cap, whereas such caps are being
lifted in most competitive markets around the world. The subsidized entry level broadband price
also uses a cap of only 2GB per month. A restatement of this outcome indicator was “a decrease
in the price per 1 Mbit/s per month of broadband service (fixed) and/or per GB of data
(mobile)”. By using a unit price rather than a price based on a current service, it should be easier
to make comparisons between different services and to “future proof” the indicator for the days
when data caps are lifted and slower speed services are no longer available.

53.     M&E Implementation: MoFED was responsible for coordinating the supervision and
monitoring of the reform program supported by this DPL series. MoFED liaised with the
appropriate staff in the ministries, departments, and agencies involved. The Bank carried out
periodic monitoring every 6 months through 3 Implementation Status and Results (ISRs), and
conducted a dialogue with relevant line ministries and other stakeholders involved in the
implementation of the reforms through field missions and through staff based at the Bank’s
country office. MoFED, as the primary counterpart agency of these operations, was responsible
for providing the Bank with the information required to follow progress on all indicators and
monitor outcomes in the policy matrix. The data used for M&E purposes were all official data
collected from the sector ministries, the Bank of Mauritius and Tele geography for the ICT
indicators.

54.     M&E utilization: Overall, the data was received in a timely manner and provided good
indicators where reform was lagging which allowed for closer monitoring. The data and
information provided by the MoFED and other implementing agencies on the status of the
indicators was received in a timely manner. The continuous monitoring allowed for the
identification of critical areas to focus on to move forward the agenda at a faster pace.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

55.     Following the successful completion of both programmatic series, the one focusing on
the public sector competitiveness and the other focusing on private sector development, the
government engaged with the Bank to prepare a new series with three annual single-tranche
DPLs of US$20 million with effectiveness date in June 2016. The new lending operations will
build on the reforms supported by the previous programmatic DPL series and will support the
country’s priorities identified through the Strategic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and incorporated
in the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF).

      3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

Objectives: High

56.     The program’s objectives remain relevant in the current country context. To pursue its
vision of making Mauritius a higher value added, more diversified, and a skill-and-knowledge
intensive economy (Country Partnership Strategy (CPS update, 2011), the Government is
continuing to strengthen the institutional and policy environment for business growth while
developing an overarching strategic policy framework for knowledge development and
technology. In April 2012 the Government presented its new program for 2012-15, “Moving the
Nation Forward” (MNF). The MNF program for 2012-15 sets the ball rolling for the economy to
be part of the league of globally competitive economies and contains six pillars covering
economic, political, social, and environmental issues. The Government intends to steer the
economy away from its traditional export-reliance on European markets and to focus on the new
centers of economic gravity, namely the emerging economies, the BRICS 1 and geographically
closer, continental Africa.

57.      The high relevance of the objectives is also reinforced by the strong demand by
Government for continued support in the Doing Business and Business Licensing reforms.
Moreover, the preliminary findings of the Systematic Country Diagnosis report, currently under
preparation, also point towards the need for continued reforms in the realm of business
facilitation and enterprise development.

Design: Substantial

58.     The operation aimed at supporting competitiveness and enterprise growth in Mauritius
through strengthened policy and institutional environment in three integrated and mutually
reinforcing pillars (i) improving competitiveness and growth of enterprises; (ii) improving access
to finance; and (iii) promoting ICT and e-Gov for enhancing competitiveness and transparency.
The project design was consistent with the project’s objectives and remains relevant in the
current context. The choice of the actions within each pillar was selected after in depth
consultations with the government and the private sector on their relevance and was closely

    BRICS is an acronym for the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa

                                                         30
aligned with the Government’s own program. Moreover, they were also based on analytical
work carried out by the Government, other development partners and the Bank, most specifically
from the extensive dialogue and analytical work that underpinned the MSDCP and (METAP)
investment operations that focused on private sector competitiveness, enterprise growth and
business environment matters.

59.      To improve competitiveness and growth of enterprises, the operation supported the
government’s objectives of improving entry, survival and growth of innovative and
entrepreneurial firms and facilitating firm exit through strategic reorientation of SME support
institutions so as to eliminate fragmented BDS assistance programs and improve the
effectiveness of the program and to reduce the barriers to close a business through the
establishment of a cost effective and efficient regime to allow business to exit a market or give
the possibility to rehabilitate distressed businesses without forcing them into bankruptcy. To
improve access to finance, the operation aligned with the government reform agenda of
enhancing the credit visibility of entrepreneurs though the credit bureau reforms and facilitating
registration of fixed and current assets as collateral through land titling reforms and secured
lending transactions reforms to remove demand side hurdles, and on the supply side through the
restructuring of the DBM into a MSME bank. On the pillar that relates to promoting ICT and e-
Gov for enhancing competitiveness and transparency, the DPL actions supported the reform
agenda of the government in signaling its long-term intentions clearly, credibly and convincingly
though the adoption of the national broadband policy and some of its implementation measures
such as (i) amendments to the ICT Act to introduce a definition of SMP and to equip the ICT
Authority with the appropriate tools to regulate markets in which there is SMP and to encourage
the development of independent ISPs, to streamline licensing and introduce spectrum
management; (ii) the publication of guidelines for tariff setting that will promote transparency
and, in the longer term, reduce the requirement for preapproval of tariffs by non-dominant
operators; and (ii) introducing online payment of government services.

60.      There was adequate government ownership of the DPO apparent through strong
Borrower emphasis on ensuring high quality outputs. The program made efficient use of non-
lending technical assistance (NLTA) through which support was provided to develop a pipeline
of financial and private sector development policy reforms for the series. This proved to be a
very useful tool, as it helped provide technical expertise and global best practice on policy and
institutional issues informing policy dialogue. From the previous DPO series and cancelled
Investment lending operations, it was clear that, in Mauritius, lending operations must include
only reforms that are aligned with Government priorities and Government leadership and that
are owned by line ministries. Moreover, flexibility to adjust and respond to Government’s
evolving agenda is a key driver of success. In some areas, the reform process required more
sustained dialogue and assistance, while in others the implementation was faster and smoother.
The current DPL series successfully incorporated these lessons and proactively adjusted where
needed.

Implementation: Substantial

61.    MoFED was responsible for monitoring the reforms, reporting progress and coordinating
actions with the various ministries, department and agencies involved. The expected outcomes
were outlined in the development policy matrix, which indicated the prior actions to be taken by
                                               31
the Government for each stage of the programmatic series. As indicated above, the World Bank
team provided technical assistance and analytical support where appropriate to help achieve
some of the triggers for the second operation. Even then, some reforms took longer than
anticipated due to their highly political sensitivity and different government priorities. However,
the Government ensured that the thematic content of the DPL was fully consistent with its
development objectives. There were also instances where some reforms went further than
anticipated due to strong stakeholder commitment.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between policy actions supported by the operation and outcomes):

62.     The Program Development Objectives of the programmatic series is to strengthen the
policy and institutional environment in Mauritius to support competitiveness and enterprise
development. The operation would achieve this by supporting reforms around three integrated
and mutually reinforcing pillars (i) improving competitiveness and growth of enterprises; (ii)
improving access to finance; and (iii) promoting ICT and e-Gov for enhancing competitiveness
and transparency.

Pillar 1: Enterprise Growth and Competitiveness

63.      The achievements under Pillar 1 toward the development objective have been
substantial. Improving entry, survival and growth of innovative and entrepreneurial firms and
facilitating firm exit are an important part of the creative destruction process that underpins
economic growth. To support SME creation and survival, the Mauritian government already had
undertaken several ―market completing interventions, focusing on skills and training,
technology development, and information services gaps. However, many of the programs were
considered as not meeting market needs of SMEs, were of mixed quality and were hampered by
coordination challenges among the multiple agencies and between programs with overlapping
objectives, roles and cumbersome procedures. Hence, the DPLs included the MoBEC
engagement to strategically reorient SME support institutions so as to eliminate fragmented BDS
assistance programs and improve the effectiveness of the programs. In the same vein, since firm
exit is a necessary condition for economic growth, the DPL series also supported the
government’s agenda to reduce the barriers to close a business through the establishment of a
cost effective and efficient regime to allow business to exit a market or give the possibility to
rehabilitate distressed businesses without forcing them into bankruptcy.

64.     Under the first operation, MoBEC sought and obtained cabinet approval for the
consolidation of its SME programs, including the establishment of the Inter-Agency Strategic
Coordination Committee (IASCC) with the mandate to, inter alia, strategically reorient all the
existing SME programs. The IASCC was to be guided in its work by the establishment of an
M&E system to ensure that the Government receives value for money for its support through
BDS schemes to enterprises. There are two types of BDS support. Generic support include
including training and skills development; hand-holding services like business planning and
coaching; product development and marketing support, quality control and standards, and
support in technology upgrading. Specialized support include reimbursable financing, on cost-
sharing basis, to buy specialized expertise in areas of skills and training, technology upgrading,
standards and marketing that constrain firm growth and productivity. During the second
                                                32
operation, the IASCC was made operational and the Request for Proposal for the consultancy of
the M&E framework was issued. The latter did not attract any international consulting firms as it
was not published internationally. MoFED had to reissue the RFP with an emphasis on wider
outreach to the international consultancy pool. An international consultant was eventually hired
on October 01, 2013. The M&E framework was completed in May 2014.

65.      These measures directly cause the availability of information and coordination among the
various providers of business development services to increase which in turn will allow them to
better direct entrepreneurs to the most appropriate SME agency. In this manner, the
entrepreneurs can avail of the most appropriate SME programme tailored for their specific needs
as evidenced by the meeting and surpassing of indicators 1 and 2. The number of enterprises
accessing generic BDS increased to 555 showing that the target was met by 100% and
overpassed by around 200 enterprises that received support. The number of enterprises
accessing specialized BDS increased to 247, confirming that the target was met by 100% and
surpassed by 100%. This is mainly due to the higher than anticipated uptake of the specialized
services. The 2013 census on business activity show that while SMEs as a percentage of total
enterprises has remained stable at around 90 percent, the number of SMEs has increased by
nearly 36 percent. Employment by SMEs has also risen by 33 percent and has grown from
employing 40 percent of the total labour force in 2007 to over 52 percent of the labour force in
2013. These measures demonstrate compelling progress towards the strengthening of the
institutional framework in the SME sector as evidenced by achieving and exceeding the targets
to increase the number of enterprises accessing both generic and specialized business
development services.

66.     On the credit environment front, the achievement made towards the development
objectives has been substantial. The Insolvency Act 2009, while representing a significant
advancement in the development of Mauritius’ insolvency framework, needed to be fully
operationalized and implemented through significant secondary legislation that had remained
outstanding. As part of the Prior Actions for DPL1, the GoM introduced regulations pertaining to
Insolvency Practitioners’ qualifications and appointment. DPL2 further build upon these reforms
to enhance the overall effectiveness of the country’s insolvency regime, and supported i) the
Publication of rules of professional conduct for insolvency practitioners; and (ii) the
establishment of procedures by the Director of the Insolvency Service to deal with the
suspension and removal of insolvency practitioners from the Registry. These measures were
under the original design of the DPO series and had already proved to be satisfactory. During the
implementation of the second program, the country went further and published Out-of-Court
Workout (OCW) guidelines to establish protocols on how to expedite reorganization of ailing
business corporations which have viable future prospect by means of debt restructuring at an
early stage. The OCW guidelines can be also accessed on the Insolvency Services official
website.

67.     The publication of the regulation on the professional conduct for insolvency practitioners
ensure a more streamlined, transparent regulation of the profession and encourages professionals
to engage in this field. This is evidenced through increase in the number of professionals who
registered as insolvency practioners which went up by 100% and was also surpassed. With
regards to the out-of-court workouts, the publication of these guidelines enables banks to use
these as a means to renegotiate bad debts or non-performing loans while restoring liquidity and
                                               33
restoring the enterprise so that it can continue operating as a going concern. However, on the
latter indicator, the uptake of the Mauritian guidelines by banks has been partially achieved
(50%). International banks use the Insol guidelines rather than the Mauritian OCW guidelines.
However, the reform further enhances the strengthening of the insolvency regime framework as
also recognized by the improvement in the recovery rate for businesses from 35 cents in 2012 to
67 cents last year, under the Doing Business Resolving Insolvency indicator

Pillar 2: Improving access to finance

68.     Access to credit is an important driving force in economic growth. The government
reform priority is to increase access to finance to SMEs as well as micro enterprises. Although,
aggregate data show that Mauritius is well banked relative to its peers and to sub-Saharan
countries, granular analysis reveal a different picture. Indeed, almost 50 percent of all the firms
surveyed and 59 percent of total SMEs consider access to finance as one of the top three
constraints to doing business in Mauritius. Further analysis and consultation with stakeholders
indicate that the constraint may be linked to both supply side issues along with the demand side
factors outside the credit market. Therefore the DPL series has supported the policy objectives
of the government through both demand and supply side measures. On the demand side,
enhancing the credit visibility of entrepreneurs though the credit bureau reforms and facilitating
registration of fixed and current assets as collateral through land titling reforms and secured
lending transactions reform, and supply side through the restructuring of the DBM into a MSME
bank as per the Government‘s intention as announced in the Budget speech of 2012. Through
complimentary policies aided by this DPL’s dialogue on access to finance, the government has
provided further funding of Rs 7 billion to SMEs throughout 2011 to 2015, notably by setting up
a scheme for manufacturing companies to modernize their equipment through Foreign Currency
                                                34
Leases for an aggregate amount of Rs 1 billion; bank lending to SMEs totaling Rs4.8 billion for
the same period and the setting of a specialized financial institution, under the Banking Act, that
will serve the micro to small enterprise niche segment. Under this pillar, the DPL has been
modest in achieving the development objective of strengthening the policy and institutional
environment.

69.      This component addressed both the demand and the supply side constraints to access to
finance. On the supply side, the DPL series supported an increased access to SME finance
through the establishment of a licensed bank with a focus on MSMEs through restructuring the
existing state-owned Development Bank of Mauritius by (i) getting rid of its non-performing
loans and real estate activities and (ii) looking for a strategic partner for equity injection and
managerial participation. Under DPL1, Cabinet approved the decision to transform DBM into a
financially viable MSME Bank, licensed by the Central Bank, and with private sector
involvement. Under the second operation, the restructuring was initiated by the appointment of a
transaction advisor, endorsement by steering committee of an inception report and the issuance
of letters of invitation to potential investors for the sale of DBM’s non-banking assets. The
Mauritian authorities were in talks with the Government of India in view of a strategic
participation of the Bank of Maharashtra in the equity of the Mauritian SME bank. With
elections leading to a change in government in India in April/May 2014, there have been delays
to the ongoing negotiation talks between the two governments. Following failed negotiations
between the Mauritian authorities and Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), the
new government decided to go ahead with a new institution, an SME bank oriented towards
micro and small enterprises, under a new type of license, that of a Specialized Financial
Institution under the Bank of Mauritius. Legislations for this purpose have already been passed
and MoFED is working towards operationalising the SME Bank in August. Hence, while the
strategic partnership with DBM did not materialise, the restructuring exercise within DBM has
been and is still ongoing. A new Board is in place and emphasis in being placed on reviewing the
role of DBM within the new landscape. Since the reforms have been delayed and given that the
two results indicators were not met, the program of support towards restructuring DBM is
deemed to be negligible.

70.     On the demand side, the DPL series provided support to the credit environment through
(i) under DPL 1, an improvement in the time taken to register property from 15 days to 2 days
through the enactment of legislation amending the Transcription and Mortgage Act in order to
prescribe a time limit consistent with business standards to register property and (ii) under DPL
2, Government approval to further facilitate the use of movable and intangible assets as collateral
and to establish a modern movable collateral registry with the completion of the necessary
legislative amendments. Although all the necessary amendments have been carried out and all
stakeholders have been consulted, the laws have not yet been passed as the parliament has been
on leave. The amendment of the Transcription and Mortgage Act in order to statutorily prescribe
time limits to register property has brought down the number of days to register immovable
property to 2 days. The second indicator is in progress as legal amendments to enable secured
transactions have been completed but have not yet received cabinet approval since the parliament
has been on leave. The results are favorable and point that the success towards achieving the
development objective of strengthening the policy environment has been modest.



                                                35
71.     The DPL also aimed to support a healthy credit environment though an expansion of
borrower information collected by the Mauritius Credit Information Bureau (MCIB) that was
established in December 2005 by the BoM as a public registry. Under DPL1, The coverage of
the credit information bureau is expanded to include all non-bank financial institution and under
DPL2, information from utility bodies was added through amendments to the Bank of Mauritius
Act. Further, in order to facilitate the transfer of data from the utility companies to MCIB, there
have been system enhancements that have been undertaken to facilitate data transfer and
decrease the transactions costs involved. The statutory increase in data capture has led to an
increase in coverage from 407,160 customers in June 2011 representing 49.8 percent of the adult
population to covering 554,809 registered entities representing 67.8 percent of the population in
December 2012, whereby the indicator 14, i.e. the increase in the coverage of the credit bureau,
was met by 100% and surpassed by 4.56 percentage points The achievement on this front is
substantial.

Pillar 3: Enhancing ICT and e-Gov Support for Increased efficiency and Transparency Gains

72.     ICT is considered a key pillar for supporting competitiveness and has proved to have
significant positive spill-over effects on other sectors of the economy. The DPL series aimed at
strengthening the policy landscape and support the objective of the government to make ICT the
“fifth pillar” in the national economy contributing at least 7 percent of national GDP. For this to
happen, operators need to invest in these networks, and to reassure and entice them, governments
have to signal their long-term intentions clearly, credibly and convincingly. In this vein, the
Mauritian authorities have spelt out a national policy that will guarantee the predictability to the
business environment while at the same time aims to achieve robust competition that will
improve consumer welfare through lower prices, more abundant offerings and an increased set of
choices. The DPL actions supported the reform agenda of the government in this area and
achievement of objective is high in strengthening the policy and institutional environment.

                                                36
73.      ICT is considered a key pillar for supporting competitiveness and has proved to have
significant positive spill-over effects on other sectors of the economy. The DPL series aimed at
strengthening the policy landscape and support the objective of the government to make ICT the
“fifth pillar” in the national economy contributing at least 7 percent of national GDP. Under DPL
1, Cabinet approved (i) the National Broadband Policy, and (ii) amendments to the ICT Act to
introduce a definition of SMP and to equip the ICT Authority with the appropriate tools to
regulate markets in which there is SMP and to encourage the development of independent ISPs.
Under DPL 2, ICTA published the guidelines for tariff setting that will promote transparency
and, in the longer term, reduce the requirement for preapproval of tariffs by non-dominant
operators, thereby promoting greater price innovation. Draft legal changes to pertinent sections
of the ICT Act 2001 related to licensing were adopted by the ICTA Board and submitted to
parliament for approval. The amendments were made to recognize class licenses and introduce a
new section 24B on spectrum management. This inter alia has created a framework for allowing
spectrum auctions, spectrum sharing and even secondary spectrum trading. The achievement of
the objective of strengthening both the policy and institutional environment in this area is high.
Progress has gone beyond the intended trigger as collection of market level data was completed,
market assessments for significant market power in two markets considered bottlenecks were
completed, followed by stakeholder consultations, feedback from which were incorporated into
the tariff guidelines that have been published on ICTA’s official website.

74.      The strategy and legal reforms gave a clear signal to the private sector on the way the
authorities will govern the sector and hence guaranteed predictability of the business
environment. The market responded by more abundant offerings and an increase in consumer
welfare through lower prices. Consequently, consumers responded by a higher uptake of
broadband subscriptions as evidence through the targeted indicator ‘Increase in number of
broadband subscriptions with actual speeds of at least 10 Mbit/s’ being achieved at 100% and
surpassed by 15.9%. Similarly indicators 17 and 18 show that the prices of broadband services
have decreased: fixed broadband prices have dropped by 10%, as per target and mobile
broadband prices have dropped by 58%, over the target of 10%. All indicators were either
achieved or exceeded. Moreover, Mauritius is doing relatively well in the information and
communications technology (ICT) sector in terms of price, access, and coverage as benchmarked
against other upper middle-income countries. The country’s domestic operators accounted for a
total of 167,000 high-speed Internet subscribers as of June 2014, up from 147,000 in 2013. The
overall broadband household penetration rate is 47.3 percent, above the upper middle-income
average of 32.7 percent and well above the African average of 4.3 percent

75.     For the E-Government Component, the prior action for DPL1 was intended to support the
Government’s efforts to promote the widespread adoption and use of public key infrastructure
(PKI) which is a secure encryption technique, to execute secure electronic transactions. In order
to do so, the Electronic Transactions Act was amended and the Electronic Transactions
(Certification Authorities) Regulations 2010 came into effect on December 1, 2010, providing
for the licensing framework as well as the regulation of Certification Authorities (CA) activities
in Mauritius. ICTA was nominated as the Certification Authority for PKI and serves as the root
authority for issuing digital signature certificates. To build on this progress, the MoICT
concluded a contract with a competitively selected partner for the development of a Government
Services Platform, based on PKI, which will support a wider range of government services, some
of which may replace paper-based alternatives (such as secure email replacing memos) but
                                               37
others of which are new (for instance, permitting the use of credit cards to pay for services such
as online business registration). The adoption of public key infrastructure (PKI) makes electronic
transactions safe and secure and consequently it was meant to encourage the uptake of online
payment of government services. For this to happen, public services had to be made available
online. The availability of these services was lower than anticipated by closing date of DPL, as
the introduction of the key public services that can be executed online include online application
and payments of services for incorporation of a company, annual registration fees of a company,
and ePayment for the lease of state land was introduced in a phased manner and required
extensive communication efforts. Results are, however, meant to be demonstrated through the
number of public services that can be executed via secured online transactions and while, the
DPL original target was to have 15 such eservices available, the target was modified downwards
to 10, and was still partly achieved (70%), due to cautious uptake. Despite the number of e
transactions as measured by the lending series indicators are below target, the government has
made good progress on other fronts such as achieving a 95% uptake in the e-filing of income tax
and an overall broadband household penetration rate of 47.3 percent, above the upper middle-
income average of 32.7 percent and well above the African average of 4.3 percent. Both policy
and institutional environment reforms have been assessed as high in achievement of objectives
and are a concrete stepping stone for future developments.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:

76.     Based on the combined assessment of achievement of development objectives and
relevance of objectives/design, the program overall outcome rating is Satisfactory. This
rating takes into account that while the current relevance of objectives was high, relevance of
both design and implementation was substantial and that the achievements under two of the
three pillars were either high or substantial, the achievements of the other pillar were modest.

77.     The achievements under Pillar 1 toward the development objective have been
substantial. There has been compelling progress towards the strengthening of the institutional
framework in the SME sector as evidenced by achieving and exceeding the targets to increase
the number of enterprises accessing both generic and specialized business development services
and on the improvement in the insolvency framework and regulation. Reforms under the second
pillar have been modest in their contribution towards the development objective with negligible
results on the restructuring of the SME bank, modest results with the consolidation of the secured
transactions framework and substantial results achieved in the provision of credit
information. The contribution of the DPL actions under the third pillar towards the development
objective has been high. Progress has gone beyond the intended triggers and all indicators were
either achieved or exceeded for the provision of internet and partly achieved for the uptake of the
ePayment facilities for services


3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or
to amplify discussion above):

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

78.      The DPL Series was expected to have the potential to deliver positive impacts on poverty
over the medium term. Both the improvement of investment climate, strengthening of SME
programs and improving access to finance are expected to have significant, if indirect, poverty
and social benefits. Employment generated by SMEs has increased by 13 percentage points to
represent 53% of total employment from 2007 to 2013. Over the period 2011 to 2014, the Global
Competitiveness Index also makes mention of the progress of Mauritius in rank (from 55th to
39th), in score (from 4.3 to 4.5 out of 7) and in stage of development (from the efficiency driven
stage 2 to the transition stage between 2 and 3). The measures aimed at raising private sector
competitiveness and eventually increasing investment, including FDI, are designed to support a
virtuous cycle of growth, employment generation and productivity gains. Reform measures
supported by the three pillars are targeted at decreasing business costs and creating better
conditions for private local and foreign investments and ultimately leading to job creation. The
rationalization of SME programs was aimed at improving the capacity of GoM to provide
targeted business development services. The progress that has been made in implementing these
reforms supported by the DPL series will yield direct benefits to lower income segments of the
population.




                                                39
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development):

79.     This DPL series was instrumental in advancing reforms that have led to a substantial
amount of institutional development and capacity building, especially in the areas of
coordination among BDS provision to SMEs, and enhancement of the regulatory powers of the
ICT Authority. The capacity of utility bodies to transfer data to MCIB has also improved through
system enhancements. Workshops were carried out for all relevant stakeholders on the
registration and deregistration of Insolvency Practitioners. The Registrar General now takes 2
days to register immovable property, in line with international business standards. The access to
finance dialogue as part of the DPL has also contributed to other reforms undertaken by the
government under this component, the most notable one being the amendment to the Banking
Act to introduce a new class of financial institutions to serve the SME niche segment.

80.    These developments were important to enable the Government to ensure that policy
decisions are indeed institutionalized and implemented.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

81.     In some areas, the implementation of the reform program has realized much more
benefits than was anticipated during the design of the program (insolvency practice, MCIB, ICT
related measures. In others, it emphasized the need to strengthen coordination among the various
departments/ministries to avoid duplication of efforts and waste of resources (provision of BDS
for SMEs). The DPL also enabled exploring new areas of engagement, such as on deposit
insurance, included in the preparation of the 2013 DPL on Competitiveness.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops (optional for
Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

82.     The risks that development outcomes or expected outcomes will not be maintained or
realized are moderate. This assessment takes into account both the probability and likely impact
of threats to outcomes. It considers how these have been mitigated in the operation’s design or
by actions taken during its initial implementation.

83.     Macroeconomic stability was identified as a moderate risk. On the external side, the
Mauritian economy was (and still is) exposed to uncertainty in the global economic climate
which will impact negatively on the growth of GDP and tax revenues. The concentration of the
country’s exports on a few markets (Europe) and products (tourism and textiles) and its large
share of imported commodities could further increase the current account deficit. Despite this
difficult environment, the government started consolidating the fiscal deficit and reducing public
debt.



                                               40
84.      The Mauritian economy has proven its resilience in 2012 with 3.4 percent GDP growth
despite all the headwinds to growth. Furthermore, the increasing levels of foreign exchange
reserves (projected to be at six months of imports in the medium term) provided an additional
buffer against a potential deterioration in the balance of payments. Mauritius’ floating exchange
rate also facilitated correction of external imbalances. The recent trend towards reorienting
exports towards new markets (particularly Africa) also helped. On the fiscal front, the slowdown
in the growth of public revenues has been more than compensated by the containment of public
expenditure, with a reduction of the fiscal deficit and public debt. The government also extended
the maturity of the public debt, further reducing roll-over risks, as the majority of debt is
domestic and there is currently excess liquidity in the domestic capital markets. Macroeconomic
stability was maintained.

85.     Slowdown of reforms because of political risks is significant: The pace of reform in
Mauritius slowed in recent years and the appetite for further aggressive reform appears modest at
this time. This reflects the fact that many of these second generation reforms are meant to have a
redistributive effect, sometimes eliminating the rents, subsidies and privileges of certain groups.
This complexity is further compounded by the withdrawal of one party from the Government
coalition in July 2011 which has translated into only a slim Government majority in Parliament.

86.     To mitigate this risk, the DPL series coincided with the remainder of the current
majority’s term of office and was aligned with the country’s priorities on supporting an SME
agenda for inclusive growth and reforms for engendering competitiveness and growth to generate
better conditions for job creation. Going forward, the Strategic Country Diagnostic (SCD) that is
currently under preparation, in partnership with national authorities and other stakeholders, is
expected to aid the government in defining its engagement with the Bank and possibly inform
their own reform agenda. Finally, better communication is critical to building consensus around
the reforms, using visits to Mauritius by high level practitioners and management to raise
awareness and understanding about the reforms and their benefits.

87.     Capacity constraints posed a moderate risk: The DPL series required an active role of
sector ministries such as the MoBEC and MoICT. Institutional capacity of sector ministries to
design and implement these sector reforms was limited, particularly in the newly created
ministries. To mitigate this risk, the DPL positioned itself as a way to build bridges between the
different ministries involved in the reform program, thereby enhancing coordination. Going
forward, the Services Agreement for NLTA to support institutional capacity that was signed
between the Bank and the Government would also help mitigate this risk.

88.     The fourth risk relates to corruption with high-level allegations of corruption e under
investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). The risk of corruption
was mitigated by the fact that Government appears to be supportive of ICAC and respectful of its
independence as well as the fact that the financial systems in Mauritius, as documented in the
2010 Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) report, appear robust, suggesting
relatively minimal risk to the proceeds of the loan. This risk is negligible, and did not affect the
implementation of the lending series and was removed as a risk in the second operation.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: Satisfactory

89.     Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory. The program supported
a comprehensive structural reform program which remained the priority of the Government
throughout the operations and is of relevance to date. The policy changes in the reform program
responded to the medium term challenges that the country faced at the time of the start of the
program, as well as short term challenges at the beginning of each operation. Prior to and during
the start of the preparation of this programmatic series, the Bank and other donors carried out
extensive AAA work. The DPL and the CPS are closely linked and the great majority of the
DPL’s actions and triggers are drawn from the CPS. The design of this operation applied lessons
learned from the Bank’s previous engagement. The program adequately evaluated institutional,
fiduciary and environmental aspects. In each operation, risk assessments were made and
mitigating steps were implemented. The programmatic DPL series was both client-driven and
client-focused and was the result of a fast and efficient response to the Government when it
cancelled two Investment Lending operations.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

Rating: Satisfactory

90.     The focus of supervision was on the development objectives and outcomes indicators,
which was facilitated by locally-based staff. Since this program was a programmatic series, the
program benefited from the supervision of DPL1 being conducted side by side with preparation
of DPL2. This has allowed for the progress of the reform program to be adequately documented
and for the need for technical assistance to advance the program to be well- defined. It also
allowed the Bank to understand the political economy and capacity at different ministries/
agencies and the reasons why reforms advance faster in some areas. At the same time, there were
areas where reform went beyond envisaged triggers and more was achieved than originally set
forth. In these areas, the Bank was responsive in providing assistance and desk review of
documents to ensure quality control. Progress on the program was also being tracked during the
annual business planning meetings between the Government and its development partners.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

91.    Overall Bank performance was satisfactory. According to ICR Guidelines, the overall
ratings are dictated by the combination of ratings for Quality at Entry and Quality of
Supervision. A combination of satisfactory ratings at quality at entry and for supervision implies
a combined rating of satisfactory.
                                               42
5.2 Borrower Performance

92.     In this operation, the Government and implementing agency cannot be distinguished
separately. Therefore the rating in this section should be considered as an overall rating for the
borrower. The Ministry of Finance was the driver and coordinating body for the reform program.
It was responsible for the overall management of the reforms.

93.      The overall Borrower’s performance is rated Satisfactory.

94.    The satisfactory rating reflects the determination exhibited by the Government to
implement a politically difficult (but economically essential) reform program and the steady
progress achieved therein by the time of project closure. The program built on the reforms
supported by the previous programmatic DPL series, with which the government was familiar.
The Ministry of Finance continuously ensured that the substance of the reform program was kept
on track and identified funding requirements for the reform implementation, so that these
requirements were included in the budget.

95.    Given the bold and far-reaching nature of some of the reforms being implemented and the
associated political sensitivities, the passage of key legislation through the National Assembly
was bound to take time. Stakeholders were adequately consulted for all major reforms, as per the
agreed process and the provision of the legislation. Given that some line ministries showed weak
capacity in the implementation of the reform program, the Sector Ministry Support Team at the
MOFED were instrumental in the opportune resolution of implementation hurdles, the
reformulation of some actions for the DPL and the timely collection of data for the M&E
framework.

96.     Fiduciary arrangements in the country were already reliable when the first operation was
designed. The Ministry of Finance also organized regular meetings with development partners to
take stock of on-going engagement and ensuring that there were no duplications of efforts and
resources. The private sector was always fully involved at all stages of the program.

      6. Lessons Learned

97.     Lesson 1: The new programmatic DPL series was prepared in tandem with the Public
Sector Performance (PSP) DPL series and led to an integrated dialogue with the client, and joint
internal processing, and targeting with better results. This Project thus showcases the
remarkable tripartite collaboration among three sectors – FPD, HDN and PREM - under a tight
time line. Simultaneous preparation and processing of the two projects, allowed the two teams to
cross-fertilize ideas and foster partnership in the interest of a higher quality product for the client.
This was recognized by the Board at the time of presentation. Moreover, the Bank team also
worked with other development partners such as African Development Bank, and the European
Union (EU) to leverage on dialogue and concerted messages (e.g. ICT and e-Gov).

98.      Lesson 2: The PSC DPL series serve as an example of the Bank’s responsiveness and
agility to meet a Middle Income client’s development priorities more geared towards policy and
institutional support as opposed to public investment and capacity building. The Bank team used
                                                  43
this as an opportunity to adopt an innovative approach to successfully transform two low-
disbursing investment loans into a DPL series while still focusing on the competitiveness agenda.
It may be noted that the PSC DPL I team received the Africa VPU award in 2012 as recognition
of the Bank’s responsiveness to the client and innovative approach.

99.     Lesson 3: The loan was designed to include a certain degree of flexibility to allow the
government to adapt the reform program as needed over time. In this manner, the lending series
acknowledged areas where the country made significant efforts beyond what was expected. In
the lagging areas, the necessary building blocks were put in place to ensure that the reforms take
place progressively as in the case of the restructuring of the DBM where consensus for reform
existed but the timeline was extended to take into consideration negotiations with another
government on the selection of a strategic advisor.

100. Lesson 4: Throughout the process of Project design and preparation, the government
placed great value on the knowledge package accompanying the DPL which contributes to
reform planning and implementation. The Mauritian Government had recently cancelled two ILs
but continued to request the Bank for technical assistance, analytics and policy dialogue. This
brings to the forefront the issue of Middle Income Countries that can raise finds on the open
market but still wish to maximize access to the Bank’s advisory services, analytics and technical
assistance without the associated administrative requirements of lending instruments. This calls
for continuous improvement of Bank lending instruments to suit the requirements of this
‘emerging’ client segment.

101. Lesson 5: The Results Framework was realistic and with clear baseline data and targets
that allowed proper monitoring of progress towards performance. Implementation and
monitoring of progress of the series was facilitated by regular updates from the ISRs. The
supervision of the project with frequent missions and field based staff was pivotal to timely
resolution of issues encountered.

   7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies:
The Borrower received a copy of the draft document and responded jointly to both this ICR and
the ICR for the Public Sector Performance DPO series. The authorities concurred with the
overall gist of the reports. They agreed that the results and monitoring framework were well
aligned with the budget and cycle and policy actions were reasonable and enable strong sector
ministry accountability. They agreed that the lessons learned were useful and should be
incorporated in the future when other such operations are designed.

The other issues raised by the Borrower on the DBM have been dealt with in the main text.

Finance and Economic Development).

Subject: ICR for Mauritius Private Sector DPL Series for your review and comments

Dear Brinda

Plz see my comments on para 69 as under:

The decision not to go ahead with SIDBI/Bank of Maharashtra was not from Mauritian Government. In
fact, Mauritian Authorities had meetings with Indian counterparts in India to push forward the project
and a follow up letter was even sent. However, the Reserve Bank of India did not approve the request
from SIDBI to invest in Mauritius.

Following this event, the Mauritian new Government decided to go ahead with a new SME Bank, which
will be essentially MSME oriented and which will operate as a Specialised Financial Institution under the
Bank of Mauritius. Legislations for this purpose have already been passed. MoFED is working towards
operationalising the SME Bank in August.

Though the strategic partnership with DBM did not materialise, the restructuring exercise within DBM
has been ongoing. A new Board is now in place and emphasis in being placed on reviewing the role of
DBM within the new landscape.

Hope above meets your expectations.
