Loans (DPL) Project for\n            Mauritius were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the new programmatic DPL\n            series was prepared in tandem with the public sector\n            performance (PSP) DPL series and led to an integrated\n            dialogue with the client, and joint internal processing, and\n            targeting with better results. The PSC DPL series serve as\n            an example of the Bank\u2019s responsiveness and agility to meet\n            a middle income client\u2019s development priorities more geared\n            towards policy and institutional support as opposed to\n            public investment and capacity building. The loan was\n            designed to include a certain degree of flexibility to allow\n            the government to adapt the reform program as needed over\n            time. Throughout the process of project design and\n            preparation, the government placed great value on the\n            knowledge package accompanying the DPL which contributes to\n            reform planning and implementation. The results framework\n            was realistic and with clear baseline data and targets that\n            allowed proper monitoring of progress towards performance."}, "docdt": "2015-06-15T02:19:05Z"}
