Lessons learned from the\n            project are as follows: The importance of aligning project\n            objectives with that of the Borrower's. With the\n            objectives of both sides aligned, the project received\n            strong administrative support from the government\n            representatives in the Ministry of Labor and Social\n            Security, Heilongjiang and Qingdao, in the Project\n            Implementation Unit and the Project Management Offices. The\n            practicality of focusing the project on one province and one\n            municipality as pilots with oversight from the central\n            government. In terms of project management, a lesson learned\n            from this project is that there should be better clarity as\n            to the responsibilities and repayment obligations at the\n            onset of project launch."}, "docdt": "2006-07-10T00:00:00Z"}
