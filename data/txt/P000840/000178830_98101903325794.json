The proposed credit would cover the entire foreign\n            exchange cost of the project, and the proceeds would be\n            applied towards purchase of water and sewer pipes and\n            accessories, pumps, mechanical and electrical equipment and\n            the foreign exchange component of installation costs and\n            consultants' services. Though GWSC lacks experience in\n            utility management, it has a number of qualified engineers\n            and accountants on its staff.
