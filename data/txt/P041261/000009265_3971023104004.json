  Structural Adjustment Credit are: (1) to open domestic\n            markets to competition through trade liberalization; (2) to\n            further reduce the role of the state in economic and\n            commercial activities; (3) to promote the development of a\n            sound banking system; and (4) to protect vulnerable groups\n            from utility price increases. The SAC will be disbursed in\n            two equal tranches, over a period of 9 to 10 months, upon\n            completion of Board and second tranche conditions. The\n            Credit will generate local currency funds, which will (1)\n            provide non-inflationary financing for the budget; (2)\n            increase trade liberalization, including financing\n            additional imports needed, privatizing state-trading\n            organizations, and eliminating export duties on cotton; and\n            (3) accelerate structural reform in the areas of\n            demonopolization and privatization, completing small-scale\n            privatization and achieve majority private ownership of 500\n            companies, and implementing the free use, sale, and mortgage\n            of agricultural lands, the liquidation or restructuring of\n            state enterprises, and new bankruptcy and secured\n            transactions laws; (4) banking sector reform, implementing\n            new accounting procedures, capital adequacy and liquidity\n            standards, and restructuring plans of the four state-owned\n            banks; and (5) refine the social safety net, including\n            replacing food subsidies with targeted cash benefits,\n            finalizing proposals on measures to mitigate effects of\n            subsidy removal, and pension reform."}, "docdt": "1997-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
