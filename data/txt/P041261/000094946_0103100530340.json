           sustainability is likely, however, institutional development\n            impacts are modest. Lessons learned suggest that: 1)\n            transition to a market economy is a gradual, and lengthy\n            process, that is marked by successive incremental changes to\n            the status quo. From this perspective, the project's\n            agenda may have been overly ambitious, setting to accomplish\n            extensive changes in a very short period of time. Yet,\n            without such an ambitious program, the project most likely\n            would not have achieved as much as it did; 2) unanticipated\n            circumstances required timetable adjustments, thus, the\n            Bank's flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances,\n            contributed to a greater Government commitment, and the\n            project success; and, 3) the sustainability of the fragile\n            reform program is questionable, for although policy actions\n            were adequately implemented, the perceived weakness in\n            Government ownership of the development process, needs\n            further attention to ensure shared objectives are met."}, "docdt": "2000-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
