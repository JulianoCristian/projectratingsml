             SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (Cr. 1005/Ln 1833-H0)

                               PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT


                                         HIGHLIGHTS


Introduction and Objectives

1.         This project was the f i f t h agricultural project financed by the
Bank i n Honduras.      The project included a nationwide agricultural credit
program; a p i l o t forestry program i n Western Honduras; studies and training;
and incremental expenditures for the UPCA (para 2.04).            The main objectives
of the project were t o improve incomes of individual small-farmers and
agrarian reform groups and t o accelerate growth of agricultural production
(para. 2.03).

Implementation Experience

2.          The project achieved a l l of its goals concerning the number of
beneficiaries, project cost, implementation period, and closing date.            Also,
the objectives of expanding the area under food crops and livestock produc-
tion, and of improving the balance of trade through making a contribution t o
increasing agricultural sector exports and t o import substitution, were
attained by the project though t o a lesser degree than anticipated a t
appraisal (para. 7.01).

Results

3.          The key objective of the project of supporting the s m a l l farms
subsector was attained a s about 3,000 project beneficiaries were small
farmers.    Also, the project achieved the project condition t h a t earmarked 40%
of the c r e d i t funds t o small farmers (para 7.01).     Actual spending under the
project (computed i n US dollar equivalent) was the same as estimated a t
appraisal (para. 3.16).       The project was successful i n increasing production
of milk and beef and it helped t o increase the production of poultry and
pigs.   Regarding crop development, the project did not achieve the production
envisaged a t appraisal.      However, it was successful i n the promotion of other
crops such as tobacco, cotton, basic grains, c i t r u s , o i l palm and cocoa.    Of
these, tobacco production was particularly successful (para. 6.02).            The
yields of the main project crops f e l l below appraisal expectations
(para. 6.04).       The financial r a t e of return f o r the typical dual-purpose farm
i n the North zone was estimated a t 27%, and f o r the Central zone a t 30%. The
corresponding appraisal estimate was 23%. The estimated economic r a t e s of
return f o r the same North zone and Central zone dual-purpose farms were 29%
and 33% respectively.       Net farwincome of beneficiary households a t f u l l
development was estimated t o be about twice the level that would prevail i n
the without-project situation (para. 6.05).

Sustainability

4.          The project has a very good Project Unit which throughout the l a s t
sixteen years has been strengthening its a c t i v i t i e s and improving its perfor-
mance.    Credit a c t i v i t i e s are expected t o continue a f t e r the project is
completed.    However, a s t h e demand of credit increase new external funds w i l l
be needed t o provide subloans funds t o s a t i s f y the increasing demand.         The
Project Unit is giving proof of commendable technical capacity and a b i l i t y i n
the management of credit proceeds.             This is because the Project Director and
h i s staff enjoy s t a b i l i t y and independence i n the decision-making process.
Another major achievement is a l s o the decisive participation by the private
banking system (12 financial intermediaries) and one public bank i n the chan-
nelling of subloans funds t o the d i r e c t beneficiaries of the project
(para. 3.08).

Findings and Lessons (para. 7.02)

5.         The main lessons t o be learned a r e that: (a) as i n previous Bank-
financed projects i n Honduras, only the credit component and matters related
t o credit were successfully implemented; (b) the Project Executive Committee,
i n charge of project coordination, did not perform well; (c) although the
project goal of lending t o small farmers was attained, commercial bank
lending t o small-scale farmers is constrained because of the farmers' lack of
land titles and collateral; (d) i n the case of the smallholder tobacco
growers, the tobacco manufacturers provided the necessary collateral on
behalf of the small farmers; (e) future Bank credit projects i n Honduras
should not earmark credit funds f o r specific crops linked t o specific
geographic areas a s i n the case of the unsuccessful implmentation of t h e
bananalplantain development i n the Ulua Valley; ( f ) BANADESA prepared a plan
of action f o r the improvement of the r a t e of recovery with respect t o
subloans rediscounted under bank-financed projects, but that plan has not yet
been implemented; and (g) under t h i s project, no important technical innova-
tions were expected t o be introduced, but throughout the implementation
period, improved farming system8 already practiced i n the country were
disseminated more widely.

                                   INTRODUCTION


1.01.     At the time when the project was appraised in March 1979, the Bank's
estimate of Honduras' GNP per capita was about USS480. The agricultural sector
accounted for about 33% of the GDP, generated about 80% of export earnings and
employed about 56% of the economically active population. Bananas, coffee,
timber and beef were the principal exports (69% of total export value) while
imports of food, agricultural inputs and capital goods represented 17% of total
imports. The total population was about 3.3 million and the rural population
numbered 2.2 million.  The main goals of the Government's second five-year plan
(1979-83) were to promote agricultural development, to give greater attention
to the small-scale, independent farmers, and to integrate the various public
entities related to the sector. The Bank supported this Government effort.

1.02      During project implementation,no dramatic changes occurred in the
structure of the economy: agriculture still is the most important sector in the
economy, accounting for about 30% of GDP in 1984; the sector's share of total
exports and labor force in 1984 was 75% and 53% respectively. Bananas, coffee,
timber and beef continue to be the major sources of agricultural exports; and
food imports account for about 10% of total imports.  The population is about
4.4 million, and the most recent Bank estimate of the GNP per capita amounts to
USS700 (1984).  The country is now going through severe economic difficulties.
As in the rest of the economy, the rate of growth of agricultural production
has declined in recent years, although the sector has performed better than the
economy as a whole. The Government is now giving high priority to projects
that would improve the balance of trade, particularly those that would increase
and diversify agricultural exports. The Bank is helping to support this
strategy through a loan of USS45.0 million for a follow-up Third Agricultural
Credit Project (Loan 2284-H0, of September 1983), which is expected to be com-
pleted by June 1987.

                           11. PROJECT FORMULATION

                A.  Identification, Preparation and Appraisal

2.01      The project was identified in September 1978 by an FAO/CP mission and
preparation was completed by the Agricultural Credit Project Unit (UPCA) and
staff of the Honduran Banana Corporation (COHBANA) and of the Western Region
Rural Development Project (PRODERO).  It was appraised by the Bank During
MarchIApril 1979.

                     B.  Negotiations and Board Approval

2.02      Negotiations for the Second Agricultural Credit Project took place in
Washington, D.C. in March 1980. The credit and loan were approved by the Board
on April 17, 1980. The Board was concerned that: (a) the major obstacles to
the use of credit by small farmers were the lack of collateral and guarantees;

(b) the change in the banking law was a major consideration for the success of
the project; and (c) the organization of the agrarian reform cooperatives--who
were to be the potential credit beneficiaries--for the bananalplantain produc-
tion component in the Ulua Valley had not yet been started (the organization of
cooperatives was a necessary condition not only to regulate the land tenure in
that area, but also for the fanners to receive subloans for banana/plantain
           .
production)

                    C. Project Objectives and Components

2.03      Objectives. The objectives of the project were to: (a) expand the
areas under food crops and livestock production; (b) improve the contribution
of the agricultural sector to export earnings and import substitution;
(c) increase employment oportunities and family incomes; and (d) support
selected institutions for further planning and development of the agricultural
sector and for the conservation of natural resources.

2.04      Components.  The project included: (a) a nationwide agricultural
credit program to finance lending through the national banking network
(accounting for about 82% of total project cost); (b) a pilot forestry program
in western Honduras (6%); (c) studies and training (9%); and (d) incremental
expenditures for the UPCA, including the provision of consultant services,
vehicles and equipment (3%).

                        D.  Project Cost and Financing

2.05      At appraisal, total project cost was estimated at USS38.5 million, of
which the Bank and IDA was to contribute USS25.0 million (65%) to cover the
foreign exchange costs estimated at USS19.3 million (50%) and USS5.7 million
(15%) of local currency costs. The Government and the BCH were to contribute
USS4.3 million (11%); financial intermediaries USS3.9 million (10%); the
national corporations, COHBANA and the Honduran Forestry Development
Corporation (COHDEFOR), USS2.0 million (5%); and from farmers, the remaining
USS3.3 million (9%).

                             111.  IMPLEMENTATION

3.01      Introduction. This chapter compares actual performance with the tar-
gets established at appraisal, including a comparative analysis of implementa-
tion of the different components (credit, forestry program; studies and train-
ing; and the incremental expenditures for the UPCA), assessment of project
cost, disbursements, procurement, reporting and auditing, and compliance with
credit and loan covenants. The implementation schedule is presented first.

                          A. Implementation Schedule

3.02      Effectiveness. The Credit and the Loan became effective on
September 11, 1980, five months after Board approval.

3.03      Implementation Period. According to appraisal projections, the
project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1984 and the Closing Date
was to be June 30, 1985.  Completion was achieved on schedule.

                        B.   Implementation of Project Components

3.04            Agricultural Credit.  1/   The key indicators of the c r e d i t component
a r e presented i n Annex 1.       The project financed a t o t a l of 1,284
sub-loans--nearly        double the appraisal expectation of 700.                 This indicates a
broader distribution of benefits under the project than anticipated, and
especially a greater participation of small- and medium-scale farmers.                         About
65% of the amount of loan funds were used f o r sub-loans f o r livestock
development, 34% for crop development, and the remaining 1%f o r heavy machinery
and agroindustries, a s compared t o appraisal estimates of 32%, 50% and 18%
respectively.         Although these r e s u l t s a r e d i f f e r e n t from appraisal estimates,
they follow the pattern of the previous Bank-financed credit project i n
Honduras (Credit 628-HO).          The average amount of sub-loan per beneficiary was
much lower than the appraisal expectation so that the t o t a l cost of sub-loans
financed was v i r t u a l l y the same a s the appraisal estimate.

3.05            According t o Schedule 2, paragraph l(m) of the Project Agreement, a t
least 50%of the t o t a l value of sub-loans approved by participating interme-
d i a r i e s would go t o small-scale farmers.          In f a c t , the number of sub-loans
granted t o s m a l l farmers was 80%more than expected a t appraisal, and 60%more
than the number of sub-loans granted t o other beneficiaries.                        Fewer coopera-
t i v e s participated than expected (para. 3-11), and the average s i z e of sub-loan
i n t h i s category was less than expected, resulting i n a smaller t o t a l value of
sub-loans f o r such beneficiaries (about 38% of the t o t a l cost of the c r e d i t
component compared with 52% anticipated a t appraisal).                       During project imple-
mentation, the legal document was amended t o take account of the lower partici-
pation of cooperatives and greater number of small sub-loans t o individual
farmers by changing the amount targeted t o the small-farmer category t o 40%.

3.06            Livestock accounted f o r 937 of the sub-loans, compared with 294 en-
visaged a t appraisal.        About 700 of these were made f o r dual-purpose c a t t l e
(dairy and beef) compared t o 294 estimated a t appraisal.                       Moreover, 235 sub-
loans were granted f o r poultry and pig development (120) and s t e e r s fattening
(115) not envisaged a t appraisal.            About 340 of the sub-loans were f o r crop
development; about 94% of the appraisal estimate.                        However, regarding the agro-
industries and services a c t i v i t i e s , only f i v e sub-loans were made f o r agricul-
t u r a l machinery, representing only 13%of the appraisal estimate.                      This lower
than expected r e s u l t was due t o a lack of demand f o r t h i s type of sub-loan.
Finally, no sub-loans were made f o r the rehabilitation of municipal abbatoirs
as compared with 4 sub-loans estimated at appraisal.                         This was because the
Banco Municipal, the financial intermediary f o r such s u b ~ l o a n s ,found alterna-
t i v e funds t o finance the municipal abbatoirs.

3.07            During project implementation, severe floods occured during March-
April of 1982 which affected the region of Choluteca located i n the south of
the country.         Following a request of the Government of Honduras, the legal doc-
uments of the Bank project were modified t o allow USS1.5 million of short-term
c r e d i t t o assist i n the recovery of the Choluteca Region. This amount was taken

from Category 4 . corresponding t o c i v i l works and engineering f o r flood
protection and land drainage i n the Ulua Valley (see para. 3.11).                   The credit
was used f o r land preparation, seeding and f e r t i l i z e r application, and f o r the
replacement of fattening livestock, all of which had been destroyed by
flooding.    The t o t a l amount of funds earmarked f o r t h i s a c t i v i t y was disbursed
as planned.      Subsequently, however, droughts have aggravated the problems of
the same region and farmers are having d i f f i c u l t i e s repaying t h e i r sub-loans.

3.08       A t o t a l of 13 financial intermediaries (one public and 12 private)
participated i n the project.       The National Bank of Agricultural Development
(BANADESA), a public development bank, was the most active financial intermedi-
ary.   It accounted for 50%of the amount of sub-loans and 45%of the volume,
mostly s m a l l sub-loans.    This followed the pattern of BANADESA under the qrevi-
ous project, a s well as i n the subsequent credit project (Loan 2284-HO). -1

3.09       The r a t e of sub-loan recovery by the financial intermediaries ranged
from 35%t o loo%, reflecting different emphasis given t o supervision, checking
on investment plans and collection efforts.             The overall average r a t e of sub-
loan recovery was 65%i n 1983, and ranged from 79%f o r private banks and 47%

      period t o the sum of the arrears a t the beginning of the period and the
      amount that f e l l due during the period.

I n 1984, the average level of sub-loan recovery by financial intermediaries was
similar t o the previous year, but for BANADESA the level of recovery declined
t o 42%. The low level of sub-loan recovery i n recent years is largely the
result of the economic d i f f i c u l t i e s the country is facing.     I n the specific
case of BANADESA, a number of additional factors apply, including, inter a l i a ,
that BANADESA does not demand r e a l estate-based collateral from beneficiaries,
because a large proportion of small farmers do not have proper titles t o t h e i r
land.

3.10       A condition of effectiveness of the subsequent project (Loan2284-H0)
required that BANADESA provide the Ban.. with a satisfactory plan of action f o r
improving the level of recovery f o r sub-loans rediscounted under Bank-financed
projects.    BBNADESA submitted its plan i n August 1983, but it proved t o be too
ambitious.     After two years of experience with the f i r s t plan, BANADESA was
asked t o prepare a new plan.       This has only recently been prepared with the
help of a consultant, and has not yet been submitted t o the Bank.

3.11       The credit component earmarked USS4.0 million f o r the bananafplantain
development i n the Ulua Valley.           The project was expected t o provide credit t o

peasants who would be organized into producer's cooperatives. Moreover, the
project was also expected to finance USS1.5 million of civil works, including
final engineering studies for flood protection and land drainage. During
project implementation, COHBANA, the implementing agency, was unable to orga-
nize the peasants in production cooperatives. For this reason, the funds ear-
marked for this activity were not used for the purpose originally intended
(they were reallocated to the other credit categories).

3. 12     The Forestry Program. The project was to finance a pilot forestry
program located in western Honduras to be carried out by COHDEFOR. Only one of
the three activities was satisfactorily achieved: forestry fire protection sys-
tem of about 25,000 hectares. The other two activities were poorly imple-
mented: (a) the project provided for the establishment of three nurseries: one
for production of 1.8 million pine seedlings per annum accomplished about 65%
of the targets. However, the other two nurseries for the annual production of
800,000 broad-leaf seedlings for firewood were not implemented; and (b) the
reforestation program of 4,000 ha of pine for timber production reached only
10% of the targeted area.  Only 22% of the Bank funds were utilized by
COHDEFOR. Furthermore, none of the 12 man-months of consultants provided for
the development of the forestry program were used.  This component has been
severely delayed in its execution, mainly because the field project unit of
COHDEFOR received little support from its headquarters due to a combination of
apathy and internal managerial problems. This situation was aggravated by
COHDEFOR's lack of counterpart funds.

3.13      Studies and Training. The project was to finance three studies:
(a) water resource use and agricultural development for the Aguan Valley;
(b) utilization of the banana and plantain by-products to be used for livestock
feeding; and (c) COHBANA's organization and management. A consulting firm
carried out a successful study of the Aguan Valley with the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) as the executing agency. The actual cost was
US$842,385 compared to USS1.0 million estimated at appraisal. The study of
banana and plantain by-products was carried out by using alternative sources of
financing from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI).
COHBANA's organization and management review was carried out by a consulting
firm with the Bank financing US$226,819. The study of the Aguan Valley proved
to be useful for the Government. However, COHBANA's organization and manage-
ment study was not utilized because severe financial, managerial and political
problems during the project prevented implementation of the recommendations.
COHBANA is currently in the process of being liquidated.

3.14      Regarding the training activities, COHDEFOR's staff received training
for 24 man-months, as planned at appraisal; UPCA had a total of 38 training
activities which benefitted 137 participants also as envisaged at appraisal.
These training activities proved to be useful. COHBANA training program was
not implemented due to managerial problems.

3.15      Incremental Expenditures for UPCA.  The project provided funds for
three new professional staff salaries to strengthen two of UPCA's regional
offices and its central office in Tegucigalpa, and for office equipment and the
purchase of 13 vehicles for the use of UPCA's staff. The project also financed
the extension for two more years of the coneultancy service agreement with the
Centro Agronomic0 Tropical de Inveetigacion y ~neenanza(CATIE).   Project funds

allocated t o UPCA were f u l l y spent.      UPCA1s new technical s t a f f , the CATIE1s
consultancy services of three full-time experts ( i n f i e l d s of animal production,
pasture management and farm economics), and the acquisiton of the vehicles and
equipment with proceeds of the project produced a positive impact, increasing the
volume of credit operations.

                                       C.  Cost Estimate -
                                                         3/

3.16           The t o t a l cost of the project a t completion is virtually the same a s the
appraisal estimate of USS38.5 million.           However, the actual cost of the credit
component f o r loan category f o r beneficiaries, other than small-scale farmers, is
a l i t t l e higher than the appraisal estimate.      This is because during project
implementation it became evident t h a t there was a higher demand f o r credit from
these farmers.        The lower costs of the forestry and studies and training compo-
nents were discussed i n paras. 3.12 and 3.13 respectively.             A comparison of actual
costs with expected costs a t appraisal is shown below:

Actual disbursements during project implementation were virtually as planned,
except for the first fiscal year (1981) because the previous project (Credit
628-H0) was still being implemented.

                               E.  Procurement

3.18      Procurement of equipment and vehicles for the Project Unit was
carried out satisfactorily and on schedule. Goods financed under the sub-loans
were procured directly by the beneficiaries and no serious problems were
encountered. However, procurement of equipment and vehicles for COHDEFOR took
more time than anticipated.

                                F. Reporting

3.19      Project reporting was generally satisfactory. The Project Unit's
monitoring and evaluation section prepares the UPCA's quarterly and annual
reports on implementation progress and has also been responsible for the suc-
cessful preparation of the project completion reports for this project and the
two previous projects (Credit 434-H0 and Credit 628-HO).

                                 G.  Auditing

3.20      All audited financial statements of the project accounts of the
Central Bank and the financial intermediaries audi;edVby the Superintendencia
Bancaria were submitted for each fiscal vear. on schedule. The financial
-       -
     ~




statements included valuable audited data on subloan recovery rates. BANADESA-
has been sending to the Bank six-monthly audited reports on its sub-loan
recovery rate since June 1983. The audited financial statements of the project
accounts of COHDEFOR for 1983 and 1984 fiscal years were received by the Bank
on May 10, 1985. They were unqualified.

                     H.   Compliance with Loan Covenants

3.21      Compliance with covenants was fully satisfactory.

                        IV.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE

4.01      The performance of the UPCA in implementing the credit component was
satisfactory. The project executive cormnittee established in connection with
the implementation of the previous Bank-assisted projects, was to be princi-
pally responsible for coordinating the activities of the project entities and
reviewing its programs, budgets and progress reports with regard to the pro-
ject. As in the case of the previous projects, the committee was not success-
ful in fulfilling its responsibilities, as it met infrequently and the managers
who represented the executive agencies did not attend the meetings nor support
the committee. Representation of the executing agencies (except for the
Central Bank) was usually vested in relatively low-ranking staff, which greatly
complicated the task of arriving at practical solutions acceptable to the
senior managers of the entities concerned. In general, the usefulness of this
committee was very limited. The performance of the financial intermediaries
was satisfactory, as they did fairly well in the identification and processing
of subloans, although their supervisory efforts were not very effective.

BANADESAtsperformance was tnsatisfactory due to the consistent deterioration
its subloan recovery rate. / The performance of COHDEFOR and COHBANA was
unsatisfactory as cited in paras. 3.12 and 3.13.

                              V. ROLE OF THE BANK

5.01       The role played by the Bank throughout the execution of the project
was satisfactory. The Bank acted in a supportive and flexible manner in
responding to the Government's request for reallocation of the proceeds of the
credit and loan to rehabilitate the Choluteca region affected by severe floods
in 1982. The appraisal was too optimistic about the banana/plantain develop-
ment in the Ulua Valley for which USS5.5 million were specifically targeted and
did not materialize.

                           VI.  AGRICULTURAL IMPACT

6.01       Technical coefficients used by the appraisal mission in the invest-
ment models for crop and livestock production were based on experience already
gained in Honduras, principally through the monitoring of previous IDA pro-
jects. No important technical innovations were expected to be introduced under
the project. At year three of development, the project reached the following
incremental production:
                                  Production

                                                  Incremental

6.02       The project was successful in increasing production of milk and
beef, as was the case in the three previous Bank-assisted projects.  In
addition, the project helped increase the production of other livestock opera-
tions (not shown in the table above) such as poultry and pigs (para. 3.06).
Regarding crop development, the project did not achieve the production envi-
saged at appraisal for bananalplantain development for the reasons stated in
para. 3.11.  The sugarcane production was also lower than anticipated as the
international sugar price declined sharply starting in 1981. However, the
project was successful in the promotion of other crops such as tobacco, cotton,
baeic grains, citrus, oil palm and cocoa (rehabilitation).  Of these, tobacco
production was particularly successful. Although not anticipated at appraisal,
crop promotion and a solution.tocollateral problems of small farmers was pro-
vided by one tobacco firm which gave technical assistance, bought the crop, and
agreed to put up collateral for small farmers in order for farmers to obtain

6.05           An analysis of the financial and economic p r o f i t a b i l i t y of dual- pur-
pose (dairy-beef) farms participating i n the project was conducted, based on a
representative sample of such farms.             Lending f o r dual-purpose livestock
investment was the main category of sub-loans financed under the project and
accounted f o r about 46% of a l l lending.         The financial r a t e of return f o r the
typical dual-purpose farm i n the North zone was estimated a t 272, and f o r the
Central zone a t 30%. The corresponding appraisal estimate was 23%. The esti-
mated economic r a t e s of return f o r the same North zone and Central zone dual-
purpose farms were 29% and 33% respectively.             N e t farm income of beneficiary
households a t f u l l development is estimated t o be about twice the level that
would prevail i n the without-project situation.              The r e s u l t s obtained f o r the
dual-purpose farm investments are likely t o be a l s o representative, i n general
terms, of livestock fattening investments, which accounted for about 7% of a l l
1ending    .
6.06.          For crops, a similar analysis was conducted f o r sugarcane farms par-
ticipating i n the project.         Lending f o r sugarcane was the main category of crop
subloans financed under the project and accounted f o r about 11%of a l l
lending.       The financial r a t e of return f o r the typical sugarcane farm was esti-
mated a t 17% (the corresponding appraisal estimate was 42%), and the increase
i n net farm income of beneficiary households a t about 70%. The economic r a t e
of return f o r the typical sugarcane farm, i f based on farmgate prices derived
from the prices prevailing i n the preferrential U.S. market, would be about the
same a s the financial r a t e of return.          However, the ERR for the typical sugar
farm would be negative i f the very low prices i n the non-preferrential markets
a r e used t o compute the benefit stream.           No ex-post r a t e of return analysis was
conducted f o r other crops financed under the project (bananas, plantains,
tobacco, etc.), because there was no satisfactory data base t o carry out such
an analysis.

                            V I I . SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED

7.01           Summary.  The objectives of expanding the area under food crops and
livestock production, and of improving the balance of trade through making a
contribution t o increasing agricultural sector exports and t o import substitu-
t i o n , have been attained by t h e project though t o a lesser degree than antici-
pated at appraisal.        Also, the objective of supporting the s m a l l farms sub-
sector has been attained as about 3,000 project beneficiaries a r e small
farmers.       The project a l s o achieved the project condition t h a t earmarked 40% of
the c r e d i t funds t o small farmers.       The project achieved a l l of its goals con-
cerning the number of beneficiaries, project cost, implementation period, and
closing date.       The performance of the implementing agencies has been mixed.
UPCA and the commercial financial intermediaries did w e l l .                 The other agencies
did not do w e l l :  BANADESA had a very low r a t e of sub-loan recovery, COHBANA
proved t o be a very weak i n s t i t u t i o n , and COHDEFOR did not lend enough support
t o implementation of the forestry component.             The financial and economic impact
of the c r e d i t component was satisfactory and a considerable increment i n pro-
duction was achieved.        With regard t o the Board's concerns (para. 2.02),               the
project did w e l l despite the small farmers' lack of c o l l a t e r a l and guarantees,
and no major changes i n the banking law occurred.              The Board was rightly con-
cerned t h a t no arrangements had been made a t the t i m e of Board presentation t o
ensure the organization of the planned bananalplantain production cooperatives
i n the Ulua Valley.       In the end, such cooperatives w e r e never organized.
Finally, the successful implementation of t h i s project contributed i n approval
on May 19, 1983, of the Third Agricultural Credit Project ( ~ o a n2284-HO).

Lessons Learned

A s i n previous Bank-financed projects, only the c r e d i t component
and matters related t o credit were successfully implemented.           Future
credit projects i n Honduras should not include other components that
a r e not related t o credit.    The subsequent Bank project ( ~ o a n
2284-H0) incorporated t h i s recommendation;

the Project Executive Committee, i n charge of project coordination,
did not perform well i n t h i s project (para. 4.01) nor i n the previ-
ous project, and is performing very poorly i n the on-going project
(Loan 2284-HO).     Future agricultural credit projects i n Honduras
should not have such a committee.       UPCA should be the actual coordi-
nating agency;

although the project goal of lending t o small farmers was attained
(para. 3.05), commercial bank lending t o small-scale farmers is con-
strained because of the farmers' lack of land t i t l e s and collateral.
Under the subsequent Bank loan (Loan 2284-HO), the Government is
required t o study two alternatives t o land titles, such a s chattel
mortgages.     The Bank should encourage the Government t o speed up the
completion of t h i s study a s well a s the land t i t l i n g process;

i n the case of the smallholder tobacco growers, the tobacco
manufacturers provided the necessary collateral on behalf of the
small farmers.     This proved t o be a successful cooperation among the
small farmers, the tobacco manufacturers and a private bank, and the
arrangement was instrumental i n encouraging the commercial banks t o
lend t o small farmers f o r tobacco production (para. 6.02).

future Bank c r e d i t projects i n Honduras should not earmark credit
funds f o r specific crops linked to specific geographic areas a s i n
the case of the unsuccessful implementation of the banana/plantain
development i n the Ulua Valley;

BANADESA was asked, under Loan 2284-H0, t o prepare a plan of action
f o r the improvement of the r a t e of recovery with respect t o subloans
rediscounted under Bank-financed projects.       BANADESA has prepared a
plan of action t o improve the loan recovery, but that plan has not
yet been implemented.       This should be followed under the possible
forthcoming Fourth Agricultural Credit Project; and

under t h i s project, no important technical innovations were expected-
t o be introduced, but throughout the implementation period, improved
farming systems already practiced i n the country were disseminated
more widely (para. 6.01).       Future credit projects i n Honduras should
follow t h i s pattern.

WHICH POINT OUT THAT THE OBTECTIVES, PARTICULARLY I N THE FIELD OF AGRICULTURE

COMMENT: THE RESULTS SHOWN I N THE DOCUMENT ARE EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED TO TIIE USE
OF THE WORLD BANK LOAN AND CREDIT FUNDS UNDERESTIMATING THE RESULTS OF THE
CREDIT COMPONENT AND OF THE WHOLE PROJECT.                             CONCERNING THE NUMBER OF SUBLOANS
THE UNDERESTIMATION I S 8 0 % AND CONCERNING THE AMOUNT OF SUBLOANS THE
UNDERESTIMATION I S 76%.                     THE TOTAL PROJECT COST HAS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED BY
39%. THESE SAME COMMENTS WERE MADE AT THE PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
COMPLETION REPORT.                 WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE LESSONS LEARNED AND WE ARE TRYING TO
OVERCOME ANY DIFFICULTIES I N THE EXECUTION OF THE CURRENT THIRD AGRICULTURAL

Dear Sir:

           We have read the copy of the draft Project Completion Report on the
Second Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1005-HO/PR-1833-HO) which you sent us
with your letter of October 9, 1986.   We note that the Report criticizes
BA?iADESA's performance as financial intermediary, terming it unsatisfactory.

           In our opinion, this is an unfair judgment:  BANADESA, as a State
Development Institution, has contributed positively to the achievement of the
goals of the Second Agricultural Credit Project, thereby promoting the
country's agricultural development.

           It is important to point out that BANADESA, as the country's only
development bank, has to serve those borrowers who, not having urban
mortgages, are not eligible for credit from the private banking sector.
BATJADESA accepts as security mortgages on urban and rural properties aa well
as collateral, which may consist of livestock or equipment, whether already
belonging to the borrower or to be purchased with the loan.   Under this
project, BANADESA has also financed agricultural reform beneficiaries,
guaranteed by the National Agricultural Institute (INA), who in many cases do
not even have any collateral to offer.   The only security then consists of
the products they expect to obtain.

           With respect to the low rates of loan recovery, these are mainly Uw
result of failures suffered by the borrowers, either owing to adverse weather
conditions (drought, floods, etc.) or to fluctuations in the price of their
products (meat, sugarcane, cotton, coffee, etc.).  Nevertheless, the quarterly
reports that have recently been sent to the World Bank show that despite t k
adversities mentioned, BANADESA has managed to prevent the situation fror
getting any worse, and has even succeeded in improving things in some cases,
if we look at its project participation, which in the case of the Second
Agricultural Credit Project amounts to 891 loans (69.4% of the total), with
financing of L 33.5 million (57.1% of the total), and under the Third
Agricultural Credit Project (PR-228440) amounts to 1,267 loans aggregatiry
L 41.8 million.

          Trusting that the above coaments will be borne in mind, and that the
Project Completion Report will be able to include data 6ivin6 a better picture
of BANADESA's participation in the Project, a sumaary table is included,
giving details on the points mentioned.

                               Very truly yours,

                  Comments on the Letter by the Projects Department
                   Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Off i c e




          The PCR acknowledged t h a t BANADESA was the most active single
financial intermediary a s it a l s o was i n previous projects (see para. 3.08).
However, some of its most important current problems are:         (a) high percen-
tage of arrears, which is an old issue and continuously growing; (b) there
have been a n increased number of subloans a s a r e s u l t of the land reform
program and t h i s onlending has been carried out without the normal c o l l a t e r a l
requirements; (c) poor subloan supervision; and (d) lack of an institutiona-
lized system f o r subloan recovery', extensions, refinancing and consolida-
tion.  As a consequence, during project implementation subloan recovery has
consistently been deteriorating.      Recently, BANADESA has prepared a revised
Action Plan t o deal with its problems and i t remains t o be seen i f the recow
mendations w i l l be implemented.
