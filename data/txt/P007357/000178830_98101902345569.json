domestic food production\n            and consumption, increasing exports and import substitution,\n            generating employment, improving incomes and strengthening\n            institutions for agricultural planning and development and\n            for natural resource conservation. The project comprises:\n            (1) a line of credit for investments in crops, livestock,\n            agricultural machinery and municipal abattoirs; (2) flood\n            control and drainage works for banana and plantain\n            development; (3) a pilot reforestation program; (4) studies\n            of groundwater resources, COHBANA's organization, and\n            use or waste bananas and plantains for animal feed; and (5)\n            incremental PU expenditures and related training and\n            technical assistance. Almost 90 percent of the expected\n            12,800 persons who would benefit directly from the project\n            have present incomes which fall beneath the rural poverty\n            line; the project would help raise their annual incomes substantially."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
