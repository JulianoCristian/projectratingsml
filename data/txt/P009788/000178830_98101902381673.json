Potential project risks are that\n            the free distribution of seedlings might lead to some waste,\n            that village panchayats might lack sufficient leadership and\n            incentive to assume responsibility for village woodlots, and\n            that there might be resistance to the introduction of a new\n            type of stove. These risks would be minimized by the careful\n            monitoring and supervision of planting programs, and public\n            information and education efforts."}, "docdt": "1981-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
