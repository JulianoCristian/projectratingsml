 fuelwood for domestic use in rural areas through the\n            establishment of 93,000 ha of plantations on private and\n            public wastelands throughout the State. It would also\n            provide poles, bamboo, small timber, fodder grass, fruits,\n            oilseeds, and other forest produce from these same\n            plantations, introduce energy-efficient stoves, generate\n            paid employment for the rural poor, help to stabilize the\n            environment, and establish the Social Forestry Wing of the\n            State Forestry Department. Potential project risks are that\n            the free distribution of seedlings might lead to some waste,\n            that village panchayats might lack sufficient leadership and\n            incentive to assume responsibility for village woodlots, and\n            that there might be resistance to the introduction of a new\n            type of stove. These risks would be minimized by the careful\n            monitoring and supervision of planting programs, and public\n            information and education efforts."}, "docdt": "1981-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
