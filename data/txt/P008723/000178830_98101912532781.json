        items included in Romania's 1981-85 railway and highway\n            Investment Plans and technical assistance. The railway\n            components include: (i) construction of 77 km of two new\n            lines together with about 7 km of tunnels, 3 km of bridges\n            and 2 km of viaducts; (ii) doubling of three line sections\n            of approximately 125 km; (iii) electrification of 470 route\n            km of main lines; (iv) procurement of special steel for the\n            superstructure of Cernavoda bridge over the Danube; and (v)\n            procurement of about 330 freight cars. The highway\n            components include: (i) paving of three two-lane gravel\n            roads (85 km); (ii) widening of one road (6km) from two to\n            four lanes; and (iii) construction of a 17 km new road\n            between Fetesti and Cernavoda on the two arms of the Danube\n            to shorten the distance between Bucharest and Constanta.\n            Technical assistance comprises a traffic optimization study\n            (150 man-months) and related study visits abroad by Romanian\n            officials as well as other such visits in connection with\n            improvements in car control and locomotive utilization and\n            in highway maintenance practices."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
