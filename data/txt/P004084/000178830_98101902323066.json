to\n            stimulate and support the development of technological\n            capabilities in the Korean electronics industry. The project\n            consists of: (a) development of KIET comprising: (i)\n            physical facilities including a semiconductor building,\n            other buildings, support facilities, and equipment; and (ii)\n            technology-related items including training, expert\n            invitation, and the purchase of technology; (b) research,\n            development, and engineering program designed to promote and\n            finance research carried out at KIET for the benefit of the\n            Korean electronics industry. While the risks inherent in\n            this complex project which would operate in a rapidly\n            changing technological environment are higher than for\n            projects in most other industries, the potential benefits as\n            well as the costs of inaction considerably outweigh the risks."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
