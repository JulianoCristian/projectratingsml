The objectives were not achieved\n            for lack of an appropriate input package, because of general\n            disorganization and the failure to build-up adequate\n            services. The Government appeared to be supporting this\n            movement, but in 1983, with the withdrawal of Government\n            funding, the extension service, such as it was, fell apart.\n            Otherwise, the project was organizationally very weak\n            because of the combination of limited Government\n            administrative capacity and the co-donors' individual\n            aims and interests. The first economic possibilities should\n            have been accurately identified, notwithstanding the\n            country's political imperatives. Before mounting any\n            new agricultural projects it is essential to ascertain the\n            range of economic possibilities in the agricultural sector."}, "docdt": "1987-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
