The original main project objective was to\n            build up, over a three-year period, the capacity within the\n            Ministry of Rural Development and Fisheries (MDRP) which was\n            divided in two separate ministries: Ministry of Rural\n            Development and Agriculture(MDRA) and Ministry of Fisheries\n            (MP) to: i) manage its human resources with particular\n            attention to technical assistance; (ii) plan activities in\n            the agricultural sector and coordinate external aid; (iii)\n            fulfill its technical role in the different agriculture\n            subsectors; and (iv) ensure monitoring of sectoral\n            implementation and impact of the Government's\n            Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) of 1987 - 1988. The\n            overall project outcome is judged unsatisfactory because\n            there was a large disproportion between project costs and\n            benefits. Bank performance was rated as satisfactory.\n            Overall, the performance of the borrower was rated as\n            deficient. Key Lessons Learned were as follows:(a)better\n            project design and preparation;(b)borrower's\n            ownership;(c) better monitoring of the human resources\n            capacity building and performance;(d)upfront training in\n            important aspects of proiect management and bank\n            guidelines;and(e)sharpening the research and extension linkages."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
