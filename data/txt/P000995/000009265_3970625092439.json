First, the project\n            aims to support MDRP's management with a Human\n            Resources Division to manage technical assistance and to\n            make recommendations on local personnel management policies.\n            Second, it also plans to enhance MDRP's capacity in\n            sector planning by further strengthening the Planning Bureau\n            of MDRP (GAPLA) in (a) collection, analysis and\n            interpretation of statistics; (b) strategy and policy\n            planning; (c) aid coordination; (d) project planning; and\n            (e) monitoring and evaluation.  Third, the project seeks to\n            strengthen MDRP's support services through selective\n            improvements in its technical departments. Depending on the\n            specific priority needs of each Department, the project\n            provides physical facilities, technical assistance, training\n            and operating funds.  Under the project, a special fund will\n            also be established to meet needs, as they arise."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
