      Hydroelectric Project are to : i) provide additional\n            generation capacity to the power system in Sichuan province\n            in order to alleviate an acute electricity shortage; ii)\n            assist in the transfer of modern power technology and in the\n            introduction of efficient dam construction methods to reduce\n            the prevailing long gestation periods of hydropower\n            projects; iii) contribute to further improvements in the\n            analysis of environmental and ecological impacts of\n            hydroelectric resource development; iv) enhance the\n            institutional development of Ertan Hydroelectric Development\n            Corporation (EHDC); and v) provide technical assistance in\n            project design and implementation.  The project components\n            include : 1) preparatory works; 2) construction of a\n            parabolic, double-curvature arch dam (240 m high) across the\n            Yalong River together with an underground powerhouse\n            complex, a log conveyance system, and appurtenant works and\n            structures; 3) provision and installation of six 550MW\n            generating units and associated equipment; 4) resettlement\n            of 30,000 people; 5) an environmental management program and\n            science station; 6) consultant's services for\n            engineering, procurement, management of construction; 7)\n            studies of power pricing and power plant and reservoir\n            operation; and 8) strengthening EHDC's organization,\n            technical assistance and staff training."}, "docdt": "1991-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
