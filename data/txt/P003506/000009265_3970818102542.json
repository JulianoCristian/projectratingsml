The objectives of the Project were to: (a)\n            provide additional generation capacity in Sichuan Province\n            to alleviate the acute shortage of electricity; (b) assist\n            in the transfer of modern power technology and efficient dam\n            construction method; (c) contribute to further improvements\n            in the analyses of environmental and ecological impacts of\n            hydroelectric resource development; (d) enhance the\n            institutional development of the beneficiary, Ertan\n            Hydroelectric Development Corporation (EHDC), by\n            strengthening its organization through a comprehensive\n            management training program and introduction of economic\n            efficiency and sound pricing principles; and (e) provide\n            technical assistance in project design and implementation.\n            The objectives of the project were consistent with those of\n            the Chinese Government and the Bank. The progress made\n            toward achieving all project objectives has been very\n            satisfactory. The outcome is rated as highly satisfactory,\n            and sustainability likely. The key lessons are summarized as\n            follows: 1) In implementing a project of the magnitude and\n            complexity of Ertan, implementation will be greatly assisted\n            if an implementing organization is in place at the outset of\n            the project; 2) Prior to the start of construction,\n            construction management personnel should be trained in\n            contract administration and modern project management\n            techniques; 3) Improved communication among various parties\n            should be actively pursued from the outset, to avoid\n            misunderstandings that could cause delays and/or losses to\n            the project; 4) Development of project management systems\n            should also commence before construction in order to manage\n            the construction more efficiently; and 5) in the future,\n            consideration should also be given to reducing interfacing\n            by procuring equipment in smaller numbers of larger packages."}, "docdt": "1997-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
