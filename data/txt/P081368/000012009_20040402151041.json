          sustainable income increase, access to basic socio-economic\n            services, and improved natural resource management\n            practices. The project would achieve its objective through\n            capacity building, and investments in economic, social and\n            environmental sub-projects, implemented by these\n            communities. The capacity building component, reflects the\n            fact that the long-lasting impact of community investments\n            critically depends on: a) the organizational and managerial\n            capacities of villagecommunities to design, and implement\n            effective development plans; and, b) the technical capacity\n            of providers of services to these communities. To this end,\n            four subcomponents will support capacity building:\n            consulting services to design, and implement investment\n            planning, and, training assistance in organization and\n            management capacity building of rural municipalities;\n            capacity building of agricultural services; and, capacity\n            building rural micro-enterprises. The second component\n            supports development of investment funds, through Village\n            Investment Funds, and Rural Communal Road Funds, focused on\n            improving socioeconomic conditions. A third component,\n            project management, monitoring and evaluation, shall provide\n            management, administrative, and financial support during\n            project implementation, as well as monitoring of performance\n            indicators, and reporting requirements."}, "docdt": "2004-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
