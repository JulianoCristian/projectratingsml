SUMMARY
This memorandum seeks your approval for a first extension of the original closing date of
the above mentioned credit by 12 months, to December 31, 2011 and reallocation of
credit proceeds, to support the achievement of the Project Development Objectives. The
objective of the Project is to improve living conditions in selected village communities in
the Borrower's territory through: (a) capacity building and (b) investments in economic,
social and environmental activities carried out by these communities.

PROJECT STATUS
The Project is on track to achieving the Project Development Objective. The pace of
implementation of activities under the various components of the project was affected by
the 14 months non processing of Mauritania withdrawal applications by IDA following
the August 2008 military coup. Despite this difficulty, the project implementation has
been satisfactory. Overall, the performance ratings of the project have been satisfactory
in terms of achieving Development Objectives (DOs) and Implementation Progress (IP).
As of June 30, 2010, the project has disbursed US$ 40,508,785.67about 90,02 percent of
the original amount of credit approved by the Board.

As of March 31, 2010, of all targeted 856 village associations were built up, and their
community's development plans validated, all municipal development plans for the 10
targeted rural municipalities validated, 2003 micro-projects financed and implemented
by the village communities, and 21 feeder roads' infrastructures works complete for 2
communes out of the 10.

The implementing entities are compliant with the Bank's financial management
requirements; and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial reports from
these entities. The Mai 2010 supervision mission made a positive assessment of the
financial management of the Project.



PROPOSED CHANGES
· Financing
The purpose of the proposed reallocation is to adjust some of the categories in order to
meet the Government's ongoing and planned commitments by focusing on priority
actions (please refer to the plan attached) to essentially better cover increasing cost of
civil works and grants associated respectively with (i) the construction of feeders roads;
and (ii) the implementation of village communities development plan. The objectives
pursued through activities under various Categories will be fully achieved with new
reallocation. The total amount being reallocated is SDR 1,263,000 equivalent. It comes

                                            4
from the Categories 2 (works), 5b (Grant Part B2), 7 (refunding of Project Preparation
Advance).and 8 (Unallocated).

The Recipient requests a reallocation of this amount for: i) Category 1 (Civil works) to
complete the rehabilitation of the Research center of Rindiaw and the PIU headquarter, ii)
Category IV (Training and workshop) to ensure adequate financing for the training of
project staff and the Association de developpe ment Communautaire (ADC) further to
finalize the implementation of the Local Development Plans and to complete the
strengthening of ADC operational capacity; iii) Category V-a (Grants Part B1) to provide
additional funds to Subprojects Grant to ensure funding of subprojects of ADC coming
from the Local Development Plans, iv) Category V-c (Grant Part B3) to finalize the
construction of feeder Roads, Category VI (Operating Costs) to ensure close monitoring
and supervision of the activities at the local level with the involvement of project
decentralized implementation units as well as local authorities.

The new allocations of the amount of the Credit to each Category of expenditures, and
the percentage of expenditures for items to be financed in each Category are shown in the
table below.

Closing date

The extension is required to allow the country to complete all project activities. This will
in particular provide the time and resources to (i) complete construction works for the
feeder roads; (ii) allow time for technical support for at least one year to the last village
communities benefitting from funding to implement their development plans. The
extension will also allow the Recipient to make up for the time lost due to 2008-2009
political turmoil in Mauritania.

In the first supervision mission after the restoration of normal operational engagement in
December 2009, the Recipient reaffirmed its commitment to the project's objectives and
its willingness to continue the implementation of activities under the project. From our
assessments, the objectives of the project will be achievable in a satisfactory manner. In
order to achieve these objectives, the Recipient and the Bank agreed on the need to
extend the project for one year to help finalize the feeder roads infrastructures
component to increase the achieving of the project's Development Objectives.

Please note that the detailed work plan for the one year period of extension is attached to
this memorandum (as required by OP/BP 13.30: Extension of the Closing Date), the
procurement plan for 2010 and the reallocation of resource for the undisbursed amount.
A review of these documents suggests that the activities could be completed by the
requested extension date, thereby ensuring achievement of PDO by December 31, 2011.
