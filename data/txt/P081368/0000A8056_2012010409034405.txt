                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the project has been satisfactory. To date, the project has disbursed 100 percent of the credit amount. The implementation of the Investment Funds for sub-
                         projects activities has been completed and the funds were appropriately utilized. The performance of this component is satisfactory. A total of 2521 Communities Micro-projects out of
                         3000 targeted (84 percent) have been completed, in addition, 55 civil works to unclock the feeder roads have been rehabilitated. Furthermore, the capacity building component
                         reached 90 percent of the targeted objectives in the field of training of Community Development Associations (CDA), municipalities, agricultural services and Rural Micro Enterprises.
                         Overall, the project has contributed positively to the improvement of the living conditions of 428.000 poor people (against 350.000 targeted).

                         The newly introduced livestock activity is very successful and has proven to be appropriated 5052 beneficiaries (of which 2445 women).

                         The CBRD provided a platform for the Government to respond to the communities needs in the targeted zones. The dynamic created with this project could be catalytic for the local
                         Development and decentralization project under preparation.

                         The dissemination of all studies conducted is already completed. The preparation of borrower's ICR will start soon and will be completed at the end of January. The plan for the
                         preparation of the Bank's ICR (which is expected to be submitted by the June 2012) is in place
