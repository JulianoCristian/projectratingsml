(a) development of 7,060 ha of swamp land by drainage or\n            control of water levels for growing one crop of rice, and\n            1,850 ha of swamp land by irrigation to grow two crops per\n            year; (b) erection and operation of eight rice mills and\n            associated facilities for paddy purchase, transport,\n            parboiling and storage; (c) rehabilitation of 186 km of\n            existing feeder roads and construction of 117 km of new\n            feeder roads; (d) provision of seasonal credit for farm\n            inputs and hired farm labor to project farmers; (e)\n            provision of extension and support services, including farm\n            service centers; (f) provision of training facilities,\n            including farmer and specialist training in irrigation and\n            rice agronomy; and (g) monitoring and evaluation of the\n            project's economic and social impact and studies for\n            further expansion of swamp rice development in the two\n            states. Principal expenditures would be for land development\n            (21 percent), project management, agricultural extension\n            services and credit services (17 percent), rice milling and\n            marketing (13 percent), road improvement (9 percent), and\n            farm inputs, specialist services, training, etc. (9 percent)."}, "docdt": "1974-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
