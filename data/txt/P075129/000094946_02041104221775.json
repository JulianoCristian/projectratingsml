resume a productive\n            social, and economic life, by reallocating resources from\n            defense towards poverty reduction. The objectives include:\n            1) demobilization of an estimated 45,000 ex-combatants from\n            the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA), and members of armed\n            groups, while supporting their transition to civilian life;\n            2) supporting the reinsertion of ex-Forces Armees Rwandaises\n            (FAR); 3) supporting the social and economic reintegration\n            of all ex-combatants to be demobilized in stage II, and all\n            stage I ex-combatants who remain socio-economically\n            vulnerable; and, 4) facilitating the reallocation of\n            Government expenditure form defense, to social and economic\n            sectors. The project includes a quick disbursing mechanism\n            that uses a positive list of imports, to generate\n            counterpart funds to finance a rapid Program implementation.\n            Nonetheless, the resumption of hostilities is the major\n            external risk, while program specific risks are linked to\n            weak implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "2002-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
