Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This Project Update is based on an implementation support mission during Jan. 19-20, 2015, a review meeting on March 4, 2015, and subsequent
 discussions to get a snapshot of project implementation following the Bank's suspension of disbursement on March 11, 2015. The project completed the
 civil works in Al-Maftash and Al-Haraziya/Al-Arous, while the works in Medinat Al-Noor are 97.5% complete. Given the lack of funds due to exchange
 rate fluctuations and the Bank's disbursement suspension, however, the PMU informed the Bank that the remaining pavement works around the
 hospital in Medinat Al-Noor can no longer be completed by the project and would need to be finalized by the Taiz Local Government. Current
 disbursement stands at 91.36% which might increase once all pending requests for direct payment to third parties for works completed, goods
 delivered, services provided by March 11, 2015 are processed by the Bank. Despite the Bank's close monitoring, the PCU has not yet resolve the
 pending compensation of a project affected individual for the loss of his lease of Waqf land in Al Harazia, leading the Bank to communicate with
 Government and remind the PCU that the PCU is responsible for resolving this safeguards issue even after the project closing date of March 31, 2015.

         Comments
         The PCU informed the Bank only during the March 4, 2015 review meeting, that this indicator target had been reduced from 19,500 to
         18,500 beneficiaries, without specifying the date of this change nor providing any related documentation. The rational provided was
         that water for some residents in the three Taiz informal settlements is being provided by the local authority, instead of by the project.
