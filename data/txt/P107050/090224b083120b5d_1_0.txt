1.1   Context at Appraisal

Country Context
1.      The Integrated Urban Development Project (IUDP) was approved on May 25, 2010. The
Grant Agreement was signed on June 28, 2010, and became effective on August 18, 2010. The
IUDP was a successful operation in several respects, which succeeded in delivering results in the
very fragile and capacity-constrained context that characterizes Yemen. The appraisal context
and rationale for World Bank involvement is presented in the following section. The ICR seeks
to apply objective and uniform evaluation criteria to assess project outcomes, while recognizing
the comparatively positive accomplishments of IUDP, given the extremely challenging and
unpredictable implementation conditions in Yemen’s fragility context.

2.     At appraisal, Yemen had a population of 22.4 million, of which 6.7 million livingd in
urban areas. The urban population growth rate was about 4.8 percent per annum which was the
highest in the MENA Region and one of the highest in the world. The annual rate of urbanization
exceeded 7 percent for the capital city of Sana’a. Nearly 75 percent of all urban poor were
concentrated in the cities of Sana’a and Aden (respectively with 1,800,000 and 600,000
inhabitants) followed by Taiz, Hodeidah, and Mukalla (respectively with 540,000, 450,000, and
200,000 inhabitants). Land use and planning, as well as delivery of public services, faced severe
challenges in the wake of rapid population increase.

Sector Context
3.      In Yemen, close to 1.7 million people lived in slum-like conditions in urban areas in 1990,
increasing to close to 3 million people in 2001. The growth rate of the slum population
consistently mirrored the growth of the urban population, with the cities of Taiz, Hodeidah,
Sana’a and Aden most affected by the rapid growth of urban slum populations, and the cities of
Hodeidah, Taiz and Mukalla witnessing particularly extreme urban poverty. For instance, 70
percent of the total residential built up area of Taiz is informal, where most of the informal
settlements have expanded onto mountain slopes, exposing respective households to higher risks
of being affected by landslides and flooding.

4.      Informal urban settlements in Yemen are characterized by poor access to basic
infrastructure and services, such as water supply and sewerage, garbage collection and street
lighting; environmental degradation; lack of economic and educational opportunities; poor health
care; and lack of security of land tenure. Utility services in some of the most urbanized
Governorates reached less than 60 percent of total households and below 40 percent in Taiz.
Affordable housing came under pressure with the influx of new migrants which led to informal
squatter settlements both within the open areas in Taiz city and in the outskirts, often located on
marginal land and without access to basic urban services. The key reasons why poor areas were
underserviced in Taiz were: (i) the inability of the city to anticipate urban growth resulted in
unplanned development in peri-urban areas which were mostly inhabited by poor people in
marginal lands who had no basic services; (ii) in developed areas closer to the city center, poor
people lived in marginal lands, especially in flood paths and on steep slopes where it is often
logistically difficult to provide basic services; (iii) interventions in low-income neighborhoods in
urban areas had little or none sectoral coordination between line ministries and public programs

                                                 1
such as the Social Fund for Development (SFD) or the Public Works Project (PWP); and (iv)
service delivery followed a top-down approach and very few Government entities adopted
participatory approaches for ensuring/improving public service delivery. Some of the
consequences of lack of basic services included deterioration in health conditions and quality of
life, negative economic impacts due to loss of productivity, higher costs of healthcare, a poorly
trained workforce, and perpetuation of a vicious cycle of poverty.

5.      The 2010 Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified Taiz city, among Yemeni cities,
as meeting the conditions to pilot an approach for integrated urban development as: (i) nearly a
quarter of the population lived below the poverty line; (ii) 60 percent of the residential built-up
area was in informal areas (highest among any city in Yemen); (iii) Taiz had been relatively
stable and was not too affected by conflict; (iv) there was strong support and commitment from
the local council and the governor; (v) a year-long strong dialogue engagement with beneficiary
communities; and (vi) the private sector was committed to resolving social issues.

6.      At the time of project preparation, urban upgrading in Yemen was in its infancy without a
national policy for informal settlements, and the Government had paid little attention to this issue.
All interventions undertaken by local or national governments were informal and ad-hoc without
integrated planning. To develop a national upgrading policy, it was critical to demonstrate the
benefits of an integrated approach to urban upgrading at the local level in Yemen’s context.

Rationale for World Bank Involvement
7.      The project’s development objectives at appraisal were wholly consistent with and in
support of the overall Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Yemen (FY2010-13), and
specifically the aims of four overarching goals: (i) to accelerate economic growth through private
sector-led diversification; (ii) to enhance governance; (iii) to improve living conditions and
social indicators; and (iv) to manage natural resource scarcity and natural risks. Project activities
supported the third and fourth goals of the CAS through the improvement of living conditions of
the urban poor and population at risk from natural hazards, as key priorities of the Government
of Yemen (GoY). This support was also aligned with the Government’s Development Plan for
Poverty Reduction (DPPR) which provides a prioritized framework for actions focusing on: (i)
poverty alleviation; (ii) protection of the environment; and (iii) provision of basic services.

1.2   Original project development objectives (PDOs) and key indicators

8.       The original Project development objectives (PDOs) were to: (i) improve access to basic
services in select informal settlements in urban areas in Taiz; and (ii) to strengthen the dialogue
on a national framework for urban upgrading. The project had four key indicators, where the
first three measured the first element of the PDO, and the fourth indicator measured the second
element of the PDO:

  (i) number of people in targeted areas with access to “improved sanitation”;
  (ii) number of people in targeted areas with access to “improved water supply”;
  (iii) number of people in targeted areas with access to all season roads within a 500 meter
        range; and
  (iv) assessment of investment needs for urban upgrading at a national level.

1.3    Revised PDOs, key indicators, and justifications (2nd Restructuring, April 2014)

9.      Despite the first restructuring (Level II) 28 months after project effectiveness, the
project’s implementation pace remained inadequate to ensure that project activities would be
completed satisfactorily by the planned closing date of September 30, 2015; the PDO, IP and
Safeguards continued to be rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. Yemen’s 2011 crisis was a
substantial factor in the project’s implementation delay. Specifically, the political instability,
security challenges, and uncertain operating environment at that time caused IDA to suspend
disbursements between July 2011 and January 2012. Furthermore, as the overall prices for local
goods, works and services increased, the original sub-project bids for goods, works, and services,
which had been completed before the crisis, had to be cancelled and retendered, as the winning
bidders refused to sign contracts based on their original, pre-crisis bid prices. In addition, there
was a lack of proactivity by the Taiz-based PMU to speed up project implementation by the
project’s planned closing date.

10.     Therefore, the GoY, through its communication dated February 23, 2014, requested the
Bank for a further reduction in the project scope and cancellation of the related grant amounts
under Component 1 and Component 2. Accordingly, the following revisions were effected to
reflect the revised agreements for IUDP through the second, Level I project restructuring,
approved on April 18, 2014:

      a) Project PDO was modified as – “to improve access to basic services in informal
         settlements in three urban areas in Taiz”.
      b) PDO Result Indicator – “Assessment of investment needs for urban upgrading at the
         national level” – was deleted as the related activity was dropped from the project.
      c) Scope of the Project: Simplified and reduced scope of the project to focus on the
         completion of ongoing upgrading works in three urban areas of Al-Maftash, Al-
         Haraziya/Al-Arous and Medinat Al-Noor, in Taiz only.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

11.      The main project beneficiaries were primarily to be the population (25,000)1 in the three
informal settlements of Al-Maftash, Medinat Al-Noor, and Al-Harzariya in Taiz, who were
expected at appraisal to benefit from the delivery of a basic municipal service infrastructure in
their settlements. About 47 percent of the beneficiaries were women whose burden of daily water
collection was to be reduced, and whose health improved due to in-house sanitation and disposal
facilities. Furthermore, about 21,000 people and businesses were to benefit from improved
transportation access to and within these settlements, which would substantially increase
respective trade and transport connectivity within these areas and within the city of Taiz.
However, the ICR team could not measure the spin-off benefits as an impact assessment and/or
an ICR mission could not be carried out due to the ensuing conflict in Yemen2.

  Since early 2011 to date, Yemen has been undergoing a transitional period. The country’s political and security
situation has been fragile and volatile, rendering the operational environment very challenging, as witnessed by the
2011 crisis, the 2012-2014 Transition Period with the National Dialogue Conference, and the subsequent conflict
that started in March 2015 and continues to date.

1.5   Original components (as approved on April 22, 2010)

12.     The project consists of three components: (1) development of public infrastructure in
selected urban settlements in the Taiz municipal area, including road and pedestrian ways, water,
drainage and sewage systems, and street lighting; (2) institutional strengthening and capacity
building to improve governance and implementation capacities in Taiz and develop a national
framework on urban development; and (3) Project Management. The total project cost, including
contingencies, was estimated at US$22 million equivalent at appraisal (see Annex 2 for
component objectives and outputs by grant closure).

13.     Component 1: Infrastructure in Taiz (US$18 million). This component, relating to the
first PDO aspect, was to finance provision of goods, works, and consultant services for
upgrading of public infrastructure in selected settlements in Taiz, including road and pedestrian
ways, water, drainage and sewage systems, and street lighting. The initially selected settlements
were: (i) Al-Maftash, (ii) Medinat Al-Noor and (iii) Al-Haraziya and Al-Arous, where multi-
sectoral packages of basic infrastructure and service improvements were to combine the
upgrading of roads and pedestrian footpaths; extension and improvements to water supply and
sewerage networks (including provision of household connections within public right-of-way for
unconnected households, representing 20 percent of the population); connections to existing
sewerage systems and provision of septic tanks for unconnected households (comprising about
60 percent of households); street lighting; storm water drainage; and solid waste collection
containers. The investments in water and sewerage were expected to be close to 31 percent of the
total component cost.

14.     Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity-Building (US$2.7 million). This
Component, relating to the second PDO aspect, was approved to finance the procurement of
goods, training and consultant services to: (i) strengthen the dialogue on a national framework
for urban upgrading including through the identification of an appropriate line ministry for urban
upgrading, strengthening the knowledge base on informal settlements, the establishment of
guidelines for identifying areas in need of upgrading, and the development of a short and
medium-term plan for investment planning, implementation of an awareness-raising campaign
and capacity-building; and (ii) to build up the Taiz Government’s capacity to carry out urban
upgrading, including establishment of and support for a core Geography Information System
(GIS) unit in the Governor’s office, the development of a public land inventory and information
technology systems, and provision of goods to Taiz Governorate to operate the Accounting
Financial Management Information System (AFMIS).

15.    Component 3: Project Management (US$1.3 million.) This component was approved to
finance the provision of goods, training, consultant services, and the incremental operating costs
of the PIU to support project coordination, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and
management.

1.6   Revised components

16.     The components were formally revised twice, (with the approval of the Level II
restructuring on December 27, 2012, and Level I restructuring on April 18, 2014). The first
component revisions were in connection with the approval of the first restructuring in 2012,

                                                4
when a decline in overall project costs was identified, and the second restructuring in 2014 where
the rehabilitation of the GIS unit building was dropped.

Component 1: Infrastructure in Taiz (US$13.8 million)
17.     The restructuring on December 2012 included a partial grant cancellation (from US$15
million to US$11.15 million) as financing needs had declined. The second restructuring in April
2014 dropped: (i) the rehabilitation of the GIS building due to lack of progress; and (ii) the social
expertise for the ongoing infrastructure investments which was considered no longer relevant,
but increasing allocations to civil works and supervision (increasing overall component costs to
US$13.08 million). The component continued to relate to the first PDO aspect.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity-Building (US$2.5 million)
18.    The December 2012 restructuring included the cancellation of support proposed for the
General Authority for Land, Survey and Urban Planning (GALSUP) for the State Land
Management Pilot in Taiz, reducing costs to US$1.9 million. The April 2014 restructuring
included cancellation of the non-performing activities of: (i) elaboration and support of a
National Framework for Upgrading; and (ii) provision of equipment for the Accounting-Based
Financial Management Information System in Taiz Governorate, reducing the component cost to
US$0.4 million. This component related to the second PDO aspect that was dropped in April
2014.

Component 3: Project Management (US$1.3 million)
19.     The December 2012 restructuring reallocated project funds to accommodate the higher
costs of administering a restructured project (from US$1.3 million to US$2.5 million).The April
2014 restructuring reduced project management costs to US$0.7 million as the PMU was
substantially reduced.

1.7   Other significant changes

20.     Effects of internal strife. Six months after project effectiveness, Yemen started its
transitional period which still continues and the precarious security situation in the country
substantially hampered project implementation. Specifically, in February 2011, widespread
popular demonstrations erupted in Yemen 3 demanding better governance, greater voice, and
improved economic opportunities. Based on an agreement brokered by the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) and overseen by the United Nations and major stakeholders in November 2011, a
transitional government – the Government of National Reconciliation (GNR) - was formed and
confirmed by the Parliament in early December 2011. On February 21, 2012, President Abd
Rabbuh Mansur Hadi was elected as interim president to implement the GCC-initiated Transition
Roadmap, which was supposed to be completed by February 2014, but is still ongoing. While the
National Dialogue Conference was completed in January 2014, a full consensus on power-
sharing arrangements could not be achieved. Political tensions prevented the finalization of a
new constitution, the reform of the military and security establishments, and the preparation for
parliamentary, legislative and presidential elections. Starting in September 2014, the Houthis - a

3
  Popular demonstrations in Tunisia started in December 2010 and had a ripple effect on the entire MNA region,
leading to protests in early 2011 in Egypt, Yemen, Syria and other countries of the region. This also shifted the
Bank’s focus to responding to the new emerging crisis and to new agendas of governance, voice, marginalized
groups, including youth.

Zaidi Shia insurgent group with a power base in Yemen’s far north - forcibly occupied the
capital Sana’a and several other areas of the country. In January 2015, the GNR resigned. Due to
the instable security situation, the Bank imposed travel restrictions and formally closed its
Country Office in the capital Sana’a in February 2015. In March 2015, the power struggle
between Houthi forces and those loyal to President Hadi further escalated amid deepening
political tensions and increased violence. In late March 2015, a coalition of ten countries led by
Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign across Yemen which is ongoing to date. Bank staff
remaining in Sana’a were relocated within Yemen or evacuated to Cairo, Egypt. President Hadi
and members of his government remain in exile in Saudi Arabia, and as of September 1, 2015,
efforts to negotiate a ceasefire have proven unsuccessful.

21.     Two Suspensions of Disbursement and a challenging operating environment. The
project was implemented under extremely difficult circumstances. Specifically, throughout
project implementation, the precarious security situation led to recurrent travel restrictions and
mission cancellations, and two disbursement suspensions - the first between July 2011 and
January 2012, and the second on March 11, 2015, which is still in effect. Additionally, several
fuel crises, with lack of supply and high costs, frequently obstructed implementation. These
unforeseen circumstances resulted in a frequent stop-and-go for project implementation and thus
severely hampered the project’s ability to maintain momentum. Given the above, project
achievements, its 99.42 percent disbursement rate, and its robust Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) and Net-Present Value (NPV) are considered as accomplishments.

22.     First Restructuring – Level II. The project underwent two restructurings. The significant
implementation delays - caused by the 2011 Yemen crisis, IDA disbursement suspensions, as
well as poor PIU project management and poor Bank implementation support - were considered
inadequate for delivering the project satisfactorily by the planned closing date. The PDO and IP
were continuously rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. Specifically, in December 2012, 28
months after project effectiveness, disbursements stood at 6.68 percent, which necessitated a
restructuring (Level II). This dropped a key Component 2 activity, i.e., strengthening the Taiz
Government’s capacity for carrying out urban upgrading to be implemented by the General
Authority for Land, Survey and Urban Planning (GALSUP). The Results Framework (RF) was
updated during the restructuring in line with the definition of IDA core indicators and added a
new PDO indicator: “direct project beneficiaries (number), of which female (percentage)”. Three
intermediate outcome indicators were dropped under Component 1: “number of new septic
tanks” and “number of new street lights”, which the restructuring paper justifies as “unrelated to
any project activities”; “number of implementation communications and public awareness
activities” was dropped as this was considered part of ongoing supervision; and under
Component 3: “progress reports on project implementation” and “number of annual training
courses received by project management unit staff” were dropped as these were considered part
of regular supervision. Indicator targets were also adjusted. In addition, implementation
arrangements were changed to address the PIU’s lack of implementation proactivity, i.e., the
Project Director’s position in the Taiz-based PIU was changed to a Project Manager in a PMU,
and a new Project Director was designated for all ongoing urban sector projects4 at the Sana’a-

based Project Coordination Unit (PCU) 5 under the Ministry of Public Works and Highways.
Finally, to reflect the reduced scope, an amount of US$4.12 million equivalent was cancelled
from the original IDA grant (US$22 million equivalent).

23.     Second Restructuring – Level I. In late March 2014, 43 months after project
effectiveness, disbursements stood at 32.74 percent of the restructured grant. Hence, a Level I
restructuring was effected to: further reduce the project scope by cancelling non-performing
activities and related allocations, change to the PDO (see section 1.3) as well as implementation
arrangements. The following activities were dropped: under Component 1, rehabilitation of the
GIS building and social expertise for the ongoing infrastructure investments; and under
Component 2, the development of a National Framework for Urban Upgrading, and support for
AFMIS for the Taiz Governorate. The Taiz-based PMU was integrated into the Sana’a-based
PCU, the Taiz project office was closed, and Taiz project staff was reduced to only a Safeguards
Specialist and an assistant, then hosted at the Taiz Governorate. The remaining PMU staff was
made responsible for timely completion of the three ongoing civil works contracts, with the
support of the consultant contracted for works supervision. The restructuring cancelled US$3.70
million equivalent, thus reducing the project amount to US$14.18 million equivalent. In view of
the reduced project scope, the project closing date was revised from September 30, 2015, to
March 31, 2015.

2.     Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes

2.1    Project preparation, design, and quality at entry (QAE)

24.     Project grounding. The project built on the outcomes of implemented investments and
technical assistance, including the local government capacity-building component – from the
Taiz Municipal Development and Flood Protection Project (TMDFPP). It also built on the
priorities to improve service delivery emerging from the Sana’a City Development Strategy
(CDS) for sustainable development. In addition, IUDP was designed to complement efforts of
other donor-financed projects such as the IDA-funded Sana’a Basin Water Management Project
and the Social Fund for Development, the Solid Waste Management Project of the Gesellschaft
für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), and the UNCDF/ UNDP-supported Decentralization and
Local Development Support Program.

25.     Bank engagement. The Bank was well placed to assist the Government in implementing
the new decentralization strategy, being already involved in other decentralization activities. The
PAD presented an analysis of the likely implementation challenges and built on lessons learned
regarding the importance of ensuring the sustainability of upgraded interventions, monitoring
and evaluation, as well as scaling-up and upgrading intervention. The PAD was also clear on the
insufficient capacity and poor condition of infrastructure as a limiting local development factor.

26.    Link to Bank and Government Strategies. The project’s development objectives at
appraisal were wholly consistent with, and in support of, the overall Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Yemen (FY 2010-13), specifically the aims of four overarching goals: (i) accelerate

5
  The PCU managed both, IUDP (P107050) and the Taiz Municipal Development and Flood Protection Project
(P070092).

                                                  7
economic growth through private sector-led diversification; (ii) enhance governance; (iii)
improve living conditions and social indicators and; and (iv) manage natural resource scarcity
and natural risks. Project activities supported the third and fourth goals of the CAS through the
improvement of living conditions of the urban poor and populations at risk from natural hazards,
as key GoY priorities. This support was also broadly aligned with the Government’s
Development Plan for Poverty Reduction (DPPR) which provides a prioritized action framework
for: (i) poverty alleviation; and (ii) protection of the environment, and provision of basic public
services. Given the reduced scope of the project through two restructurings, the project
implemented the CAS program priorities of: (i) improvement of living conditions and social
indicators; and (ii) protection of the environment, and provision of basic public services (in the
three identified informal urban settlements).

27.      Project Design. The project design was grounded in a low capacity country context. The
design focused on the requirements in the cities of Taiz and Sana’a and to support institutional
strengthening of systems for improved governance and public service provision. The project’s
institutional set-up was based on an analysis of existing structures and lessons learned from
failures of prevailing planning and implementation practices. As part of its strategy to deepen the
broad decentralization process down to the local bodies, the project focused on empowering
existing Governorates and local councils, making them increasingly accountable, with necessary
checks and balances. The project design introduced the devolution of substantial management
and financial powers to these local administrative institutions as part of its efforts to support
Yemen’s decentralization efforts. During the latter part of preparation, the project dropped these
efforts in Sana’a, since preparation was significantly behind schedule. Sana’a, Yemen’s largest
urban agglomeration with a unique municipal status, appeared to require differentiated stand-
alone interventions and already benefited from substantial support from other donors. Taiz, on
the other hand, was seen to have the required institutional capacity to manage the project, had the
commitment of the local council, and had a relatively stable security situation. Despite the
security situation, project preparation and design did not take adequate account of fragility.

28.     Technical preparation aspects. The investment portion of the project (Component 1) was
generally well designed and based on technical studies; however, the detailed engineering civil
works designs for the three project sites were not ready at appraisal. Similarly, the Component 2
implementation mechanism was not ready at appraisal, as the inter-ministerial advisory
committee - to provide policy guidance for the dialogue on the national urban upgrading
framework - was to be created only during implementation by the project’s line ministry, the
Ministry of Public Works and Highways MoPWH. While the initial institutional design to
establish a separate PIU in Taiz for project implementation was appropriate, it was weak due to
suboptimal skills to implement all aspects of the project, particularly under Component 2, where
project documentation does not identify a dedicated PIU staff or consultant. The Bank carried
out due diligence on potential adverse impacts of the project, including on safeguard aspects,
through field verifications. An Environmental and Social Monitoring Plan (ESMP) as well as a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were prepared as part of project preparation. The
environmental studies concluded that the anticipated impacts were minor and temporary as
associated with construction dust and noise, and temporary obstruction of traffic. An RPF was
prepared with the provision that a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) or Abbreviated RAP (ARAP)
would be prepared in case of any land acquisition and/or resettlement, and if compensation
would be aquired under the project.

                                                8
29.     Project Costing. While cost estimates at appraisal in a fragile country like Yemen are
likely to change during implementation, it appears nevertheless that project costs were
overestimated. The initial budget envelope remained the same after the project scope was
reduced from two cities to one city during the later stages of project preparation. A Bank review6
during preparation highlighted the large per capita costs, which the team justified as based on
detailed engineering designs – which, however, had not been finalized at that point. There are
also inconsistencies in the project documentation of project costing - within the PAD (main text,
costing annex, and economic analysis)7, and between the PAD and other documents, including
the restructuring papers. Costs of the three civil works contracts at project completion were
significantly below the appraisal estimates (even after taking account of exchange rate
variations).

30.     Quality at Entry. The ICR rates the quality at entry as moderately unsatisfactory, due to
shortcomings in the project design. Although Yemen had been recognized as a fragile country
during project preparation8, the PAD fails to mention the fragility of the operating environment
as a main constraint and/or risk and to develop appropriate mitigation measures. Instead, the
project was designed in the context of low capacity, but not of fragility. This had substantial
implications on project implementation. Further, project costing was imprecise, and
inconsistently documented. The engineering designs of civil works for the three project sites
were not ready at appraisal, and the mechanism for the dialogue on the national urban upgrading
framework was not finalized at appraisal. This significantly affected project readiness, and
contributed to the project’s substantial implementation and disbursement delays. Despite
developing a risk identification worksheet, the project had not developed adequate measures to
mitigate the risk of implementation delays.

2.2     Implementation

31.     Delayed Start-up. Despite initial efforts and resources mobilized to ensure project
readiness, it soon became clear that some project sub-components would be delayed, as the PIU
needed to complete the detailed engineering designs for sub-projects in the three informal
settlements. This, however, was delayed due to the Yemen crisis in February 2011 (six months
after project effectiveness, which could not be foreseen). While bidding for works, goods, and
services was completed before the crisis, the review and particularly the clearance of the bid
evaluation reports (BERs) took time9. The IDA disbursement suspension (July 2011 to January
2012) further compounded delays, e.g., the Bank could not provide clearances during the six-
month suspension period.

32.    Impact of Disbursement Suspensions. As the Yemen portfolio was subjected to two IDA
disbursement suspensions, project implementation and management was substantially affected.

6
  Documentation of the Appraisal Decision Meeting (February 23, 2010) is not filed in the Bank’s record system,
but was available in respective Bank e-mail exchanges.
7
  The PAD text refers to Component 1 costs as US$18 million and US$17 million; Annex 5 indicates US$15
million; and the economic analysis estimated costs at US$17 million.
8
  For instance, the April 2009 finalized Yemen CAS (2010-2013) highlights the country’s fragility.
9
  Bids were advertised for all three sites on January 1, 2011; bids were opened on February 11, 2011, and initial
BERs were submitted to the Bank in March 2011. However, the PIU did not consider Bank comments, and thus
needed to resubmit the revised BERs to the Bank for clearance. This occurred only in September 2012.

                                                       9
In 2011, the Bank withheld withdrawal applications several weeks before the official
disbursement suspension on July 28, 2011, thus extending the de facto suspension beyond the
official six months. During the suspension, the Bank was unable to provide clearances, and
without replenishment of the project’s designated account (DA), the PIU had to carefully manage
its finite DA funds to ensure that its resources (financial, human, physical) remain intact for
implementation resumption after the end of the suspension. When the suspension was lifted in
January 2012, the project faced an additional 10-12 month implementation delay and incurred
costs, e.g., as the original sub-project bids for goods, works, and services before the crisis had to
be cancelled and retendered, as the winning bidders refused to sign contracts based on their
original, pre-crisis bid prices. According to the PCU, the suspension delayed implementation for
close to 18 months. In the case of the 2015 suspension, the Bank temporarily halted the
processing of withdrawal applications already in late January 2015 – well before the official
disbursement suspension on March 11, 2015.

33.     Disbursement delays. In June 2012, 22 months after project effectiveness and five
months after the suspension was lifted, the disbursement rate remained at five percent and
commitments were less than one percent. Project implementation remained affected by the
lingering political, security, and economic effects of the unpredictable 2011 Yemen crisis, and
the IDA clearance delays caused by the disbursement suspension. Bidders for works in Al-
Maftash and Al-Haraziya raised complaints, and the lowest bidder refused to sign the Medinat
Al-Noor works contract at the pre-crisis bid price due to the overall post-crisis price increases of
local goods, works and services. Hence, all three bids had to be cancelled and needed to be
retendered, thus further delaying implementation. The revised BERs for the three sites, dated
September 2012, were cleared by the Bank on September 26, 2012, i.e., two years after project
effectiveness.

34.     Slow implementation. In December 2012, the PIU awarded civil works contracts for the
three project areas, giving ample time for completion by the project closing date. However,
contracts for construction supervision were only awarded in June 2013, while contract awards
and extensions for delivery of goods continued until late February 2015. The implementation
pace of the awarded contracts was slow, primarily due to the lingering Yemen crisis, as well as
pending procurement under Component 1 and Component 2 activities. The Bank’s
implementation support was suboptimal at one mission per year, instead of one mission every six
months10. In addition, the need to coordinate project implementation and safeguard compliance
appeared to have overwhelmed the Taiz local authorities. Due to the reduction of PMU staff in
Taiz, the opportunity for building closer relations with beneficiary communities through
participatory processes was missed in the later part of project implementation. Implementation of
Component 2 activities did not progress, due in part to Yemen’s unstable political and security
situation.

35.     Weak Procurement. Throughout implementation, procurement remained relatively weak.
After the Mid-Term Review, however, agreed Action plans and work programs were generally
implemented and followed through within the agreed timeframe. In hindsight, the Bank could
have taken a more hands-on supervision approach by: (i) providing guidance to improve control
10
   As no aide-memoires are documented, it is presumed that no Bank supervision missions took place between
project appraisal in March 2010 and September/October 2011; and between May/June 2012 and May/June 2013 and
November 2014.

                                                    10
over project-related procurement functions; (ii) addressing specific constraints on implementing
safeguard actions; and (iii) providing additional training.

36.      Mid-Term Review (MTR). The MTR, originally scheduled for August 2012 (24 months
after effectiveness), was carried out in November 2014. The MTR revealed that poor project
performance could not be attributed solely to Yemen’s political crisis, delayed preparation of
sub-projects and/or procurement issues. Implementation delays were also due to poor project
management/procurement decisions, frequent changes of Bank Task Team Leaders (TTLs), and
infrequent Bank supervision missions. Given the project’s implementation delays and progress, it
would have been useful to conduct a detailed MTR either as planned in August 2012, or before
the first project restructuring (December 2012), or at least before the second restructuring (April
2014), with restructuring as an MTR outcome. Post MTR, project management, monitoring and
implementation improved substantially, as evidenced from efficient IDA clearances of
procurement, effective monitoring and reporting, appreciation by the Borrower and the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU), as well as increased disbursements (from US$8.6 million equivalent in
November 2014 to US$13.18 million equivalent by project end).

37.      Third Party Monitoring (TPM). In 2014, the Bank engaged a TPM firm to conduct a
one-time on-site inspection of project activities and to report progress based on information on
the ground, as Yemen’s unstable security situation prevented Bank staff from traveling outside of
the capital Sana’a. Although the 2014 TPM report highlighted some inadequacies by contractors
regarding implementation of civil works, the report was limited to figures and data from visual
site inspections documented in excel sheets. The TPM report did not include information on
contract packages, analysis of the quality of executed civil works, compliance with Bank
safeguards, and/or recommendations for improvements. It is unfortunate that the Bank did not
include these as requirements for the TPM firm to report on alongside the TPM site visits. The
2013 ISRs state that no TPM visits were conducted as the civil works in the three sites had just
started.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Design
38.     The PAD results framework had a relatively clear statement of the PDO element related
to in-situ urban upgrading, with three PDO indicators and six intermediary outcome indicators
expected to measure progress. The PDO element of strengthening the dialogue on a national
urban upgrading framework, however, was less clearly defined. The PDO indicator focused only
on the delivery of an assessment of investment needs for national-level upgrading; however, no
further specification is provided regarding the assessment quality or follow-up actions to
strengthen the national upgrading dialogue. Similarly, the associated intermediary outcome
indicators focused on reports on the current upgrading situation and on land inventory in Taiz,
without specifying report quality and/or follow-up. While data collection responsibilities were
clearly established, the M&E design could have included more substantive impact evaluations.

Implementation
39.   The project was slow to collect data, indicators were not monitored diligently and/or
measured stringently. For instance, indicator progress was only reported in the April 2014
Implementation and Status and Results Report (ISR) – 15 months after the first restructuring, 43

                                                11
months after project effectiveness, and one year before project closure. Although it was not
mandatory at the time to integrate all PAD-determined intermediate outcome indicators into the
Bank’s ISR, six indicators11 were not reported on internally. While these indicators are included
in mission aide-memoires, the ICR team could not determine whether progress was monitored by
the client and/or achieved, as the two aide-memoires (prior to the first restructuring) do not show
indicator progress, and a client ICR is not available 12 . Additionally, data on the qualitative
benefits of project investments is absent, limiting the post-MTR progress reports to
implementation aspects regarding procurement, financial management, and safeguards
compliance.

Utilization
40.     In light of the above shortcomings, the project used data provided by the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) to track outputs. Progress towards achievement of the PDO was
analyzed and rated based on general considerations rather than stringent analysis of whether
indicators and targets were adequate and were likely to be achieved. Although the PCU used the
procurement plan actively to keep track of implementation progress and follow up with
contractors, progress reporting did not focus on the status of the indicators. The Bank and the
client could have used the M&E framework more proactively to identify the project’s
implementation delays earlier and put remedial actions in place.

2.4     Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards Compliance

41.    The IUDP was classified as a Category “B” project and triggered Operational Policy 4.01
on Environmental Assessment and Operational Policy 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. Given
the uncertain land tenure and weak land management issues in Yemen and because some of the
subcomponents could only be fully finalized after completion of the detailed engineering designs,
a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared, with the provision that a Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP) or Abbreviated RAP (ARAP) would be prepared during implementation (on
the basis of the RPF) in case any land acquisition, resettlement and/or compensation were
required under the project. All required safeguards instruments were developed and disclosed
before approval. During implementation, overall safeguards compliance was predominantly rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

42.    The Bank monitored compliance with environmental safeguards regularly and considered
environmental compliance as adequate. The sub-projects largely addressed environment
safeguards as agreed with the Bank, and were in line with the prepared safeguards documents.
The quality of monitoring reports could have been improved by reporting on site-specific
impacts, i.e., specific impacts and measures taken to mitigate negative impacts. TPM reports, as

11
   These include: number of new street lights; number of implemented communication and public awareness
activities; report on the current situation of informal settlements and need for urban upgrading in Yemen; report of
state land inventory in Taiz; progress reports on project implementation; and number of annual training received by
project management unit staff.
12
   During the MTR, the PCU and Bank agreed that the PCU would submit the Client ICR to the Bank by project
closure. However, due to the resignation of GoY on January 22, 2915, and the ongoing military operation, the PCU
informed the Bank that it would not be able to prepare a client ICR.

                                                        12
well as on-site monitoring reports, revealed non-compliance with worker safety standards in
some construction sites and lack of personal protection equipment (PPEs). Post MTR, the Bank
stepped up supervision of compliance with respect to worker safety measures, as well as
adequate and regular on-site monitoring and reporting. However, physical verification of
compliance could not be carried out due to restrictions on travel outside of Sana’a. Therefore, no
safeguard compliance report was submitted to the Bank at the close of the project.

43.    During implementation, the project had taken land from 10 individuals/families for road
widening (starting in May 2013) without preparing an ARAP. The PIU only informed the Bank
about this in December 2014 after all related works and activities had already been completed.
The Bank then required the PCU to prepare a Land Acquisition Review Report with details of all
issues, including all land acquired, affected persons, compensation and respective
documentation 13 . The Bank received the report in January 2014. The report, as well as the
documents, were considered adequate and required no further action. The report has
subsequently been disclosed in-country and at the Infoshop.

Fiduciary Compliance
44.    Procurement. Procurement under the project has been carried out in accordance with the
World Bank “Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated May 2004,
revised October 2006 and January 2011, and “Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers” dated May 2004, revised October 2006 and January
2011, and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement. Each contract financed by the
IDA Grant, the different procurement and consultant selections methods, estimated costs,
procurement requirements, and time-frame are documented in the Project Procurement Plan,
which was updated as required to reflect the project implementation needs.

45.     Slow procurement processing by the PCU and response from the Bank to requests for “no
objection”, especially during the later stages of project implementation, contributed to project
implementation delays. Moreover, the project faced daunting challenges due to institutional
changes and capacity weaknesses, delays in preparation and tendering of civil works, goods and
services. In hindsight, some procurement issues (such as procurement of goods and non-
consulting services) could have been solved earlier by a more proactive and hands-on approach
from the Bank and the implementing agency. After the MTR, the project maintained good
performance overall in terms of transparency and accountability. Procurement compliance was
predominantly rated Moderately Satisfactory.

46.    Financial management. Financial Management (FM) was adequate. The PCU maintained
adequate staffing in the FM department and established adequate internal control procedures
based on the FM manual. The PCU prepared monthly bank reconciliation statements and
maintained a fixed assets register with the required data. The PCU used an automated accounting
system to prepare the Financial Statements to be audited and submitted to the Bank annually.
Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were generated from the system quarterly and were reviewed
by the project’s external auditor. The Bank received and found the IFRs to be acceptable. The


13
   The PCU provided the Bank task team with relevant documents, including voluntary land donation documents
signed by affected people, and signed compensation payments indicating that all affected people/families were
informed of their rights and entitlements.

                                                     13
PCU contracted “Fadhl Sabri” as an external auditor for FY2014. External audit reports for
FY2013, FY2014 and FY2015 (Q1-Q2) were submitted on time. The auditor rendered
unqualified (clean) opinions.. Throughout implementation, FM compliance was continuously
rated Satisfactory.

2.5   Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

47.     According to the PCU, all infrastructure financed by the project was completed prior to
project closure. The Taiz Local Authorities are expected to take responsibility for providing
improved water supply and sanitation - including operation and maintenance - and to maintain all
season roads within a 500 meter range, as provided by the project. However, the ongoing
military conflict in Yemen has led to the closure of local government offices. At this point, it is
unclear whether project infrastructure investments have been affected by the conflict; it is also
unclear whether and when the Taiz Local Authorities can assume responsibility for the post-
completion operation of project investments. The ongoing Damage and Needs Assessment
(DNA), which aims to provide a preliminary estimate of damages on critical infrastructure,
physical assets and service delivery as well as to identify the resulting reconstruction needs,
could help clarify these issues.

48.     The Bank considered conducting an impact assessment at grant closure to assess the
success of the intervention. However, this could not be done due to the ongoing conflict in
Yemen. The project exit procedures were negatively affected due to the Bank’s current
disbursement suspension – from March 11, 2015 to date - that led to an abrupt informal closure
of the project before the official closing of March 31, 2015. However, the PCU had closed all
project activities, and the Bank processed all outstanding payments to eligible third parties.

3.    Assessment of Outcomes
Overall rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.1   Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

49.    Relevance of Objective is rated High.

Objectives Rating Pre-Level 1 restructuring
50.     Access to improved basic services in Taiz. The 2012 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
2013-2014, which is the latest available, specifically highlights the need to address Yemen’s
vulnerability on informal housing, given that half of Yemen’s housing stock in major cities is
informal. The ISN highlights improvement of basic infrastructure by expanding investments and
strengthening management as an ISN outcome. Enhancing governance and local service delivery
form Pillar 3 of the ISN. The project rightly focused on streamlining participatory and equitable
development in urban areas through enhancing the capacities of existing institutions, integrating
feedback of beneficiary communities into project design, and through providing sustainable
public services to vulnerable groups in Taiz. Investment priorities were determined through a
participatory approach with communities in the three selected informal settlements identifying
their respective priorities. A multi-sectoral package of basic infrastructure and service
improvements was to be included in each settlement, thus combining: upgrading of roads and
pedestrian footpaths; extension and improvements to water supply and sewerage networks,

                                                14
including provision of household connections within public right-of-way for unconnected
households; connections to existing sewerage systems and provision of septic tanks for
unconnected households; street lighting; storm water drainage; and solid waste collection
containers. This part of the PDO remains highly relevant.

51.     Institutional strengthening and Government capacity-building for urban upgrading. ISN
Pillar 3 identifies the need for capacity-building and institutional strengthening, and presents the
public's general dissatisfaction with poor service delivery, including at the local level, as a
driving force in the 2011 uprising. It further highlights that the Bank will help restore trust and
confidence between the state and its citizens by facilitating an inclusive dialogue and
strengthening mechanisms for service delivery. However, it is unclear whether a national
dialogue framework for urban upgrading was a priority for the Bank and the Government as the
respective strategies do not allude to this. This part of the PDO has modest relevance.

Objective Rating Post-Level 1 restructuring
52.    As the second PDO element was dropped through the Level 1 restructuring, the current
PDO (i.e. the first PDO element of the original PDO) remains highly relevant, for reasons
mentioned above. As the current conflict has increased rates of poverty and internally displaced
people, it is likely that the need to provide access to basic services in informal settlements will
remain high in future as well. When the Bank does fully reengage, in situ reconstruction could
form a large part of the support for infrastructure devastated by the conflict.

53.    Relevance of Design and Implementation is rated Modest.

Rating Pre-Level 1 restructuring
54.      The overall relevance of the project as designed and implemented before restructuring is
rated Modest. Based on available information, inclusion of Component 1 activities for in-situ
upgrading was relevant to contribute to the thematic areas of the first PDO, and these activities
fit well to achieve the PDO. Component 1 activities were also appropriate to the local context, as
local beneficiary consultations helped identify activities to respond to local in-situ upgrading
priorities. The overall technical design of infrastructure was sound; however, detailed
engineering designs of civil works in the three project sites were only finalized and approved
during implementation. The results framework was adequate to track progress towards the first
element of the PDO (via three adequate indicators), but the Bank did not document the results
framework properly in the ISRs.

55.     Component 2 activities were relevant to contribute to the thematic areas of the second
PDO, but the associated indicators in the results framework were insufficient in number and
quality. Additional indicators would have been required to promote and track progress on
strengthening the dialogue on a national framework for urban upgrading. The inclusion of a
policy component, that required inter-governmental cooperation in Yemen’s fragile country
context and to be implemented by a PIU with an infrastructure background, was ambitious. The
ISN highlighted the need to enhance understanding of decentralization issues in Yemen; hence,
the project could have done more during the design phase to understand the local political
economy, and could have provided more implementation support for furthering a national slum
upgrading dialogue. A Bank-executed political economy study of upgrading was planned to be
conducted during implementation, but was never finalized - initial delays stemmed from the

                                                15
2011 Yemen crisis and the first IDA disbursement suspension, while Yemen’s continuously
unstable security situation prevented necessary stakeholder consultations on the draft report, and
the Bank dropped the study in 2013.

Rating Post-Level 1 restructuring
56.    The relevance of the project as designed and implemented after restructuring is
substantial. After the second element of the PDO and the associated Component 2 activities were
cancelled, the simplified project was able to focus on implementing the three ongoing civil
works and the associated supervision contracts for in-situ upgrading in Taiz. The reduced project
scope fit well with the continuously fragile country context, and the revised results framework
was adequate to track progress in achieving the PDO.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

57. Efficacy is rated Modest.

Pre-Level 1 Restructuring
58.     The original project, before the Level 1 restructuring, disbursed US$5.96 million and
carries a weight of 45 percent (US$5.96 million of the US$13.25 million disbursed). The
efficacy of the project’s original two PDOs is rated as Low, as there were significant
shortcomings in the achievements of the PDO before restructuring; while there was disbursement
progress on infrastructure investments, there was no progress on Component 2 activities relating
to the second element of the PDO. PDO indicators discussed in mission aide-memoires, but are
not documented in Bank ISRs prior to the Level 1 restructuring (in April 2014).

Post-Level 1 Restructuring
59.    After the Level 1 restructuring, the project disbursed US$7.29 million and carried a
weight of 55 percent (US$7.29 million of the US$13.25 million disbursed). The efficacy of the
project after restructuring is rated as Substantial. As described below, the project improved
access to basic services in select informal settlements in urban areas in Taiz, and, according to
data provided by the PCU, achieved the PDO indicators (see below).

          PDO Indicator 1: The number of people in targeted areas with access to “improved
           sanitation” is 24,400, exceeding the original target of 23,621, and the revised target of
           19,500. Achievement is 125 percent of the revised target.
          PDO Indicator 2: The number of people in targeted areas with access to “improved water
           supply” is 18,500. While this exceeds the original target of 15,600, the revised target of
           19,500 was not fully attained. Achievement is 95 percent of the revised target.
          PDO Indicator 3: The number of people in targeted areas with access to all season roads
           within a 500 meter range is 21,000; this exceeds both the original target of 18,950 and the
           revised target of 19,500. Achievement is 107 percent of the revised target.
          PDO Indicator 4: The number of direct beneficiaries at 25,000 exceeded the expected
           number of 19,500 (of which 47 percent female) and achievement is 128 percent14.



14
     As this indicator was introduced during the first restructuring (Level I), there is no original target.

                                                              16
60.     Despite these impressive achievements, efficacy post-restructuring is only rated
substantial, as project achievements rely entirely on PCU information and cannot be
independently verified at this point. The security situation prevented project site visits by the
TPM firm, as well as a Bank ICR mission; in addition, there is no client ICR. Further, due to lack
of information on the ground, it is unclear whether the project-supported investments have been
affected by the ongoing military conflict. It is also unclear whether and when the Taiz Local
Authorities can assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of project investments.
Hence, the sustainability of project investments is uncertain.

61.     Overall rating of efficacy. Taking into account the efficacy ratings of Low and
Substantial respectively for the Pre-Level 1 Restructuring and the Post-Level 1 Restructuring, the
overall efficacy of the project is rated Modest.

3.3 Efficiency

62. Efficiency is rated Modest.

63.     The efficiency analysis evaluates the economic efficiency and sustainability of
investments of Component 1 of the project, financing the upgrading of public infrastructure in
the three mentioned informal settlements (Madinet Al-Noor, Al-Maftash, and Al-Haraziya/ Al-
Arous). At appraisal, the estimated cost of Component 1, upgrading of the three informal
settlements, was US$17 million (out of the total project cost of US$22 million). The contracted
costs of Component 1 activities was US$13.08 million, which corresponds to 92.24 percent of
the final project costs.

64.    Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net-Present Value (NPV). At project completion, the
ERRs for the three informal settlements vary between 15.68 percent and 37.64 percent, in
contrast with the range between 18.3 percent and 46.5 percent at appraisal. Similarly, the NPV
ranges from about US$1.0 million to US$11.8 million for the three informal settlements, which
is lower than the estimated range at appraisal (US$2.2 million and US$20.3 million). The overall
ERR of 28.51 percent, and the NPV of about US$6.96 million - while somewhat lower than at
appraisal - are nevertheless considerable. However, there are uncertainties regarding the
underlying assumptions, which the ICR team was not able to verify due to the lack of data.

65.     Component 2. Activities under Component 2 (Institutional Strengthening and Capacity-
Building) were progressively dropped due to many administrative constraints, limiting the
client’s capacity to implement these activities. Some equipment was delivered to the Taiz Local
Authorities based on the reduced project scope.

66.     Administrative Efficiency. Project implementation was severely affected by the
deteriorating situation in Yemen, two disbursement suspensions, as well as a travel ban to project
sites for Bank staff. It was difficult for the client, including their contractors, to adhere to the
implementation schedule agreed at appraisal. These problems were further compounded through
a pattern of fractured project management in the PIU and Taiz Local Authorities. Despite the
weak capacity and operational constraints, more efforts could have been made to ensure that
changes to the project were fully recorded, implemented, and monitored. The relocation and
changes in implementation arrangements for the PIU and PCU contributed to weakened and

                                                17
limited on-site supervision of activities due to the civil unrest and lack of personnel in Taiz. This
situation led to reporting delays and implementation issues, thereby affecting project
administration on a daily basis.

67.    Efficiency is rated modest. Activities under Component 1 were largely completed on time
at over 99 percent of the restructured grant, with an acceptable rate of return; however, as
mentioned above, there are uncertainties regarding the underlying assumptions. The efficiency of
implementation of Component 2 is Low.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

68.    Taking into account the ratings for: relevance of objectives (High), the relevance of
design and implementation (Modest), achievement of the PDO (Modest), efficiency (Modest),
and unclear sustainability of outcomes, the project outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching themes, other outcomes, and impacts

 Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development
69.    Poverty impact. The project supported investments for the provision of basic services
(improved water supply, sanitation and local, all-season roads) in: Al-Maftash, where at
appraisal, 83 percent of the population earned less than one US$ per day; Medinat-Al-Noor,
where 66 percent of the population earned less than one US$ per day; and Al-Haraziya where 73
percent of the population earned less than one US$ per day. In all, about 25,000 poor and
vulnerable people benefited from the project.

70.      Gender aspects. An estimated 9,100 persons (an estimated 47 percent of direct project
beneficiaries) are women who have benefited from improved water supply and sanitation
facilities, as well as improved access to hospitals and other public service facilities due to the
improved roads facilitating public transport through the neighborhoods.

71.     Social development. The project has helped empower local communities and improve
their voice and choices, as targeted beneficiaries expressed their demands and needs in the
provision and upgrading roads, water supply, and sanitation facilities. Local communities
participated in the planning and implementation of project activities. The project operationalized
participatory approaches towards project implementation and public service provision.

4.   Assessment of risk to development outcomes
Rating: High

72.     The likelihood of changes detrimental to the project outcome is “high”. Yemen’s ongoing
conflict has likely affected local government capacity (institutional and financial) to operate and
maintain project created assets. Until the situation on the ground improves, it would not be
feasible for the Bank or other donors to provide capacity-building and other support in this

5.   Assessment of Bank and borrower performance

5.1 Bank performance
(a) Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

74.     The Bank helped the GoY and Taiz authorities prepare a relevant project, giving careful
consideration to all thematic areas of intervention and sustainability. The risks were analyzed and
the technical assistance program was developed to mitigate the main risk stemming from
insufficient capacity and the poor condition of infrastructure. As presented in Section 2.1, the
Bank conducted due diligence on safeguard aspects, evaluated efficiency, and contributed to
setting up efficient implementation arrangements. The overall project design was built on a
relatively good analysis of sector needs and the definition of relevant PDOs for each area of
intervention. However, the project design did not take account of the fragile operating
environment. Project costs were overestimated and imprecise, and documented inconsistently. At
appraisal, the engineering designs for civil works were not ready and the inter-ministerial
advisory committee for dialogue on a national urban upgrading framework was not established.
In addition, the project’s original results framework had some weaknesses (see section 2.3).

(b) Quality of supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

75.     Throughout project implementation, the country’s security situation was very unstable
and highly volatile. This led to frequent and unpredictable mission cancellations, and travel bans
outside of the capital, Sana’a. Sana’a-based staff were also frequently advised to work from
home. IDA also initiated two disbursement suspensions, which negatively affected project
implementation well beyond the official suspension periods. Despite this extremely challenging
operating environment, the Bank was able to provide implementation support to the project,
including through locally-based team members and TTLs. It is commendable that the Bank
conducted a reverse mission during the 2011-2012 IDA suspension. The Bank also maintained a
dialogue with the Government and the implementing entity, and conducted due diligence on
fiduciary and safeguard aspects, and monitored risks. Post MTR, the Bank’s proactive support to
the PCU led to improved project performance.

76.     On balance, the quality, frequency, and documentation of the Bank’s implementation
support was less than optimal. Of the 10 ISRs filed, five were based on desk reviews, as only
five supervision missions were conducted during the project’s implementation period of four and
half years. Two of these five missions took place during the project’s last five months of
implementation. There was also an unexplained 17-month gap between the June 2013 and
November 2014 missions – while conditions for local supervision remained unpredictable,
supervision could have been conducted through reverse missions. More attention to candor and
quality of reporting in the ISRs could have highlighted the issues that hampered the achievement
of the PDOs within the planned project period. The MTR should have been conducted as
originally planned, which would have helped to identify the reasons for poor project performance,
distinguishing between factors related to the unforeseeable 2011 Yemen crisis (thus beyond
project control), and factors within project control requiring remedial action. The Bank could



                                                19
also have conducted procurement post-reviews earlier to identify procurement issues causing
implementation delays, and identify solutions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

77.    In view of the above, overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     The performance of the Government during project preparation and implementation is
rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Government, the Taiz Governorate and the Local Council
were committed to the project despite the crisis, maintained a good dialogue with the Bank,
supported the innovative, integrated urban upgrading approach and effectively adopted the
participatory approaches towards project implementation and public service provision. However,
the Government could have been more proactive in supporting the implementation of
Component 2 activities to achieve the second element of the PDO and avoid non-performance
and cancellation – a missed opportunity for urban upgrading and supporting Yemen’s
decentralization efforts. Additionally, the Government should have ensured compliance with the
agreed social safeguards documents, i.e., the preparation and implementation of the ARAP (see
section 2.4).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

79.     The performance of the implementing agency is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Until
project appraisal, project preparation was on track, including PIU staffing, ToR preparation,
procurement plans, as well as consultations and communication with beneficiary communities
and other stakeholders in Taiz on sub-project priorities and behavioral changes towards
collection of fees and charges for services. However, detailed engineering designs for sub-
projects in the three informal settlements were not ready for approval at project appraisal, thus
contributing to subsequent project implementation and disbursement delays.

80.     The PCU deserves commendation for completing the restructured project activities before
the early closure of the project, despite the conflicts in the country, and IDA suspensions of
disbursement. Project achievements, the 99.42 percent disbursement rate, and the robust ERR
and NPV are the result of the PCU’s commitment in the later stages of implementation. However,
the initial PIU could have been more proactive in supporting project implementation after the
suspension was lifted in 2012. Procurement was affected by delays, and construction supervision
contracts were only awarded six months after the civil works contracts. While the PIU had strong
FM capacity, it was less so on technical and supervision aspects - the PIU could also have been
more proactive in promoting the implementation of Component 2 activities and in using the
M&E system to prepare regular progress reports. Lack of PIU proactivity led to a change in
project management from Taiz to Sana’a under the first restructuring in December 2012, and to a
substantial reduction of project staff under the second restructuring in April 2014. Finally, the

                                               20
PCU failed to prepare the ARAP, obtain clearance from the Bank, and implement the approved
ARAP before initiating the relevant sub-project works.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

81.     With ratings above and below the line (MS and MU), the overall Borrower performance
is rated MU, which is in line with the project’s outcome rating of MU.

6.     Lessons learned

82.    The lessons below are derived from a project in a Fragility, Conflict and Violence (FCV)
context and therefore provide learning for other countries in similar contexts.

83.     Identifying stakeholder incentives through a political economy analysis is essential to
underpinning project design and confirming ownership, especially for policy reforms.
Analyzing stakeholder interests during preparation helps to design a project that fits into the FCV
country circumstances. The analysis would have highlighted Yemen’s fragility, thus helping the
team to design the project with a ‘fragility lens’ rather than with a ‘low capacity’ approach. Such
a lens helps to adequately identify and mitigate constraints and risks regarding project readiness,
implementation, and ownership. Specifically for the policy reform under Component 2, the
analysis would have helped the team to better gauge its appropriateness, feasibility, and
Government ownership.

84.     Mixing infrastructure investments with policy reforms is challenging in an FCV
context but is feasible with strategic planning, clear champions and strong implementation
support. Investment projects focus on bricks and mortar, requiring the skill mix of traditional
engineering, procurement, contract management and sound financial management; an FCV
country context may pose challenges to meeting traditional implementation time schedules.
While policy reforms and institutional strengthening require a different skill set, an FCV context
can open up opportunities to implement reforms – this, however, requires clear champions,
thinking “outside the box”, as well as full ownership and support by both the Client and Bank
teams throughout project preparation and implementation. When the Bank reengages, its support
for infrastructure delivery will remain useful to maintain local services, while its support for
policy reforms could be embedded in an investment program, depending on local conditions and
informed by a political economy analysis. The Bank could also conduct an impact evaluation to
assess project outcomes and impacts on the ground, and draw lessons for Bank operations in a
FCV context.

85.     Restructuring should be considered as a key tool in implementation support rather
than as a last resort. The project’s second PDO element and Component 2 activities were not
progressing due to the internal conflict in Yemen. Active restructuring could have cancelled non-
performing activities earlier, e.g., at the time of the first restructuring – this would have
simplified the project scope, and freed up associated financial and human resources.

86.     Third Party Monitoring (TPM) needs to be conducted systematically, informed by
sector standards and continuous interaction by Task Teams and CMUs. Due to the increasingly

                                                21
challenging country context, the Bank hired a TPM firm in fiscal year 2013 to monitor the
progress of its Yemen portfolio outside of Sana’a on behalf of Bank task teams who were not
allowed to travel due to Yemen’s security situation. The exchange between Task Teams and the
TPM firm would need to be systematic and sustained to ensure that the TPM provide the
necessary information on all aspects of project monitoring and at adequate intervals; hence, the
TPM Terms of Reference (ToR) should require analyses of civil works packages, PDOs,
safeguard compliance, recommendations for improvements, etc. Additionally, efficiencies and
economies of scale across the portfolio should be enhanced by including sector standards in the
TPM ToRs; this will ensure more systematic monitoring and avoid duplication of efforts which
may occur if project specific TORs are exclusively used. Finally, the Bank and TPM firm could
draw on lessons learnt from TPM experiences in other countries.

87.     The challenging operating environment in FVC countries requires continuity and due
diligence on the Bank’s implementation support system. Project implementation can be greatly
assisted through locally based team members and TTLs to allow for continued client dialogue
and follow-up. Project restructurings would need to be closely coordinated between Washington-
based staff and country-based task team members/TTL. Moreover, procedures for task leadership
handover need to be followed diligently to retain institutional memory and to allow for seamless
project management, including monitoring and reporting. Close attention by Bank Management
to implementation delays is essential; however task teams need to follow through on
management guidance.

88.     Adapting the Bank’s operational approach to better fit an FCV context would allow for
more flexibility and facilitate proactivity. Although the project was implemented during a
protracted period of instability and Bank suspensions in a fragile and conflict country, the Bank
used standard mechanisms for implementation support and performance assessment through
traditional procedures. The Bank should consider to adjusting its operational approach to an FCV
context through specific tools that allow for more flexible and proactive project monitoring,
supervision, restructuring, and performance assessment. The task teams could be more
innovative, e.g., conduct project reviews via reverse missions, videoconferences, and/or audio
conferences. Back-up mechanisms could be specified in the Operational Manual to preempt
issues, e.g., by adding provisions to avoid rebidding in cases of large cost increases between
bidding and contract implementation, and establishing back-up arrangements for reporting and
reaching out to beneficiaries.

7.     Comments on issues raised by borrower/implementing agencies/partners

(a) Borrower / implementing agency
89.    The current situation in Yemen precluded sharing the draft ICR with the government. The
Draft ICR was shared with the PCU for comments, who made substantial and laudable efforts to
respond. However, due to the ongoing military conflict in Yemen and the closure of Government
and PCU offices, the PCU informed the Bank that it was neither able to prepare the Client ICR,
nor provide comments on the ICR.

Objectives. The objective of this component was to develop cost-effective and simple approaches
towards the provision of basic services in informal settlements in Taiz. This component also
developed approaches to engage the beneficiary communities and local council through a
consultation process in the planning, design, implementation, and operation and maintenance of
such public infrastructure to ensure sustainability. The component actively engaged TWSLC in
the design and implementation process and for operation and maintenance to ensure
sustainability of water supply and sewerage infrastructure upon completion and commissioning.

Key Achievements

The project has played a crucial role in providing basic infrastructure to three informal
settlements of Al –Maftash, Medinat Al-Noor, and Al Hazariya in Taiz, benefiting over 25,000
people living in these settlements. Although some of the works were dropped when the project
was restructured twice, at least one part of the PDO pertaining to: (i) improving living conditions
and social indicators; and (ii) protection of the environment, and provision of basic public
services was retained. However, despite this achievement, the unstable political and security
situation, and subsequent conflict, impeded the verification of PCU data (through third party
monitoring) the ICR mission and Client ICR.

Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity-Building

The objective of this component was to: (i) at the national level, strengthen the dialogue on a
national framework for urban upgrading; and (ii) at the local level in Taiz, develop
implementation tools for urban upgrading, such as setting up a core Geographic Information

GALSUP for development of state land inventory in Taiz, and the launching of a financial
management information system in Taiz Governorate.

Status. Subcomponent allocations were progressively reduced due to non-initiation of activities
under these subcomponents, except for procurement and installation of the GIS equipment.
Allocations were either reallocated to activities under Component 1 and/or included for
cancellation, as considered appropriate during the restructuring of the project. The scope of this
component was significantly reduced and all subcomponents were dropped during the 2nd
restructuring and re-scoping of the project, leaving only one activity left for implementation
post-restructuring: to procure and establish GIS equipment in the Taiz Governorate. Due to
delays in procurement and equipment supply, deliveries have been partially carried out and the
installation was not completed. Subsequently, the PMU applied to the suppliers’ bank to cash out
the Bank Guarantee against an advance. However, it was close to the project closing date that the
conflict escalated.

Regarding strengthening the dialogue on a national framework for urban upgrading – this
activity was dropped during the Level 1 Restructuring due to a lack of implementation progress
under the project. Secondly, the growing civil unrest in Yemen severely hindered public
consultations which are critical inputs, however, in the development of a national upgrading
framework which is meant to be based on participatory processes.

Component 3: Project Management

The objective of this subcomponent is to: This component will support the PMU based in Taiz in
the overall management of IUDP implementation.

Status: Changes under the project severely affected the PMU staff. After the first restructuring,
the Project Director of the original PIU was reassigned as Project Manager of the Taiz-PMU,
reported to the new Project Director of Sana’a-based PCU in MPWH, and was relocated to
Sana’a along with the procurement and financial management specialists after the second
restructuring. These three staff were in place throughout the life of the project, from start-up
through closing, which was very useful in terms of information and continuity, especially during
the Mid-Term Review. The PCU team should be congratulated for accelerating their efforts to
complete works under Component 1 before project closing, once additional support from the
Bank team was provided. However, the PCU did not fully execute the IEC-related activities,
dissemination of information on project performance and progress among all stakeholders for
monitoring project implementation, empowering them to work in partnership with the project
beneficiaries, and submission of regular monitoring and progress reports. This was primarily due
to Yemen’s security and conflict issues, thus limiting Bank supervision missions, delaying
procurement decisions, and interrupting reviews and decisions by the PCU. Thus, the activities
executed under this component – although completed satisfactorily – were largely limited to the
following: (i) financing of the incremental and operating costs and salaries of PMU/ PIU/ PCU
staff to support project management; (ii) consultancy contracts for construction and supervision
of civil works; and (iii) appointment of an auditor to review the accounts.

                               Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Background: The economic analysis focused on Component 1, which represented the largest
proportion of the project’s total investments as described in the PAD. At appraisal, the total
amount of Component 1 represented 77.3 percent of total project investments. However, during
Project restructuring in April 2014, the total investments under Component 1 were adjusted
according to the actual cost of contracted amounts. Moreover, considering that smaller
investments were dropped, Component 1 ultimately represented the totality of IUDP’s total
investment. This component financed the upgrading of public infrastructure in three informal
settlements selected by the City Council of Taiz, namely: (i) Medinet Al-Noor; (ii) Al-Maftash;
and (iii) Al-Haraziya and Al-Arous. The specific interventions responded directly to the
communities’ expressed needs and priorities. They included, among others, the provision and
upgrading of urban infrastructure such as roads, street lighting, footpaths, drainage, sewer
network, water supply and sanitation facilities, connections to the electricity network, schools,
playgrounds/open spaces, and solid waste collection facilities.

Methodology: The methodology used to quantify project benefits in the three settlements was
based on upgrading the appreciation of land market values. Other specific and direct benefits that
may have been reflected in the appreciation of land values are detailed below under “Alternatives
Considered for the Quantification of Benefits”. The net increase in land values was expected to
reflect part of the benefits from the provision of basic local economic infrastructure, including
water and sanitation, which were expected to yield significant health benefits. This methodology
compared the “with” and “without” project scenarios to compute the net economic benefits over
time, in line with the methodological approach used at appraisal.

Investment Costs: At appraisal, the total estimated cost to upgrade the three informal
settlements under Component 1 was US$17 million17, out of a total estimated project cost of
US$22 million. However, the project’s investment costs for urban upgrading was actually
US$13.08 million. Table 1 below illustrates the cost calculation for each informal settlement,
based on the total contracted amount and the relative weights of each operation compared to the
original estimated total amount.

   Considering the inconsistencies in the PAD regarding the final estimated cost for this component, the original
figure of US$17,000 provided for the economic analysis is used in this annex only to calculate the relative weights
of the investments per settlement, and not to indicate the final estimated cost for this Component. The corresponding
percentage of investments per settlement were then applied to the actually contracted amount (US$13,080) to
determine the absolute amount of investment per settlement -- as illustrated in Table 1 of this Annex.

                                                        26
Operation and Maintenance Costs (O&M): At appraisal, operation and maintenance costs
(O&M) were estimated between 12 and 17 percent of the total investment cost. The upper range
was revised to 16 percent during this analysis. Further, in order to convert the financial cost to an
economic cost, the standard conversion factor of 0.94 was applied.

Alternatives Considered for the Quantification of Benefits: Typical benefit indicators were
considered during appraisal to assess alternative options to measure expected net economic
benefits of the proposed urban upgrading. Indicators of expected benefits included the following:
(i) Increase in productivity and efficiency per beneficiary due to daily time-savings arising from
improved transportation; (ii) increase in household services cost efficiency due to lower costs,
primarily of water and electricity (regarding the benefits associated with the new water
connections, it should be noted that savings from the expected reduction of water purchases from
private vendors will not be significant because water rationing continues, which forces
households to rely on private vendors to make up for the significant daily interruptions in this
service; hence, this indicator was not deemed adequate); (iii) increase in health benefits (not
falling ill and associated costs) due to improvements in the provision of water and sanitation; (iv)
increase in local economic activities that generate local employment; and (v) appreciation of land
values which generally capture and thereby reflect the improvements in the neighborhood’s
physical infrastructure and household services. The applicability and actual relevance of each of
the above indicators was examined at appraisal and it was concluded that the appreciation of
land market values would be most adequate. It was argued that land market values capture in a
more comprehensive manner multiple benefits, in contrast with what one indicator could achieve
alone, particularly considering the rather broad nature of the benefits in urban upgrading.

For the purposes of this ICR, the same net benefit indicator adopted at appraisal was applied for
the economic analysis of the ICR. Moreover, given that the same methodology was used, the
results of these two economic analyses can be directly compared.

The analysis of relative weights for the proposed investments at appraisal indicated that most of
them are for roads, streets, street lightening, drainage and sewers. Typically, these investments
would benefit the unit price of land. Thus, it can be argued that a comprehensive indicator of
these benefits is the appreciation of market land values in the affected areas.

Given the above, it was concluded that expected project benefits measured in terms of their
impact on the appreciation of land values would be represent a viable and relevant indicator of
accrued benefits on the residents in the project area.

Benefits: In order to estimate the benefits, as reflected in the appreciation of land values due to
upgraded informal settlements, the following factors should be taken into account: (i) number of
land parcels/lots within each settlement (in the respective project area) which have benefited,
directly or indirectly, from the various upgrading works; (ii) the average size of the lots; (c) the
average market price of the square meters (sqm) of land at appraisal (i.e., scenario “without”
project); and (iv) the expected market price of the sqm after upgrading and thereby after
appreciation (i.e., scenario “with” project). However, as a result of Yemen’s civil war, the client
could not provide the required data; therefore, the unit market price of the sqm of land in the
respective project areas after project completion remains unknown. This economic analysis
relies on a realistic and conservative assumption on the expected change in land market values in

                                                 27
the project areas. It has been assumed that land market values have risen in about 25 percent less
than anticipated at appraisal. Equivalently, it is assumed that the unit prices for land have not
increased as much and as fast as expected, due to the effects of the wars on the overall economy.
In general, Yemen’s overall economic activity has decreased due most recently to the 2015 civil
war, generating high rates of unemployment. It has been reported (by several sources including
the World Bank) that GDP since FY2010 has still been growing at an annual average rate of
about 4.2 percent.

Results of the Cost Benefit Analysis: The ERR and the NPV have been calculated applying a
10 percent discount rate, which is estimated to be a proxy of Yemen’s opportunity cost of capital.
The economic evaluation of each informal settlement is based on the expected net flow of costs
and benefits. Costs include O&M “with” and “without” the project and benefits are measured in
terms of the expected incremental change in the market values of land that will occur due to the
economic effects attributable to the investments in local infrastructure. The ICR yields lower
results, compared to those estimated at appraisal, but are still strong for each settlement as
follows. The economic rates of return (ERRs) vary between 15.68 percent and 37.64 percent, in
contrast to those at appraisal which fluctuated between 18.3 percent and 46.5percent. Similarly,
their Net Present Value (NPV) ranges from about US$1.0 million to US$11.8 million, which are
lower values than those estimated at appraisal and which varied between US$2.2 million and
US$20.3 million. The settlements’ average ERR is 28.51 percent, and the average NPV is about
US$6.96 million.

Results of the Sensitivity Analysis: Given these relatively high ERRs, not unusual for informal
settlements, a sensitivity analysis is not considered essential. However, an additional scenario of
a 25 percent lower increase in net benefits was performed because of the difficulty of verifying
benefit data on the ground, with the probability that benefits could be even lower. The results
indicate that the average ERR, under this rather unlikely scenario, would still be economically
acceptable (22.19 percent), considering that it is higher than the opportunity cost of capital
(which is about 10 percent). Nevertheless, the ERR of upgrading Al-Maftash, under this scenario,
comes down to barely 10.66 percent, while the average NPV is US$4.2 million and still a strong
indicator of the economic merits of these types of investments. Given the robust results, the
investments in the three informal settlements are deemed economically sound. The specific
results for each settlements, illustrating the strong economic merits of these investments, are
summarized below.

Financial Analysis: As determined at appraisal, several institutions play a role in the operations
and maintenance activities of new infrastructure. These entities include the local government
regarding road and street maintenance, and the utility companies for water supply, sewerage
systems, drainage, waste management, and electricity. However, the role of these institutions is
relatively marginal and the project’s financial and fiscal impacts are foreseen as neutral.
Specifically, there is a fairly marginal incremental cost in operations and maintenance (O&M)
for the above institutions, but there is also a small incremental revenue from the new service
subscribers, as well as from landowner contributions. In practice, as empirical evidence has
consistently shown in similar projects, these two small financial impacts are expected to balance
each other out, leaving practically no significant net financial impact on either, the revenue or the
expenditure side of the institutions’ operating budgets. Therefore, as compared with the situation
at appraisal and the severe limitations on the ground to collect required information for this in
particular, no financial analysis of these entities was undertaken at the ICR stage. The project’s
strong economic viability has been solely assessed by the results of this economic analysis.
