Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project has been under implementation since August 18, 2010. The project was confronted with inordinate implementation delays primarily due to
 (a) the crisis in Yemen in 2011 which lead to suspension of IDA disbursements between July 2011 and January 2012; (b) the overall price increase of
 local goods, works and services after the crisis, and the need to retender civil works due to complaints of the bidders for two major rehabilitation works
 in Al-Maftash and Al-Haraziya, in addition to the refusal of the lowest bidder to sign the contract for works at Medinat Al Noor with the pre-crisis bid
 price, (c) a change in implementation arrangements to integrate project management into the Sana’a based Project Coordination Unit (PCU)[1] with only
 a Social Safeguards Specialist and an assistant remaining in Taiz, hosted by the Governorate; (d) lack of proper onsite supervision from the client; (e)
 change in the project closing date from September 30, 2015 to March 31, 2015- in line with the project’s reduced scope and revised implementation
 schedule; and (f) delays from the Bank due to changes in task leadership (four Task Team Leaders within a span of 4 years of the project execution
 period) and delayed issuance of No Objections.
 This lead to the reduction of the original IDA Grant of US$ 22 million (SDR 14.5 million equivalent) to US$ 17.88 million (SDR 9.40 million equivalent) in
 December 2012 and to US$ 14.18 million (SDR 17.01 million equivalent) in April 2014. The overall implementation of the reduced scope is progressing
 albeit at a slower pace than required. As of the mission’s date, project disbursement reached USD 8.6 million which represents 62.5% of the allocated
 grant amount of USD 13.8 million. Project accounts have been regularly audited, using an automated accounting system, and reported as per the
 requirements of the Bank. The Bank received all pervious IFRs and found them acceptable. The Project Management Unit (PMU) has been able to
 maintain active Designated Account through submitting regular Withdrawal Applications. Although the project does not face any notable environmental
 challenges, full compliance with the Bank's Safeguards policies are required, including the urgent need for the project to follow-up on the pending
 compensation of families for land taking for road widening.
