                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite the restructuring in December 2012 and the cancellation of US$4.12 million from the original IDA grant of US$ 22 million equivalent, the implementation pace has not been
                         adequate to ensure that the Project would be satisfactorily completed by the planned closing date. As a result, the Government requested a further restructuring which was approved
                         by the Board on April 18, 2014. The restructuring included:
                         •        A revision of the PDO. The new Project's Development Objective (PDO) is to improve access to basic services in informal settlements in three urban areas in Taiz.
                         •        A cancellation of an amount of US$3.70 million, which had been allocated for (i) Component 2, i.e. the development of a National Framework for Urban Upgrading, and the
                         support for Accounting-based Financial Management Information (AFMIS) in Taiz, and (ii) Component 1, i.e. the rehabilitation of the Geography Information System (GIS) building,

                         • A significant reduction of the field-based Project Management Units (PMU) in Taiz. The PMU will be limited to the Safeguards Specialist with an assistant. It will be hosted by the
                         Taiz Governorate, and will be responsible for on time completion of the three ongoing works contracts in Taiz, with the support of the consultant contracted for works supervision.
                         •         An advancement of the closing date to March 31, 2015.

                         After this second restructuring and with the close follow up of the ongoing activities by the PMU and the World Bank Country Office, the project implementation status is changing
                         quickly in the right direction.
