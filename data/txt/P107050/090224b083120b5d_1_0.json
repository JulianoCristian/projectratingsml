unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            high, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: identifying stakeholder incentives\n            through a political economy analysis is essential to\n            underpinning project design and confirming ownership,\n            especially for policy reforms. Mixing infrastructure\n            investments with policy reforms is challenging in a\n            fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV) context but is\n            feasible with strategic planning, clear champions, and\n            strong implementation support. Restructuring should be\n            considered as a key tool in implementation support rather\n            than as a last resort. The challenging operating environment\n            in FVC countries requires continuity and due diligence on\n            the Bank\u2019s implementation support system. Adapting the\n            Bank\u2019s operational approach to better fit an FCV context\n            will allow for more flexibility and facilitate proactivity."}, "docdt": "2015-09-28T23:53:05Z"}
