REPORT ANTD RECONEIlRATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUMIVJ DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIr TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR TIE SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPiENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of $16 -million to help
finance the Second Livestock Development Project which consists of village
livestock development in Northeastern Turkey and livestock fattening opera-
tions in Central Antalya. The credit would be made to the Government on
standard IDA terms and relent to the Agricultural Bank of the Republic of
Turkey (ABT) at 5 percent interest per annum and 14 years maturity including
5 years of grace.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The level of Bank Group operations in Turkey in past years has
been largely influenced by the almost chronic balance of payments diffi-
culties and the heavy external debt-service burden, the limited IDA re-
sources which could be made available to Turlkey and to some extent diffi-
culties in project preparation. In 1960 the Bank and the Turkish author-
ities began discussions to establish a basis for a major increase and
greater continuity in the level of lending.  In the Bank's view, the main
prerequisite for this was the institution of economic policies that would
increase Turkey's capacity to borrow on Bank terms. This meant in particular
improved external debt management, introduction of reforms in the system of
trade and payments, and the provision of more resources and incentives for
export-oriented projects. Another important factor was a significant im-
provement in the Government's capacity to identify and prepare projects.
3.        By the end of 1970, the Government had made substantial progress
in these fields. The goal of achieving external viability within a reason-
able time period, and the promotion of exports as the principal means of
doing so, had been accepted. In August 1970, a stabilization program was
initiated, and the Turldsh lira was devalued.  Parallel with these develop-
ments, the Bank Group stepped up its assistance in project preparation,
notably with advice on project selection criteria and institution-building.
As a result, the volume of Bank/IDA lending reached $114 million in FY 1971,
thus exceeding the level reached in the five preceding years.
4.        Bank Group lending to Turkey aims at assisting the country in three
major tasks: (a) improving the foreign exchange position particularly through
export promotion; (b) institution building and reform in key sectors in-
cluding improved financial viability of the major State Economic Enterprises;
and (c) the achievement of a better balance in rural and urban development.



6.        A summary of Bank Loans, IDA Credits and IFC Investments is
attached as Annex I. The proposed credit would be the second loan for Live-
stock Development in Turkey, following the $4.5 million Intensive Dairy Pro-
duction Credit (236-TU) made in 1971. The execution of projects in Turkey
has been generally satisfactory apart from prolonged delays in making several
recent loans effective (see my report on the Irrigation Rehabilitation and
Completion Project, dated January 6, 1972).
7.        Five Bank and IDA operations are planned for FY 1972. A $18 million
credit for the Irrigation Rehabilitation and Completion Project was approved
by the Executive Directors on January 18, 1972, and a $76 million loan for
the Erdemir Steel Plant Expansion Project on Ivlarch 14, 1972. Negotiations
for the IGSAS urea and ammonia plant project have been substantially com-
pleted, and the proposed loan is expected to be presented to the Executive
Directors in April. The Istanbul urban development and water supply project
has been appraised and is planned for negotiation in the first half of 1972.
8.        IFC has been active in Turkey, haTing participated in industrial
investments for nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass and aluminum. Total commit-
ments so far amount to $29.94 million. IFC is currently investigating various
new investments, including ones in mining, special steel and cement.
9.        The Second Livestock Project was appraised by a Bank mission in
June and July 1971. In the negotiations in Washington from February 14 - 23,
1972, the Borrower was represented by lir. Orhan Ozdural, Deputy Undersecre-
tary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Mr. Ahmet Tufan Gul, Chief Commercial
and Economic Counselor, Mr. Teoman Koprululer, Counselor and Hr. Yoruk,
Financial Attache, the last three of the Turkish Embassy, Washington, D.C.,
and Mr. Erkun, Acting Director General of the General Directorate of Live-
stock Development Projects (hereafter called the Livestock Directorate) of
the Ministry of Agriculture. The ABT was represented by its Secretary General,
Mr. Nesit Parman.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
10.       A report "The Development Prospects of Turkey" (EMA-30a) dated
February 1, 1971, was distributed to the Executive Directors on February 4,
1971. This was updated by a memorandum entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Turkey" (EMA-40a) dated July 19, 1971, which was distributed
on July 26, 1971. The next economic mission is scheduled for April 1972. A
country data sheet is attached as Annex II.
11.       Following the 1969 elections, which confirmed the Justice Party in
power, the Government under Prime Ianister Demirel saw its majority in the
National Assembly gradually eroded. At the same time, violence by groups of
extremist students and unrest among workers were on the rise and persisted
through 1970 into the early months of 1971. In Mlarch 1971, the Armed Forces
intervened, the Government resigned and a new "above-party and reformist"
Government was formed under Prime Minister Erim.



- 4 -
12.       The new Government's program called for the restoration of law
and internal security, more rational management of the economy, and long
overdue wide-ranging sbructuiral reforms. These reforms included land and
educational reform; far-reaching reorganization of the government, including
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) and external trade agencies; nationali-
zation of private enterprise in mining, petroleum and forestry industries;
and stricter enforcement of the conditions for foreign capital investment,
including Turkish majority participation.
13.       In its eight months in office, the Government successfully restored
law and order and, on the economic side, introduced some administrative
changes, raised substantially prices of several SEE products and presented
several reform bills to Parliamenit but was not yet able to translate its
long-range economic policies into detailed measures and decrees. It was
also unable to bring under control the serious fiscal imbalance and the
rapid increase in prices, both' of which were aggravated by the salary rises
introduced as part of the Pez'sonnel Reform Law by the previous Government.
Growing opposition from Parliament and the private sector to some adminis-
trative changes and reform proposals brought about the resignation of a large
group of technocratic ministers in December 1971. A new coalition Govern-
ment, headed again by Prime Niinister Erim, was then formed with a large
number of representativqs of the political parties.
14.       The second Brim Goverrmentts program reLterated the urgency of
making major structural reforms, emphasized the importance of the survival
of democratic procedures in Turkey, and appeared to be conciliatory both in
tone and in the choice of key ministers towards Parliament and the private
sector. In the program and in subsequent public statements, the role of the
private sector was stressed. Since then several administrative features of
the original program of April 1971 affecting the private sector have been
modified and policies affecting domestic and foreign private investors have
been under review.
15.       Economic growth in 1970 was influenced by factors associated with
civil unrest, the growing balance of payments problems, devaluation, and un-
favorable weather affecting the 1969-70 harvest. GNP grew by 5.6 percent at
constant prices, compared with an average of 6.6 percent in the preceding
eight years. Industrial growth slowed down to 3 percent from 10 percent in
1969, and agricultural output rose by only 1 percent. However, the rest of
the economy grew at a rate of 7 percent.
16.       In 1971, economic growth, buoyed by a sharp improvement in the
overall balance of payments position following devaluation, rebounded to a
record rate provisionally estimated at about 9 percent. This performance
reflected a record increase in agricultural output for the 1970-71 crop year
estimated at over 8 percent and a recovery in industrial output, which is
estimated to have increased by about 9 percent.



17.       Other aspects of economic performance in 1971 were less encouraging.
Growth of investment slowed down considerably, with public investment actually
decreasing in real terms, and private investment increasing only moderately.
The decrease in public investment was due to the drop in public savings,
which was largely the result of the high cost of the Personnel Reform Law and
the poor performance of the SEEs. The overall savings ratio increased from
15.1 percent of GNP at constant prices in 1967 to 16.6 percent in 1970 but,
according to preliminary estimates, did not improve further in 1971. Whole-
sale prices increased by more than 20 percent as a result of the combined
pressure of increased wage settlements under the Personnel Reform Law, the
effect of the 66 percent devaluation on import prices, and the substantial
increases in SEEs prices.
18.       Following the devaluation in August 1970, Turkey's current account
deficit declined sharply to roughly $100 million in 1971, compared with $172
million in 1970 and $221 million in 1969. This improvement occurred despite
a widening of the trade deficit in both 1970 and 1971 when steadily rising
exports were outstripped by more rapid increases in imports. The main off-
setting factor was a jump in workers' remittances from $14L million in 1969
to $273 million in 1970 and an estimated $475 million in 1971.
19.       Although private and public capital inflows appear to have de-
clined somewhat in 1971 after a substantial increase in 1970, the growth in
remittances was strong enough to push up the level of official foreign re-
serves to a record $772 million at the end of 1971, a trend which has con-
tinued in early 1972. Turkey's net foreign assets, which were negative in
1968, rose to $411 million by the end of 1971. This relatively high level
of reserves should help Turkey protect its new rate of exchange, cushion
any sudden drop in remittances, which are vulnerable to conditions in Europe,
and possibly support a larger degree of import liberalization. Following the
changes introduced in the relationships among the major world currencies in
December 1971, Turkey established a central rate of 14 Turkish lira to the
US dollar (replacing the previous parity of TL 15 to the dollar).
20.       Provisional estimates for 1971 indicate a significant increase in
the budget deficit over 1970. Although total domestic revenues increased
substantially to an estimated TL 37 billion in 1971, as compared to about
TL 29 billion in 1970, expenditures rose more rapidly to an estimated TL 43
billion from about TL 32 billion in 1970 (mainly due to the increase in
personnel costs). As a result, whereas the deficit in 1970 was virtually
all covered by counterpart financing, in 1971 the estimated deficit necessi-
tated substantial short-term borrowing from the Central Bank.
21.       In summary, the economic situation in 1971 could be regarded as
transitional, showing the first effects of the major adjustments in the ex-
change rate, salaries, and SEE prices, and the clearing of the backlog of
imports. The budget is being severely strained by the heavy cost of the
Personnel Reform Law and faces probable continued pressure from the weak finan-
cial position of some of the SEEs and from the need to step up investment
expenditures. In the private sector too, wage-price inflationary pressures



- 6 -
appear to be substantial. Consequently, measures are needed to contain
aggregate demand whilst at the same time additional resources have to be
mobilized to step up investment in both the public and private sectors.
The new Government's economic program attaches therefore special impor-
tance to the efficient utilization of existing capacity, investment in
quick-yielding projects, and completion of on-going ones. It calls for
a major rise in taxation to finance an increase of 30 percent in the level
of public investment expenditures in 1972 and to do so within a balanced
budget. These measures, which in themselves will test the strength of the
new Government, will need to be supplemented by other actions aimed more
specifically at checking the wage and price increase in both the public and
the private sectors.
22.       For the longer term, if the country remains politically stable
and if the Government can carry out at least a modified reform program in
several essential fields and promote exports and investment, the prospects
for continued growth will be promising. However, to maintain an adequate
rate of investment Turkey will continue to need substantial amounts of ex-
ternal assistance. The main sources of foreign aid to Turkey have so far
been the members of the OECD Consortium. Of total disbursements of official
external assistance estimated at $417 million in 1970, a total of $306 mil-
lion was provided by Consortium members. The United States provided the
largest amount ($78 million); followed by the European Fund ($75 million);
Germany ($41 million); the Bank Group, including IFC ($28 million); the Euro-
pean Investment Bank ($26 million); and France ($22 million). Other countries
provided smaller amounts. In the future, the proportionate share of the Bank
Group' s disbursements will rise significantly since the level of Bank Group
commitments has gone up markedly in the past year whereas there are no indi-
cations of major changes in the level of pledges of other Consortium members.
23.       As a result of successive debt reschedulings and arrangements for
debt relief together with increased remittances, the debt service ratio was
lower than expected in 1971, and is provisionally estimated at about 15 per-
cent of total foreign exchange earnings. In the next five years, with an
anticipated gross inflow of external assistance of about $400 million per
year and gradually hardening terms, the debt service ratio can be expected
to fluctuate around 15 percent provided exports and remittances continue to
grow. Turkey's borrowing capacity will need to be kept under review in the
light of balance of payments developments and the Government should continue
to seek a substantial part of future external aid on concessionary terms.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTCR
24.       A report entitled "Agricultural Policies and Problems" was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on March 10, 1971, as Volume III, Annex I,
of the report "The Development Prospects of Turkey" (EMA-30a), dated Feb-
ruary 1, 1971.
General
25.       Turkey has three distinct agricultural regions: the generally moist
coastal plains, which support diversified crops and are the most pro-



- 7 -
ductive region; the semi-arid Anatolian PI.ateau, which mainly supports
cereals on unirrigated land; and the more isolated and also semi-arid
Eastern highlands, where livestock is predominant. In the more humid
coastal areas as well as in the two drier regions the distribution of rain-
fall is unreliable and sharply affects output on rainfed land (about 22
million ha. versus 1.5 million ha. under irrigation).
26.       Although declining as a share of the economy, agriculture remains
crucial in Turkey. It contributes about 30 percent of GNP, provides 65-70
percent of total employment, supplies much of the raw materials for industry,
and accounts for the bulk of exports earnings (75 percent in 1970, mainly
cotton, tobacco, fruits and nuts). The agricultural sector is also an im-
portant market for domestic manufactures, particularly fertilizer, pesticides,
agricultural machinery, and consumer goods. Cereals, mainly wheat, account
for about 70 percent of the total area cropped and 25 percent of the value of
production. Livestock accounts for 30 percent of production, fruits and vege-
tables, which have expanded significantly in recent years, for 20 percent of
production and industrial crops (mainly cotton, tobacco, sugarbeet and pota-
toes) and oil-seeda for about 15 percent.
27.       In the 1950's agricultural growth averaged about 5 percent per annum,
mainly as a result of the rapid expansion of the area cultivated (especially
wheat).  Prom 1962 to 1970, however, the sector grew at only 2.9 percent per
year, falling short of Plan targets and lagging behind the economy as a wshole,
which grew at 6.6 percent per year. The decline in the agricultural growth
rate during the 1960's occurred as a result of two principal factors. First,
the possibilities of opening nae lands had been virtually exhausted, except in
South-eastern Turkey, where an ambitious project which would open large areas
to irrigation from the Euphrates river, is contemplated. Second, the marketing
abroad of many traditional products (e.g. sugar, tobacco and tea) had beccme
more difficult.  Therefore, further growth has now become dependent largely on
diversification of cropping and the greater use of fertilizer, improved seeds
and irrigation. Nevertheless, weather remains a key short-run factor, and be-
cause of excellent conditions in 1971, there was a record agricultural output.
Wheat consumption requirements should be met and exports of other commodities
increased.
28.       The Governmentts efforts to stimulate increased agricultural pro-
duction have focused primarily on credit and irrigation and on three commodity
subsectors: wheat; fruit and vegetables, and livestock, the latter two for ex-
port as well as domestic markets. Bank Group projects were recently approved
for a Fruit and Vegetable Export Project (257-TU) and an Irrigation and Rehabi-
litation Project (281-TU).
The Livestock Sub-Sector
29.       Livestock are currently estimated to number about 14.5 million cattle,
36 million sheep, and 21 million goats, but production las failed to keep pace
with rapidly-growing demand. Against a projected annual increase of 4.6 per-
cent in consumption during 1967-72, output in 1966 and 1969 expanded only 3.1
percent and 3.5 percent respectively. As a result, prices have risen more
rapidly than general wholesale prices. In addition, exports of live animals,
which have totaled about $15 to 20 million per annum (mainly of sheep to nearby
Middle Eastern countries) have failed to expand despite rising demand and high
prices.



- 8 -
30.       Turkey has a good resource base for livestock development -- a
potential which is being only partially realized. Sluggish performance re-
sults largely from traditional production patterns established when grazing
pressures were much less. Animals are maintained at a low level of nutri-
tion through most of the year because of overgrazing and poor use of supple-
mentary fodder. In addition, the local breeds, although responsive to im-
proved management, have only limited growth potential.
31.       Because of the mixed nature of much of Turkey's agriculture, live-
stock policy and performance are closely related to policies affecting wheat.
During the 1950's in response to rising consumption and imports of wheat,
the Government introduced support programs and other policies which encouraged
its production on lands previously used for grazing and forage. As a result,
wheat production increased at the cost of shortfalls in meat and milk supply.
Current Government policy now favors intensification of both livestock and
wheat production through improved methods and increased mechanization. Greater
use of fertilizers and improved seed should raise the yields of both forage
crops and wheat and reduce the need for fallow. This should permit
a decline in the area under wheat and fallow, particularly in the Northeast
livestock region where most farmers grow wheat for their own use only, and
release land for pasture and fodder crops.
32.       To improve livestock management  and meet rising domestic and
foreign demand, the Government has embarked upon a General Livestock De-
velopment Program, aimed at improvements in breeding, fattening and dairy
production, and the establishment of modern livestock markets and slaughter-
houses. The program seeks in particular to increase production and
offtake from the traditional breeding areas such as the northeast and in-
creased quality and average weight of meat produced from fattened animals.
33.       While in the past, the relative prices of animals, livestock pro-
ducts, feedstuffs, and wheat have tended to favor production of wheat over
feedstuffs, particularly in view of the more assured markets for wheat, recent
increases in livestock prices have now begun to stimulate the expansion of
livestock as well as feedstuff production and should encourage farmers to
grow fodder crops.
Agricultural Credit
34.       Almost all institutional credit available to farmers in Turkey is
provided by the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT), a semi-autonomous body,
wholly owned by the Government. ABT finances agricultural, fishery and
forestry production and marketing and allied activities. It has about 750
branches and holds about 25 percent (about $700 million) of all deposits
in the banking system. Assets on December 31, 1971 totaled about TL 18,312
million ($1,300 million). Though profits are not its primary objective,
ABT is administered as a profit-making institution and all profits are rein-
vested.



- 9 -
35.       Eighty percent of ABT's lending is short-term, much of it on
standard terms, writh fixed amounts per ha. according to crop purpose. In 1964,
ABT began a supervised medium- and long-term credit scheme, based on farm
planning and technical guidance and since then has been trying to expand its
medium- and long-term lending. However, with limited resources, particularly
for long-term lending, it cannot meet all of the credit requirements of farmers.
In 1969, ABT created a Project Loans Department and within it an Encouragement
and Development Loan Division, designed to handle projects with foreign financ-
ing and large projects in general in irrigation, livestock, export promotion,
food processing, agricultural chemicals, transportation and storage. In parti-
cular, this Division will administer the financial aspects of the Intensive
Dairy Production Project (236-TU), of the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project
(257-TU and 762-TU) and of the present project.
36.       The Project Loans Department has a staff well trained in banking
practices and an acceptable performance record. However, further improvements
in the organization and supply of agricultural credit are desirable and the
Fruit and Vegetable Export Project accordingly includes financing for a com-
prehensive credit study.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the re-
port entitled "Appraisal of Second Livestock Development Project" (PA-122a)
dated January 14, 1972, which is being distributed separately. A Development
Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
General
38.       The project is essentially an integrated livestock credit program,
comprising two sub-projects: (a) a Village Livestock Development Sub-project
in the Northeast to stimulate increased production of meat and milk; and (b)
a Fattening Sub-project, mainly focused on fattening districts in the Anatolian
Plateau and Coastal Plains. A map showing the project areas is at Annex III.
The Project will also help develop a professional technical services group in
the Livestock Directorate of the I-Iinistry of Agriculture and increased compe-
tence in ABT field offices. The Livestock Directorate would be responsible
for technical direction of the Project and ABT would be the lending channel.
Subloans to participants in the two suo-projects would be approved by ABT on
the basis of development plans approved by the Directorate.
39.       Village Sub-Project.  Under the Village Sub-project, sub-loans would
be extended to about 5,000 individual farmers for investment improvements in-
cluding machinery. In addition, subloans would be made in about 250 villages
to organized groups of farmers, normally cooperatives, organized on the basis
of irrigation, common meadows, purebred livestock raising, and machinery con-
tracting. The number of villages was kept small and concentrated in location
to ensure better initial results from the limited existing technical services
of the Directorate.  The proposed villages were selected following an intensive



- 10 -
joint survey in 1970 by the Livestock Directorate, other offices of the
Ministry of Agriculture, the State Planning Organization and FAO. Factors
taken into account were the attitude of villagers, the importance of livestock,
the ease of supervision, and access. To facilitate supervision the villages
selected are grouped within 11 counties of the north-eastern provinces of
Kars, Erzurum, and Agri, which contain the greatest concentration (about 13
percent) of breeding animals in Turkey.
40.       Project sub-loans made to individual farmers would finance develop-
ment plans aimed at comprehensive improvements in the prevailing mixed agri-
culture. In most instances, new or better practices would be introduced affect-
ing forage and cereal crops, pastures, livestock breeds, barns and other struc-
tures, and the use of simple animal-drawn hay-making equipment and other machine-
ry.
41.       Four types of project sub-loans would be made to farmer groups. First,
in villages with common meadow, about 80 farmer Meadow Groups would receive sub-
loans    to finance improvements in an estimated 12,000 ha. of communal lands
and in the inputs and practices used on those lands. Village headmen and
councils, who normally have the power to determine the use of communal property,
wxould in most cases be responsible for ensuring the repayment of the loans.
Lending to 1'eadow Groups is an experiment, but one with potentially substantial
economic and social benefits and possible wide applicability elsewhere in rural
Turkey. Second, sub-loans would be made to about 100 Irrigation Groups (usually
formed in villages where rudimentary stream-based irrigation is already prac-
ticed) and would affect an estimated 3,000 ha. of land. Rehabilitation and
construction of channels and provision of pumps and headworks would normally
be financed. Because stream flow is usually intermittent and the growging
season no more than six months, only limited investments would be profitable.
Third, sub-loans to about 50 Purebred Bull Stud Groups would finance construc-
tion of barns and purchase of purebred Brown Swiss bulls for use on members'
farms and for renting out. Fourth, sub-loans to a substantial number of Con-
tractor Groups formed by operating farmers would be designed both to finance
needed tractors and other machinery and to promote contracting as a technique
for providing custom machinery services (over and above members' own needs) to
other farmers who have too little land to utilize a piece of equipment fully.
A number of individual farmers are expected to take the risk of purchasing a
tractor for their own use and for providing part-time contract ploughing to
other farmers, but in many villages such equipment service could be adequately
provided only by a Contractor Group.
42.       Fattening Sub-Project.  As part of a wider Government fattening pro-
gram, the proposed fattening sub-project would increase small-scale livestock
feedlot operations in a number of provinces throughout Turkey, but mainly in
the Central Anatolian Plateau. This would involve the fattening annually of
an additional 100,000 cattle and 240,000 sheep at full development. It is ex-
pected that new producers would fatten about 30 percent of this number and
existing specialist fatteners the balance. Finance would be available for the
construction or renovation of feeding barns and storage facilities and for pro-



- 11 -
vision of the incremental working capital required for the purchase of live-
stock and fodder. Approximately 1,000 cattle and 600 sheep fatteners are ex.-
pected to participate with feedlot size ranging from 20 to 50 cattle or 80 to
200 sheep per intake. All feeders would fatten twro intakes, for about 100 days
each, over the autumn and winter period, while about 50 percent of them - those
in the more favorably situated areas - would fatten a third intake in the spring.
Project Costs and Financing
43.       Total project cost is estimated at $28.3 million, -- about $14.9 mil-
lion for the Village Sub-Project, $10.3 million for the Fattening Sub-Project,
and $3.1 million for technical services and studies. Financing of the Project
would be approximately as follows: sub-borrowers, 16 percent ($4.7 million);
Government, 6 percent ($1.6 million); ABT, 21 percent ($6.0 million); and IDA,
57 percent ($16.0 million).
44.       The proposed Credit of $16 million would finance the $6.5 million
foreign exchange cost of the project as well as $9.5 million of local currency
costs. The total financial plan of the project still requires Turkey to pro-
vide $12.3 million in local currency, which given its available resources, is
substantial. Although the Government has performed reasonably well in raising
additional revenues, current expenditures have risen at a faster rate than the
growth of revenues and the shortage of public savings is developing into a
major constraint on maintaining the real level of public development expendi-
tures and has pushed the Government to inflationary financing. Apart from the
immediate insufficiency of budget revenues to finance expenditures (see para.
20), the shortfall of domestic savings in financing an adequate rate of invest-
ment is likely to continue over the Third Plan period (1973-77), and restrain
the real growth of investment. Development in some priority areas will probably
suffer.
45.       The proposed project has a high priority in the overall program
for agricultural investments and improvements. With the fast growing domes-
tic demand for livestock products, livestock development should be given
special support if Turkey is to avoid becoming a net import6r instead of
a net exporter of livestock and livestock products in the next few years.
In view of the importance of this project in agricultural development, the
insufficient domestic resources available, and considering the small foreign
exchange component of this project, I believe that the Bank Group can make a
significant contribution in this vital sector only by covering a substantial
proportion of local currency expenditures.
Organization and Management
46.       The organization and management for both sub-projects would be similar
to that for the Intensive Dairy Production Project 236-TU. Project implementa-
tion and technical and economic aspects would be the responsibility of the Live-
stock Directorate, while the Encouragement and Development Loans Division of ABT



- 12 -
would handle the credit aspects. Within the Livestock Directorate a division
has been set up for the Village Sub-Project and another will be formed for the
Fattening Sub-Project. The managers of the two sub-project divisions would
be university-trained and otherwise have qualifications and experience accept-
able to IDA. Three foreign consultants would be employed to help train the
Livestock Directorate technicians and help establish guidelines for lending
and for monitoring Project progress. A Project Coordinating Committee com-
prising senior staff of the Livestock Directorate and ABT would decide when
sub-loan approvals would be delegated to any of ABT's eleven branch offices in
the project areas.
47.       The Village Sub-Project manager would be assisted by a Regional
Manager at Erzurum, Provincial 'l4anagers at Kars and Agri, and about 50 techni-
cians in various country towns, who would advise on formation of groups and
preparation of development plans, recommend sub-loan amounts and terms, and
supervise sub-project implementation. To assess Project benefits and progress,
they would keep detailed production records on at least 5 percent of Project
sub-borrowers. In order to facilitate the recruitment of good technicians for
the remote project areas, the Government will provide special incentives, mainly
in the form of per diem supplements.
Lending Operations
48.       Of the total IDA credit of $16 million, the Government would on-lend
the Turkish lira equivalent of $14.5 million to ABT to an interest rate of 5
percent for 14 years, including a five-year grace period. ABT in turn would on-
lend to sub-borroTwers at 9 percent, the same rate as charged under the Intensive
Dairy Production Project (236-TU) and in line with other agricultural lending
rates. ABT would place 1 percent of its interest receipts in a Special Opera-
tional Fund to help cover operating expenses of the Livestock Directorate of
the Ministry of Agriculture. IWithdrawals from the Fund would be authorized by
the General Director cf the Directorate. ABT would receive a spread of 3 per-
cent to cover its own costs. The Government would bear the foreign exchange
risk of the IDA credit.
49.       Project sub-loan applications would be submitted through the local
ABT branch and would be approved 'oy ABT on the basis of a farm development plan
as approved by the Livestock Directorate and ABT's own determination regarding
creditwortlhiness. ABT would not be restrictive in its collateral requirements
if the sub-borrower's financial prospects appeared satisfactory.
50.       Under the Village Sub-Project, sub-loans to individual farmers would
be for an average of 12 years including four years of grace and would cover all
cash requirements for the development program (excluding the farmers' own labor
estimated at about 10 percent of the cost) plus working capital needed over.the
disbursement period. Sub-loans to meadow, irrigation, and purebred bull groups
would be normally for 10 years including three years of grace and would also
cover all cash requirements. Sub-loans to machinery contractor groups would be
for seven years, including one year of grace, and usually for 80 percent of the
cost of the machinery.



- 13 -
51.       Under the Fattening Sub-Project, sub-loans would be made to fatteners
for about 70 percent of both fixed investments and average animal and fodder
inventories (about a half year's purchases). Sub-borrowers would finance,
mainly with cash, the remaining 30 percent of the investment plus working
capital needed to cover incremental operating expenses not financed by the sub-
loan. Sub-loans would be for seven to nine years including one to two years
grace. Fatteners would maintain a credit account in their ABT branch bank for
deposit of proceeds of livestock sales and for financing further normal operat-
ing and contingency purchases.
Market
52.       At full development, the project is expected to increase annual pro-
duction of both meat and milk by about ' percent of current production.  For
both products demand is rising rapidly and no difficulty is foreseen in selling
the added output in domestic markets. Most of the 6,300 tons of additional
meat produced would be of high quality mainly for sale in Istanbul and Ankara,
where a 5 - 6 percent population growth rate is raising the level of demand by
about 3,000 tons per annum. Most of the additional 29,000 tons of milk pro-
duced would be sold to village cheesemakers, local milk vendors and the milk
plant at Kars. The Kars plant, which opened in 1969 and operated well below
its 15,000 tons full single-shift capacity in 1970, should be able to handle
30 percent to 40 percent of the Project output. The plant's current production
of milk powder, butter and cheese is easily being sold locally. With national
demand for milk expected to rise at 4 - 5 percent per annum, the increased out-
put at Kars will be absorbed with little difficulty by urban markets, the new
Army purchasing depot at Kars, and the active small-scale dairy trade through-
out Turkey.
Producer Benefits
53.       Benefits to participants in the Project would be considerable, with the
estimated average financial rate of return on the new investments at full devel-
opment ranging from 19 percent in the case of individual farmers to 36 percent in
the case of members of purebred bull stud groups. This range of return seems high
enough to make the proposed investments attractive. The activities with the
highest returns are also those facing the greatest risks from changing condi-
tions.
54.      IMiost sub-borrowers would be just above subsistence levels before
borrowing and after development would still have incomes below the average for
Turkish farmers (the average sub-borrower would support a family of seven to
eight). At full development, the net cash income of individual sub-borrowers
under the Village Sub-Project would be about $670 before debt service and about
$270 after debt service. Turkish farmers are not liable to income tax unless
their sales exceed $2,140 and the typical Village Sub-Project participants would
fall below this level. Sub-borrowers in groups would also in most cases receive
low incomes, e.g. members of Machinery contract groups would divide up a net
income after depreciation of only about $600 to $700 per tractor and would
therefore also pay little if any income tax.



- 14 -
55.       Sub-borrowers under the Fattening Sub-Project would receive an
average net income before debt service of $1,450 to $1,740 (or about $200
per family member) but after debt service would receive only $450 to $740
(or below $100 per family member). These sub-borrowers do not obtain any
subsistance from their properties and would still have very modest incomes.
After deductions for dependents and other permissible items are made, in-
come tax would be negligible.
Procurement
56.       The Livestock Directorate would organize the procurement of trac-
tors by international competitive bidding on the basis of individual orders
collected by Directorate technicians and wou].d award contracts to the lowest
evaluated 'bidder. The Bank's standard guidelines for bid evaluation, in-
cluding a domestic preference of up to 15 percent or the level of import
duties, whichever is the lower, would be applied. The invitation to bid
would specify that suppliers would guarantee adequate servicing facilities
and spare parts supply in the Village Sub-Project area. Procurement of
tractors would be subject to not more than four contracts. Vehicles for the
Livestock Directorate and ABT would be procured on the same basis. For
other Project goods, numerous individual purchases by farmers over an ex-
tended period would make bulking of procurement and therefore international
competitive tendering impracticable. Procurement would thus be through
local commercial channels, which offer an adequate choice of locally manu-
factured and internationally supplied goods.
Disbursements
57.       The credit would be disbursed against 70 percent of amounts dis-
bursed under ABT sub-loans under the two sub-projects, the full cost of vehic-
les, the full foreign exchange cost of consultants, and 80 percent of the
costs of office equipment, technical studies, and training and travel abroad
and of the local costs of consultants.
Economic Justification
58.       At full development after seven years, the Project would provide
annual incremental production valued at $11 million, of which 40 percent
would be from the Village Sub-Projec' and 60 percent from the Fattening Sub-
Project. Under the Project, about 1,500 new jobs would be created for people
previously unemployed or underemployed. Some 7,000 individual sub-borrowers
and 5,000 group members, many of whom are also presently underemployed, would
benefit directly through fuller employment. The added production would also
contribute to better utilization of processing facilities in the Northeast.
The economic rate of return is estimated at approximately 20 percent after ad-
justing taxes,duties and other transfers and including the cost of technical
services.



- 15 -
59.       The experience gained under the Village Sub-Project, in both small
farm and common land improvement, should be helpful in facilitating future ex-
tension of this kind of development program to other parts of rural Turkey.
The Village Sub-Project may also provide a limited test of the thesis that pro-
duction and job-creating investment in the rural areas can produce a significant
dampening effect on urban migration. The Fattening Sub-Project would provide
a more technical approach to fattening, and should greatly assist in improving
the base upon which the fattening industry is being developed.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
60.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Turkey
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
the Agricultural Bank of the Turkish Republic, the Recommendation of the Com-
mittee provided for in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The relending to ABT under
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement to be approved by the Association is provided for
in Section 3.01 (b) of the Development Credit Agreement. The Executive Direc-
tors' attention is drawn to Section 4.03 of the draft Project Agreement related
to the establishment in the ABT of a Special Operational Fund to supplement
the operating funds of the Village and Fattening Sub-Project divisions of the
Livestock Directorate.
61.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit wiould comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOIWIvENDATION
62.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
