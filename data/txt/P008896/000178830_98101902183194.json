program, the project consists of two interrelated\n            subprojects: one for village livestock development in the\n            Northeastern Highlands of Turkey, and the other for\n            livestock fattening. The project aims at both meat and milk\n            production by increasing both cattle and sheep breeding\n            herds and offtake in the Northeast, and through fattening\n            this underfinished offtake and other available animals,\n            mainly in the adjoining Anatolian Plateau, to heavier\n            weights prior to slaughter. In addition, the project would\n            assist, through consultants, in the development of technical\n            services in the Livestock Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture."}, "docdt": "1972-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
