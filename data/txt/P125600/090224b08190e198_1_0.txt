                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During 2011-2012, this Grant provided financing for post-disaster reconstruction of communities in Central Java and Yogyakarta which were affected by the volcanic eruption of
                         Mount Merapi as well as villages on Mentawai Island, West Sumatra which had been hit by a tsunami. In 2011 the project funded cash for work programs in Central Java and
                         Yogyakarta, which was distributed to approximately 196 villages in 14 sub-districts and 4 districts. Another US$6.8 million funded reconstruction of damaged infrastructures in Central
                         Java and Yogyakarta. It generated more than 700,000 paid work-days for 160,000 workers from local communities, including over 84,000 women and 82,000 poor households.

                         Reconstruction on Mentawai Island has been slower because the island is difficult to reach and because implementation of PNPM Rural faces facilitation and management difficulties.
