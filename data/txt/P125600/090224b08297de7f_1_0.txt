Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project has yet to finalize its project evaluation to assess end-line values for its outcome indicators. The project evaluation is currently
 under implementation and the final report will be available in January 2015. However, the project has made good progress in exceeding end of
 project target values for at least 4 of 7 Intermediary Results Indicators (IRIs); and has reached about 500,000 beneficiaries, of which more than
 50 percent (%) are reported to be females. IRIs exceeded include: (i) 91% of infrastructure works are evaluated as of high quality compared
 with a target of more than 50%; (ii) Operations and Maintenance is in place and functioning for 87% of infrastructure works compared with a
 target of more than 50%; (iii) 100% of disaster affected Sub-Districts have received additional facilitator and training for disaster assessment
 compared with a target of 90%; and (iv) audits have been carried out in 39% of disaster affected Sub-Districts compared with a target of more
 than 25%. In addition, implementation progress in Mentawai has picked up significantly since the last ISR from 24% of sub-projects completed
 to 79%. Fifty-nine of 75 sub-projects have been completed to date, of which 46 have already been handed over to the community. A total of 752
 sub-projects have been implemented under the project from a planned total of 781 across 18 Sub-Districts in the 3 Provinces of Central Java,
 Jogjakarta and West Sumatera. However, after further investigation, only less than a quarter of the sub-projects are classified as rehabilitation /
 reconstruction and/or disaster mitigation related, which falls short of the target of more than 50%. This will be further verification during the
 project's evaluation.

         Comments
         Target of 50% not achieved. Although the project has, in the past, reported that 77% (compared with the target of 50%) of villages
         located in disaster affected areas have benefited from replaced infrastructure lost to disaster, upon further investigation and analysis
         of sub-projects during the September and October technical missions, only an average of 23% of a total of 718 infrastructure sub-
         projects can be attributed to the replacement of infrastructure caused by disaster. According to communities, the destruction caused
         by the tsumani or earthquakes in project impacted areas were not significant enough to destroy public infrastructure. The damage
         was mostly limited to private assets. Therefore, block grants were used by communities to rehabilitate or replace infrastructure that
         had deteriorated over time due to poor maintenance and/or neglect. At the same time, the mission’s findings also confirmed that
         communities regarded the project as an additional resource to meet their overall development needs. This indicator will need to be
         further verified during the project's evaluation.

         End target value not yet available. The 2012 Technical Evaluation of the PNPM Rural confirmed that 89% of beneficiaries were satisfied
         with the services and improved governance. However, this figure will be updated following the completion of the household surveys
         conducted in Central Java and Yogyakarta in December 2014. The results will be available by January 2015 and used to inform the ICR.

               End target was not originally established at design. However, from a total of 781 sub-projects that was proposed, planned and
               approved, 752 have been completed, to date. The previous result for the last ISR was misreported by the implementing agency.
               After further verification from the task team, the actual result has been revised down from 790 to 752 completed sub-projects and
               confired by the implementing agency's Quarterly Progres Report for end September 2014.
