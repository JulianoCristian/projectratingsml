SUMMARY
This restructuring paper seeks the approval of the Country Director for a one-year extension
of the closing date of Third National Program for Community Empowerment in Rural Areas -
DISASTER MANAGEMENT SUPPORT, Grant No. TF-098819, P125600 from December
31, 2012 until December 31, 2013.


PROJECT STATUS
In October 2010 Indonesia was struck by two natural disasters: the eruption of Mount Merapi
near Yogyakarta and a tsunami which devasted Mentawai island. Government approached the
World Bank for post disaster assistance and on March 23, 2011 this project was approved and
immediately became effective. Government’s National Team on Accelerating Poverty
Alleviation (TNP2K) had assured that upon signing of the Grant Agreement the Government
budget could immediately be amended and funds would be available for reconstruction.
However the procedures required before an amendment could be made meant that funds only
became available in August 2011, leaving just three months before the end of the fiscal year.
Due to the limited time during which money could be spend, the initial grant-funded activities
were cash-for-work in the provinces of Yogyakarta and Central Java. The reconstruction and
rehabilitation budget could only be included in the 2012 budget and would benefit Yogyakarta
and Central Java as well as Mentawai.

The project is currently rated as Moderately Satisfactory in achieving its objective which is
to support the Government of Indonesia’s disaster management efforts at the community
level. Funding from this grant has been very beneficial to the affected communities. It
generated more than 700,000 paid work-days for 160,000 workers from local communities,
including over 84,000 women and 82,000 poor households. As of November 2012, the
disbursement of Grant TF-098819 has reached 83% and the remainder has been fully
programmed. In addition, a comprehensive disaster mitigation and early disaster evacuation
system has been established in Yogyakarta and Central Java which works closely with Local
Disaster Management Agencies (BPBD – Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah) and
local NGOs.

PROPOSED CHANGES
A one-year extension is required to ensure that the reconstruction activities in Mentawai can
be finished, Mentawai is very isolated and transportation to the island is infrequent and
seasonal. PNPM-Rural is the only community-based program on Mentawai and therefore
critical to bring benefits directly to the affected population. PMD has already mobilized
additional assistants for sub-district Facilitators (FK/FT Assistants) to help accelerate the
completion of infrastructure work and to build the communities resilience for future disasters.
