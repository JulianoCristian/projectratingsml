A one-year\n            extension is required to ensure that the reconstruction\n            activities in Mentawai can be finished, Mentawai is very\n            isolated and transportation to the island is infrequent and\n            seasonal.  PNPM-Rural is the only community-based program on\n            Mentawai and therefore critical to bring benefits directly\n            to the affected population.
