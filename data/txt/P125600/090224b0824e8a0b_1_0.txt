                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is demonstrating reasonable progress. About 77 percent of the villages in disaster-affected areas benefiting from the project have successfully replaced infrastructure lost
                         to disaster. This compared with the project's target of more than 50 percent. In addition, a technical evaluation indicates that 89 percent of beneficiaries are satisfied with improved
                         services and local level governance, which compares well with the target of more than 80 percent. In terms of physical progress, all planned project implementation activities have
                         been completed in Yogyakarta and Central Java; and 14 of the 18 participating disaster-affected Sub-Districts have completed the reconstruction process. Implementation progress
