                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project works were completed in Yogyakarta and Central Java in 2012, however works on the remote island of Mentawai, West Sumatra, will require an extension of 11 months
                         (requested by Government) to complete. Project outcome indicators on replacement of infrastructure lost to disaster, beneficiary satisfaction levels, representation of vulnerable and
                         marginal groups in community based decision making and management have all exceeded targets. The ERR will be computed at the end of the project.
