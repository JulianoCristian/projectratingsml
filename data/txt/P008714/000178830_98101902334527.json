"Agricultural credit subprojects to be\n            financed under the proposed loan are expected to include\n            investments to be undertaken in 1980-83 for 37 new broiler\n            breeding farms, modernization of 20 existing broiler\n            production farms, 28 new mechanized broiler production\n            farms, 15 new poultry slaughterhouses, provision of\n            specialized equipment for quality control, applied research,\n            disease control and performance standards improvement and\n            provision for infusion of current pure line breeding stock\n            with imported pedigreed stock. The project would be the\n            first significant step by the Government designed to\n            contribute to fulfilling unsatisfied domestic demand for\n            fresh meat which has hitherto been suppressed due to the\n            need to earn scarce foreign exchange. Annual incremental\n            poultry meat production resulting from the project would\n            reach 157,000 tons (liveweight) at full development in 1987.\n            The project is also expected to create about 9,000 new jobs.\n            The main risk confronting the project is that the projected\n            efficiency improvement in poultry industry may not be\n            attained unless the feed conversion ratio and the managerial\n            and technical quality of the local staff improve as planned\n            and sufficient specialized quality and health control\n            equipment is provided."}, "docdt": "1979-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
