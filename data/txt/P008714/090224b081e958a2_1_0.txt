SCHEDULE 4
Procurement
A.   International Competitive Bidding
1.   Except as provided in Part B hereof, goods shall be procured
under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent
with those set forth in the "Guidelines for Procurement under
World Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in March
1977 (hereinafter called the Guidelines), on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding as described in Part A of the Guide-
lines.
2.   For goods to be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding under the Project and in addition to the
requirements of paragraph 1.2 of the Guidelines, the Borrower
shall prepare and forward to the Bank as soon as possible, and in
any event not later than 60 days prior to the date of availability
to the public of the first tender, a general procurement notice,
in such form and detail and containing such information as
the Bank shall reasonably request; the Bank will arrange for the
publication of such notice in order to provide timely notification
to prospective bidders of the opportunity to bid for the goods
in question. The Borrower shall provide the necessary information
to update such notice annually so long as any goods remain to
be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding.
3.   Identical or similar items to be procured for the Project
shall be grouped together, whenever practicable, for the purpose
of bidding and procurement, and such grouping of items shall
be subject to agreement between the Bank and the Borrower.
B.   Goods and services required for Part B of the Project may be
procured on the basis of prudent international shopping by
soliciting offers from at least three suppliers from at least
three of the member countries (including, for this purpose,
Switzerland) of the Bank; provided, however, that the Bank's prior
agreement to such procedures shall have been obtained.
C.   Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Goods; Preference
for Domestic Manufacturers
1.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the
supply of goods: (i) bidders shall be required to state in their
bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods, or the


﻿-19-
ex-factory price for domestically manufactured goods; (ii) customs
duties and other import taxes on goods evaluated on a c.i.f.
basis, and sales and similar taxes (applicable to finished domes-
tic products) on goods evaluated on an ex-factory basis, shall be
excluded; and (iii) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight and
other expenditures incidental to the delivery of goods to the
place of their use or installation shall be included.
2.   Goods manufactured in Romania may be granted a margin of
preference in accordance with, and subject to, the following
provisions:
(a) All bidding documents for the procurement of goods
shall clearly indicate any preference which will be granted,
the information required to establish the eligibility of a bid
for such preference and the following methods and stages that
will be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
(b) After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified
in one of the following three groups:
(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in
Romania if the bidder shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that the
manufacturing cost of such goods includes a value
added in Romania equal to at least 20% of the
ex-factory bid price of such goods.
(2) Group B: all other bids offering goods manufactured
in Romania.
(3) Group C: bids not included under Group A or B
above.
(c) All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared
among themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import
taxes on goods to be imported and any sales or similar taxes
on goods to be supplied domestically, to determine the lowest
evaluated bid of each group. Such lowest evaluated bids shall
then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this
comparison, a bid from group A or group B is the lowest, it shall
be selected for the award.
(d) If , as a result of the comparison under paragraph
(c) above, the lowest bid is a bid from group C, all group C
bids shall be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid


﻿- 20 -
from group A after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of the imported
goods offered in each group C bid, for the purpose of this further
comparison only, an amount equal to: (i) the amount of customs
duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would
have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such
group C bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods
if said customs duties and taxes exceed 15% of such price. If
the group A bid in such further comparison is the lowest, it i3hall
be selected for the award; if not, the bid from,group C which as a
result of the comparison under paragraph (c) is the lowest eval-
uated bid shall be selected.
D.   Review of Procurement Decisions by the Bank
Review of invitations to bid or, in the case of procurement
by international shopping, to quote prices and of proposed awards
and final contracts:
(a) Before bids or price quotations are invited, Romagrimex
shall furnish to the Bank, for its comments, the text of the
invitations to bid or quote prices and the specifications and, in
the case of invitations to bid, other bidding documents, together
with a description of the advertising procedures to be followed
for the bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said
documents or procedures as the Bank shall reasonably request.
Any further modification to the bidding documents or the invita-
tions to quote prices shall require the Bank's concurrence before
it is issued to the prospective bidders or suppliers.
(b) Promptly after the bids or price quotations have been
received, Romagrimex shall inform the Bank of the names of the
bidders or prospect-ive suppliers and the respective amounts of the
bids or prices quoted, and shall indicate those items for which
only one bid was received.
(c) After bids or price quotations have been evaluated,
Romagrimex shall, before a final decision on the award is made,
inform the Bank of the name of the bidder or the supplier to which
the contract is intended to be awarded and the reason for the
intended award and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient time
for its review, a detailed report on the evaluation and com-
parison of the bids or the price quotations received, together
with the recommendations for award and such other information as
the Bank shall reasonably request. The Bank shall, if it deter-
mines that the intended award would be inconsistent with the
*'


﻿- 21 -
Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform Romagrimex and state
the reasons for such determination.
(d) The terms and conditions of the contract shall not,
without the Bank's concurrence, materially differ from those
on which bids or price quotations were asked.
(e) Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished
to the Bank promptly after its execution and prior to the sub-
mission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of
funds from the Loan Account in respect of such contract.
