1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (fYR Macedonia) faced major difficulties and
severe hardship in its transition to nationhood and market economy: large external financial
obligations (37 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1994), hyperinflation (1,935 percent
in 1992), and loss of trade and trade routes due to the outburst of hostilities in the region. As a
result, the economy deteriorated; and real GDP fell nearly 40 percent between 1990 and 1995.
The increase in the unemployment rate and the decline in the real wage (about 50 percent
between 1990 and 1995) resulted in severe erosion of real consumption and living standards.

Despite these difficulties, the agriculture sector was relatively more buoyant than the rest of the
economy. The output of the agriculture sector experienced signs of recovery, with increase in
output of about 8 percent in 1994 and 3 percent in 1995. The sector accounted for about 15
percent of employment and contributed about 18 percent to GDP. About half of the population
was living in the rural areas and their livelihood was closely linked to agriculture. Substantial
investments were made in the irrigation sub-sector during the 40 years of the socialist regime; but
since then, these systems deteriorated significantly due to a lack of adequate maintenance. In
addition, land holdings generally tended to be small and fragmented so intensive modern methods
of production were essential if farmers were to produce surplus for sale. Such intensive crop
production was only possible with irrigation.

The government of fYR Macedonia initiated a major economic stabilization program in 1994,
including several measures for the agriculture sector such as price liberalization and privatization
of the socially owned agro-kombinats. These measures were aimed at accelerating the growth of
the sector and maximizing the production at competitive prices for export of agriculture products
in re-emerging opportunities in neighboring countries.         The restoration of the deteriorated
physical infrastructure, particularly irrigation systems was also given a high priority.

In this regard, the government of fYR Macedonia requested the Bank's involvement in the
irrigation sub-sector, as it considered the Bank to be well suited to provide assistance in
developing a policy framework for irrigation management leading to long-term sustainability and
supporting viable investment. The course of action recommended by the Bank was based on the
idea that public sector reform and user participation in irrigation management should be elements
of the overall Bank's assistance, building on a wide-range of experience in the development of
irrigated agricultural systems, both throughout the world and within the region, with comparable
small holder farm settings (e.g., Turkey, Slovenia, and Albania).

Accordingly, the rehabilitation of the deteriorated existing irrigation infrastructure had the first
priority under the Project in order to maximize the economic benefit given the existing budgetary
constraints. Three schemes to be rehabilitated were selected: Tikves, Bregalnica and Polog,
where the situation was becoming critical and unless substantial rehabilitation works were
undertaken, the schemes would almost become non-functional, putting the livelihoods of about
25,000 farmers at stake.

In addition to infrastructure investment, the Project also aimed to introduce several initiatives,
including more cost-effective and efficient irrigation management by calling for the restructuring
of Water Management Organizations (WMOs) and promotion of participatory irrigation
management in order to establish a more sustainable irrigation sub-sector in the country. The



                                                   1

Project was the fourth Bank-financed investment project in the country and the second in the
agriculture sector, following the Private Farmers Support Project (PFSP).

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project had two primary objectives: (i) to enable private farmers to fully regain the potential
of the irrigated agriculture sub-sector through the rehabilitation of the three deteriorated irrigation
schemes with high priorities; and (ii) to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the irrigation
schemes by introducing participatory management.

The above two overarching Project's objectives were important for fYR Macedonia's irrigation
sub-sector, and supported implementation of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, in that they
were aimed at: (i) restructuring of irrigation's operation and management practices through
establishment of more efficient and cost-effective methods, based on the introduction of user
participation and reform of the present WMOs; (ii) optimizing the area irrigated in Tikves,
Bregalnica and Polog through the rehabilitation and repair of physical infrastructure; and (iii)
introducing more technologically advanced crop production and irrigation methods.

1.3      Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
         and reasons/justification

The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were not formally revised. However, there was a
substantial change in the focus of the Project's activities around mid-term review in response to
the legal vacuum to restructure public sector irrigation agencies, namely WMOs, as stipulated in
the 1998 Water Law. In particular, given that most of the WMOs, who were the de facto agency
in charge of managing irrigation facilities, were experiencing serious financial problems and
slowing down the introduction of participatory irrigation management, the Project's focus shifted
to support the restructuring of the WMOs and the transformation of the Public Water
Management Enterprise (PWME) into a regulatory agency for WMOs and Water User
Associations (WUAs). Another of the Project's restructuring took place in 2003/2004, when it
became apparent that restructuring of the irrigation sub-sector was not feasible without the
liquidation of WMOs.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

The direct Project beneficiaries were irrigation water users, e.g., private farmers and agro-
kombinats. Table 1 below summarizes the beneficiaries of the Project by irrigation scheme.

                                  Table 1: Project Beneficiaries

                        Scheme               Private Farmers            Agro-kombinats
                 Tikves                           8,700                         8
                 Bregalnica                       11,000                        7
                 Polog                            4,500                         3

Private Farmers: The main characteristics of the private farmers were: (a) their small holding
sizes, on average 1.5-2.0 hectare (ha), including non-irrigable land; and (b) their dependence on
off-farm employment. The majority (50 to 60 percent in Tikves and Bregalnica and up to 90
percent in Polog) of private farmer households in the Project area had at least one member
engaged in off-farm employment and were often referred to as part-time farmers earning farming



                                                  2

income as a supplement.        The term "part-timers" could be misleading however, as many
households, especially in the Polog area, still had one or more other household members working
full-time on the farm. The household size at the time of appraisal varied between two and about
ten members. The smaller households usually being nuclear families, the larger ones were
extended families (three generations) or joint families (two or more brothers) or a combination of
these two.

Agro-Kombinats. At the time of appraisal, agro-kombinats had land under the proposed schemes
(in Tikves: 7,323 ha; Bregalnica: 12,128 ha; Polog: 725 ha) and were also to benefit from the
Project. However, since the government of fYR Macedonia intended to privatize part of these
state lands and lease the remaining state lands, it was difficult to assess the potential number of
beneficiaries for the agro-kombinats' land.

Municipalities many of which depended upon the provision of bulk water from the WMOs were
also to benefit from the lower water prices. The population living downstream of the Kalimanci
Dam was supposed to benefit from the dam safety improvements.

Other indirect Project's beneficiaries were the former employees of the liquidated WMOs since
their unpaid salaries and significant social benefits such as pension and health contribution arrears
were settled under the framework of the Project; as well as the staff of the recently established
WEs, who benefited from training and capacity building activities.

1.5      Original Components (as approved)

The Project was originally intended to be implemented over a period of about six years
(November 1997 ­ March 2004) and included the following five components:

Component 1 - System Rehabilitation (Base Cost US$20.72 million). This component consisted of
the essential and most urgent repairs and the replacement of the damaged portions of the
irrigation systems. Measurement structures were to be installed at intakes of major secondary
canals and at the borders between the main WMOs and distribution WMOs in primary canals in
order to monitor the water use at each secondary network and assess each WMO's operational
efficiency.

Component 2 - Institutional Development Component: (Base Cost: US$1.89 million).                This
component was to support the government's initiatives to increase efficiency and establish
sustainability of the irrigation sub-sector through: (i) a pilot water users association (WUA)
program; (ii) pilot improved water management; (iii) pilot self-help rehabilitation; (iv) a
mathematical modeling of water resources in Bregalnica and Polog scheme; and (v) technical
assistance for the ongoing reorganization of the WMOs.

Component 3 - Technical Studies: (Base Cost: US$0.51 million). This component included
support for the undertaking of four technical studies to identify solutions to the various problems
faced by the Tikves and Bregalnica schemes: (i) growing of algae in main canals; (ii) assessing
conditions of siphons to establish rehabilitation requirements and prioritization; (iii) assessing
design floods at the two storage dams to further evaluate their safety; and (iv) determining
alternative alignment for Tikves intake tunnel. These studies were to be carried out mainly by
local research institutions in close collaborations with international experts.

Component 4 - Project Administration and Monitoring (Base Cost US$3.01 million).                This
component was to provide critical support to ensure timely and efficient Project implementation


                                                  3

including: (a) establishment of a Project Management Team (PMT) by financing essential
national staff and a supporting a team of expatriate experts comprising, a chief technical advisor
(18 staff/months), a construction supervision and management advisor (4 staff/months), a
procurement advisor (4 staff/months), and a financial control and accounting advisor (4
staff/months), as well as essential office equipment and vehicles for PMT and experts; and (b)
technical assistance for design and construction supervision by financing a team of local
consultants to carry out design, tender document preparation, and construction supervision for
civil works to be financed under the Project.

Component 5 - Implementation Support (Base Cost US$0.50 million). This component was to
finance incremental operating cost of the irrigation systems and incremental staff of four
participating WMOs. These WMOs were to take on Project implementation responsibilities for
carrying out pilot WUA programs, preparing annual irrigation reports and other responsibilities.
A total sum of US$100,000 per year was to be provided to the participating WMOs. The annual
allocation of funds among the four participating WMOs was to be determined each year by the
PMT, depending on the responsibilities assigned and number of additional staff needed.

1.6      Revised Components

On the basis of the evaluation of Project's progress carried out at Mid-Term Review (MTR) in
November 2000 in collaboration with the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water
Economy (MoAFWE), the PWME, and the PMT, a representative from the government of The
Netherlands (main Project co-financier), the following revisions were made to the original
Project's components to reflect what could be accomplished within the remaining life of the
Project to still achieve the overall PDOs:

Component 1 - System Rehabilitation (Base Cost US$23.66 million).                The rehabilitation of
irrigation facilities was revised to include minimum repairs and rehabilitation to the distribution
networks in order to support the ongoing WUAs program -- also called Irrigation Water
Communities (IWCs)1 program. The budget for this component was also revised to reflect the
real needs for rehabilitation of the most critical parts of the main canals and the adoption of a
mixture of replacement and repair strategy (instead of a pure canal lining replacement strategy).

Component 2 - Institutional Development Component: (Base Cost: US$2.55 million).                    The
following revisions were made to this component:

         Sub-component a - Pilot WUAs/IWCs Development.                While there were not major
         changes under this sub-component, the technical assistance under it was reprogrammed to
         support the development of 70 IWCs covering 14,000 ha (by the completion of the
         Project) and accelerate the transfer of distribution networks to them.

         Sub-component b - Pilot Improved Water Management. This sub-component proved not
         to be effective due to delays in institutional reform. Therefore, it was revised to focus on:
         (a) installing measuring equipment at the main and branch canals in order to enable
         WMOs to charge water users on a volumetric basis, (b) completing the introduction of



1   While WUAs were established under the Law on Citizen's Association, IWCs were established under
    a special Law on Irrigation Water Communities. The traditional WUAs were not allowed to engage in
    economic activities, and therefore, they were prevented from managing distribution networks on behalf
    of their members.


                                                    4

        the SIMIS software to improve water management, and (c) training on improved
        irrigation techniques for selected IWCs.

        Sub-component c - Pilot Self-help Rehabilitation. This sub-component was cancelled in
        2000 during the mid-term review since no progress was made up to that time due to
        delays in establishing the WUAs/IWCs.           The funds for this sub-component were
        transferred to the rehabilitation of irrigation distribution networks under Component 1.
        The following rules were established for the provision of financial support:

        (a)      For branch canal rehabilitation, the Project contributed up to US$150 per hectare
                 for the canal's total command area or US$250 per hectare for the total area under
                 command of the respective main canal or US$450 per hectare for the area under
                 the IWC, with the condition that at least 60 percent of the total command area
                 was covered by the IWCs. No farmer contribution was required.

        (b)      For on-farm rehabilitation works, the Project contributed up to US$100 per
                 hectare for the total area under the IWC's command, and member farmers
                 contributed US$20 per hectare.

        (c)      For on-farm improvement works, the Project contributed up to US$20 per hectare
                 of area under the IWC's command, and farmers contributed US$4 per hectare of
                 area.

        Sub-component e - Technical Assistance for the Ongoing Reorganization of the Water
        Management Organizations.         The scope of the original technical assistance was
        substantially modified, to provide more targeted support for the restructuring of WMOs
        and the PWME. Key recommendations at mid-term review for refocusing of this sub-
        component were:

        (a)      With respect to the objectives, this sub-component would: (i) provide continued
                 support for developing an appropriate legal framework that defines the role and
                 governance of the institutions in the irrigation sub-sector, namely PWME,
                 WMOs, and IWCs; and (ii) concurrently prepare the first steps for restructuring
                 WMOs, including the institutions' financial, technical, and managerial aspects.

        (b)      With respect to specific activities, the sub-component would: (i) support for
                 developing a legal framework for WMO/PWME restructuring; (ii) development
                 of business plans; (iii) introduction of financial control; and (iv) support for
                 developing a maintenance plan.


Component 3: Technical Studies: (Base Cost: US$0.26 million).               The mid-term review
recommended that all studies except the Tikves Tunnel Alignment were to be executed and the
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) budget figure of US$564,000 was to be reduced to US$259,000.

Component 4: Project Administration and Monitoring (Base Cost US$3.92 million). The mid-
term review recommended that the budget additional funds for design and supervision of civil
works would be allocated to this component.

Component 5: Implementation Support (Base Cost US$0.30 million). Since the four participating
WMOs were under restructuring, the mid-term review recommended discontinuing this
component as of 2001and to incorporate the remaining funds into the overall restructuring
support for the WMOs to be provided under Component 2.



                                                 5

1.7     Other significant changes

At MTR, the revised total Project cost was estimated at US$33.07 million (including US$2.38
million in contingencies), up from an estimate of US$32.46 million at appraisal (including
US$5.84 million in contingencies). This increase reflected: (a) a decrease in IBRD and IDA
contributions to the Project in dollar terms due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar (US$1.75
million); and (b) an increase in government of fYR Macedonia's contribution (US$2.36 million)
resulting from the recent introduction of value-added taxes (VAT). Contributions from the
government of the Netherlands remained the same at US$11.98 million.

In August 2004, the Project was again restructured following the adoption of two fundamental
laws for the restructuring of the irrigation sub-sector, i.e., the Law on Irrigation Water
Communities (herein the Law on IWCs) and the Law on Water Economies (herein the Law on
WEs), and the issuing of a government's decree to liquidate the WMOs in the Project area and to
establish the first Water Economies (WEs).         Component 2 was re-designed to support the
establishment of IWCs instead of WUAs across the three schemes and a few new activities were
incorporated into the Project aiming to assist the government of fYR Macedonia to implement the
reform, namely: (i) the provision of severance payment to the employees of eight WMOs in
Tikves, Bregalnica and Polog; (ii) the financing of outstanding salary and pension insurance
contribution arrears of WMOs in the Project area; and (iii) the provision of working capital for
the WEs established in Tikves and Bregalnica. The changes were expected to be budget neutral
since the funds were to come from savings in the rehabilitation program.

The above changes required reallocation of funds among categories as well as amendments to the
IBRD Loan and The Netherlands Grant agreements, which were approved by the Bank upon
government's requests. The amounts described in the loan and grant agreements were modified
as shown in Table 2.

Another significant Project change relates to the extension of the Project closing date from
September 30, 2004 to November 15, 2006, in order to allow the government of fYR Macedonia
to implement the restructured Project and complete the agreed reform of the irrigation sub-sector.


2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Improving sustainability of the irrigation sub-sector was the main Project design consideration.
Consistent with the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) approved by the Board
on May 16, 1996, and given the crisis situation of the irrigation sub-sector, the main concern of
the Project design was to improve the sustainability of the irrigation sub-sector by focusing on
rehabilitation of decayed irrigation infrastructure and increasing the efficiency of irrigation
management. The latter was expected to be achieved by supporting a few initiatives such as
restructuring of water management organization and introducing of participatory irrigation
management on a pilot basis.

The Project design incorporated lessons learnt from previous Bank involvement in agriculture
and irrigation. While the Bank has extensive experience in financing agriculture and irrigation-
related projects, in Europe and across the globe, reform of the irrigation sub-sector remains a
challenge, and this Project was the first trying to address important policy and institutional issues
and to introduce user participation to improve water management and maintain irrigation systems
on a pilot basis through continuous evaluation.

Relevant lessons learned from the Bank Group's earlier funding of projects in the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia including the Bank's first investment project in the agriculture
sector for the fYR Macedonia, FY06 Private Farmers Support Project, were also incorporated in
Project design. These included: (i) demonstrated willingness and ability of Macedonian private
farmers to adopt new technology and farming systems, provided these are beneficial and
economically viable; and (ii) inadequate project implementation capacity limiting the benefits
obtained from the projects.

Sufficient consideration was given to environmental and social issues and safeguards. The
Project was screened and classified as category B in accordance with the Bank's Operational
Policies. The environmental impact from the Project was expected to be minimal, as it would
rehabilitate the existing irrigation schemes, which were currently in use. No alterations to the
catchment areas or to the dams took place under the Project. A possible impact could be due to
the increase in the use of fertilizer and chemicals from restoration of the higher level of crop
production from the current low level; however, pollution was expected to be limited, as more
scientific and economic farming practices with lower inputs were anticipated in the future. No
major pollution due to the irrigated agriculture has been reported in the past. Technical training
to municipality-level agriculture extension officers and research grant was also to be provided
under the PFSP as well as technical advice on relevant topics such as efficient application of
fertilizers and integrated pest management. It was anticipated that the Project would have a
positive environmental impact, as it would improve water conservation through on-farm water
efficiency improvements, changes to agricultural production and training provided to farmers.




                                                  7

There were also some shortcomings in Project design. While the overall Project design was
realistic and relevant and the pilot approach to the institutional design was appropriate, there were
a few shortcomings and limitations worth pointing out:

         (a)     First, while the Project design included support to the formation of WUAs to take
                 over responsibility for tertiary irrigation management, more attention could have
                 been given to enabling the environment for the fostering and nurturing of WUAs,
                 in particular to the adequacy of the incentive structure for each of the water user
                 group (e.g., MoAFWE, WMOs, PWME, WUAs and farmers) which was
                 somehow neglected.

         (b)     Second, while the Project design contemplated a role of the government
                 institutions in regulating and facilitating the activities of WEs and WUAs,
                 activities to strengthening the regulatory, supporting and monitoring capabilities
                 of the central government, namely the MoAFWE, could have been included. The
                 Department of Water Economy within the MoAFWE needed to have adequate
                 capacity to function effectively as a regulator and to ensure that policies were
                 implemented.

         (c)     Third, although the original intervention areas and the scope of rehabilitation
                 works might have been adequate, the MoAFWE and the Bank should have
                 carefully monitored the demand for irrigation at the local level/farmer level and
                 provided clear incentives (e.g., up-front contribution towards system
                 rehabilitation costs) to ensure effective use of rehabilitated schemes.

         (d)     Fourth, while the passing of the 1998 Water Law was a condition of Project
                 effectiveness, sufficient covenants to ensure that the law and its by-laws had
                 support from stakeholders and were satisfactory to the Bank could have been
                 introduced in the legal agreements.          Furthermore, some features of the
                 institutional framework proposed by the 1998 Water Law and its by-laws were in
                 contradiction to the principles of decentralization, users' participation in the
                 management of irrigation systems, and divestiture of non-core business that the
                 Project wanted to promote. This created a legal vacuum for the reforms that the
                 Project wanted to support.

         (e)     Fifth, more efforts could have been made to articulate a concrete strategy on how
                 to address the financial hardship of the WMOs as a result of overstaffing and
                 outstanding debts, which was a key issue impacting negatively on the provision
                 of irrigation services.

         (f)     Sixth, implementation schedule and the monitoring indicators could have been
                 less ambitious and more realistic. In the case of cost recovery, for example, the
                 Project set the unrealistic target of 70-80 percent cost recovery of operation and
                 maintenance costs within three years (baseline 30 percent). It was not realistic to
                 expect that the Project would establish WUAs, define a participatory
                 rehabilitation program, and complete the civil works needed to deliver reliable
                 and timely water supply within the proposed timeframe of three years.

         (g)     Seventh, while assumptions of risk factors were appropriate, particularly those
                 related to policy and institutional reform, the Project's design would have
                 benefited from an explicit recommendation to deal with them outside the Project
                 using other instruments (with more leverage than this Project) or an explicit exit
                 strategy.




                                                   8

         (h)      Eighth, while the Project set as a PDO indicator increasing the income of farming
                  families, the Project's design would have created more synergies with the then
                  on-going Private Farmer Support Program to bring other agriculture services
                  such as extension, marketing and credit services to the Project areas.

2.2      Implementation

The key factors affecting Project implementation and outcomes included the following:

Weak administrative capacity during the start-up phase. The Department of Water Economy of
the MoAFWE, responsible for overall Project implementation, found difficult to perform its tasks
due to staffing problems and no experience with World Bank procurement, financial management
and disbursement procedures. While a PMT was established within the Department of Water
Economy using existing staff of the MoAFWE and a few consultants, MoAFWE staff assigned to
work on the Project were not released from their other functions. As a result, the Project suffered
from limited follow-up until March 1999, when the MoAFWE took the necessary steps to
establish an independent Project Management Unit (PMU) with a certain degree of autonomy and
recruited an experienced/full-time Project Director.

Heavy reliance on the Water Development Institute. During the first three years of Project
implementation, there was a heavy reliance on the Water Development Institute (WDI) to carry
out design and supervision of rehabilitation works because of an under-developed private
consulting services industry. The WDI, who faced limited competition, encountered considerable
delays in the design and supervision of system rehabilitation works as a result of: (i) inadequate
or limited field surveys; (ii) lack of qualified staff for the jobs; (iii) failure to complete
satisfactory designs on schedule, e.g., designs took between 12-18 months to be completed
(several folds of original estimates) because the PMU repeatedly returned inadequate designs for
amendments; (iv) unsuitable proposals for rehabilitation technology; and (v) failure to recognize
problems caused by hydrostatic pressure. This slowed down implementation of the physical
rehabilitation works for irrigation schemes for almost one year.

Delays in physical rehabilitation works for irrigation schemes prevented farmers to subscribe to
initial institutional reform initiatives. While both the PMT and the Bank team were convinced
that rehabilitation of irrigation schemes without the reform of the irrigation sub-sector was going
to be a waste of effort and money, delays in rehabilitation works prevented WMOs to provide
reliable water services. As a result, farmers were less motivated to subscribe to the formation of
WUAs.

Inappropriate legal framework to support the reforms proposed by the Project, namely the
restructuring of the WMOs.         The 1998 Water Law, adopted at the beginning of Project
implementation, which called for the consolidation of the WMOs into a single PWME to
strengthen the management and supervision of irrigation facilities as well as the introduction of
beneficiary participation in the management board was the basis for supporting the reform of the
irrigation sub-sector under the Project. However, this Law could not be implemented because of
inconsistencies with other organic laws, the issuing of contradictory by-laws (particularly those
dealing with the establishment of the state-owned centralized PWME), and the strong resistance
on the part of existing WMOs to merge with the PWME. As a result, WMOs continued operating
under the 1981 Water Law as unregulated monopolies, outside government supervision and
regulation. The WMOs in the Project area did not have incentives to improve efficiency, reduce
costs or undertake modernization. In 2000, consensus emerged among all stakeholders that as the
1998 Water Law failed to be implemented, and would likely take years to take effect and the



                                                   9

continuing dire state of the WMOs (bankrupt and highly-overstaffed), there was the need to
provide an alternative legal framework for the reform of the irrigation sub-sector. Agreement
was therefore reached on the need to prepare two new laws - a Law on IWCs and a Law on WEs.
Preparation of these laws, however, proceeded very slowly.           This was exacerbated by the
government of fYR Macedonia back-tracking on the reforms during the 2002 general election.
Between July 2002 and July 2003, the government of fYR Macedonia abandoned almost all
efforts towards the institutional and legal reform process of the irrigation sub-sector. During the
election campaign in 2002, the previous Administration promised free irrigation water and ceased
the preparation of the draft Law on IWC and the Law on WE. These political factors undermined
farmers' incentives to form IWCs and assume management of distribution networks and pay
operational and maintenance costs, and had significant slow-down effects on Project
implementation. It therefore took almost 3 years to have the laws finalized and approved by the
Parliament.

Kosovo crisis in 1999 and the internal conflict of 2001.          The Macedonian agriculture was
seriously affected by the Kosovo crisis, as Serbia (including Kosovo) had traditionally been the
most important market for Macedonian agricultural products. This was certainly a factor in the
low cost recovery for irrigation facilities, particularly for Polog and Bregalnica. Polog, which is
adjacent to Kosovo, used to sell vegetables through Kosovo to various markets (including
Serbia).    A large number of farms in Bregalnica also used to produce rice for Serbia.
Furthermore, the Kosovo crises and the internal conflict of 2001 precipitated severe fiscal deficits
that led to shortage in counterpart funds for the Project, which caused the suspension of
rehabilitation works to almost 18 months. The internal conflict of 2001 also presented security
problems in several of the Project areas. Due to their proximity to Kosovo, Tetovo and Gostivar
schemes were most affected. Implementation of Project activities in these regions was suspended
since early 2001 until September 2002.

Limited attention to address the financial insolvency of WMOs, which perpetuated the vicious
circle of low cost recovery and undermined efforts on participatory irrigation management. The
findings of the 1998-1989 financial audits of the four participating WMOs, revealed that they
were in poor financial situation and the low cost recovery of irrigation water tariffs was at the
core of the problem. The financial audits also revealed that the efforts to collect tariffs through
court action, improving billing, as well as remedies and sanctions were not working and that the
implementation of critical measures such as the clearing of their arrears and the retrenching of
staff were inevitable. However, it took the government of fYR Macedonia more than 4 years to
develop an agreed strategy on how to deal with these issues. After the strategy was developed,
fiscal difficulties (or lack of commitment to liquidate WMOs) prevented the MoAFWE to finance
the implementation of a staff retrenchment and severance program as part of the liquidation of
WMOs. As long as the WMO existed, they obstructed initiatives of newly established IWCs by
refusing to honor water delivery contracts with IWCs, soliciting individual farmers to pay directly
to WMOs and delaying sharing information with farmers regarding the establishment of IWCs.

Unnecessary delays in processing request to establish IWCs at the MoAFWE. After all legal
issues had been addressed and the WMOs in the Project area were in the process of being
liquidated, the process of registering IWCs at the MoEFWE faced unnecessary delays due to non-
substantial administrative reasons, which undermined the PMU's efforts to accelerate the
institutional reform.

Close and strong oversight and extraordinary persistence observed by the Bank. The Bank's
regular joint supervision missions with the government of The Netherlands and frequent follow-
up missions played a critical role in identifying implementation problems, in finding solutions to


                                                  10

them, and in keeping the policy dialogue alive for the need for institutional reforms, especially for
restructuring WMOs and developing IWCs.            The extraordinary persistence and conviction
observed by Bank team played an important role in laying the foundation for the overall
institutional reform of the irrigation sub-sector.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) functions of the Project were divided into two parts: One
part to manage the inputs and outputs under each Project component, and the second part to
manage the impacts of the Project. During Project implementation, most of the focus was
devoted to the first part of the M&E, which included information on expenditures, accounts,
status of contracts, among others. This information was reported in the quarterly progress
reports, which were complete, and accurate.

The second part of the M&E was inadvertently neglected. Key performance indicators were
proposed at appraisal for each outcome of the Project and a list of indicators and a baseline
prepared in 1999. This list of indicators was re-formulated and a detailed monitoring and
evaluation plan were prepared at the time of the MTR. A detailed farmer survey of about 150
farmers was implemented for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 by an independent consultant.
However, after the restructuring of the Project in 2004, limited efforts were made by the PMU to
redefine outputs and outcome indicators in line with the restructured Project. Therefore, no
information was collected in 2004/2005 to quantify the impacts vis-à-vis the two stated Project
objectives. While the Bank insisted on the development of a detailed M&E plan including a
beneficiary social assessment of the restructured Project, the PMU was not able to mobilize
consultants to implement the M&E Plan. A non-random ex-post survey of benefiting farmers
was conducted after the Project closure to assess the impacts of the Project.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental compliance was assured with water quality monitored prior to the start of the
Project and during the Project implementation at: (a) system intakes at the reservoir; (b) selected
points in the primary drains; and (c) at locations in the river downstream of the schemes. Terms
of reference for environmental monitoring were prepared during Project preparation. Submission
to the Bank of an environmental evaluation describing general environmental conditions
including the current quality of water was made a condition for effectiveness.

While the overall quality of the irrigation water in the proposed schemes was good in terms of
total dissolved matter, acidity, and dissolved oxygen levels, algae problem was encountered in
several canals in Tikves and Bregalnica schemes during summer time. A technical study was
undertaken under a EU-PHARE funded project to define measures to address this problem.
While the study and field investigations confirmed the seriousness of the problem, they did not
recommend any remedies.

Initially, a small PMT within the MoAFWE was in charge of all aspects of procurement, financial
management and disbursement. Twelve months after the Project was declared effective, these
responsibilities were transferred to a separate PMU, with a strong level of autonomy in decision-
making regarding Project implementation. The PMU was restructured in 2004 to increase its
effectiveness in performing its financial management and procurement functions with overall
satisfactory results. This arrangement proved to be satisfactory to ensure adequate compliance
with all Bank fiduciary requirements and shield implementation from excessive political
influence, and remained in place until Project completion.


                                                  11

A few issues regarding procurement were raised during Project supervision, particularly during
the two consecutive post supervision mission reviews that took place in 2004, related to planning
and implementation of procurement procedures (e.g., planning of procurement of civil works
needed to take into account the construction period was limited to late winter/early spring and late
autumn, unnecessary delays in the evaluation of the bids caused expiration of bid validity, among
others) and contract management (e.g., ensuring closer supervision of the design and civil works
contracts, exercising timely processing of invoices).           A few procurement processes were
cancelled by the Bank because of irregularities and new procurement procedures for small works
were established in 2004 to be followed during the remaining period of the Project.

It should be pointed out that a few allegations regarding irregularities in the implementation of
the Project have been reported. The Department of Institutional Integrity has investigated the
allegations of the irregularities. The Bank will take appropriate follow-up actions.

Regarding financial management, the introduction of VAT -- a flat rate of 19 percent -- in April
2000 had an impact in Project implementation, since funding for VAT was not planned at the
time of appraisal. This required a substantial increase of counterpart funds to finance the VAT of
all civil works, goods and consultant contracts, equivalent to US$3.7 million, since the IDA
credit, the IBRD loan and The Netherlands grant eligible percentage were to cover only the net
amount of expenditures after deducting the VAT.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

In order to fully realize the potential of the new irrigation model, the Project has helped to put in
place, there are a number of challenges for the government of fYR Macedonia and farmers to
sustain the reform of the irrigation sub-sector:

         (a)     Ensure that the appointment of Board members for WEs is fully consistent with
                 the Law on WEs. The MoAFWE should monitor that water users are adequately
                 represented in the Boards of the WEs and that their establishment is done
                 following the procedures spelled out in the Law on WEs.

         (b)     Amend the Law on Water Economies and Law on Irrigation Water Communities.
                 These two laws need to be amended to address already identified weakness in the
                 legal and institutional framework, namely, clarification of the role of the Union
                 of Irrigation Water Communities (UIWCs), transfer of infrastructure2,
                 transparency and governance structure of WEs, financial management
                 obligations of WEs and IWCs, funding for public functions performed by WEs,
                 among others.

         (c)     Strengthen the capacity of the MoAFWE. There is a need to build capacity
                 within the MoAFWE to provide information and technical support to water users
                 groups and monitor the irrigation sector.

         (d)     Provide additional support for irrigation rehabilitation. Since without reliable
                 water services farmers will not subscribe to the reform, the government of fYR
                 Macedonia should continue supporting the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes
                 responding to the demands of IWCs.



2   Infrastructure has not been officially transferred to the UIWCs in Tetovo because of delays with the
    amendment to the Law on IWCs. Once this is done, the MoEFWE should follow up with the transfer.


                                                     12

        (e)     Cost recovery for irrigation. While discussions with farmers and IWCs and
                other stakeholders attest to the fact that water users overall are obtaining better
                water services from WEs and UIWCs, the financial sustainability of these entities
                is still precarious and efforts need to be made to ensure all water users pay for
                their water. Areas that need to receive government of fYR Macedonia's attention
                include: (i) improve communication between WEs and IWCs; (ii) complete
                privatization and regulation of winery enterprises, which are the major buyers of
                grape production; (iii) complete land reform, which is preventing large areas with
                access to irrigation to be put into productive use3; (iv) improve reporting of the
                irrigation areas; and (v) address disputes over some of the costs passed on to
                farmers (referred to cost-sharing arrangements).            MoAFWE might want to
                continue supporting installation of metering systems as a way to improve
                reporting of irrigation areas. It is expected delivered water volumes will appear
                significantly larger than were recorded in the cropping plans. At present, this
                difference goes unchecked or recorded, and WEs and UIWCs have no means to
                claim it from IWCs.

        (f)     Review cost-sharing arrangements. At present, the contribution from the IWCs
                to UIWCs and WEs does not cover the maintenance and monitoring costs of
                large state-owned infrastructure. The MoAFWE needs to review cost-sharing
                arrangements for functions perfomed by WEs and UIWCs that have a public
                goods character and might want to consider providing them with budget support
                to cover expenditures for public goods activities, e.g., periodical monitoring of
                sediments, periodical monitoring of dam safety4, etc.

        (g)     Address broad water resources management issues. Irrigation management and
                development activities being carried out under the direction of the MoAFWE are
                not sufficiently taking into account the broader water resources management
                issues such as dam operations and safety; environmental needs; energy
                opportunities; water allocation priorities.           It is recommended that Bank
                encourage and assist in expanding the dialogue on water resources management
                and development as well as promote the participation of other relevant
                stakeholders such as the Ministries of Environment and Economy, and also the
                other entities involved in irrigation and water supply and related activities,
                particularly at the regional and local levels. Taking a more integrated approach
                to water resources issues, which incorporates the river basin as the core unit for
                planning, management and development is in agreement with the requirements of
                the EU Water Framework Directive.


The government of fYR Macedonia has demonstrated its political will and has made good
progress in implementing the first phase of the restructuring process of the irrigation sub-sector
under the IRRP, and has decided to complete the reform process under the new Agriculture
Strengthening and Accession Project, which is to be approved in June 2007. The new Project will
assist the government of FYR Macedonia to: (i) complete the liquidation of nine WMOs; (ii)
establish 6 new WEs to undertake responsibility for multi-purpose water systems; and (iii)

3   In some large irrigation schemes, about 25-35 percent of the potentially irrigated area is not put to
    productive use because of the delays with the issuing of leasing arrangement or privatization. This has
    serious impacts on the revenue base of the WEs.
4   In Bregalnica, for example, farmers opposed to paying for the costs associated with the monitoring of

    budget.


                                                   13

strengthen the capacity of the Department of Water Economy to effectively provide information
and technical support and oversee and monitor the new IWCs, UIWCs and WEs.

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Project's design was relevant to and consistent with the priorities of the government of fYR
Macedonia of building private capabilities to increase agriculture production and modernization
of physical infrastructure, and responded well to the CAS's objectives of assuring adequate
infrastructure for economic growth and facilitating and supporting the structural reform and
transformation to a market economy.         The Project contributed to the above objectives by
supporting rehabilitation of the deteriorated existing irrigation infrastructure, restructuring of
water management organizations and promoting participatory irrigation management.

During the preparation of the Project, the following issues were identified as risks to the Project
objectives: (a) market constraints; (b) low cost recovery; (c) delay in the reform of the WMOs;
and (d) delay in the establishment of WUAs. Indeed, during implementation, these risk factors
identified at appraisal affected the implementation of the Project.        The planned mitigation
measures such as improving farmers' awareness and confidence regarding the introduction of
participatory irrigation management and continuous policy dialogue on the reform process were
undertaken and helped to enhance farmers' willingness to participate, improve cost recovery as
well as limit the delays in the reform process.

It should be pointed out that the Water Law, which was passed in early 1998 as the base law for
defining an institutional framework for the water sector, including irrigation and drainage, was
found to be too socially and politically difficult to implement and that the original goals of the
Project hinged on this law. To address these issues, the PDOs were not changed as they remained
relevant, however the Project was substantially restructured to develop consensus among the key
stakeholders on the need to redevelop the legal framework for the irrigation sector and to provide
the much needed support (e.g., legal and institutional technical advice, funds for the liquidation of
WMOs, etc.) to carry out the reforms. Arguably, this restructuring could have been done earlier
and more effort could have been made by the Bank team and PMU to redefine the Project's
outputs and indicators in accordance with the restructured Project.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The Project has substantially contributed towards enabling private farmers to fully regain the
potential of the irrigated agriculture sector and to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the
irrigation systems. Some observations of the achievements are presented below:

         (a)     To enable the private farmers to fully regain the potential of the irrigated
                 agriculture sector through the rehabilitation of the three deteriorated irrigation
                 schemes with high priorities. According to the crop budget survey for the years
                 2004-2006, interviewed farmers experienced increase in irrigated areas for high-
                 value crops, (e.g., grape, cabbage, orchard and pepper in Tikves; tomato, rice and
                 sunflower in Bregalnica; and alfalfa and tomato in Polog).            Farmers also
                 experienced higher yields, as reliability of water supply improved (e.g., 64-151
                 percent in alfalfa; 25-206 percent in tomato; 275 percent in watermelon and
                 melon; 186 percent in potato). The substantial reduction on the cost of water to



                                                 14

                   farmers (from US$287/ha to US$84/ha in Bregalnica, from US$229/ha to
                   US$129/ha in Tikves and from US$US$296/ha to US$115/ha in Gostivar-Polog)
                   has also positive impacts on farmer's income. Rice growers in Bregalnica have
                   seen a reduction in the cost of water equivalent to 13 percent of their gross
                   income. Average net farm income per hectare in the Project area is about
                   US$1,300, which is more than double the average income of a typical cereal farm
                   under rainfed conditions. Thus, the reform of the irrigation sector supported
                   under the Project has led to increase in agriculture productivity and farm income.
                   Reliable and cost-efficient irrigation services have resulted in growing more
                   profitable crops, particularly vegetable; increases in irrigated areas in some IWCs
                   (although at the system level the overall irrigated area has a downward trend);
                   increase in quality of produces; higher crop yields; introduction of new
                   technologies, such as dripped irrigation; among others.

         (b)       To enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the irrigation schemes by
                   introducing participatory management.           At the low level, Irrigation Water
                   Communities (IWCs) have developed quickly to perform participatory irrigation
                   management and assume operation and maintenance responsibilities for
                   secondary and tertiary infrastructure. As of November 2006, 95 IWCs have been
                   established within the Project areas covering about 50,100 ha, and in addition 6
                   IWCs covering 3,700 ha in non-project areas.             Thus, about one-half of the
                   equipped irrigated area country-wide is managed by IWCs. A total of 12 WMOs
                   have been liquidated under the Project, in addition to 2 WMOs abolished, and
                   liquidation procedures have been initiated for 5 WMOs. There still remains 4
                   WMOs that should be liquidated. Furthermore, 2 UIWCs have been established
                   in Tetovo and Gostivar, and 2 WEs have been established in Tikves and
                   Bregalnica to operate and maintain multi-purpose infrastructure including main
                   canals and other structures and provide bulk water to IWCs. While substantial
                   progress in cost recovery has been achieved in the small irrigation schemes
                   (Tetovo and Gostivar), reaching up to 100 percent in some IWCs; progress in
                   large schemes (Tikves and Bregalnica) varies with 78 percent collection in
                   Tikves and 65 percent in Bregalnice. IWCs collectively have paid about 75
                   percent of water fees, with more than 40 percent of them having 100 percent
                   payment rates. The independent farmers remain the major defaulters paying on
                   average only 47 percent of their water fees5.

It is clear that this was an important Project for fYR Macedonia but also an ambitious one to be
undertaken at the time. It is also apparent that the Project will not result in restoring about 32,000
ha under irrigation as was envisaged during preparation by 10th year of the Project. During the
period 2005-2006, only one-third of the total area equipped to deliver reliable water supply was
reported to be irrigated by the farmers. There are several reasons for this outcome, including: (i)
irrigation schemes were originally over-dimensioned and thus were never used to their maximum
design capacity; (ii) underreporting of irrigation by farmers; (iii) good rainfall during the past
couple of years; (iv) lower than expected demand from farmers coupled with out-migration from


5    The significant difference between Tikves and Bregalnice in terms of collections is made up mostly
     from legal entities and industrial users, where in Tikves they contribute about 90 percent of payments,
     in Bregalnice they have paid only about 65 percent of their dues. An ongoing problem that needs to be
     addressed to ensure system sustainability is the significant undeclared irrigated land areas. Officially,
     actual irrigated areas under the project dropped between 2005 and 2006, yet all interviewed farmers
     expressed their appreciation for the opportunities the improved water supply provided.


                                                      15

rural areas; (v) delays with the privatization and regulation of winery enterprises, which are the
major buyers of grape production; (vi) large share of idle agricultural land because of unfinished
land reform6; and (vii) disputes over some of the costs passed on to farmers7.

3.3      Efficiency

The primary economic benefits of the Project are increased agricultural production as a result of:
(i) increase in yields with secure irrigation water; (ii) prevention of the future decline of irrigation
areas; and (iii) conversion to higher value crops. At appraisal, the economic rate of return (ERR)
for the entire Project was estimated at 29 percent.

At completion, the ERR was re-estimated to be about 16 percent using actual costs and benefits.

The 2004-2006 crop budget survey shows financial returns per hectare, inclusive of cost of labor,
taxes and cost of water, of about US$870-2,800 for the cultivation of mixed vegetables, US$500
for orchards, and about US$300 for cereals. Thus, farmers in the Project area have enjoyed
positive financial returns from agriculture activities.

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The Project is considered to have satisfactorily achieved its intended major objectives: (a) enable
the private farmers to fully regain the potential of the irrigated agriculture sector through the
rehabilitation of the three deteriorated irrigation schemes with high priorities; and (b) enhance the
sustainability and efficiency of the irrigation schemes by introducing participatory management.
The planned rehabilitation works were carried out, but perhaps more importantly, the Project had
very important institutional impacts such as development of IWCs and the restructuring of the
WMOs into WEs. The Project was rated satisfactory for 76 percent of the Project implementation
period. These accomplishments are even more commendable in the context of the Kosovo crisis
which took place in 1999 and the internal conflict within fYR Macedonia in 2001.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

An international gender specialist carried out a one-month study to identify any gender specific
issues related to the irrigation sub-sector or to the establishment of IWCs in both ethnic
Macedonian and Albanian areas. The specialist collected information on gender-differential
household responsibilities, women's involvement in water management, women's expectations
for the rehabilitation of irrigation, their interest in irrigation management and participation in
IWCs, their preferences in formal membership, and barriers to women's participation.
Based on the information collected, the negative impacts for women often associated with the
irrigation sub-sector and irrigation projects, such as an increase in women's workloads (for both
production and household activities), were found not to be occurring in this Project.


6    In some large irrigation schemes, about 25-35 percent of the potentially irrigated area is not put to
     productive use because of the delays with the issuing of land leasing arrangements or land
     privatization.
7    In Bregalnica, for example, farmers opposed to pay for the costs associated with the monitoring of the
     Kalmanci Dam, which is considered a public function and therefore should be paid by the state budget.


                                                   16

Nevertheless, the Project encouraged women to participate in the IWCs, but in general, women
only informally and indirectly participated or influenced the management process of the IWCs.
The women found strategies for articulating their interests without needing to expose themselves
to public attention.

A Social Impact Assessment carried out in July-September 2006 found overall the Project had
positive results. It helped transform the old centralized irrigation infrastructure systems and
institutions into new participatory and self-governing institutions. The Project helped raise
farmers' awareness and farmers became willing to take on the responsibility of solving local
irrigation problems. Participatory electoral procedures of self-management were also introduced
and with the new arrangement of the WEs, water users formally take part in management,
through their representatives on the board, who are elected by the members of the IWCs. Farmers
also feel that they are now participating in the decision making regarding water prices. In
addition, IWCs began to manage secondary and tertiary irrigation systems and collect water fees
directly from the farmers.

From a social development perspective, the irrigation reforms creating WEs and IWCs were
necessary not only for survival, but also for social cohesion in villages and for the progress of
farmers. Frustrated farmers, once fighting among themselves and causing conflict between
villages, now trust each other and have friendly working relationships. Major development
breakthroughs were participation, community awareness, and willingness to pay for services. In
addition, reflecting on the previous system, water users feel that the reforms were the only way to
improve the quality of agricultural production for competing in the market economy.

Major water users now have a different attitude and accept responsibility for decision making.
This couple with the reduction in irrigation costs and lower prices for the water have contributed
to almost 100 percent payment of water fees.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

It should be noted that the Project has played a very important role in initiating major institutional
reform in the irrigation sector. In the last 2 years of implementation, the Project team focused on
policy dialogue to convince stakeholders of the need for institutional reform, especially for
restructuring WMOs and developing IWCs. Ironically, it was the low cost recovery for irrigation
services and the subsequent financial crisis experienced by WMOs that finally convinced them of
the need to reform. Now, full consensus appears to have been reached by government officials,
former WMO staff and farmers that the reform must continue and expand to other regions not
covered by the Project.

During the four-year period ending in December 2003, the Project established 27 water user
associations covering about 5,690 ha and 7,090 members. However, with the enactment of the
Law on WEs and the Law on IWCs, between 2004 and 2006, a total of 95 IWCs, 2 WEs, and 2
UIWCs were established in the three Project regions (i.e., Tikves, Bregalnica, and Polog)
covering 50,100 ha and 32,500 water users.8




8   Data taken from the M&E reports. However, the Implementation Completion Report prepared by the
    MoAFWE indicates that the 95 IWCs cover 48,600 ha and 32,000 members.


                                                 17

(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Because of the overall positive results of the Project, 3 WMOs in Kicevo, Resen and Struga were
liquidated in accordance with the Law on WE, involving 107 staff, and 6 additional IWCs were
established outside of the Project regions covering 3,700 ha.

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

(a)      Social Impact Assessment

A Social Impact Assessment was conducted towards the end of the Project to determine the
Project's social impacts. The assessment included a combination of focus group discussions and
expert interviews. Main stakeholders included: members of IWCs and UIWCs, water masters,
staffs of water economies, staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Economy,
owners of small and medium private farms as well as house plots, owners of larger farms and
commercial farms, cooperatives and farmer and producer interest groups, and small rural traders.
The key findings of the assessment are summarized below:

Stakeholders' satisfaction with infrastructure improvements.       In general, stakeholders in the
Project areas expressed satisfaction with the improved irrigation infrastructure, which led to
improved water delivery in terms of quality and quantity. A few were not satisfied with the
quality of the works and/or with the scope of the rehabilitation.

Change of attitude towards paying for irrigation services. Stakeholders in the Project areas have
undergone a major change in terms of their attitude to pay for irrigation services. The majority of
water users have been able to see the benefits of timely payment ­ timely delivery of irrigation
water and increased efficiency of the entire irrigation system. Farmers are also satisfied with the
notable reduction in the water fee and the flexible payment schedule.

Impacts of improved water services. Because of the improved reliability of the irrigation water
services, farmers in the Project areas are diversifying their agriculture production and shifting to
more profitable crops. Some are waiting for better market conditions to make the switch.

Community empowerment through community-based associations.               The Project successfully
supported the establishment of IWCs, which empowered water users for their active engagement
in irrigation management decision-making. With the establishment of the IWCs, water users
have started to function as a social group with common interests. IWCs have also played an
important role in building mutual trust between farmers from different villages. The relationship
between individual farmers and the water management enterprise has also changed ­ from being
formal and distant to being informal and closer.

Level of participation of beneficiaries. Most of the interviewed water users indicated they were
satisfied with their level of participation through the elected members in the Board of Water
Users or elected President of the IWCs and their level of participation in IWC General
Assembly's meetings.

Institutional bottlenecks that need to be addressed. Stakeholders also made the following
recommendations for addressing institutional bottlenecks and for future assistance to the sector:
(i) build capacity within MoAFWE to provide information and technical support to water users
groups and monitor the irrigation sector; (ii) strengthen water users groups, who have large needs
for quality advice on legal and technical issues, planning and financing; (iii) improve


                                                  18

communication process between IWCs and the final water users and between WEs and IWCs,
IWCs and UIWCs through training and technical assistance; (iv) provide technical assistance to
help IWC management take a more active role; (v) disseminate work done by WEs via
publications and information sharing; (vi) support establishment of an umbrella national
Federation of Irrigation Water Communities (FIWC) to facilitate exchange of experience among
IWCs, formulate and recommend changes in policies to the government of fYR Macedonia, and
lobby for the interests of water users groups; and (vii) review cost-allocation arrangements for
public good functions performed by WEs and UIWCs.

The detailed Social Impact Assessment Report is in the Project files.

(b)      Farmers Survey

As a follow-up to the above-mentioned qualitative Social Impact Assessment, the Bank team
commissioned a low-cost survey of about 150 farm households in the three Project areas, which
was carried out in February 2007. The findings of the survey, which summary is presented in
Annex 5, reveal that more than 85 percent of the surveyed farmers were either satisfied or fairly
satisfied with the rehabilitation works performed under the Project as well as the services
provided by the WEs, IWCs and UIWCs, in terms of water availability and distribution, level of
maintenance of main canals and distribution systems. About 30 percent of the interviewed
farmers in the Polog region, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the level of maintenance of
distribution networks.

The detailed Farmers Survey included in the report titled "Crop Budget Survey 2004-2006" is
also in the Project files.


4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

While good progress has been made under the Project, there are a few risks identified at
completion, which may threaten the long-term sustainability of the Project's impacts unless
appropriate mitigation measures are put in place. These risks are:

Further Support for WEs and IWCs. The WEs and IWCs are in the initial stages of development
and need training relating to administrative and fiduciary management (budgeting, accounting
and procurement) as well as technological advancements in the irrigation sub-sector.

Regulation and Facilitation by MoAFWE.            As the responsibilities for irrigation are being
decentralized to stakeholders, the role of MoAFWE with respect to the irrigation sub-sector
should be oriented more towards planning, facilitation and monitoring. In the area of planning,
MoAFWE needs to: (i) have responsibility for overall policy and inter-ministerial coordination
for water resource management; (ii) prepare budget allocation for irrigation and drainage sector
based on priority and need; and (iii) prioritize investments in the sector. In the areas of facilitation
and monitoring, MoAFWE needs to: (i) provide coaching for WEs and IWCs including technical
advice; (ii) provide technical and financial supervision of WEs; and (iii) monitor plans for future
development and expansion.

Aware of the above risks, the government of fYR Macedonia has requested Bank support to build
capacity within the Water Management Directorate of the MoAFWE to effectively support and


                                                  19

oversee the establishment of IWCs and WEs and monitor their performance as well as to carry
out planning of water resources in the country. This support will be provided under the already
approved FY07 Agriculture Strengthening and Accession Project.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      Bank Performance

(a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank performance during preparation of the Project is rated moderately satisfactory. While
the Bank team understood well the problems that exist in the Irrigation sub-sector in fYR
Macedonia, and tried to design a Project to improve the sustainability of the irrigation sub-sector
by proposing to rehabilitate the infrastructure and support initiatives to increase efficiency of
irrigation management, a long time elapsed between the approval of the Project Concept and the
Board's approval, almost 25 months. Although detailed preparation was imperative, the long
preparation should have been avoided since agreements among institutions and stakeholders tend
to change in a period of 2-3 years as institutional power structures and relations change.

The 1998 Water Law, which was at the core of the institutional reform to be supported by the
Project, should have been subject to a closer review and scrutiny by the Bank team as well as
stakeholder consultation. The Bank should have insisted on having a say on the Water Law and
its by-laws and regulations.

The Bank also should have been less ambitious in its targets for 90 percent cost recovery of
operation and maintenance cost of irrigation systems within a 5-year period and full reinstatement
of irrigation services in about 26,400 ha within a 10-year period. Given the Bank's global
experience in the irrigation sector, it is hard to explain why the Bank team set and agreed to such
ambitious targets.

(b)      Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance in supervision is rated satisfactory. Given the pilot and experimental
nature of several critical components, the Project required intense supervision and follow up by
the Bank during the first two years of implementation. The Bank (in some cases jointly with the
government of The Netherlands and FAO) undertook regular supervision and policy dialogue,
field visits, and spot checks of rehabilitation works and development of WUAs.

The Project launching mission took place in October 1997 to assess the PMT strength, review the
first year annual plan, and assist PMT in preparing Terms of Reference for several technical
studies to be implemented during the first year. In addition, a workshop was conducted during
this mission to strengthen and review the procedures for procurement and disbursement.

Subsequently, on average three Bank missions per calendar year (above Bank-wide's average)
were conducted over the duration of Project implementation. Supervision missions were regular
and identified critical problems as early as possible and cooperated with the PMU in seeking



                                                   20

solutions and improving implementation. The MTR was used to appropriately restructure the
Project, and this together with the frequent supervision mission between the MTR and the second
restructuring of the Project in 2004 contributed to the advancement of the Project's objectives and
substantial implementation progress. More intensive supervision in the following years would
have contributed even greater to fully achieve the PDOs. In general, the supervision team had a
good measure of continuity.

The Bank was also fully involved in policy dialogue with all stakeholders and advised the
government of fYR Macedonia on the legal reform of the irrigation sub-sector. The laws on WEs
and IWCs enabled the establishment of the WEs and IWCs respectively, and allowed these
institutions to take over the managerial responsibilities for the irrigation facilities.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is rated satisfactory.             Through Project preparation and
implementation, the Bank team was continuously engaged in intensive monitoring as well as
timely advice on both Project implementation and policy development.                 The collaboration
between the Bank and the Borrower, particularly the PMT/PMU has been valuable and critical for
the Project's success. In addition, the assistance and co-financing received from the government
of The Netherlands greatly helped with the realization of the reforms, especially for coverage of
the severance payments which were a key part of the reform package. The government of The
Netherlands funded one third (US$11.98M) of the total Project costs on a grant basis. Besides the
physical rehabilitation works support, significant funds from The Netherlands grant (US$2.6M)
were reallocated to enable the fundamental institutional reforms which involved liquidation of the
former WMOs and establishment of WEs in the three schemes (i.e., Tikves, Bregalnica and
Polog). Additionally, the government of The Netherlands strongly supported the government of
fYR Macedonia efforts to expand the reforms throughout the sector and agreed to support
liquidation of three additional WMOs (i.e., Resen, Kicevo and Struga) outside of the original
Project scope.

5.2      Borrower Performance

(a)      Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower's performance during preparation is rated satisfactory. It committed as many
resources as was feasible to the preparation effort, was well organized and took an active role in
preparing the Project. The Borrower finalized the draft of the Law on Water prior to appraisal,
and the Law was approved by the Parliament prior to Project effectiveness.

During the implementation phase, the Borrower provided full support and counterpart funding
throughout the implementation of the Project. However, it should be noted that there were some
issues that caused implementation delays, as stated in Sections 6 and 7. Nevertheless, the
government of fYR Macedonia gradually learned lessons and once the relevant changes to the
legal framework were made, funding was secured to retrench redundant WMOs staff; the
government of fYR Macedonia demonstrated its full commitment to accelerate Project
implementation and restructure the 9 WMOs in the Project areas. Furthermore, the government
of fYR Macedonia scaled up the restructuring of the irrigation sub-sector outside the Project


                                                 21

areas, and other 3 WMOs were restructured into IWCs and UIWCs prior to the closing of the
Project. The scaling up of the reform to the entire country will be supported by the FY07
Agriculture Strengthening and Accession Project.

(b)      Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Originally a small PMT in MoAFWE was established, which was later converted to a larger PMU
more detached from MoAFWE to better manage and administer the Project, given MoAFWE's
limited capacity and in accordance with WB procedures. Throughout Project implementation, the
PMU played a catalytic role in achieving the Project's objectives. Staffed with fully qualified and
motivated professionals, the PMU was very active in carrying out their various tasks effectively
and in proposing solutions when challenges arose. However, it has been observed that MoAFWE
relied completely on the PMU for implementation of this Project. Now, the challenge is to
mainstream the experience and expertise acquired by the PMU into the MoAFWE structure.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall performance of the Borrower is rated as satisfactory because despite the slow beginning
of the Project and the challenges relating to the institutional reforms before 2003, the Borrower
remained committed to the successful implementation of the Project and made advances to the
best of their ability. Overall, the Borrower's execution of the Project was adequate and the
Borrower's commitment to the PDOs was unwavering. Very importantly, once the legal reform
took effect, during the final two and a half years of Project implementation, the political will and
full support of the MoAFWE appreciably helped accelerate Project implementation.

6.       Lessons Learned

The main lessons drawn from the implementation of this Project are the following:

Farmers' participation in the design of rehabilitation works and management of irrigation system
is a pre-requisite for achieving sustainability in the irrigation sub-sector. Although the Project
limited rehabilitation works to structures with the highest potential economic benefit at the time
when agriculture was in decline, it should have placed greater emphasis on farmers' consultation
on the design of the proposed works and farmers' participation in financing these schemes. For
future support of the sector, a demand-driven approach should therefore be considered where
farmers will need to be more involved in the decision-making processes and contribute a portion
of the costs for investment, rehabilitation, etc. The Project has also demonstrated that improving
participation by farmers and water user stakeholders into the decision-making process increases
cost recovery for water services.

Decentralization of irrigation management is a long and continuous process. Although the
process of decentralization in irrigation management has gained some momentum, this takes time
and it is imperative to be patient, consistent and continue to support, monitor the performance and
build the capacity of new organizations, e.g., IWCs, WEs, UIWCs, responsible for operation and
maintenance of irrigation/water management structures. This is a long and slow process.




                                                  22

Government's commitment is imperative. It is very important that the government of fYR
Macedonia remains true to the reform process to create confidence and political support for
improving the irrigation sub-sector. Often changes in policy following a political/election cycle
send conflicting or wrong signals and undermine the process.

Irrigation is only one input to increasing agriculture productivity.         Increased agricultural
productivity and farm incomes will not be fully realized by irrigation improvements alone.
Consideration must be given to supporting equitable access to (the former agro-kombinat) land,
market organization, agriculture policies and institutional changes that must also be made to boost
the benefits of reliable and cost-effective irrigation services. The irrigation rehabilitation and
reforms will facilitate faster recovery of productivity once those other constraints are overcome.

Implementation through Project Implementation Units can reduce potential impacts on
institutional development. The experience of implementing the Project through a PMT/PMU,
although largely shielded from excessive political influences and was an appropriate arrangement
at the time, its use illustrates the dangers of eroding the institutional capacity of the central
government. Although reforms in the sector have pushed responsibility for irrigation and water
management towards local entities, who are best placed to be responsive to their clients, the
government of fYR Macedonia still needs to be able to effectively function as a regulator and
have the capacity to ensure that its policies are implemented.

7.       Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)      Borrower/implementing agencies

The following is the summary of the MoAFWE's input to the ICRR.

The outcome of the Project is appreciated, and the government of fYR Macedonia would like to
extend its commitment to the expansion and acceleration of the institutional reform. The Project
is consistent with the government's priorities and CAS objectives and the initial objectives of the
Project were coherent with the state and development of the sector. In this context, the Project is
credited with providing a considerable contribution towards the rehabilitation of hectares of
irrigation in three priority areas ­ Tikves, Bregalnica and Polog.           The Project has also
significantly supported the process of institutional reforms in the irrigation sub-sector. The
Project has made an important contribution to improve irrigation management sustainability
through the transfer of operation and maintenance responsibilities of irrigation works, main
canals and reservoirs to WEs and secondary and tertiary systems to IWCs as well as contributed
to the increased management capacity of these organizations. It is a positive fact that cost for
irrigation water has decreased and the financial contribution paid by users for irrigation water has
increased significantly during the recent years.        However, for a considerable part of the
rehabilitated surface, irrigated area was not increased during the 2005 and 2006 seasons.
Particular issues are: overall environment not prepared for new organization and functioning of
WEs and IWCs; lingering external factors affecting WE management; reforms in irrigation not
followed up with other transformations in the agricultural sector; under-reporting of irrigation;
good rainfall; and agricultural market constraints.

The Project has given important support to: (i) the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure; (ii)
the restructuring of WMOs and their transformation into WEs; (iii) the increase of participation of
farmers' in irrigation management through the establishment of IWCs.               The Project has
demonstrated that inclusion of stakeholders and beneficiaries in the planning and management of
interventions has a positive impact on the efficiency of use of funds and improves irrigation


                                                  23

management. However, completion of reform and achievement of sustainability in this sub-
sector needs further improvement, especially as regards to:

         (a)     Improvement of legal framework in the water sector, especially in terms of
                 consistency among the various pieces of law and better definition of
                 competencies and responsibilities of actors involved in the sector.

         (b)     Increase of the role and responsibilities of MoAFWE for facilitation and
                 regulation of the irrigation sub-sector.

         (c)     Further enhancement of the management skills of WEs and IWCs.

         (d)     Support for complementary agricultural measures.

On institutional arrangements, the Project implementation may have been overly dependent on
the PMU, and in the future, more close collaboration with the line department (Department of
Water Economy in MoAFWE, in particular) would be necessary.

The reform in the irrigation sub-sector should continue and participatory management should be
introduced in the rest of the country. Investments should be prioritized based on economics and
demand of end users. MoAFWE appreciates the strong support and efforts the World Bank and
expect that the World Bank will continue to be a reliable, long-term partner and will support the
forthcoming reforms in the agriculture sector while preparing the country for EU accession.

(b)      Cofinanciers

The following is a summary of The Netherlands Embassy's comments on the draft ICRR. The
full set of comments is presented in Annex 8.

The outcomes of the Project are of great significance to the overall reform and development of
the agricultural sector in fYR Macedonia. The Project indeed contributed towards enabling
farmers to fully regain the potential of the irrigated agriculture sector (e.g., reliable irrigation
services provided, irrigated areas for higher value crops expanded, water costs substantially
reduced, agriculture productivity and farm income increased) and to enhance sustainability and
efficiency of the irrigation schemes, which were part of this Project (e.g., participatory
management introduced, improved cost recovery, reduced operational costs, and improved
financial viability of the WEs).

The Embassy of The Netherlands acknowledges that in the original design, the Project mainly
focused on the physical rehabilitation of the irrigation networks, while the institutional reform
played subsidiary role. The lack of the institutional reform during the initial phase of the Project
led to further deterioration of the financial situation of the former WMOs and the outcomes
achieved under the Project in terms of the network rehabilitation were put at jeopardy. As a
result, the Bank rated the project unsatisfactory for almost two years and at one point cancellation
of the Project was considered by the Bank and the government of The Netherlands.

In view of the importance of the reforms in the irrigation sub-sector and in view of the fact that
the government of fYR Macedonia indicated a strong commitment to implement fundamental
instructional reforms, the Project was significantly restructured in mid-2004. The government of
The Netherlands was very instrumental in these efforts.         Apart from the farmers and the
agrokombinats, the government of The Netherlands wishes to also recognise some other


                                                  24

beneficiaries from the Project, in particular after the Project restructuring in 2004, namely the
former employees of the WMOs. Significant social costs (i.e., salary, pension and health
contribution arrears) for the WMOs employees were settled as part of the Project. Furthermore,
the employees at the newly established WEs benefited from the training provided through the
Project, which enabled them to strengthen their management, planning, budgeting accounting
skills and to improve the efficiency of the management of the irrigation schemes.

The government of The Netherlands recognises that the Project laid an important foundation for
the development of a framework for continuous reform of the irrigation sub-sector, and
commends the PDOs that were achieved, in particular since 2004 until Project closure. However,
ensuring of the irrigation management sustainability remains an issue for consideration after
Project closure. To that end, it is important that the Bank more extensively notes and evaluates
the consequences of events (e.g., politicization of the election of the new management of the
WEs) that can jeopardize the sustainability of the Project outcomes.

                                Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: System Rehabilitation

Tikves Irrigation Scheme. This comprised carrying out repairs and replacement of damaged
portions of the Tikves Irrigation Scheme including: (i) repairs to the system intake tunnel; (ii)
rehabilitation of canals; (iii) repairs to irrigation system structures; and (iv) replacement of
damaged pipes, hydrants and valves of the buried pipe distribution system.

Works completed are: (i) rehabilitation of the intake tunnel Tisovec-shaft and hydro mechanical
equipment; (ii) rehabilitation of 86 km main canal and one branch canal; (iii) rehabilitation of
Makarija siphon and Marena siphon as well as rehabilitation of 3 pump stations with 10 pumps
and pre-seasonal maintenance of the main canals; (iv) replacement of damaged pipes, hydrants
and valves of the buried pipe distribution system in 32 IWCs; and (v) installation of 62
measurement devices and shafts.

Bregalnica Irrigation Scheme. This composed repairs and replacement of damaged portions of
the Bregalnica Irrigation Scheme including: (i) repairs to the Kalimanci Dam; (ii) rehabilitation of
canals; and (iii) rehabilitation of the distribution network.

From this sub-component completed works are: (i) rehabilitation of Kalimanci Dam weir crest
and injection works in control gallery; (ii) rehabilitation of 55.5 km main canals, rehabilitation of
Orizarska reka siphon and Zletovska reka siphon and pre-seasonal maintenance of the main
canals; (iii) rehabilitation of the distribution network in 22 IWCs; and (iv) placement of 67
measurement devices and shafts (one joint with Tikves).

Polog Irrigation Scheme. This comprised repairs and replacement of damaged portions of the
Polog Irrigation Scheme including: (i) rehabilitation of canals; (ii) improvement of pipe network;
and (iii) rehabilitation of the distribution network.

Under this sub-component completed works are: (i) rehabilitation of 21 km of main canals,
rehabilitation of 1 pumping station with 3 pumps and pre-seasonal maintenance of the main
canals in Tetovo and Gostivar; (ii) improvement of pipe network and rehabilitation of the
distribution network in 40 IWCs; and (iii) placement of 8 measurement devices and shafts.

Component 2: Institutional Development

This component included the following sub-components: (a) a pilot water users association
(WUA) program; (b) pilot improved water management; (c) pilot self-help rehabilitation; (d) a
mathematical modeling of water resources in Bregalnica and Polog Scheme; and (e) technical
assistance for the ongoing reorganization of the water management organizations (WMOs).

Sub-component (a).       It comprised the provision of technical assistance and training to the
participating WMOs and WUAs, in carrying out a pilot water users' association program. The
original project target was to establish seven WUAs by the time of the mid-term review, and then,
having demonstrated their viability, to adopt WUAs as part of the strategy for restructuring the
sector, with transfer of the distribution networks into their responsibility. Despite considerable
resistance from all stakeholders, the Project managed to achieve the target, and eventually WUAs
were accepted by the government of fYR Macedonia as partners for WMOs. The mid-term
review recommended expansion of the WUA program to 59 WUAs, covering 37,000 ha across
the three schemes. By the summer of 2003, the Project had established only 27 WUAs with


                                                   27

5,690 ha and 7,090 members-farmers, and more importantly, an adverse climate for these young
organizations was developing and intervention from WMOs and others had reduced the number
of WUAs actually operating to about half.

With the adoption of the new Law on Irrigation Water Communities (July 2003), in 2004 this
sub-component was re-designed to support the establishment IWCs instead of WUAs across all
three schemes. The Project provided five categories of support: (i) technical assistance; (ii)
mapping; (iii) training; (iv) equipment (in Polog only); and (v) design and supervision of network
rehabilitation. By Project closure, 95 IWCs were established in the Project areas covering 48,600
ha gross area with 32,000 members, of which, 73 IWCs cover 39,640 ha within irrigation
schemes and 22 IWCs cover 8,971 ha in independent irrigation schemes. Training was also
provided to IWCs regarding their establishment and functioning. Annual regional and national
seminars were held; monthly bulletins and newspaper articles published; and mass-media clips
aired.

This sub-component also later supported the liquidation of WMOs and the establishment of new
Water Economies (WE) following the restructuring in 2004 onwards. Support included: (i)
technical assistance support for Wes; (ii) training for WE staff and Board member; and (iii)
essential equipment for WEs. All legal documentation and operational regulations as well as
budgets and service fees calculations were prepared by the PMT to commissioning of the WEs.
The following essential equipment was provided to WEs: (i) 4 four wheel-drive vehicles, 2 for
each WE; (ii) motorcycles, 10 for each WE; and (iii) computers (with printers and software) to
manage the client services, accounts, technical engineering matters, 2 each per WE and radio
communications (1 set for each WE).

Training was also provided to WEs staff and members of WEs boards. Collection rates from
farmers improved significantly ­ the collection rates from IWCs in Tikves were 87 percent and
81 percent respectively for 2005 and 2006 compared to other users, which were 12 percent and 15
percent respectively for the same years. In Bregalnica collection rates from IWCs were 65
percent for 2006 and 67 percent for 2005.

Sub-component (b). It comprised the provision of technical assistance and training for members
of WUAs in improved water management. The program was revised to focus on: (i) installing
measuring equipment at the main and branch canals in order to enable WMOs to charge water
users on a volumetric basis to WUAs; (ii) providing WMOs with the SIMIS computer software
application to improve water management; and (iii) training on improved irrigation techniques for
selected IWCs. With the abolition of the WMOs, the possibility of using the water management
computer application as management tools was lost.

Sub-component (c). It composed the pilot self-help rehabilitation. This was cancelled in 2000
during mid-term review since no progress was made up to that time due to delays in establishing
IWCs. The funds for this sub-component were transferred to the rehabilitation of distribution
networks.

Sub component (d). It included the preparation of a detailed study on water management for the
three schemes. This sub component was completed by the consulting firm, Arcadis and included
the preparation of two comprehensive water resources management modeling studies for
Bregalnica system and for the Polog system. Unfortunately, the developed models were not
mainstreamed within the WMOs and/or the Water Economy Management Department of the
MoAFWE, and were never used as decision-making tools.



                                                28

Sub component (e).       It comprised technical assistance to the MoAFWE for the ongoing
reorganization of all WMOs in fYR Macedonia. The scope of the original technical assistance
was to be limited support to MoAFWE for restructuring the WMOs in accordance with the 1998
Water Law. At mid-term review, this was modified substantially, given the political difficulties
experienced in restructuring WMOs. At mid-term review, the Project had so far provided the
following two inputs:      (a) financial audits; and (b) technical assistance for developing an
institutional framework for the irrigation sector. The following new activities were then proposed
for this sub-component: (i) support for developing a legal framework for WMO/PWME
restructuring; (ii) development of business plans; (iii) introduction of financial control; and (iv)
support for developing a maintenance plan. The proposed total cost of these activities was
US$283,000. In so doing, the Project was placed at the centre of the reform process, and
provided crucial support for the process. Technical assistance was provided for the development
of a suitable legal framework, business plans and detailed proposals for establishing the new
Water Economies.

A key output from the Project was the assistance regarding of the two pieces of enabling
legislation: the Law on Irrigation Water Communities for the establishment of new Irrigation
Water Communities, addressing the weaknesses in the 1998 Water Law and 1998 Law on
Association of Citizens and foundations regarding WUA formation (this became law on 31/7/03);
and the Law on Water Economies for the establishment of new Water Economies to replace the
defective WMOs (this became law on 29/12/03).

The following guidelines were prepared under the Project: (i) scope for establishment of IWCs
with transfer of irrigation management; (ii) structure of water charges; (iii) management plans for
the new WEs; and (iv) 3-year business plans for the liquidation of WMOs. The Project provided
assistance to WMOs on specific technical skills: (i) training on financial management including
international operational guidelines and financial standards; (ii) software, database development
and computer skills training including cataloging irrigation infrastructure with condition,
maintenance requirements etc.; and (iii) training in the preparation of maintenance plans. In
addition the Project provided computers, printers, software, fax and copiers to the WMOs.

Following the restructuring in 2004, the Project financed part of the severance payments and
salary areas of 724 employees of eleven WMOs in Tikves, Bregalnica, Polog, Kicevo, Resen and
Struga to be liquidated in accordance with the Law on Water Economies. The financial support
amounted to US$2.8 million. The Project also provided training for WEs and Board members,
equipment as well as working capital in the amount of US$0.52 million.

Component 3: Technical Studies

This component comprised provision of technical assistance and minor field equipment in order
to conduct studies on dam safety, algae and repair of the irrigation systems in the Project areas.
The algae study was completed with EU-PHARE support. While the study identified algae
species that infested the schemes, it failed to recommend concrete treatment to control the weed.
After the inconclusive EU-funded study, physical control techniques were investigated and
piloted (i.e., weed-eating fish in the canals). The dam design flood study was cancelled. The
alternative alignment for Tikves dam off-take tunnel was commissioned but early findings led to
the cancellation of the study.




                                                 29

Component 4: Project Administration and Monitoring

This component comprises provision of technical assistance, equipment and vehicles for the
PMT/PMU to carry out Project implementation and supervise design and construction under the
Project. Technical assistance to PMT/PMU was provided by international consultants during the
period 1999-2003, particularly in procurement, financial management, general management as
well as monitoring, e.g., base line survey in 2000 and crop budget survey (2000-2003).
Computers and other office equipment were also provided as well as 2 vehicles and 3 four-wheel
drive vehicles.

Component 5: Implementation Support

Financial support to cover incremental operating expenses to participating WMOs implementing
the pilot WUAs program was provided for 2 years. This component was cancelled in 2001, when
the WMOs were subject to restructuring, and the activities incorporated into Component 2.

                        Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Project has provided support to enable private farmers to regain the potential of irrigated
agriculture sector through the rehabilitation of three deteriorated irrigation schemes and to
enhance the sustainability and efficiency of irrigation schemes through the introduction of
participatory management.      The economic analysis in the SAR focused on quantifying the
economic benefits derived primarily from increases in agriculture production due to increase in
yields with secure irrigation water for currently non-irrigated or poorly irrigated area, prevention
of the future decline of irrigation areas through improvements in the physical infrastructure, and
conversion to higher value crops die to the increase in availability and reliability of irrigation
water.

The economic rate of return (ERR) of the entire Project, based on incremental benefits and costs
and including all costs of institutional development, technical studies and administration, was
estimated at 29 percent and the net present value (NPV) at US$37.8 million at 12 percent
discount rate of return.

The economic analysis in the SAR rests on the following assumptions.

Irrigated land with and without Project scenarios were estimated as follows:

Cropping patterns, yields, crop budget models were estimated for the with-Project and without-
Project scenarios. The gross margin were calculated for irrigated areas with sufficient water and
irrigated areas with insufficient water and rainfed areas as follows:

Based on the crop budget survey conducted for the years 2004-2006, which shows substantial
increase in crop yields and conversion to high-value crops, the following average gross margins
were derived per hectare of production.

                                      Conditions         Gross Margin (US$/ha)

Assuming that the conversion to high-value crops and increased in yields are due to the Project,
and based on the 2006 situation (total area irrigated under high-value crops, low-value crops, area
under rainfed and fallow land) and the gross margin values presented above, the following annual
agriculture benefits are derived the situation with-Project and without-Project in constant 2006
prices. The calculations below also assume that by year 2011, the area under irrigation will
experience a 30 percent increase over the 2006 situation, totaling about 13,780 ha ­ about half the
total area rehabilitated under the Project. This is a very conservative assumption.

With regard to the costs, total Project expenditures in US dollars from 1998 to 2007 have been
converted to 2007 prices using consumer index prices and exchange rates published by the State
Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia. Since expenditures include value added taxes, a
conversion factor of 0.85 is used to reflect expenditures net of taxes. The stream of investment
costs in constant 2006 prices is shown below.

                            Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

After Project closure, the Bank team commissioned a low-cost survey of about 150 farm
households in the three Project areas, which was carried out in February 2007. The survey
indicates that the Project impacts so far have been substantial.

Overall crop yields have increased following improvements in water delivery

Average yields for the various crops in each of the Project areas were calculated using reported
survey data. A comparison of yields from survey data and those reported in the SAR at the time
of appraisal is presented below.

                   Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

During the course of the ICR mission, a Stakeholder Evaluation Workshop was held in Skopje on
November 8, 2006, which attracted over 50 participants representing MoAFWE, WEs, IWCs,
UIWCs and WMOs still under liquidation. The workshop was opened by H.E. Aco Spasenoski,
encouraging participants to reflect on project implementation and identify weakness and
constraint that need to be addressed to foster the reform in the irrigation sector. The World Bank
Country Manager, Sandra Bloemenkamp, kindly gave the closing remarks and presented Project
accomplishments and findings.

The workshop provided an opportunity to get a retrospective evaluation of the implementation of
this project and to extract lessons learned from this operation. The participants concluded that the
reform initiated under the IRPP must be sustained and continue, and identified as the key issues
and challenges that need to be addressed in the future the following:

Within the irrigation sector

·       Building capacity within the MoAFWE to provide information and technical support to
        water users groups and monitor the irrigation sector.
·       Strengthening of water users groups, who have large needs for quality advice on legal
        and technical issues, planning and financing, must continue.
·       Continuing providing support for rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure that responds
        to the needs of the IWCs.
·       Formulating and adopting an Irrigation Strategy and Action Plan, with clear goals,
        objectives, targets, actions and responsibilities, to be subject to broad public consultation.
·       Amending the Law on Water Economies and Law on Irrigation Water Communities to
        address already identified weakness in the legal and institutional framework, namely,
        clarification of the role of the UIWCs, transfer of infrastructure, transparency and
        governance structure of WEs, financial management obligations of WEs and IWCs,
        funding for public functions performed by WEs, among others.
·       Supporting under IPA program for Rural Development agriculture water management
        measures that stimulate production of high-value crops.
·       Strengthening communication between WEs, IWCs, UIWCs through training and
        technical assistance.
·       Supporting establishment of an umbrella national FIWC to facilitate exchange of
        experience among IWCs, formulate and recommend changes in policies to the
        government of fYR Macedonia and lobby for the interest of water users groups.
·       Reviewing cost-allocation and cost-sharing arrangements for public good functions (such
        as management of large multi-purpose water infrastructure) performed by WEs and
        UIWCs.

Outside the irrigation sector

·       Improving the capacity of agriculture institutions to supporting the well-functioning of
        the agriculture sector, including access to rural credit, support for marketing, access to
        extension services and advice, which will promote better utilization of irrigated area.
·       Completing land reform, which is also preventing large areas with access to irrigation are
        put into productive use.
·       Ensuring that the overall legal and institutional frameworks for water resources
        management and irrigation management are consistent.

       Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICRR

SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR

The Project design with its size and content was first project of this type in Macedonia. The
Project design fully met the Government of fYR Macedonia and World Bank objectives to
respond to the needs and priorities of beneficiaries through irrigation infrastructure and water
delivery services, capacity building, and facilitating the transition from old set up-WMOs to
participatory management with WES and IWCs.

The project design was also essential in providing a basis and guiding project activities for
translating and developing national policy into effective and sustainable programs at the local
level through strengthened institutional structures, improved governance and an operationally
strong operator with irrigation infrastructure.

Regular supervision missions (23 in total) have been conducted during the lifetime of the Project,
reviewing the ongoing and future activities, and we appreciate the support given by the task team
leader and the Bank during the mission towards achieving the Project goals. An in-depth
assessment on the Project activities was carried out during the Mid-term Review mission in 2000
and restructuring mission in 2004, and the Project was restructured on both occasions so that it
could better assist and bridge the reform of the irrigation sub-sector.

The impression, however, is that this Project started with too ambitious aims and many complex
components. Existence of proper legal framework is most important to provide essential basis for
defining sector objectives, priorities in its development as well as setting out and monitoring
activities per responsible institutions of any sector. Implementation of legal framework is even
more important especially in the case where such a framework defines the establishment of new
institutions and transformation of old ones.

Nevertheless, through the reform process, which promoted direct and active participation of end
users in the management of infrastructure and related services, demonstrated improvements in: (i)
relations between service providers and end users; (ii) cost recovery; and (iii) behavior of farmers
for infrastructure management. The rehabilitation of infrastructure initially focused on main
infrastructure, was the proper approach and all users in the schemes had positive impacts from it
as they received water on time (and with reduced volume loss), but rehabilitation of distribution
network which was carried out in the second stage was more important for farmers as it improved
delivery of water in the field and as it was more visible for them.

The operation of the Bank during course of the Project implementation is assessed as efficient,
useful and supportive by all institutions that participated in the project implementation. During
implementation, the Project was regularly monitored by the Bank missions, assessing the status of
the Project components, counterpart's inputs, definition, scheduling and budgeting of Project
program.

Through Project implementation, a lot knowledge and experience for the irrigation sub-sector has
been obtained in cooperation with operators and end users. The reforms started in irrigation sub-
sector should continue and participatory management should be introduced in the rest of the
country. To make irrigation schemes more efficient and more widely used, MoAFWE policy
should introduce agricultural measures which will increase irrigation area with high valley crops.
Rehabilitation of main irrigation infrastructure in multipurpose schemes should continue as the



                                                 40

benefits are much broader. Prioritization of investments should be lead by economics and demand
of end users.

It is our pleasure to say that we appreciate the strong support and efforts the World Bank extends
to the government of fYR Macedonia. We are convinced the World Bank will continue to be a
reliable partner on a long-term base and will support the forthcoming reforms in the Agriculture,
preparing the country for the pre-accession EU funds.

     Annex 8. Comments of the Government of The Netherlands ­ Main Project
                                            Cofinancier


The paragraphs below contain the unedited version of the comments of the Government of The
Netherlands on the draft version of the ICRR dated June 7, 2007, received on July 12, 2007.

QUOTE

The outcomes of the project are of great significance to the overall reform and development of the
agricultural sector in Macedonia. The project indeed contributed towards enabling farmers to
fully regain the potential of the irrigated agriculture sector (e.g. reliable irrigation services
provided; irrigated areas for higher value crops expanded; water costs substantially reduced,
agriculture productivity and farm income increased) and to enhance sustainability and efficiency
of the irrigation schemes which were part of the project (participatory management introduced;
improved cost recovery; reduced operational costs; improved financial viability of the WEs).

The Embassy acknowledges that in the original design, the project mainly focused on the physical
rehabilitation of the irrigation networks, while the institutional reform played subsidiary role.
The lack of the institutional reform during the initial phase of the project led to further
deterioration of the financial situation of the former WMOs and the outcomes achieved under the
project in terms of the network rehabilitation were put at jeopardy. As a result, the Bank rated the
project unsatisfactory for almost two years and at one point cancellation of the project was
considered by the Bank and the Netherlands.

In view of the importance of the reforms in this sector and in view of the fact that GoM indicated
a strong commitment to implement fundamental instructional reforms, the project was
significantly restructured in mid 2004. The Netherlands was very instrumental in these efforts.
As one of the main co-financiers, the Netherlands funded one third (US$ 11.98 mill) of the total
project costs on a grant basis. Besides the physical rehabilitation works support, significant funds
from the Dutch grant (US$ 2.6 mill.) were reallocated to enable fundamental institutional reforms
in the sector which involved liquidation of the former WMOs and establishment of WEs in the
three schemes (Tikves, Bregalnica and Polog). Additionally, the Netherlands strongly supported
the GoM efforts to expand the reforms throughout the sector and agreed to support liquidation of
3 additional WMOs (Resen, Kicevo and Struga) outside of the original project scope. In view of
the above, the Embassy feels that clearer reference to the importance of the Netherlands
contribution for the success of the project should be made in the ICRR. The project restructuring
and the outcomes would have not been possible without strong and committed support by the
Netherlands.

The ICRR recognizes that the direct beneficiaries (point 1.4 Beneficiaries) from the project were
the farmers and the agrokombinats. Somehow, the report misses to recognise that beneficiaries
from the project, in particular after the project restructuring in 2004, were also the former
employees of the WMOs. Significant social costs (i.e. salary, pension and health contribution
arrears) for the WMOs employees were settled as part of the project. Furthermore, the employees
at the newly established WEs benefited from the training provided through the project which
enabled them to strengthen their management, planning, budgeting accounting skills and to
improve the efficiency of the management of the irrigation schemes. The Embassy recommends
that these categories of project beneficiaries are adequately recognised in the ICRR.




                                                  42

The ICRR outlines a comprehensive list of factors that affected the project implementation (point
2.2 Implementation). The Embassy concurs to a large extent with the ICRR findings. However,
the Embassy notes that more frequent supervision and closer follow up by the Bank staff would
have been needed in view of the fact that this was a very large and a complex project for
implementation.     This remark refers in particular for the second phase of the project
implementation (after 2004) when critical reforms took place.

Related to the project implementation, the Embassy would like to note the frequent delays in
processing of the withdrawal requests of the PMU which slowed down the spending of the Dutch
grant. While the Embassy had a confirmation of its transfers to the general TF account, PMU's
withdrawal requests were refused by WB administration, with various explanations (e.g. funds
were still not available; cost categories were not in line with the legal documents etc.). The time
needed for transfer of funds from the general TF account to specific project accounts was
unnecessarily prolonged due to the lack of communication between the various Bank's
departments. Only after Embassy's intervention, the disbursements have been speeded up and
completed (e.g. working capital for the WEs).

In addition, even though a requirement for frequent reporting for the progress in project
implementation (i.e. quarterly progress reports) was agreed upon (refer to the Administrative
Arrangement), the Embassy faced a constant delay in the reports submission. Usually, progress
reports were delayed for two or three quarters and only after numerous reminders, the Bank
furnished the reports to the Embassy. The same should be noted for audit reports. On the other
hand, the Embassy recognises the Bank responsiveness with regard to the regular supervision
missions debriefings and the willingness to share Aide-Memoires with the Embassy.

The Embassy understands that there have been certain allegations for irregularities in the IRRP
implementation and that an investigation has being performed by the Bank's Department of
Institutional Integrity. Based on this Department's report, the Embassy recommends that
appropriate follow-up actions are taken.

The Embassy recognises that the project laid an important foundation for the development of a
framework for continuous reform of the irrigation sub sector. The Embassy commends the
project development objectives that were achieved in particular since 2004 until the closure of the
project. However, ensuring of the irrigation management sustainability remains an issue for
consideration following the closure of the project. The Embassy concurs with the number of
challenges for sustaining of the reforms in the irrigation sector that were identified in the ICRR
(point 2.5 Post-completion operation/Next Phase). It also acknowledges the need to amend the
laws (Law on WEs and Law on IWCs) and to facilitate MAFWE to build capacity for the Water
Management Directorate to oversee and lead the reform in this sub sector in the future. Retaining
some of the qualified and professional PMU staff within the MAFWE would have been beneficial
in this regard. In view of the fact that the WEs and IWCs are still in precarious situation since
they have been operating under the new concept for only year a half, the need for further support
for WEs and IWCs is also highly recognised by the Embassy.

To that end, it is important that the Bank more extensively notes and evaluates the consequences
of the events that have been and still can jeopardize the sustainability of the project outcomes.
This not only as an accountability towards donor but also as lessons learned for the on going and
planned projects in the Republic of Macedonia. Already various reports suggest that some of the
reforms undertaken to ensure institutional and financial viability and sustainability of the WEs
(Tikves and Bregalnica) have been jeopardized through the high degree of politicization of the
election of the new management of the WEs (e.g. Boards of Users). The Embassy recommends to


                                                43

the Bank to undertake activities to protect the results of the irrigation sector reform already
achieved, and thus to evaluate the issues related to the election of the new WEs management and
to inform the Embassy about the results of the evaluation. In view of the fact that the Bank will
remain involved in the expansion of the irrigation sector reforms through the support of the new
agriculture project, the Embassy recommends that the Bank ensures continuation of the reforms
in the irrigation sector in a sustainable manner under the new operation in the agriculture sector.
