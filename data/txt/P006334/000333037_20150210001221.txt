                                  INTRODUCTION

0.01       The proposed New Settlements project constitutes the third phase of
the Integrated Northwest Region Development Program (POLONOROESTE) underway
with Bank financing.l/ The project seeks an answer both to Rondonia's need
to provide adequate land, facilities and assistance to its immigrants and to
Brazil's  more general need to evolve comprehensive and cost-effective
settlement and environmental protection methods for the development of its
vast, presently unoccupied and fragile Amazon region. Preliminary government
plans for new settlements to be implemented within this project were
presented to the Bank's Northwest Region Survey mission in November 1979. A
settlement project proposal was subsequently prepared by the National
Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Ref-orm (INCRA), with assistance from
the FAO/CP and guidance from the Federal P'lanning Secretariat (SEPLAN-PR) and
the Superintendency for Economic Development in the Center-West (SUDECO).
Later phases of preparation saw the involvement of the Brazilian Forestry
Development Institute (IBDF), the Superintendency for Rubber Development
 (SUDHEVEA) and the state government of Rondonia.

                         I.    THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR

                        A.    4griculture in the Economy

1.01      Although its relative importance in the Brazilian economy has
gradually declined, agriculture remains an important sector, employing 36% of
Brazil's labor force. It contributes today less than 10% of the total GDP
but more than 40% of total export earnings. Based on 1980 data, some 36% of
Brazil's population of 119 million lived in rural areas, compared to 39% in
1970. There are wide variations in population density among regions, from
1.7 inhabitants per km2 in the North to 56.3 in the Southeast. Of the 306
million ha in agricultural properties, 42 million ha (13.8'.)were in either
annual or perennial crops, 166 million ha (54.1%) were used for livestock,
68 million ha (22.1%) were in forestry operations, and the remaining 31
million ha (10%) were productive but unutilized agricultural land. Large
tracts of land, under federal ownership, remain outside this classification.
With large areas of undeveloped land, BraLzilhas traditionally relied on an
expansion of its development frontiers to increase its agricultural
production. The average annual agricultural growth rate in the 1970-1980
decade was just over 5%. Brazil is the world's largest producer of coffee
and sugar cane, the largest exporter of c:offeeand orange juice, and the
second largest producer of soybeans. Other major agricultural exports
include meat and fish products, cotton, peanuts, cocoa, castor oil and
sisal. In most years, Brazil is self-sufficient in basic foods, except for


     The Northwest Development Program is described in para 3.01 of this
     report. Further details on the area, objectives, strategy, costs and
     expected benefits of the program can be found in the Bank Staff
     Appraisal Report 3512b-BR: "Brazil -- Northwest Region Development
     Program, First Phase - Agricultural Development and Environmental
     Protection Project" - October 30, 1981; and Bank Report 3042a-BR: "The
     Integrated Development of Brazil's Northwest Frontier;` December 23,
     1980.
wheat. Bad crop years result in periodic imports of food crops such as
maize, rice and beans. Natural rubber is also imported. In the recent past,
most of the productivity gains, expansion of production area and increased
market integration have occurred in the south and center-west of the country,
while the north and northeast have largely continued to follcowtraditional
agricultural practices.

                      B. GovernmentAgriculturalPolicies

1.02      Agricultural development is given a key role in the government's
efforts to reduce inflation, through expanded food production, and to improve
the balance-of-payments, through increased production of export crops and
energy substitutes. To help achieve these objectives, the government has
continued its support for special regional programs, despite high inflation
and public sector deficits which have caused restraint in public expenditure
and made it difficult for federal institutions to recruit additional staff
essential to Bank-assisted prolects. The government is gradually reducing
the high agricultural credit subsidies, an instrument used extensively in the
past, but this is done more slowly in the special program areas.

1.03      For the past several years, a minimum price program has set
guaranteed floor prices for 42 commodities commonly grown in Brazil to help
farmers make planting decisions and provide for the establishment of
government stocks. Farmer decisions have proven sensitive to minimum prices,
leading occasionally to insufficient or excessive production of some of the
basic food crops. The Bank and government are cooperating in a review of
agricultural sector policies, including the existing price support system.
The recent evolution of the cruzeiro should encourage farmers to step up
production of export and import-substitution crops.

1.04      A tax on imported rubber has been used to support the price of
natural rubber produced in Brazil (which was set at a level about three times
world prices in 1982). SUDHEVEA justifies the high protection with the
argument that the rubber rehabilitation effort in Brazil is recent, that
measures are being taken in parallel to gradually improve the competitiveness
of the rubber industry, and that rubber could play an important role in the
development of frontier areas of moderate to marginal soil fertility and
fragile ecology. While some degree of protection appears justified, the
present level of protection is expected to decline during the next decade as
domestic production increases.

1.05      Brazilian coffee policies are guided by the international
agreements signed under the aegis of the International Coffee Organization.
During the last two years no official investment credit has been made
available to coffee growers, and there have been more decreases in areas
planted in coffee in frost-prone southern states than increases in other
states. Other coffee policy tools include minimum price guarantees, tree
eradication programs and export taxes. Brazil has a medium term objective of
stabilizing average coffee production around 28 to 30 million bags per year,
implying a peak production potential of 34 to 36 million bags in high-yield
and frost-free years.

                     C. Bank Involvementin the AgriculturalSector

1.06       The Bank has so far made 28 loans, totalling US$1,728.9million,
for agricultureand rural developmentin Brazil. These include one sector
loan for US$303.0 million; three, amounting to US$519.2 million, for
agro-industries;  two, totallingUSS60.5 million, for livestock development;
one for US$18.2 million for grain storage; two amounting to US$100 million
for agriculturalresearch;one for US$100 million to improve agricultural
extension services; arid18, totalling US$628 million, for various settlement,
irrigationand rural developmentprojects, 13 of which are located in the
Northeast2 / and three in the North and Northwest. In addition, there have
been three loans, totallingUS$196 million for fertilizerproduction;a loan
of US$19 million for a nutrition research and developmentproject; three
loans, totallingUS$320 million for secondary and feeder roads; and a loan of
US$32 million for a Northeast basic education project. The Completionand
Project PerformanceAudit Reports issued for the grain storage and livestock
developmentprojects reveal significantdifferenceswhich developed between
the governmentand the Bank regarding intLerest  rate policy, leading to some
cancellationand/or early repayment of the loans. Completionand Project
PerformanceAudit Reports have also been issued for the first agro-industry
project and the Alto Turi Land Settlemenit project. Implementation of the
agro-industryproject was hampered by fresquently  shifting government
policies, which included the developmentof subsidizedcompeting credit
programs. The Alto Turi settlementproject raised settler incomes beyond
expectationsbut was less successfulin the areas of environmental
protection,community organization,and strengthening    of cooperatives.

                                     UI. THE PROJECT AREA

                                              A. General

2.01          The New Settlements         project    area   would    cover     about      1.1 million       ha
in the state of Rondonia, consistingmostly of publicly owned and undeveloped
lands, mainly virgin forest, where, besides some wild rubber tapping,limited
mineral prospectingand a few dispersed extractiveforestry operations,no
systematiceconomic activity is yet taking place (Map 17069 and Table 1).
The present     population   of     the   project    area   is   practically       nil.      In   several
locations,land which has not yet been developed but is under private
ownershipwould have to be recovered by INCRA through existing legislation. A
presidentialdecree authorizingexpropriations  in the areas to be developed
during    the first     two years has already      been signed.     There are no roads into
the proposed      settlement     sites,  which considerably     reduces   the potential     for
undesired    squatting       but also limits   access  for survey    or planning    purposes.
For these reasons,most of the detailed surveying and planningof the project
area would be implementedin parallel to the opening of main access roads
within the settlementsites and would be rapidly followed by plot allocation
to selected settlers. Three of the six sites proposed to be settled (Urupa I

ownership of a second segment of the Urupa site, which had already been
studied. Unless the issue is rapidly resolved, INCRA would settle an
alternative site, Cujubim, located north of Ariquemes. Two more sites,
Capitao Silvio and Marmelo, both along the unpaved segment of BR-364, west of
Porto Velho, have been preliminarily identified as possibly having suitable
soils and are now being studied in greater detail. Identified settlement
sites are either adjacent to earlier settlements or along the BR-364
highway. If detailed surveys were to show that substantial segments of the
proposed sites are not suitable for settlement, and all plann,ed15,000
families could not be settled within the selected areas, discarded segments
could be replaced by new areas, such as Cujubim, which remain, however, to be
studied in greater detail. No Amerindians are known to dwell within the
proposed settlement sites. Moreover, prior to project implementation, formal
consent to the settlement of the sites will, by law, have to be obtained from
the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI). There are, however, Amerindian
reserves in the vicinity of the proposed Machadinho II and Capitao Silvio
sites, and measures to avoid the expansion of settlement areas through
spontaneous squatting beyond official limits will be required from FUNAI and
state government authorities, within the context of the overa:LlNorthwest
Program.

                              B.   Climate and Soils

2.02      The climate in the project area is hot and humid. Temperatures
average 250 C, and annual rainfall ranges from 2,000 mm in Marmelo to 2,600
mm in Machadinho II, with a dry season of three to four months (less than 50
mm rainfall per month) between June and September, coinciding with the cooler
nights of the year. The dry season, with lower relative humidity and
temperature, helps control fungus diseases but also limits the yields of
rubber.

2.03      The project is located in the Amazon plain, where topography is
gently undulating at altitudes between 1.00m and 300 m. The t:errainis often
dissected by streams and rivers. The vegetation is generally dense tropical
forest. Soil quality is quite variable, even over short distances, and
generally lower than in earlier settlement areas. About 5% of the project
area is in Class 1 eutrophic red soils and podsols, capable of sustained
annual or perennial cropping, with low f'ertilizationafter several crops.
These are found mainly in Urupa I and II and, to a lesser extent, Machadinho
I. Class 2 (eutrophic and distrophic red-yellow podsols) and 3 soils
(distinctly more acid distrophic and allic latosols) have more variable
management requirements and cover another 70% of the area. Remaining soils
are unsuitable for agriculture. The cropped area is expected to be
concentrated on Class 1 and 2 soils, with some extension into more acceptable
segments of Class 3 soils. Existing aerial photography and topographical
maps allow a preliminary selection of areas and road layout for settlement
purposes. The project would provide for more detailed surveys.

                         C.   Agriculture in Rondonia

2.04      Agriculture in already settled areas of the region is characterized
by a low level of productivity of land and labor and an inadequate marketing
                                       -5-



network. As in much of Brazil, production increases have been due, almost
exclusively, to the extension of the area planted and a corresponding
increase of labor input. There is less shifting cultivation in Rondonia than
elsewhere in the Amazon and, next to subsistence crops (mainly rice, corn,
beans and cassava), there has been a marlced increase in perennial crops such
as coffee (some 90,000 ha, half arabica and half robusta, at the end of
1982) 3cocoa (some 39,000 ha) and, more recently, rubber (17,000 ha planted
and some 10,000 ha more planned), and in semi-intensive livestock
production. Purchased inputs are rarely used, but their use is now being
promoted through the ongoing Bank-financed agricultural projects in the
Northwest region (para 3.01).

                           D. Highways in Rondonia

2.05      The road network of Rondonia was about 8,700 km at the beginning of
1982, with only 150 km paved. Another 600 km are being rebuilt and paved and
a further 4,400 km constructed or rehabilitated under the first phase of the
Northwest program. A substantial part of the network is under municipal
reponsibility. The recently established Highway Department of Rondonia
(DER-RO) is the subject of a considerable effort to strengthen its
construction and maintenance capability, including assistance to the
municipalities.

                               III.   THE PROJECT

                          A.    The Northwest Program

3.01       The Northwest Region Integrated Development Program, under which
the proposed project would be financed, originated with the government's
intention of paving the 1,500 km road (BR-364) which links Cuiaba, the
capital of Mato Grosso, to Porto Velho, the capital of Rondonia. The program
strategy, elaborated following the November 1979 Bank reconnaissance mission,
aims at providing for the investments niecessary to achieve the further
settlement and harmonious socio-economic development of the region influenced
by BR-364 (defined as the Northwest region) which has been subject to intense
immigration (see para 3.02) and the protection of the physical environment
and Amerindian population of that region, concomitantly with the paving of
BR-364. The Northwest region comprises the whole state of Rondonia and 14
north-western municipalities of Mato Grosso. It broadly consists of (a)
areas with good agricultural potential, which were already mostly settled but
in urgent need of complementary infrastructure and services to become
economically and socially viable; (b) undeveloped areas with somewhat lower
but acceptable agricultural potential, to which continuing immigration could
be channelled by the development of adequate infrastructure and services; (c)
areas, often of restricted productive potential, which should be maintained
in reserves, both to preserve the present ecological variety of the region
and to protect more fragile areas from irreversible environmental damage; and
 (d) areas inhabited by Amerindian tribal groups. The Northwest Program was
conceived in three overlapping phases reflecting the social, economic and
environmental priorities of the region but also the varyig degree of
preparedness of the various program comiponents. The first and most extensive
phase included (a) the paving of BR-364 (Loan 2062-BR); (h) the establishment
of a rural health network in Rondonia, including strengthened malaria control
                                     - 6 -



(Loan 2061-BR); and (c) the consolidation of existing settlements in central
Rondonia and the implementation of various environmental protection measures
(Loan 2060-BR). The second phase (Loan 2116-BR) extended similar rural
development activities to selected areas of Mato Grosso with larger
concentrations of small farmers. The third, proposed, phase aims at
gradually developing new settlement schemes in adequate but yet unoccupied
areas of the region with improved settlement planning, construction and
administration methods which could be usefully replicated in future
settlement operations both in the North and Northwest regions of Brazil. In
parallel to these three phases, the government of Brazil has been
implementing a Special Project to assist and protect Amerindian communities
dwelling in the Northwest. The presidential decree signed on May 27, 1981,
defining the objectives and resources of the Northwest Program, allocates the
equivalent of US$1.1 billion of base costs in January 1981 terms for the
program, of which US$262 million would be for the establishment of new
settlements in the region, including both the 15,000 families proposed to be
settled under this project and a further 5,000 families that could be settled
later.

                         B.   Key Project Institutions

The National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA)

3.02      INCRA would be the main executing agency of the project,
responsible for project planning and the implementation of most
infrastructure works. As those works are completed, their ownership and
operating and maintenance responsibility would be transferred to the state of
Rondonia. INCRA is an autonomous organ administered by the Ministry of
Agriculture since its establishment in 1970 but answering to the Ministry of
Land since the creation of the latter in 1982. The main objectives of INCRA
are to (a) promote and implement agrarian reform; (b) promote, coordinate and
implement settlement activities; and (c) promote farmer cooperatives and
associations and rural electrification. INCRA is responsible for all rural
cadastral operations; expropriation of land for agrarian reform purposes;
developing and providing services to new settlement areas; participating in
land zoning to identify priority development areas; defining minimum farm
sizes; and determining land values for tax purposes. INCRA operates through
its four departments of (a) Cadaster and Taxation; (b) Land Resources
(expropriations); (c) Projects and Operations (settlement); and (d) Rural
Development (cooperativism). INCRA has a total staff of more than 9,000, of
which some 1,700 are professionals. Some 700 staff are stationed in Rondonia
(with about 100 professionals). Its 1983 budget has been established at
approximately US$100 million. INCRA has traditionally been one of the
largest road building institutions in Brazil. Through the preparation of
this project, it has considerably improved its settlement planning
methodology for Amazonian areas (see paras 3.06, 3.07 and 5.03).

The Brazilian Institute for Forestry Development (IBDF)

3.03      IBDF would be responsible for forestry planning and technical
assistance. IBDF is an autonomous organ of the Ministry of Agriculture,
established in 1967 and responsible for (a) the formulation of forest policy;
(b) forestry development; and (c) directing the rational use and conservation
of renewable natural resources. Its functions are based on the comprehensive
                                   -   7   -




Forest Code of 1965 and Fauna Protection Law of 1967. There is an IBDF
delegation in Rondonia. The Forest Economics and Commercial Departments
would coordinate IBDF's work in the project. An agreement has been signed
between INCRA and IBDF, defining each institution's specific role in forestry
operations in settlement areas. In 19M2, IBDF's budget totalled about US$100
million, with a staff of some 3,500, including some 600 professionals (of
which some 200 foresters and 100 agronomists). In the specific fields of
forest management and forestry extension techniques, IBDF has yet limited
experience. However, IBDF's involvement in the project is limited, and the
project provides for consultant services to strengthen its project related
operations.

The Superintendency for Rubber Development (SUDHEVEA)

3.04      SUDHEVEA would assist farmers in rubber development activities.
SUDHEVEA was created in 1967 and is affiliated with the Ministry of Industry
and Commerce. It has a staff of about 550 with about 165 professionals. An
advisory council, the National Rubber Council, develops government policy and
guidelines to be implemented by SUDHEVEA, which oversees all aspects of the
promotion of rubber production and controls imports and marketing of both
synthetic and natural rubber. A tax oII imported rubber finances SUDHEVEA's
operations, including the production of budded plants, assistance and
training for primary processing of latex and assistance to research and
extension services. Technical assistance has largely been implemented
through contractual arrangements between SUDHEVEA and the Brazilian Company
for Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (EMBRATER), but SUDHEVEA is
presently considering measures to develop its capacity to assist rubber
farmers directly, including consulting services financed by the project to
advise and train SUDHEVEA staff.

The Agricultural Development Company of Rondonia (CODARON)

3.05      Responsibility for the construction and operation of nurseries,
input supply posts and pilot sawmills iinthe project area would be entrusted
to CODARON, a public corporation of the state of Rondonia, created by Law
No. 6805 of July 7, 1980, which became operational on January 27, 1981. Its
creation was closely linked to the establishment of the Northwest Program.
CODARON has taken over many of the staff and activities of the Secretariat of
Agriculture of Rondonia. Its performance in the first year of implementation
of the Northwest Program in Rondonia has proven satisfactory.

                           C. General Description

Origin and Rationale

3.06      The Northwest region has been subject to considerable immigration
pressure since the construction, in the late 1960s, of the unpaved BR-364.
This pressure is particularly strong in Rondonia. Immigration into the
Northwest region started some 40 years ago but was initially limited to
relatively accessible areas in the state of Mato Grosso, where private
colonization companies established a minimum of infrastructure and services
before selling plots to relatively well-to-do farmers migrating from the
south. Since 1970, INCRA has establislhed a large number of settlement areas
in Rondonia, mostly along the yet unpaved BR-364. These settlements were
generally established without preliminary soil surveys and along a standard
                                    -   8-


orthogonal layout, without consideration of topographical or ecological
factors. Roads were poorly built and soon became impassable during the rainy
season. The few available services were concentrated along BR-364
exclusively, although secondary roads were built up to 40 km away from the
highway and subsequently extended as far as 80 km into the forest as a result
of spontaneous settlement. No mechanisms were planned for the gradual
transfer of administrative responsibilities from INCRA to the local
authorities. Lots of 100 ha each, including individual legal reserves of 50
ha, were given at highly subsidized prices.

3.07      The long preparation phase of the proposed project has already
allowed INCRA, with assistance from the FAO/CP and Bank missions, to
gradually define and start to apply improved settlement methods, including
the selection of ecologically favorable areas; road and plot layouts suited
to the local topography; road standards allowing effective maintenance;
decentralized semi-urban centers providing settlers with financial,
commercial, education and health services; agglomeration of individual legal
reserves into large, collective, blocks on segments of the settlement areas
less suitable for agricultural practices, with a parallel strenghtening of
the planning and extension capability of IBDF; coordination with state
authorities for an efficient transfer of administrative responsibilities; and
cost recovery procedures reducing the project's impact on the government
budget. Furthermore, the introduction of rubber plots in some 40% of the
farms to be established, with extensive financial and technical assistance to
the farmers, would orient settlers to new perennial cropping opportunities
adapted to local soils, emphasizing a crop of strategic importance for a
rapidly industrializing country.

3.08      The survey and design schedule of the proposed settlement sites
allows the immediate development of the Urupa and Machadinho I sites.
Sufficient preliminary information is also available to schedule the
settlement of Machadinho II as of year 2 of the project. Further settlement
areas (discussed in para 2.01) are intended to be developed only after being
proven to meet the same detailed criteria used for already studied areas.
Alternative areas would otherwise be selected and are known to be generally
available in Rondonia. Project implementation is spread over a six-year
period (beyond works already implemented in the 1982/83 Northwest Program
fiscal year) to allow for the complex planning, bidding and imnplementation
requirements, the heavy rains which limit construction works to eight months
per year and the prevailing recruitment constraints which limit the
implementation capability of the lead agencies.

Objectives and Target Group

3.09        Project objectives are to (a) help INCRA settle by 1989 up to
15,000 immigrant farmer families with improved physical planning and settler
selection norms in six areas of Rondonia which have adequate agricultural
potential; (b) provide the settlers with a level and variety of
infrastructure and services comparable to those being present:Lydeveloped
under the first phase of the Northwest Program, such as roads, warehouses,
health and education facilities and agricultural extension and social
        3
services  !; (c) develop salvage logging procedures in areas cleared for


3/   See SAR 3512-BR: "Brazil - Northwest Region Development Program, First
     Phase - Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection Project."
                                   - 9 -




agriculture and, in the longer term, collective sustained forestry
operations; (d) generate farmer involvement in less traditional tree crops
which are suitable to the local soils; and (e) improve government capacity to
plan and execute similar  settlement programs in other parts of the Amazon
region. The 15,000 farm families would each receive from 25 ha (in areas of
better soils) to 40 ha (in areas of more patchy soils) of agricultural land,
plus an equal surface of forest area within agglomerated blocks. These
settlers would be engaged in the production of subsistence and commercial
food crops such as rice, maize, beans and cassava but would also grow cash
crops such as rubber, fruits and, to a lesser extent and with private
financing, coffee. Through administrative and operational arrangements that
remain to be defined, they would also be involved, in the longer term, in
 forestry operations on their legal reserves (see para 3.19). INCRA had
originally explored the possibility of settling some 60,000 families in the
Northwest region within a four-year period. This target was gradually
modified, in view of the complexity of settlement in the tropical jungle and
of financial and institutional limitations, down to 20,000 families to be
 settled within seven years (starting in 1982), 15,000 of which would be
attended through the proposed project. If migration into Rondonia were to
 continue more or less at the past rate of 1,000 families per month, half of
which declare an interest in agricultural employment, the project would
 attend a little less than half of the potential settlers arriving in the
 region during the project implementation period. The others would find work
 opportunities as sharecroppers or laborers in already established farms.

Project Description

3.10      The project would include (a) land use planning and new settlement
design; (b) an extensive rural road network and the expansion of road
maintenance capability; (c) an urban infrastructure consisting of seven rural
service centers (NUAR) and 71 satellite centers; (d) agricultural research,
rural extension and input supply; (e) grain drying and storage facilities;
(f) pilot salvage logging and sawmilling facilities; defining the
administration and organization of forestry activities within the
agglomerated legal reserves; and strengthening of Rondonia's capability to
protect its natural parks and reserves; (g) education and health facilities
in the project area; (h) project management and coordination, including
monitoring; and (i) funds for special studies to help diversify agricultural
options in the region and for the preparation of new projects in Rondonia and
Mato Grosso.

3.11      On-farm credit would be financed through existing channels, and
investment credit for rubber and other selected perennial crops would be
eligible for Bank financing. Ongoing Northwest projects would provide for a
series of parallel activities crucial to the achievement of the objectives of
the NW III New Settlements project, such as paving of the BR-364 highway,
strengthening road maintenance capability, increased deforestation control,
monitoring the environmental impact of development, overall program
coordination, construction of a hospital in Ouro Preto, malaria control in
Rondonia and the protection of the Amerindian population in the region.

                          D.   Detailed Features

Land Use Planning, SettlementLayout, Demarcation and Titling

3.12      Settlementplanning and highway constructionare faced with very
adverse environmentalconditionsin the Amazon basin due to the dense forest
and swampy areas, heavy rainfall four to five months per year, tropical
diseases, lack of reliablemaps and poor lines of communication. Traditional
road design is almost impossible. Settlementplanning financed by the
project would consist of the following sequenceof operations to be carried
out by INCRA: (a) a preliminaryzoning of the proposed settlementsites into
potential agriculturaland reserve areas, to be done on about 0.9 million ha
by the interpretation of existing aerial photographyat a scale of 1:70,000,
mapped at 1:50,000; (b) based on the above interpretation, a preliminary
layout of the feeder, access and penetrationroads, followingnatural crest
lines wherever possible, and of plots, drawn on the same maps; (c) once
simple paths are opened along those penetrationlines, a field evaluationof
the land use capabilityto confirm and, where necessary,correct the actual
boundariesof areas with agriculturalpotential and of forest reserve areas
deduced from the preliminaryzoning; (d) detailed design of settlementof an
estimated 15,000 individualpropertiesof 25 or 40 ha each and of
correspondingagglomeratedlegal reserves; and (e) cadastral surveys and
demarcationof the individualplots and outer boundariesof the legal
reserves. Field work would also include surveys by SUDHEVEA to identify
areas best suited for rubber cultivation. Land use capabilitysurveys for
another 190,000 ha in Urupa I and II and Machadinho I were financedand
implementedunder Loan 2060-BR. Further land use planning and layouts have
since been completedfor these areas. Demarcationof about 1,000 lots in
Urupa I was also completed in 1982. Acceleratedand less detailed physical
planning was used for the Urupa I and II areas, which, because of their
location, are subject to a higher risk of-invasion by squatters but which
have, generally, the advantage of soils richer than those in the other
project areas. A preliminaryroad and plot layout was also made, through
photo-interpretation, for a fourth site (MachadinhoII) covering another 36%
of the project area. Photo-interpretation  for the Marmelo and Capitao Silvio
sites, includinga first alignment of project roads, has been completed.
Settler selectionwould be implementedwithin the guidelinesof the Land
Statute (Law No. 4504) and INCRA's own selection norms, which favor
physicallyable candidateswith large families,who have experiencein
agriculturebut are not landownersand have not participatedin any previous
INCRA settlementproject. Prioritywould be given to migrant families
already in the region. SUDHEVEA would also participatein the selectionof
settlerswho would be more particularlyoriented toward areas approved for
rubber cultivation. Conditionsof disbursementfor each settlementsite
would be that (a) detailed settlementlayouts and costing of roads and NUAR
infrastructure had been satisfactorily completed by INCRA; (b) INCRA had
entered into agreementswith the governmentof Rondonia, defining programming
of constructionand operation activities for this site; and (c) INCRA had
acquired all property rights to the areas considered for settlementand
correspondingreserve areas.

Rural Roads

3.13     This componentwould include the design and construction   of (a)
some 1,550 km of primary farm access roads; (b) some 1,450 km of secondary
                                    -   11   -




farm access roads; and (c) in order to strengthen the maintenance capacity of
the state and municipalities, contracted mechanized maintenance during the
six-year project implementation period. Construction in all project sites of
a total of 750 km of feeder roads linking the NUARs to the main highway, as
well as 200 km of farm access roads in Urupa I, would be entrusted by INCRA
to local Civil Lngineering Battalions (BEC). The BEC have proved to be well
adapted, under adverse conditions, to carry out road openings and
construction of good quality within reasonable cost and time limits. The
feeder roads would be built to Class D standards of the National Roads
Department (DNER). The Bank would not finance works implemented by the BEC.
The primary and secondary access roads, linking individual farms to the NUARs
or to the feeder roads, would be built to lower (E and F) standards at unit
base costs, quoted by private contractors, of about US$12,200 per km and
US$5,300 per km, respectively, based on recent tenders received by INCRA for
the implementation of the Machadinho I component of the project (Table 2).
The DNER standards have been satisfactorily applied in numerous rural
development projects in Brazil. The maintenance system established under
earlier phases of the Northwest Program would be extended to the areas
covered by this project. Chart 1 provides a schedule of road design and
implementation. Since the implementation of the other components of the
project depends heavily on the implementation of the road component, a PERT
system would be set up by INCRA to assist in the annual programming and
monitoring of the project. Corresponding charts of activities would be
updated annually, before September 30 of the preceding year. Final road
designs are expected to be executed by private contractors and, to a lesser
extent, under force account by INCRA. Considering the latter's staff
limitations, INCRA's capacity to implement such designs in a timely and
adequate fashion would be reviewed after completion of the final design of
the first 500 km of roads. Annual maintenance plans would be reviewed with
the Bank. Assurances were received from the federal government that (a)
roads would be constructed according to design standards (Table 2) and
layouts agreed to with the state government and with the Bank; (b) INCRA
would enter into agreements with the BEC, satisfactory to the Bank, (i)
defining the BEC's construction and maintenance responsibilities for the
feeder roads; and (ii) providing the BEC with all the means and resources to
carry out in a timely manner the construction and maintenance operations
entrusted to them, without impediment to their other maintenance obligations
 in the region; (c) the portion of BR-364 between Porto Velho and Marmelo,
which provides the only access to two settlement sites, would be maintained
 permanently trafficable; and (d) the Bank would be furnished the necessary
documents and authorized to visit the facilities and sites of works entrusted
 to the BEC for construction and maintenance in order to review the progress
 of such works. Assurances were received from the government of Rondonia that
 prior to the initiation of construction of any project-financed farm access
 road, the state would enter into agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, with
 each of its project area municipalities, defining maintenance
 responsibilities of the municipalities and DER-RO.

NUAR and Satellite Infrastructure

3.14      One NUAR would be established for every 1,700 to 2,500 new
settlers. A total of seven NUARs would thus serve as foci for commercial and
social activities for some 15,000 settlers. Each NUAR would include
administration and service areas, some 200 lots for private houses and
recreational and commercial areas. The project would not finance NUAR
infrastructure already entrusted to the BEC for Urupa I. Each NUAR site
                                   -   12   -




would be cleared and providedwith office facilities(for INCRA, SUDHEVEA,
IBDF and state agencies involved in rural development),a guest house, 12
staff houses, a public water supply system and an electricitysupply
network. Four of them would be providedwith a simple landing strip and a
training center. Each NUAR would also have a secondary school (para 3.21), a
health post or referral center (para 3.22) and a crop drying and storage unit
(para 3.17). Private trade and services, especiallyfor the provision of
various farm inputs and tools, are expected to develop rapidly in these
centers, as in previoussettlementareas. To complementthe social
infrastructure network of the NUARs, the project would finance basic
infrastructure for 71 satellite centers (one for every 210 settlers),each
providedwith some 25 lots for private houses, a deep well, a one-classroom
school and a health post. INCRA would be responsiblefor the constructionof
NUAR, satelliteand surroundinginfrastructure.

AdaptiveAgriculturalResearch

3.15      Researchbeing carried out under the two Bank-assisted  Agricultural
Research Projects (Loans 1249-BR and 2016-BR) and the Northwest Program
(Loan 2060-BR)would be complementedunder this project with research into
annual and perennial crop productiontechniquestailored to local soil
conditions. The project would finance the Rondonia researchunit (UEPAE-RO)
of the BrazilianAgriculturalResearch Company (EMBRAPA) to (a) establish and
operate during the project implementation period one experimentalsubstation
in Machadinho I on soils representative of the areas to be settled; (b)
establish and provide improved supplies for 150 farmer-operated, fruit tree
and annual crop demonstrationplots; and (c) strengthen the soil and leaf
analysis capacityof the Porto Velho station. Researchwould include
investigationinto areas such as locally appropriatecrop rotations;
diversification of farming systems; and farm management. Experiments
executed at the Machadinho substationwould then be tested with extension
staff participation on the 150 demonstrationplots. UEPAE-RO would
publicize each year researchresults obtained under the project.
Assuranceswere received from the federal governmentthat the Machadinho
research substationwould be establishedand adequately staffed no later than
December 31, 1984.

TechnicalAssistance to Farmers

3.16      The Technical Assistanceand Rural Extension Associationof
Rondonia (ASTER-RO)would assist project settlers in graduallyimproving
their agriculturalproductiontechniques,with particularemphasis on soil
conservationand the promotion of new perennial crops. Besides its role in
the selection of rubber plots and farmers, SUDHEVEAwould provide trainingof
rubber farmers and tappers;assistance in the control of rubber tree
diseases, extensionrelated to the cultivationand intercroppingor rubber
during the immature period; and assistancein on-farm and centralizedrubber
processing. The project would finance (a) the constructionand equipment of
seven extension offices,correspondingvehicles and housing facilitiesfor
extensionstaff and operating costs during project implementation; (b) basic
equipment for rubber nurseries;(c) training courses for some 750 farmer
leaders and 110 general and 8D rubber extensionists,including four subject
matter specialistsand an administrativesupport staff of 25; (d) the
establishmentand operation of about seven SUDHEVEA-operated rubber
demonstration(and, later, tapper training)plots of 5 ha each; and (e) 30
                                   - 13 -



man-months of consultantservices to assist SUDHEVEA in implementingits
rubber developmentprogram in the project area. Extension would be provided
through (a) individualcontacts, to assist settlers in selectingareas for
perennial and annual crops, farm planning, credit requestsand cultivation
techniques;and (b) group extension,in specific activitiessuch as the
promotion of improvedvarieties,disease control, crop rotation,
fertilizationand soil conservation. General orientation,such as market
information,would also be provided through farmer organizdtionsand mass
media techniques. Settlers growing rubber would receive direct assistance
from ASTER-RO field staff, put under SUDHEVEA managementuntil the trees
reach tapping age. They would then be attended in groups oy ASTER-RO for all
farm activities. Initially,each agent would reach directly about 70
beneficiaries. This ratio would gradually increase to about 100 for
SUDHEVEA-managed extension and 130 for ASTER-RO within four years. SUDHEVEA
and ASTER-RO would maintain records of the cropping patterrs,use of main
inputs and production,with a view to ensuring continuity In assistanceand
monitoring project impact. The federal and state governmentshave agreed
that (a) SUDHEVEAand ASTER-RO would enter before March 31, 1984, into
arrangements satisfactoryto the Bank defining their respectivefunctions in
rubber extensionactivities; (b) project-financed  agriculturaland social
extension staff of SUDHEVEA, ASTER-RO and the Secretariat of Labor and Social
Promotion of Rondonia would be made available and trained according to a
schedule agreed upon at negotiations;and (c) SUDHEVEAwould recruit its
consultantsby June 30, 1984.

Crop Drying and Storage

3.17      In order to reduce post-harvestlosses and provide marketing
flexibility,the project would finance the constructionand equipment of
seven 2,000 ton warehouses designed for the specific climaticand
agriculturalproductionconditionsof the project area, each equippedwith a
5-ton/hourgrain dryer. Th iotal storage capacity of 14,000 tons'would
cover about 30% of the expectedmarketed output by year 6 of the project. A
modular warehouse structurewould allow later expansion. The warehousesare
expected to be designed to meet local climatic conditionsand built by
INCRA. Conditionsof disbursementagainst the warehouse componentwould be
that (a) final designs for a standardwarehouse had been prepared and
approved by the Bank; and (b) warehouse operation arrangements,satisfactory
to the Bank, had been defined.

Input Supply

3.18      Apart from a few rubber nurseries financedby SUDHEVEA and
currentlyoperated by CODARON, the productionof improvedperennial crop
planting material in Rondonia is very limited. Other inputs are expected,
in the long term, to be providedmostly by private suppliers settling in the
NUARs. The project would finance the construction,equipment and working
capital of three nurseries to produce seedlings of fruit trees such as
guarana, Brazil nut, citrus, cashew nut, jaboticaba, pupunha,avocado,mango
and coconut and of seven small input supply posts to be built and operated on
a commercialbasis by CODARON.

Forestry Development

3.19       The project would finance: (a) rapid forest inventories by IBDF of
some 570,000 ha of agricultural plots and the establishment of salvage
logging procedures to improve returns to farmers through some diversification
of the species and a modest increase of the quantities of wood that can be
salvaged from some 350,000 ha expected to be cleared over the next 15 years;
 (b) detailed inventories by IBDF of some 500,000 ha of legal reserves and
management plans for the permanent exploitation of some 20 agglomerated
reserves within those areas; (c) the construction of and vehicles and
equipment of seven forestry extension offices to be managed initially by IBDF
and later transferred to the State Forestry Institute which is planned to be
established in Rondonia; (d) training, salaries and other operating costs for
a core of 26 forestry extensionists and central staff during ltheproject
implementation period; (e) the construclion and working capital of two pilot
sawmills, each with a daily capacity of 30 m3 of sawn wood, to be built and
operated on a commercial basis by CODARON, to generate interest in the
processing of species for local market uses; (f) the construction, equipment
and operating costs of three IBDF forest:rycontrol posts; (g) the establish-
ment of control bases in Costa Marques and Ariquemes, to be owned by IBDF and
operated by the Forestry Battalion of Rondonia, for the protection of natural
parks and reserves, water sources and endangered species, including provision
of two helicopters, four boats, four vehicles and twenty helic:opter landing
pads in the areas to be controlled; (h) short market studies for wood species
with favorable features, which are found but are not traditionally processed
in the region; and (i) 24 man-months of consultant services tcoassist IBDF in
defining salvage logging procedures maximizing farmer revenue from forest
clearing and avoiding excessive damage to project roads; preparing and
implementing management plans for forest reserves; and strengthening IBDF's
environmental control capacity. Ownership of the agglomerated forest
reserves would remain with the farmers, either individually or, more
probably, through shares in a collective}ownership system.

3.20      Assurances were received from the federal and Rondonia governments
that IBDF would (a) jointly with INCRA, establish administrative rules and
regulations pertaining to the exploitation of the agglomerated reserves prior
to June 31, 1984; (b) complete (i) within six months after the construction
of each NUAR, forest inventories for the agricultural and reserve areas
attended by that NUAR; and (ii) the corresponding management plans within a
year after completion of the inventory of a given reserve; (c) make extension
staff available and train them within a schedule to be agreed upon at
negotiations; (d) sign an agreement satisfactory to the Bank with the govern-
ment of Rondonia prior to September 30, 1984, defining their respective roles
in forestry extension; (e) recruit, in accordance with Bank guidelines, prior
to June 30, 1984, consultants with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank to
assist in strengthening its extension and forest control services and develop
efficient salvage logging procedures; (f) review with the Bank the terms of
reference of the proposed market studies prior to implementing them; and (g)
sign an agreement with the Forestry Battalion of Rondonia which would allow
IBDF to retain ownership on and supervise the use of environmental protection
equipment financed by the project.   A condition of disbursement against the
first sawmill would be that final designs, satisfactory to the Bank, along
with corresponding management plans had been prepared by CODARON. The
                                   - 15 -



decision to build the second sawmill would be dependant upon a satisfactory
review by the state and federal governments of the results achieved (in terms
of steady supply of raw material and efficient marketing of the lumber
produced) by the first sawmill after a year of operation.

Education

3.21      The project would finance the construction and furnishing of seven
four-classroom schools and about 223 single classroom multigrade schools.
INCRA would be responsible for the construction, but all schools would be
equipped, operated ana maintained by the Secretariat of Education of
Rondonia, with the assistance of municipal authorities. Recruitment and
training of some 500 teachers and school operating costs are to be financed
by the state government, possibly with assistance from an education project
under preparation for Bank financing. The NUAR schools would provide upper
level primary education (grades 5 to 8) and administrative supervision of
surrounding multigrade schools. With two daily shifts of 40 students per
classroom, a total of 20,000 school places would be created, equivalent to
about 45% of the rural and urban school age population of close to 45,000
projected for 1989. The curriculum and calendar would be based on the survey
carried out under the NW I Agricultural Development Project.

Health

3.22      In complement to the Rondonia Health Project (Loan 2061-BR),
aiming at providing basic health services to rural populations and the
gradual reduction of incidence of malaria in the region, the project would
finance the construction and equipment by INCRA of (a) seven type-II health
posts in the project NUARs, each with 100 m2 of floor space, following a
standard modular design developed by SES-RO and found acceptable by the Bank;
and (b) 71 type-I health posts, each with 40 m2 of floor space, in
surrounding satellites. Two of the type-II health posts would later be
expanded by the Secretariat of Health of Rondonia (SES-RO) into referral
health centers, each with about 1,700 m2 of floor space, a 40-bed ward, a
laboratory, a delivery and operating room and medical and nursing offices.
The project would also finance various vehicles, including ambulances for the
referral centers and the training of 113 health professionals and auxiliaries
and 71 rural health workers. All health facilities would be operated and
maintained by SES-RO with the collaboration of municipal authorities. SES-RO
would also provide training of the persornel of the new health facilities
according to the program developed under Loan 2061-BR. Each NUAR health post
would be staffed by three health auxiliaries and be visited twice weekly by a
physician. They would provide both preventive and curative services,
including first aid, and serve as notification and drug distribution posts
for malaria control. Each satellite health post would be staffed by one
rural health worker. These posts would concentrate on prenatal care,
vaccination, health and nutrition education and limited curative treatment
and would also serve as malaria notification posts.

Social Organization

3.23      In line with earlier experience!in Rondonia, which has shown the
impact of communal self-help operations on previous development projects, the
project would help establish farmer organizations and develop community labor
through local agents of the State Secretariat of Labor and Social Promotion,
                                   -   16 -



working in close collaboration with ASTER-RO. Initially, some 20 settler
groups would be organized in the area of influenceof each NUAR. These
groups of settlerswould be trained to participatein various nutrition and
health education activitiesand in school constructionand maintenance. The
project would finance (a) construction and equipment of seven NUAR offices;
(b) vehicles for social extension; (c) trainingcourses for some 37 social
extensionists; and (d) staff salaries and other operating costs during
project implementation.

Special Activities

3.24      The identification, development and marketing of crops more
particularlysuited to the environmentalconstraintsof the agricultural
frontier,which is expanding into the tropical forest areas of the Amazon
basin, requires the establishmentof stable institutional  mechanismsto look
broadly and jointly at a variety of tropical tree crops, some already
relativelyextensivelygrown in Brazil without particularinstitutional
support--suchas coconut,babassu and, increasingly,oil palmr--and   other less
known crops with very favorablemarket prospects,such as guarana,cashew
nut, Brazil nut and various Amazonian fruit trees. The project would include
a componentto assist governmentagenciies  in reviewing the state-of-the-art
on various such crops, improving their capability to develop new cropping
opportunities and, as required, trying them out in the field. Under the
general guidanceof the General Secretariatof the Ministry of Agriculture
and coordinationof SUDECO and with the participationof various government
agencies involved in agriculturaland environmentalresearch and development,
such as the National Council for Science and Technology (CNPq), the National
Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA), various units of EMBRAPA, the
Brazilian Coffee (IBC) or Cocoa Institultes(CEPLAC), SUDHEVEAand IBDF, the
project would finance (a) travel and secretarialcosts of preliminary
encountersand seminarsamong these institutionsto define a plan of action
for the introductionof suitable new perennial crops in the Northwest region;
(b) ad-hoc studies and a synthesis of tlheresults of available adaptive
research and other studies,to be undertakenafter the conclusionof the
seminars; (c) travel of Brazilian and foreign specialistsfor international
contactswith specializedinstitutionsin Latin America, Asia and Africa
which have achievedconsiderableprogress in these fields; and (d) the
establishment costs of a few pilot tree crop diversification operations,as
recommendedby these studies. A critical evaluationof governmentproposals
for eventual tree crop institutions,recommendations  for inter-institutional
collaborationand assistancein the establishmentof pilot operationswould
be provided by up to 36 man-months of internationalconsultantservices to be
also financedby the project.

3.25      Provision would also be made imder the project to finance the
preparationof new regional developmentprojects in the Northwest region.
Various projectsare presentlyunder considerationby INCRA and the
governmentsof Rondonia and Mato Grosso under this component. It is INCRA's
intention to identify,for purposes of settlement in a later phase of the
NorthwestProgram, some 400,000 ha in two sites in the Guapore Valley of
Mato Grosso, where the land is under federal jurisdiction. The presence of
various Amerindiantribes in parts of tlae valley, combined with locally
                                   -   :L7
                                         -



complex cadastral situationsand soils which have good physical and
topographicalfeaturesbut low fertilityand a relativelyhigh aluminum ion
content make it necessary that (a) detailed surveys be conducted to identify
areas specificallysuited for small farmer settlementin view of annual and
perennial cropping;and (b) sophisticatedagriculturalproductionand
management techniquesbe developed,with a correspondingemphasis on the
selection of more competent farmers than those usually settled on INCRA
lands. Assuranceswere received from the federal governmentthat (a) a
detailed and costed plan of activitiesto be undertakenunder the special
activitiescomponentof the project, satisfactoryto the Bank, and
correspondinginstitutional  arrangementswould be finalized prior to June 30,
1984; (b) the nature and outline of new projects to be preparedwith project
fundingwould be reviewedwith the Bank prior to their preparation;   and (c)
consultantsrequired for the special studies would be recruited prior to June
30, 1985.

Project and NorthwestProgram Coordinationand Management

3.26      Since INCRA would play a leading role in the early and most costly
phases of the project (para 5.03), emphasiswould be on the institutional
strengtheningof INCRA headquartersand its regional delegationin Porto
Velho and on the adequate staffing of its field technical units to supervise
civil works and the settlementof new farmers. The project would finance (a)
office equipment,furniture and vehicles for the technical units of INCRA;
(b) salariesand other operating costs during project implementation  for
incrementalINCRA staff at the federal (five), regional (4) and NUAR (up to
140) levels; (c) 36 man-months of consulting services to assist the Porto
Velho and headquartersoffices of INCGA in the planning,monitoring and
supervisingof civil works; and (d) the continuationof Northwest Program
evaluationand coordinationbeyond the end of 1986 (para 5.07).

On-farm Investments

3.27      On-farm investments,totallingUS$89.4 million over the project
implementation period, including contiLngencies,would cover the establishment
of rubber (US$29.3million), coffee (US$8.9 million) and Amazonian fruit tree
plantations(US$31.5million) and the purchase of livestockand farm
implements (US$19.7million). As project farmers would have each less than
50 ha under agriculturalproduction, they would be entitled to 100%
financing,including family labor and, in the case of rubber, on-farm
processingunits, for those crops for which governmentcredit lines are
available (i.e. US$60.8 million for ruibberand fruit trees). Farmers would
rely on credit from private banks for their other investmentrequirements
(US$28.6million). Seasonal credit requirements   would build up to US$6.1
million per annum by year 6 of the project and would be financed through
governmentlines. Rubber credit would be financed through funds allocated to
the Rubber DevelopmentProgram (PROBOR)of SUDHEVEA. PROBOR loans are
evaluatedand approvedby SUDHEVEA and administered   by the Bank of Brazil
(BB) and by leading state or regional banks in the growing areas. The loans
are repayableover 13 years, with a grace period of seven years. Norms and
conditionsfor rubber loans were reviewed and found acceptableby the Bank.
PROBOR loans in the Northwest region would be subject to 70% of monetary
correctionplus 3% of interest,both to be capitalizedduring the grace
                                    -   18   -




period. Loans for fruit trees (and other perennial crops acceptable to the
Bank) would be subject to 85% monetary correction and 3% interest. These
conditions are in conformity with the overall agreement between the
government and the Bank on interest rates for agricultural credit. The
justification of the proposed subsidies on rubber loans is discussed in para
6.03. Fruit trees would be financed by,BB and other Banks approved by the
Central Bank in accordance with the lending policies and procedures set forth
in the Rural Credit Manual (MCR), which, are acceptable to the!Bank. The
credit component of the Bank loan would only finance the rubber and Amazonian
fruit tree crops investment requirements. Simplified access to credit for
settlers in the project area would require the gradual installation of bank
agencies or advanced credit posts in each NUAR. Assurances were received
from the federal government that it would (a) take all necessary
financial, legal and institutional measures, including the establishment of
an adequate banking infrastructure in the project area, to ensure the timely
availability of agricultural credit and promote its use by project
beneficiaries; and (b) exchange views with the Bank not later than (i)
December 15 in each year, on the funding mechanisms through which the
necessary credit resources would be made available to project farmers in the
following Northwest Program fiscal year; and (ii) June 30, 1984, on the
adequacy of the lending policies and procedures set forth in the MCR for the
perennial crops to be financed under the project.

                   E.   Activities Parallel to the Project

3.28      The main activity parallel to the project is the construction and
maintenance of feeder roads and limited NUAR infrastructure by the BEC, as
discussed in paras 3.13 and 3.14. Other parallel activities include the
routine maintenance of all roads, the operation of education and health
facilities and the supply of improved seeds by state agencies. The Rondonia
government would (a) provide timely and adequate funding for routine road
maintenance and education and health operating costs; and (b) enter into
agreements with each municipality in the project area, by June 30, 1984,
defining their respective responsibilities in road maintenance and education
and health facilities operation and maintenance. Within an ongoing program
for the production and distribution of improved seeds, basic seeds are
produced in Rondonia by UEPAE-RO. CODARON is responsible for seed
multiplication through selected farmers. Assurances were received from the
state government that the improved seed requirements of the proposed project
would be met in a timely fashion through its ongoing seed supply program.

                     IV.   PROJECT COST AND FINANCING

                              A.   Project Cost

4.01      The total project cost over the six year implementation period is
estimated at about US$1l2 million, including agricultural investment credit
requirements for rubber and tropical tree crops, financed by the project, of
which about US$34 million (19%) is in foreign exchange and about US$11
million are taxes. The total cost includes physical contingencies equivalent
to 7% of baseline costs and price contingencies of 26% of baseline costs plus
physical contingencies. Physical contingencies were added to baseline costs
at 13% for road construction, 10% for other civil works, equipment and
training, 20% for mechanized road maintenance and 5% for incremental

operating costs. No physical contingencieswere considered for the credit
component. Price contingencieswere calculatedin US dollar terms, based on
internationalinflation rates estimated at &0 for calendar 1983, 7.5% for
1984, 7% for 1985 and 6% from 1986 on. It was assumed that periodic local
currency devaluationswould compensatefor any differencebetween world and
domestic inflation. Project costs are summarized in Table 4.1 and the annual
phasing of investmentsis shown in Table 3. Costs of parallelactivities
essential for project implementation but not subject to Bank financingare
shown in Table 4.

                               B.   Firuncing

4.02     The proposed Bank loan of US$65.2 million to the Federative
Republic of Brazil would include US$0.2 million to cover the cost of the
front end fee assessed by the Bank, capitalizedat the request of government,
and US$65.0 million which would finance during the 1983 and 1984 fiscal years
of the Northwest Program 50%, net of taLxes,or about 46%, including taxes, of
project costs and, thereafter,35% of the same costs, net of taxes, or 33%,
including taxes. This would include the foreign exchange component of
costs, or US$34.3 million, plus the equivalent of about US$30.7 million of
local costs and would correspond, overaLll,to 38% of total project costs, net
of taxes. The loan would be for 15 years, including three years of grace.
The balance of project financing would be provided mainly by the federal
government through funds already earmarked for the Northwest Program, some of
which would be channelledthrough the state government (see Table 5). In
addition, the federal governmentwould finance constructionaLnd maintenance
works carried out by the BEC (about US$27 million) and seasonalcredit
(US$6.1 million), and the state government would finance routine road
maintenance (about US$2 million) and teacher salaries, which were not
included in project costs. Operating costs of health facilities would be
covered by rural social security funds. Investment credit for coffee (about
US$8.9 million) and livestock (about US$19.7 million) would come mainly from
commercial lines of credit. Since project farms are all under 50 ha, on-farm
development costs would be eligible for 100% financing through the various
credit lines.

4.03      To ensure the timely and effective implementation of the project,
various start-up activities such as photo-interpretation, soil surveys,
engineering designs and some road construction have already been initiated.
Retroactive financing of up to US$4.0 million is proposed to help cover
eligible expenditures made before loan signature but after November 4, 19S2.

                              C.    Procurement

4.04     Civil works for farm access roads (US$38 million) and NUARs,
satellites, drying and storage, input supply, logging and milling, education
and health facilities(US$19 million) would be executedby contract following
local competitivebidding procedures,which are acceptableto the Bank.
Brazil has a competitive local construction industry which is capable of
carrying out project works. Foreign firms would not be excluded,but
experiencein the Northwest region shows that they are not likely to be
interested given the remote and dispersed locations and difficult access.
These civil work contracts represent close to 70% of project costs which
would be subject to bidding procedures. Individual contracts are expected to
                                   - 21 -



be of the order of US$1 to US$3 million. Mechanized maintenance of access
roads (US$4.1 million) would also be let out through local competitive
bidding. Miscellaneous works for the construction of research units and
forest control and environmental supervision posts as well as forest
inventories and management plans, totalling US$1.9 million, would be carried
out either by force account or through small-scale contracts. Vehicles
purchased in small lots and minor machinery and equipment to be acquired by a
variety of executing agencies for a total of about US$4 million over the
project implementation period would be purchased directly from local dealers
or through government purchasing agencies, in agreement with existing
government procedures. For all contracts exceeding US$500,000, the Bank
would review and approve standard procuriementdocuments and specifications
prior to bidding and bid evaluations and award recommendations prior to
signing of contracts for civil works, mechanized maintenance or equipment.
Consultancy services (totalling some 126 man-months) for technical assistance
and special studies would be procured in accordance with corresponding Bank
guidelines, both locally and internationally, at base costs ranging from
US$5,000 to US$9,000 per month, of which about 80% would be fees and 20%
other costs. Procurement arrangements are detailed in Table 4.2 overleaf.

                              D. Disbursements

4.05       The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed on the basis of a
uniform rate of 44% during the first two years and 32% thereafter, except for
consultants and special studies, for which disbursements would be at a rate
of 100% of total costs, including fees, travel, services and equipment.
Disbursements for civil works executed by force account, mechanized road
maintenance contracts and operational expenses, including credit, would be
made under Statements of Expenditures initiated by the various executing
agencies and certified by SUDECO. Supporting documentation would not be
submitted to the Bank, but would be retained by the agency responsible for
their certification and would be made available for inspection by the Bank
during project supervision missions. Standard documentation covering civil
works, vehicles, machinery, equipment and technical assistance would be
submitted to the Bank. Disbursements for road designs under force account
would be made at a standard rate of US$L8D equivalent per kilometer of road.
Disbursements are expected to occur over a period of six years. The
disbursement schedule (Table 6) reflects the disbursement profile for
 previous agricultural projects in Brazil, adjusted slightly to take into
account improvements likely to result from the establishment of a Special
Account (see below). The closing date of the loan would be December 31,
1989.

4.06      In order to reduce the interval during which the government would
finance the Bank's share of project financing with its own resources, a
Special Account would be opened in the Central Bank with an initial deposit
of US$4.0 million. The government may request the Bank to make advance
payments in dollars from the loan account into this Special Account.
Withdrawals in cruzeiros from the Special Account would be made at the
exchange rate that prevailed on the date of the expenditure. The Central
Bank would send the corresponding Statements of Expenditure to the Bank,
which would then replenish the Special Account.

                               V.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

                          A.   Northwest        Program Coordination

5.01      The Northwest Region Development Program was created by                 Decree No.
86029 of May 27, 1981. Responsibility for program administration                  has been
entrusted to SUDECO, a regional superintendency attached to the                   Ministry of
Interior (MINTER). Inter-Ministerial Orders describe the ways in                  which
MINTER, SEPLAN-PR and other        ministries      and state   governments   should
collaborate,   as well as the various programming, budgeting and fund
disbursement   procedures.  At the state level, a Program Coordination Unit
(PCU) was established     within    the Secretariat       of Planning   and Coordination   of
the State of Rondonia (SEPLAN-RO) under the first phase of the program.

                        B. Project Managementand Organization

Project Implementation and Coordination

5.02      The principal implementation agencies for the New Settlements
project would be INCRA, SUDHEVEA, IBDF and the Rondonia government (see paras
3.02 through 3.05). A list of executing and collaborating agencies is given
in Table 7. Project organization is presented in Chart 2. The project would
come under the overall budgetary and administrative coordination of SUDECO
and SEPLAN-PR at the federal level. The coordination of work programs and
consolidation of monitoring reports at the state level would be carried out
by the local office of SUDECO on the basis of information provided by the PCU
and the local offices of federal agencies. These documents would be
forwarded to SUDECO headquarters where they would be further cross-checked
with information provided by the headquarters of federal agencies before
incorporation into quarterly monitoring and progress reports. Project staff
of the various agencies would be trained through the Northwest Program staff
training component financed through Loan 2060-BR, except for health
personnel, which is to be trained with iunds from Loan 2061-BR.

Construction of Project Infrastructure

5.03      A special task force set up in the Department of Operations (DOP)
of INCRA would be responsible for the (a) coordination, management,
monitoring and reporting of project related INCRA activities; (b) annual
planning and budgeting; (c) preparation of detailed settlement plans; and (d)
bidding and contracting. The Porto Velho office would be reinforced with a
technical project unit to provide planning and field level supervision of
road and NUAR works. Earlier projects have proven the availability of
national and regional contractors capable of undertaking all infrastructure
construction works. Road maintenance activities would be coordinated by
DER-RO. The BEC would maintain the feeder roads until the end of access road
construction works on each settlement site. DER-RO would then be responsible
for the mechanized maintenance of the entire road network and the routine
maintenance of the feeder road network, included in the state network. The
municipalities would be responsible for the routine maintenance of their
respective farm access roads. A strong effort is under way under the NW I
Highway project to strengthen the maintenance capability of DER-RO, which
would also assist area municipalities. Assurances were received from the
                                    - 24 -



federal government that INCRA would (a) by June 30, 1984, employ, in
accordance with Bank guidelines, a consultant with qualificaLtions
satisfactory to the Bank to assist in planning, designing and supervising all
project construction works; (b) appoint as soon as possible the necessary
technical staff with qualifications and experience to plan, administer and
monitor INCRA activities within the project; and (c) keep such positions
continuously staffed throughout the project implementation period.

Forestry Development

5.04      Reserve areas would be identified and administrative and
operational arrangements defined by INCRA and IBDF jointly, but demarcated by
INCRA. IBDF's Department of Economics would prepare forest inventories and
management plans and acquaint farmers with the potential value of the
forest. Technical assistance to farmers would be provided (a) by the local
extension agencies, with subject matter orientation from IBDF, for salvage
logging; and (b) directly by IBDF, until Rondonia establishes its own
forestry institute, for the management of the forest reserves. The
establishment of a training center for workers in the sawmilling industry is
being separately studied by the state government. IBDF's Department of
Commerce would establish and operate the forest products control network
infrastructure. IBDF would also be responsible for the control of natural
reserves and endangered species in Rondonia.

Annual Planning and Budgeting

5.05      Comprehensive updated annual planning would adjust, detail and cost
initially agreed targets and activities. As for the other Northwest
projects, INCRA, SUDHEVEA, IBDF and the state would furnish to the federal
authorities by August 31 each year, their preliminary project budget
estimates for the fiscal year beginning the following April. By September 30
each year, the federal authorities wou:Ld notify INCRA, SUDHEVEA, IBDF and the
state of the preliminary financial allocations for the project. After this,
each federal and state agency would prepare a detailed plan of activities and
expenditures for the following fiscal year. By December 31 of each year, the
plans would be consolidated by SUDECO, ensuring their internal consistency
and their integration into other programs and plans under execution in
Rondonia. These plans would serve as the basis for the yearly budget
allocation. The proposed annual project budgets and operating plans would be
submitted to the Bank, for review and comment, no later than January 31 of
each year, and the Bank would be advised of the approved plan and budget as
soon as they are formally approved. Some delays were observed in the
budgeting of the ongoing phases of the program, but the process is expected
to gain in efficiency as the numerous agencies involved become more familiar
with it.

Monitoring

5.06      The monitoring system established for the Northwest Program would
be extended to the proposed project and provide for the collection and
analysis of information to compare project achievements with targets, alert
management to problems as they may emerge and provide a basis for annual
planning. Data provided by the executing agencies on a quarterly basis would
be consolidated by SUDECO, through its Rondonia office. The reports would
also provide (a) indicators of the quality of services provided; (b) agency,
                                      - 25 -



state and SUDECO comments on special problems and steps taken to overcome
these problems; and (c) preliminary information on project impact on the
target population and agricultural production, established by state level
staff of SUDECO on the basis of field supervision and interviews. These
periodic impact reports would be incorporated into the regular progress
reports. Measures to improve the present Northwest monitoring and reporting
system are being studied with SUDECO. Assurances were received from the
federal government that the quarterly monitoring and progress reports would
be provided to the Bank not later than three months after the end of the
respective Northwest Program fiscal quarter.

Evaluation

5.07      Evaluation of the Northwest Program strategy, performance and
impact on the region's population and environment has been contracted by
SUDECO to the Economic Research Institute (FIPE) of the University of Sao
Paulo and is financed under the first phase of the Program. This project's
evaluation would be done within the same framework until the end of 1986,
when the first phase is expected to be completed, and continued with funds
from this project thereafter. A mid-term review of Northwest Program
execution as of March 31, 1984 is to be completed by June 31, 1984, in
accordance with agreements reached under Loan 2060-BR. Finally, a completion
report, giving an assessment of program impact, is to be provided to the Bank
within six months of the final completion of the program. Assurances
covering the timely evaluation of the program, including this project, were
received within the framework of the first phase of the Northwest Program.

Accounts and Auditing

5.08      Each of the participating agencies would maintain separate accounts
of its project expenditures, which would be audited annually by the Central
Secretariat of Internal Control (SECIN) of SEPLAN-PR according to standard
government practice, which is satisfactory to the Bank. Copies of the audit
report on the various participating agencies would be provided to the Bank
through SUDECO within six months of the end of each fiscal year of the
Northwest Program. This audit report would also convey the auditor's opinion
(and comments as necessary) on the methodology employed in the compilation of
the Statements of Expenditures, their accuracy, the relevance of supporting
documents, eligibility for financing in terms of the project's legal
agreements and the standards of record-keeping and internal controls related
to the foregoing. The Special Account (para 4.06) would be audited by
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank.

                  VI.   PRODUCTION, DEMAND, MARKETING AND PRICES

                           A.   Agricultural Production

Crop Production

6.01      Agricultural production in the project area is expected to result
from the settlement of some 15,000 small farmers. Individual plots will be
of 25 or 40 ha depending on (a) soil quality; and (b) cropping patterns which
can be developed using mainly family labor (about 3 ha of perennials, 2 to 3
ha of annual crops, 4 to 5 ha of improved pasture, 7.5 to 12 ha of fallow and
the remainder unsuited for agricultural production). Three farm models,
                                    -   :26-


defined by the main perennial crop grown--coffee, rubber or tropical fruit
trees--are discussed in Chapter VII and Table 8. At full development, some
45,000 ha are expected to be planted to perennial crops (18,000 ha to rubber,
11,300 ha to coffee and 15,700 ha to various fruit trees) and some 39,000 ha
to annual crops (rice, corn, beans and cassava), under the aegis of the
project. Another 64,000 ha would be under improved pasture. These
objectives would be achieved through the (a) development of the necessary
infrastructure in the project area; (b)lproper selection of areas suitable
for perennial crops and a continuous rotation of annual crops; (c) provision
of technical assistance, input supply and credit; (d) adopticinof proper
timing and density of planting for annual crops with increased utilization of
improved seeds and/or planting material; (e) introduction of proper pest and
disease control; (f) reduction of post harvest losses through improved drying
and storage practices; (g) gradual adoption of proper crop rotation
techniques, fertilizers, and legumes for pastures; and (h) reduction of labor
constraints through an increased use of animal traction.

6.02      The farmers are expected to plant perennial crops soon after
settlement. Annual crops which are not intercropped with perennials would,
initially, use traditional slash-and-burn cultivation practices until, by
about the seventh year, all areas with suitable soils would have been
cleared. Improvements during this period would be limited to the use of
improved planting material, sanitary control and on-farm post-harvest
operations. Once the farm has been fully cleared, the farmers are expected,
with the help of a more elaborate technical assistance package, to adopt a
crop rotation involving the use of fertilizers and of a leguminous cover on
fallow areas. The yields assumed reflect the relatively low level of
technology of the farmers and its gradual improvement through direct
technical assistance. Net yields would reach, at full development, 1.4 t/ha
for rice, 1.2 t/ha for corn, 0.5 t/ha for beans and 4.2 t/ha of cassava
flour. At peak production, rubber would yield 1 t/ha (dry rubber content);
coffee 2 t/ha of dried cherries; guarana, 750 kg/ha of dried cherries; and
Brazil nut, 800 kg/ha. These yields are about 30% below what the more
progressive farmers of the area could obtain given constraints of soils and
availability of inputs and support services.

6.03      The main perennial crop to be promoted by the project would be
rubber. Rubber is considered to provide a stable and environmentally safe
cropping opportunity with favorable marlket prospects to settlers coming into
Amazon areas of moderate to marginal fertility. The government has an
ambitious country-wide program of credit;and incentives to promote the
cultivation of natural rubber (PROBOR), aiming at planting, in three stages,
up to some 350,000 ha. SUDHEVEA is in the process of strengthening its own
technical assistance capacity to assist and monitor directly the
beneficiaries of the PROBOR program. Adequate planting material is generally
available from local nurseries. There is a need for good training of rubber
tappers, but this can be achieved well before the new plantations reach
maturity. Results achieved in rubber areas already in production in the
region (Mato Grosso) demonstrate that (a) the incidence of South American
Leaf Blight (SALB) is limited by the local climatic conditions and could be
further constrained with known methods to combat the disease; and (b) rubber
can provide satisfactory returns to smallholders even with the lower domestic
prices expected to prevail when project plantations reach maturity (para
6.07) with the present production methods and yield expectations, which have
been used as the basis for the rubber farm model (para 7.01). The financial
results would be roughly comparable to those that could be achieved from
                                   - 27 -



coffee plantation on similar moderate quality soils. However, with less than
10,000 ha of plantation rubber under tapping nationwide, rubber is yet a crop
little known to settlers arriving in Rondonia. It also has a long maturing
period (seven years), compared to that of coffee (about three years), a crop
with which settlers are much more familiarc. A special program of incentives,
including the proposed subsidies, is therefore justified in order to overcome
the initial inertia and risk aversion of farmers. The cultivation of rubber
would be the subject of intensive and continuous attention from SUDHEVEA,
including (a) the selection of areas best suited for rubber cultivation; (b)
the selection of farmer families which would be settled in those areas and
eligible for rubber credit; (c) the grouping of individual plots to be
planted to rubber into 45 to 60 ha blocks, preferably along an access road,
to ensure better technical assistance and control; (d) the provision of the
main inputs in kind, with credit at the new official rates for all crop
establishment expenditures, including family labor; and a close supervision
of the use of credits and grants; (e) SUDHEVEA-operated demonstration and
tapper training plots; and (f) the availability of credit for the
establishment of on-farm air-dried sheet processing units and/or central
crumb rubber units.

6.04      Coffee is expected to be planted spontaneously by many settlers.
The project does not promote its cultivation since no government credit and
little technical assistance is available for coffee planting. The risk that
areas planted to coffee exceed the estimated 11,300 ha is limited by a
general lack of suitable soils, the unfavorable market outlook and government
policies which tend to favor rubber more than coffee. The diversification of
perennial cropping through the introduction of a variety of tropical fruit
trees would be enhanced by the (a) project-financed establishment of
nurseries; (b) specialized technical assistance and research; (c) further
promotion by government of recently established investment credit lines for
guarana and Brazil nut and their extension to other fruit trees; and (d)
special studies, financed by the project, to develop more diversified
cropping patterns in the region (see para 3.24).

6.05      At October 198& farmgate prices, annual agricultural production
induced by the project at full development is expected to amount to about
US$117 million (see Table 9). Of this, some 14% is due to annual crops, 60%
to perennial crops (28% to rubber, 12% to coffee, 81 to guarana and Brazil
nut and 12% to other fruits) and 26% to the production of eggs, meat and
milk. The range of perennial crops is expected to broaden with the expansion
of the marketing apparatus for tropical fruits and the availability of
research results.

Forestry Production

6.06      The major part of forestry production would be generated in the
agglomerated reserves, which would only be developed some eight to ten years
after the settlement of a given site, when most of the agricultural area
would have been cleared and wood from salvage logging would no longer be
forthcoming. Because of the imbalance between rapid deforestation and
limited markets, modest results are expected from salvage logging, of the
order of 4 m3 per hectare cleared. This result would be achieved by
expanding the present practice of recovering some 2 m3 /ha of the most
valuable (mahogany and cerejeiro) species to a wider variety of trees which
can satisfy local demand. The actual amount of timber that would be obtained
                                    - 28 -



from the permanent reserves would only be known after inventories, financed
by the project, are completed. Farm budgets prepared for the project exclude
income from the reserves, since the role of the farmers in their management
is not yet clearly determined. A conservative estimate of an average
extraction of 0.5 m3 of timber per hectare per year was assumed for economic
analysis purposes.

                       B.   Demand, Marlkets and Prices

Markets and Prices for Agricultural Prolucts

6.07      World demand for elastomers in the medium- to long-term is expected
to increase at a rate providing ample opportunities for the expansion of
areas planted in rubber throughout the world. About 60% of Brazil's
75,000 ton/year natural rubber and one-eighth of its 200,000 ton/year
synthetic rubber requirements are imporled. Currently about 100,000 ha are
planted to rubber in Brazil, but most oi it has not yet reached production,
and about 80% of the present output comes from relatively inefficient wild
rubber tapping. Yet, Brazil is considered to have a long-term potential to
become a net rubber exporter, and plans embodied in the PROBOR Program should
allow the country to approach self-sufficiency by the time the proposed
project reaches full development. High taxes on rubber imports, established
to temporarily protect wild rubber producers and used to finance SUDHEVEA
activities, currently result in a 2.5-to-one ratio between Brazilian and
world natural rubber farmgate prices. This ratio can only decrease as
plantation production increases, replacing wild rubber tapping and imports.
However, international prices are expected to increase in real terms by some
50% over the next 10 years, leaving scope for continued attractive prices to
domestic producers. The financial analysis of the rubber model assume a
decrease of farmgate prices by about 25%, leaving them only about 25% above
correspondingworld farmgate prices by 1995 but slightly below the economic
price of rubber imported to Brazil. By the end of project implementation,
some 14,700 ha of rubber would have been planted by small farmers in
Rondonia. This figure would reach 18,000 ha at full development.

6.08      Brazil produces around 29% of the world's coffee, and contributes
some 26% to the world export market. High prices in 1979 were followed by
lower price levels which are expected to persist in the medium term, in light
of world economic conditions. World markets are expected to grow, though
slowly, in the next decade. The severe frost of July 1981 in southern Brazil
killed or severely damaged an estimated 310 million coffee trees, resulting
in a net decrease of areas planted to coffee in Brazil of some 135,000 ha
between 1981 and the end of 1982.4/ Project coffee production would
represent less than 0.5% of the average Brazilian production during the last
two years or less than 0.2% of recent world production. The International
Coffee Organization (ICO) of which Brazil is a major member, has cautioned
against investments in projects designed to increase coffee production
significantly,unless such increased production is part of an integrated
rural development program and is offset by reduced production from marginal
areas taken out of coffee. The proposed project meets these criteria. In
addition, coffee is an excellent pioneer crop, providing substantial cash
earnings to settler families after only a short maturation period. Bank
projections were used for the economic price of coffee, and farmgate prices
were assumed to vary in a similar proportion.

 4/   In comparison, some 11,300 ha are expected to be planted in coffee in
      the project area and produce, at full development (around 1997) some
      7,500 tons/year of green coffee beans.
                                      -   29 -



6.09      The growth in regional rural and urban demand for fruits and other
foodstuffs is expected to absorb all project production. Guarana and Brazil
nuts would be sent to the Sao Paulo and export markets. Rice, beans and
cassava would be consumed mainly on the farm and within the project area,
with surpluses sent to neighboring urban centers. Maize would be consumed
mostly by local livestock and poultry. Since present production of guarana
is very low, a 50% decrease of present prices were assumed both for the
financial and economic analyses. Other economic prices are based on Bank
projections, and farmgate prices are assumed to remain constant although
competition for suitable soils between food, export and fuel crops is
expected to gradually move food crop prices upward.

Markets for Forestry Products

6.10      There were some 150 sawmills officially registered in 1979 in
Rondonia, with sales of the order of 320,000 m3 . In 1982, the number of
sawmills was estimated around 260, excluding a large number operating without
official registration. Although sawmilling represents the largest industrial
activity of Rondonia, some 95% of the enterprises are of an artisanal
nature. Mahogany and "cerejeira" are the only species properly processed and
marketed. Due to a lack of competition among regional sawmillers, a
substantial part of the wood extracted leaves the region unprocessed, and
other valuable species, such as cedar and "ipe," are most often left to burn
or rot in the areas cleared for agricultural or hydro-electric purposes. At
the same time, local demand, amplified by ongoing NUAR construction works,
suffers from an inadequate supply of construction material and, because no
other types of wood are processed in significant volumes, meets its
requirements by purchasing wood of a quality superior to its needs, which
would, otherwise, have found export outlets. Immediate market possibilities
for wood felled in agricultural areas would be generated by establishing
processing units which would process secondary species to attend more
particularly to local demand for NUAR and farm house construction and
furniture.

                              C. Marketing Channels

6.11      Private intermediaries such as local processing facility
owners, merchants, and truckers for large marketing firms are very active in
adjoining areas and would be the main marketing channels in the project area,
collecting about 70% of total production. Some merchants  advance funds or
goods in return for a guarantee that they can purchase a farmer's produce at
a-price discounted to compensate for interest and inflation. The government
purchases grains through the Minimum Price Scheme when market prices go below
a pre-determined minimum. Transportation costs, financing and access to
drying and storage facilities, which have been identified as key marketing
constraints, would be improved through various components of the project,
reducing any monopsonistic power of the buyers.

                          VII. FINANCIALANALYSIS

                         A.     IllustrativeFarm Models

7.01      The three farm models analyzed in Table 8 were based on production
and cost information gathered from field surveys by INCRA in areas close to
                                    - 30 -



the proposed settlement sites prior to the substantial devaluation of the
cruzeiro at mid-February 1983 and are intended to reflect the probable
developmental behavior of prospective settlers. Considering the export and
import-substitution orientation of farm production and the low use of
imported inputs, the impact of the devaluation on the farm budgets, if any,
should be favorable. Financial prices for inputs and production are given in
Table 10. Estimated financial rates of return to investment range from 15%
in the rubber farm model on average soils to 36% in the coffee farm model on
the better soils, suitable for that crop. The sensitivity of the financial
rates of return to 20% and 40% reductiLonsin yields (or prices) of the main
crops (rubber, tropical fruits and coffee) was tested. None of the rates of
return dropped below 12% and 8%.respectively under the two assumptions.
Subsidized credit would ensure better returns to rubber farmers than shown by
the computation of returns to investment, which, by its nature, cannot
reflect the impact of such subsidies. Due to the long maturing period of
rubber and the long spread of its planting, full project development would
only be reached around the year 1998. However, already by 1993, annual
income from the project would reach 80% of its full value.

                                        Income
                             B. Produicer

7.02      The 19 S income of the targeted settlers, most often families which
have already migrated to the region and are employed as hired field workers
while waiting to be allocated their own plot, is estimated, on the average,
to be about US$1,500, i.e., below the rural poverty level for Brazil, which
is about US$330 per capita, or about US$2,000 for an average family of six.
At full development, the average annual farm family income would increase
four-fold to about US$6,000. Return to family labor would more than double,
going from the October 1982 daily wage of US$4.50 for unskilled labor to an
income of around US$11/day, in 1982 terms, at full development.

                     C.   Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery

7.03      It has not been government policy to directly recover the full
investment costs of projects directed principally to lower income settlers.
Furthermore, because of highly subsidized and very long repayment periods,
actual recovery of settlement costs by INCRA has only been nominal. INCRA is
now in the process of defining new cost recovery procedures, which would be
applied to all its new settlements in Brazil and would aim at recovering a
substantial part of basic settlement costs in real terms without, however,
putting an excessive financial burden on prospective settlers. The new
procedures should be finalized within about six months. Assurances were
received from the federal government that (a) INCRA would finalize, publish
and put into effect its new settlement cost recovery terms no later than
June 30, 1984; and (b) these terms wou:Ld allow the overall recovery, in real
terms, of a sum equivalent to at least 40% of the survey, acquisition,
demarcation and titling costs of the agricultural plots and reserves, the
construction costs of feeder, access and penetration roads, NUARs and
satellite centers and the cost of forest inventories and management plans.
Recovery of 40% of investment costs from agricultural settlers is considered
to be reasonable, considering that projiect-financedfacilities would also
benefit urban dwellers and future spontaneous settlers or farm workers in the
                                    - 31 -



area, would have a commercial impact outside the area, and would eventually
generate additional fiscal revenues. The remainder of investment costs would
be borne, over the long term, by the federal budget. As agricultural
production increases, however, substantial fiscal benefits would be obtained
from the taxation of marketed project production. At an average rate of
13.5% on the value of sales, the marketing tax (ICM) paid by merchants and
intermediaries would, at full developmerLt,with improved collection measures
allowing the taxation of about 70% of marketed outputs, produce annual
revenues to the state of Rondonia of the!order of US$9.8 million, at March
1983 prices. This compares to some US$'5.6million per year in recurrent
costs required to operate and maintain the infrastructure and non-commercial
services established under the project, other than road maintenance.
Experience in Brazil shows that various road user charges and taxes are
sufficient to cover road maintenance costs. Rural Social Security revenues
levied at 2.5% on the value of marketed production, would amount to some
US$2.0 million per year at full development and would be used to cover health
expenditures (US$2.3 million) in the project area. Users of drying and
storage units, pilot sawmills and input supplies would pay for most of the
operating and maintenance costs, including depreciation, of these services.
The federal government would generate annual coffee export tax revenues of
about US$6.6 million at full development. The excess in annual federal and
state revenues over operating expenditures, of about US$10.8 million per
annum at full development, would compensate in part for investment costs not
recovered by INCRA and operating costs iinthe early years. The cost of rural
credit to the government should be considerably reduced as subsidies are
gradually phased out.

                VIII.   ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION

                        A.   Economic   Rate   of Return

8.01      The economic rate of return to the directly productive components
of the proposed investments (representing about 88% of total project
investment costs) has been estimated at 26%. For various other aspects of
the project, such as the health and education components, which have
significant but no readily quantifiable benefits, no economic rate of return
was calculated. The benefits expected from the project transcend, however,
its purely economic results, since the project provides for an institutional
development which would allow a wide replication of the cost-effective
procedures developed for this project, while (a) avoiding the degradation of
the Amazonian environment which would otherwise occur with large numbers of
immigrants spontaneously entering areas possibly unsuited for agriculture and
limited, for lack of infrastructure and services, to annual crops and
shifting cultivation; and (b) providing these migrants with adequate services
and assistance to limit the severe personal risks to which they would
otherwise be subjected. Economic price assumptions are detailed in Table 10,
and the cost and benefit streams assumed in the economic analysis are given
in Table 11.

8.02      The cost stream used in the economic rate of return analysis
includes (a) all on-farm incremental investment and operating costs; (b)
project investment costs related to agricultural production; and (c)
recurrent costs of production-related services, such as extension,research,
forestry development, project coordination and maintenance of productive
infrastructure during and after the six years of project implementation.
                                       -   32   -




The benefit stream includes (a) the economic value of the increasing
productionof the farmers gradually settled over the six years of the
project,minus their pre-projectincome; and (b) the net value added by NUAR
inhabitantsemployed in non-agricultural  sectors. Non-agricultural  benefits
derived from the rural road network and NUAR infrastructure were assessed on
the basis of a conservativeestimate af populationgrowth in the NUARs (400
families per NUAR five years after the establishment of a given NUAR and 40
families per satellitecenter), assuming that the average value added per
NUAR family is about US$500 on the second year of a family's establishment,
increasingto US$2,000 per annum as of the fourth year (para 8.05).

8.03      The prices used in the economic analysis for inputs and outputs
traded on the international market were based on world price trends adjusted
to take into account processing, transport,handling and insurancecosts. Of
the project products,Brazil is a net exporter of coffee, guarana, Brazil nut
and rice, and a net importerof rubber and, periodically,rice, corn, beans
and meat. Brazil is also a net importer of fertilizer. Non-tradedgoods,
such as cassava,were valued at local farmgate prices. Most of these prices
are expected to remain stable or increase over the next decade. Labor was
priced at the wages prevailingin the region, which are currently twice the
wages in other parts of Brazil, but are expected to drop, in real terms, to
75% of the present high wages from year 6 on, as migrants continue to arrive
and a more balanced labor situationis generated. Foreign exchange costs and
benefitswere adjusted upward by 20% to reflect trade-distorting  tariffs,
subsidies,advance import deposits, export taxes and quantitative
restrictions.

8.04      The rate of return also takes into considerationthe direct impact
of the new infrastructure on the creation of urban job opportunities.
Excluding urban value added, the economic rate of return of the project would
drop to about 24%. Sensitivitytests reflectingthe impact of possible
changes in the economicenvironmenton the project's stream of costs and
benefits show (Table 8.1) that the returns are relativelysensitive to lags
in production(once the infrastructure has been completed). In view of the
high rates of immigrationand the corr,esponding pressure on agricultural
land, the avoidanceof delays in productionwould depend mainly on the
institutionalefficiencyof the lead project agencies.

                       Project BeneficiariLes

8.05      Project infrastructure and serviicesare expected to benefit all
15,000 farm and some 5,600 urban families expected to settle in the project
area by 1988. Experience with similar settlements in the Northwest region
has shown, however, that urban development which accompanies agricultural
settlement, and which the project would facilitate by the provision of NUAR
infrastructure, could, in the longer term, result in approximately equivalent
numbers of rural and urban families. Agricultural activities generated by
the project would require 29,000 man-years of family and hired labor
annually, at full development. Indirectly, the development of the settlement
area would also create at least 8,000 new permanent jobs in the
administrative, construction, processing and commercial sectors. The
education component would reach some 20,000 students. Productive and social
investment costs per farm and urban beneficiary family, at March 1983 prices,
including physical contingencies, are of the order of US$4,100, to which
on-farm investments of the order of US$6,500 should be added for the 15,000
farm families. These figures compare favorably with worldwide Bank
experience of an average per family settlement cost in rainfed areas of the
order of US$6,500 in 1975 prices, equivalent to about US$11,000 in 1983
prices.5/

8.06      As with previous Northwest projects, the New Settlements project
considers the whole family as a productive unit. Farm requirements provide
work opportunities for women and children, particularly indispensable during
the early pioneering period, when the fam,ilycan rely only on its own
resources to meet a variety of requirements. The extension services and
farmer organization programs would focus on the needs of the whole family,
including the non-agricultural aspects of pioneer life.

                          C.    EnvironmenLtal   Impact

8.07      During project preparation, particular consideration was given to
the improvement of settlement planning techniques, thus contributing
significantly to a reduction of the risks of soil erosion and to the
maintenance of areas of low agricultural potential under forest cover. The
project would introduce selective techniques of tree crop development and
train farmers in continuous annual cropping with fallow periods to avoid
shifting cultivation. Means to maximize the economic use of timber removed
from agricultural areas would be developed, together with techniques for the
rational and sustained use of those lega:Lreserve areas which have forestry
potential. Other environmental concerns of the region (environmental and
ecological research and monitoring, establishment of natural reserves) are
being attended through the Northwest I Agricultural Development and
Environmental Protection Project (Loan 2060-BR). At full development, the
project would result in the clearing, for agricultural purposes, of some
300,000 to 400,000 ha out of a total project area of about 1.1 million ha.

                               D.   Project Risks

8.08      The project is located in a yet totally undeveloped and
environmentally sensitive frontier area, where lower quality soils are more

abundant than in the earlier settlement areas of central Rondonia or Mato
Grosso. Furthermore, the administrative requirements of the project would
add to the burden of the already complex coordination, monitoring and
decision-making process of the Northwest Program, on which adequate measures
to detect and minimize negative social and environmental impact would
depend. However, with the ongoing paving of BR-364, the growing need to
channel the pressure of immigration toward the best available areas far
outweighs the potential risks of the project.

Institutional Risks

 8.09     The project involves a large number of federal and local
institutions, many of which are strained in human and financial resources,
although they have up to now responded reasonably well to their various tasks
under previous Northwest projects. The three major institutions (INCRA, IBDF
and SUDHEVEA) would receive technical assistance from the project. Transfers
of funds have suffered delays in other Bank-financed projects, but the
government remains commited to the timely implementation of the Northwest
Program, and project implementation has already started. Some delays could
occur if funds are not released on time, complementary staff is not allocated
or coordination is loose. The commitment of all project agencies to make
staff available as required, improved monitoring and evaluation procedures,
and Bank financing of 50% of overall costs the first two years and 100% of
training and consultant budgets should help reinforce considerably the major
project institutions. The capability of various agencies to train extension,
health and education staff and retain them within the project area thereafter
will have a crucial impact on the long--term results of the project.

Production Risks

 8.10     There is yet some debate among knowledgeable agronomists as to how
rapidly immigrant farmers would adopt a technology approprialte to Amazon
soils with moderate to marginal fertility. The land use planning and
agricultural plot allocation process under the project are, however, much
more sophisticated than in previous public or private settlements in the
region and should help select both adequate soils and more knowledgeable
settlers. Because of weak world market prospects and soils generally less
suitable for coffee, the project has emphasized the promotion of relatively
new crops such as rubber and fruit trees. There is growing evidence in the
region that, with proper management, the risk of SALB can be sufficiently
controled at reasonable costs. There is little experience yet in growing
non-traditional fruit trees. The impact of failure in growing one species is
mitigated, however, by the great variety of trees that can be grown. To
reduce areas initially planted in annual crops or given to grazing because of
limited credit and labor availability, the special studies financed by the
project would help develop new perennial cropping strategies.. The risk of
expansion of areas under extensive use as a result of a gradual concentration
of land ownership would be amplified if (a) the settlers were not provided
with adequate financial and other resources to achieve the best returns from
a land which they would otherwise be tempted to sell; or (b) qualified
farmers were not selected for settlement. Strict selection criteria, close
monitoring of future changes in land ownership and of the reasons for such
changes, adequate credit resources and early planting of perennial crops, all
provided by the project, should considerably reduce this risk. Success in
                                    - 35 -



forestry operationswill depend, in a first phase, on the administration's
capacity to generate additionaldemand for and organize the collectionof
lumber felled in agriculturalareas. The construction  of two sawmills under
the project would be a first step in that direction. In the longer term, the
proper exploitationof agglomeratedforest reserveswill require that area
farmers organize themselves,with the help of trained IBDF staff, in
acccordancewith the management plans to be developed by the project.

EnvironmentalRisks

8.11      Settlementin virgin Amazon regions entails a variety of well
documented environmental risks resulting from a combinationof extreme
climatic conditions,fragile soils and lack of knowledge of the region. In
order to avoid spontaneoussettlementon unsuitable soils, excessive
exploitationof farm and fish resources,clearing of steep slopes or river
banks and impropermanagement of the foretst reserves, a number of measures
were incorporatedinto earlier phases of the Northwest Program, including
ongoing research programs of CNPq on program impact on the climate and
hydrology of the region. This project puts further emphasis on a variety of
precautionarymeasures, such as improved selection of agriculturalareas;
promotion of perennialcrops as far as possible;smaller individualplots
than in earlier settlements;agglomerationof individualreserves into
blocks, reducing the risk of their conversioninto agriculturaluse; some
expansion of salvage logging operations;and strengtheningthe protectionof
natural reserves,water sources and endangeredspecies. Notwithstandingall
these measures, the risk of negative project impact on the environment,
though limited, is real, but the measures incorporatedinto the project and
the overall Northwest Program would provide acceptablestandardsof
environmentalcontrol.
