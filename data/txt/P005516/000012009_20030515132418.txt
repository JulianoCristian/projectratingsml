The 
first

would 
be

upon

and 
the second tranche, 
of 
USD25

would 
be 
disbursed 
in 
June 
2004 
upon 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
set 
of 
predetermined conditions. 
Single

20 
years

including 
5 
years

grace. 
Contribute 
to  public 
expenditure 
rationalization 
and 
efficiency, 
notably 
in 
the 
public 
education and health 
sectors, 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
effective 
asset 
management system. 
Morocco, 
like 
many 
other countries, 
treats 
its 
public land 
and 
real 
estate 
holdings 
as 
public 
goods, 
rather 
than 
productive 
assets 
capable 
of 
producing 
a 
mix of 
significant 
retums and social 
benefits 
if 
properly 
managed. 
In 
Morocco,  land 
and 
real 
estate 
typically 
represent 
25 
to 
50 
percent 
of 
public 
entities’ 
assets. 
The 
replacement cost 
of 
the 
buildings 
of 
the 
ministries 
of 
Health, 
Education 
and 
Higher 
education  alone 
amount 
to 
over 
9 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The potential 
savings 
from 
improved 
management 
of 
this 
land 
and 
real 
asset 
portfolio 
are 
significant: 
lessons 
from 
corporate 
real 
property 
management, already 
applied 
by 
a 
number 
of 
governments around 
the 
world, 
have shown that 
improved 
asset 
management systems generate 
significant 
economic 
and 
efficiency 
gains. 
The 
AMRL 
will 
help 
Morocco 
achieve 
those 
gains 
by 
promoting 
a 
reform 
targeted towards: 
i) 
a 
National 
Asset 
Management 
Policy; 
and 
ii) 
Buildings 
Management 
Systems 
for 
the 
public 
Health,  Education 
and 
Higher 
Education 
sectors. 
While 
the 
cost 
of 
maintenance 
and 
asset 
management can 
be 
high 
in 
the 
short 
term, 
its 
retum 
in 
the 
longer 
term 
is 
high. 
Therefore,  the  proposed 
adjustment 
loan 
is 
to 
finance 
the 
short-term 
reform 
costs 
and 
to 
help 
fill 
the 
budgetary 
gap 
during 
the 
period 
of 
adjustment. 
Improving 
public 
asset 
management 
in 
Morocco 
will 
generate 
efficiency 
gains and 
mediudlong-term 
savings 
and 
improve 
the  maintenance 
of 
properties. 
The 
preparation 
of 
the 
AMRL 
has 
also served 
to 
promote 
policy 
dialogue, partnership 
and 
ownership 
that 
are 
essential 
not only 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
operation 
but 
also 
for 
the 
long-term 
reforms 
needed 
on 
overall 
budget 
and 
financial 
management. 
Securing  allocation 
of 
adequate 
resources 
for 
the  purpose 
of 
public 
asset 
rationalization 
and 
maintenance 
in 
future 
budget 
laws 
remains 
the 
most 
difficult 
element 
of 
the 
operation 
in 
view 
of 
the 
rigidity 
of 
the 
budget 
in 
Morocco. 
However, 
this 
risk 
will 
be 
reduced 
as 
Morocco 
moves towards  a 
medium 
term 
expenditure 
framework. 
Poverty 
Category: 
The 
maintenance 
systems 
introduced 
by 
the 
AMRL 
include 
a 
module 
for 
primary 
schools 
and  clinics,  notably 
in 
rural 
and 
dispersed 
areas 
and 
will 
promote 
extensions 
and upgrading 
such 
as 
water 
connection. 
This 
should 
serve 
to improve 
the 
state 
and 
quality 
of 
these 
facilities, 
which 
are 
used 
primarily 
by 
the 
poor.

I. 
THE 
ASSET 
MANAGEMENT 
LOAN 
AND 
THE 
CAS 
1. 
The 
AMRL 
supports 
improved  efficiency 
in 
public 
expenditures, 
by 
helping 
rationalize 
investment, maintenance and 
rehabilitation 
expenditures 
in 
education 
and 
health, 
and 
improve public 
asset 
management. 
The 
operation 
therefore  promotes 
three 
key 
objectives 
of 
the 
CAS: 
expenditure 
rationalization, 
long-term 
fiscal 
sustainability, 
and 
improved 
service 
delivery 
in 
the 
social 
sectors. 
The 
AMRL 
is 
a 
key 
element 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
approach 
for  improving 
public 
expenditure 
and 
long-term 
fiscal sustainability. 
After 
conducting 
a 
participatory 
PER, 
which 
not only 
generated 
an 
important 
reform 
agenda 
but 
also 
led 
to 
significant 
reforms 
on 
deconcentration, 
the 
Bank 
shifted 
its 
support 
towards 
ongoing 
technical 
assistance, 
which 
is 
now 
being 
accompanied 
by 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
public 
administration 
reform 
loan. 
The 
TA 
and 
loan 
are 
focused 
on 
supporting longer-term 
goals 
of 
budget 
reform 
(and 
civil 
service 
reform), 
while 
the 
AMRL 
is 
designed 
to 
move quickly 
in 
more 
discrete 
areas 
where 
strong 
consensus 
and 
ownership 
already 
exist  and  tangible 
benefits  can 
be 
demonstrated. 
Thus, 
even 
though 
this 
is 
a 
relatively 
small 
operation, 
it 
can 
have 
an 
immediate 
and 
significant  public 
expenditure 
efficiency 
impact. 
It 
is 
envisaged  that  once  the 
asset 
management 
reforms 
are 
launched through 
the 
AMRL, 
they 
will 
be 
incorporated 
in 
a 
medium 
term 
expenditure 
framework 
covered 
under 
the 
public 
administration 
reform 
program. 
3. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
operation 
is 
asset 
management 
reform 
and 
public 
expenditure 
rationalization, 
which 
are best 
tackled 
cross-sectorally 
under the 
leadership 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, rather than 
through  specific 
investments. 
Thus, 
although 
the 
AMRL 
was 
initially 
designed 
as 
an 
investment 
operation, the 
design 
was 
changed 
to 
policy-based  lending. 
This 
helps 
raise  maintenance 
as 
a 
chronic 
and 
systemic 
problem 
of 
Moroccan 
public 
administration. 
4. 
The improved 
budget situation 
in 
2002 
warrants the 
Bank moving to 
the 
full 
base 
case 
program 
(under 
which 
sectoral 
reform 
programs 
are 
included). 
In 
addition, 
the 
proposed  operation’s  transformation 
from 
investment 
to 
budget 
support 
follows 
practical 
considerations  rather 
than  any 
substantial 
changes 
in 
the  nature 
of 
the 
operation. 
Finally, 
the 
loan’s 
increase 
from 
the 
base case 
amount 
of 
USD 
30 
million 
to 
the 
current 
USD 
45 
million 
is 
happening 
in 
a 
context 
of 
improved 
macroeconomic 
performance and 
lower 
than expected 
Bank 
lending, and therefore 
does 
not 
increase 
Bank 
exposure. 
This 
loan, 
in 
its 
current 
structure, 
is 
a 
key 
contribution to 
the 
base 
case 
scenario, 
and 
one that 
is 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
CAS 
discussed at 
the 
Board 
in 
May 
2001. 
5. 
The 
amount 
proposed 
for 
the 
AMRL 
is 
in 
line 
with 
the 
estimated 
costs 
of 
the 
proposed 
reform 
program. 
It 
is 
to 
finance 
part 
of 
the actual 
costs 
of 
the 
policy 
change 
and 
reforms 
during 
the 
adjustment 
period 
rather 
than 
provide 
broad 
budgetary 
support. 
The 
use 
of 
an adjustment 
loan 
for 
this 
limited 
and focused purpose 
does 
not 
signal 
a 
departure 
from 
the 
base 
case 
scenario. 
’ 
This 
operation 
does 
not 
include private 
health and education 
services. 
Hence 
whenever 
the health 
and 
education 
sectors are 
mentioned 
in 
this 
document, 
it 
is 
the 
public 
health 
and education 
sector 
we 
are 
referring to. 
Page  6

6. 
Finally, 
by 
fostering a 
new 
type 
of 
partnership 
with 
Morocco, 
away 
from 
a 
regulatory 
stance 
and towards 
a trust 
mode, 
the 
AMRL 
offers a prudent way 
of 
getting 
to 
the 
broader budgetary 
reforms 
envisaged 
in 
the 
CAS, 
should 
triggers 
be 
met. 
The 
loan 
has 
a 
simple, 
and easily 
monitorable 
output-based 
structure 
- 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
loan 
would 
be 
disbursed 
in 
the 
second 
tranche 
based 
on 
results, 
while 
first 
tranche 
disbursement 
is 
based 
on 
required 
inputs 
(adoption 
of 
appropriate  regulations, 
systems 
and procedures.) 
11. 
MACROECONOMIC 
SITUATION 
A. 
Current 
Situation 
The 
Government’s  economic 
policy 
continues 
to 
focus 
on 
reducing poverty 
and 
urban 
unemployment through 
faster 
economic 
growth 
and 
improved 
social 
services. 
Over 
the 
last 
decade, 
Morocco 
has 
achieved 
significant 
progress 
in 
establishing 
macroeconomic stability, 
with 
a 
declining 
foreign 
debt, sustainable 
current 
account 
balances, 
comfortable external 
reserves 
(at about 
9 
months 
of 
imports), and 
inflation 
at 
industrial 
country 
levels 
(around 
2 
percent 
per 
annum). 
Real 
GDP 
growth 
rate 
is 
estimated 
at 6.5 
percent 
in 
2001 
and 
4.5 
percent 
in 
2002. 
The 
high 
growth 
in 
2001 
was 
largely 
due 
to  good  agricultural 
performance 
but 
also 
to  improving 
non- 
agricultural 
performance, 
in 
part 
boosted 
by 
the 
fiscal 
expansionary 
policy. 
8. 
The 
fiscal 
situation had 
deteriorated 
in 
2000-2001, 
when 
high 
privatization 
receipts 
were used 
to 
finance 
an expansionary 
fiscal 
policy 
(mainly 
through 
salary 
increases 
in 
the 
public 
sector). 
Since 
then, 
authorities 
have 
tightened 
management 
and 
brought 
down 
the 
fiscal deficit 
from 
6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001 
to 
4.6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2002. 
This 
improvement 
justifies 
a 
return 
to 
fast 
disbursing 
support 
to  Morocco 
as 
indicated 
in 
the 
CAS. 
Public 
expenditures 
fell 
in 
2002 
by 
2.5 
percentage 
point 
of 
GDP 
below 
the 
2000 
peak. 
The 
decline 
in 
expenditure 
was  across 
the 
board, 
but 
among 
the 
more positive 
developments 
is 
a 
fall 
in 
the wage 
bill 
for 
the 
first 
time 
since the 
mid-nineties. 
For 
2003, expenditures 
are 
forecast 
to 
decline 
further 
through 
savings 
on 
interest 
payments  and 
wages, 
and 
through 
measures 
to 
improve 
the 
structure 
of 
expenditures. 
In 
particular, 
the 
Government 
has 
adopted 
key 
measures 
to 
reduce wage 
bill 
pressure. 
Indeed, 
this 
is 
part 
of 
an 
overall 
effort to 
reduce the 
budget 
deficit 
by 
implementing 
sustained 
corrective 
adjustment  based 
on 
sound 
institutional 
reform 
in 
the 
public 
sector, 
as 
well 
as 
greater competitiveness. 
The 
proposed operation 
supports such 
fiscal 
rationalization, 
albeit 
in 
a 
partial 
manner. 
B. 
Medium-Term 
Challenges 
9. 
Budget 
deficit 
increases 
in 
2000 
and 
2001 
did 
not 
destabilize, 
in 
any 
significant 
way, 
the general 
macroeconomic situation. 
Privatization 
revenues 
helped 
finance 
the 
larger 
deficit. 
Nevertheless, 
a 
continuation 
of 
the 
trends 
of 
the 
2000  and 
2001 
budgets 
would 
have  raised 
concerns 
with 
respect 
to 
medium-term 
fiscal 
sustainability 
(government 
debt 
would 
increase  once 
privatization 
revenues 
run 
off) 
and 
with 
respect 
to 
the increased 
rigidity 
in 
the  structure 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
The 
good 
performance 
on 
the 
2002 
budget, despite 
a 
difficult 
international 
environment,  and 
Page  7
the 
notable 
effort 
to 
reduce the 
external 
debt 
from 
42% 
to 
35% 
through 
an 
active 
debt 
management strategy, 
was 
a very 
positive 
development. 
10. 
The 
authorities 
have 
acknowledged their  concern 
for 
fiscal 
sustainability 
and have 
begun 
to 
take action. 
In 
January 2003, the 
Government 
announced 
its 
plan 
to 
limit 
the 
budget 
deficit 
to 
3% 
of 
GDP 
(excluding 
privatization 
receipts) 
by 
2007.  Overall, 
moving to 
a 
more 
sustainable 
fiscal framework 
while 
accelerating 
essential 
structural 
reforms 
is 
key 
in 
unleashing 
the economy’s 
growth potential 
to 
meet the challenges 
of 
unemployment and 
rising 
poverty. 
These 
are 
the 
objectives 
that, 
in 
the 
view 
of 
Bank 
and 
IMF 
staff, 
this 
operation 
will 
help 
support 
in 
a 
modest 
but 
realistic 
and 
effective 
manner. 
11. 
The 
operation 
is 
set 
against 
a  backdrop 
of 
slow 
but 
steady 
progress 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
performance-based budgetary management system 
in 
the 
context 
of 
development 
of 
a 
medium-term 
expenditure 
framework. 
This 
will 
allow 
for 
greater 
efficiency 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
a 
better 
vision 
of 
the 
overall 
impact 
of 
public 
expenditures and 
enhance 
the 
authorities’ 
ability 
to 
optimize 
the 
allocation 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
It 
should 
also 
allow 
for 
more 
effective control 
and 
input 
by 
Parliament,  an 
important 
element 
of 
the ongoing democratic  transition. 
The 
Bank 
aims 
to 
support 
the 
ongoing 
reform 
process 
in 
Morocco 
to 
achieve 
both 
its 
short and 
medium-term 
objectives 
through 
appropriate instruments 
for 
each.

SOCIAL 
SECTOR 
CONTEXT 
A. 
Overall 
Performance 
of 
the 
Social Sectors 
12. 
Social 
expenditures 
are 
among 
the  largest 
items 
in 
the  budget, 
and have had 
the 
highest 
increase 
in 
recent years. 
For 
Education 
and 
Health, 
however, 
this 
increase 
was 
mostly 
absorbed 
by 
an increase 
in 
the 
wage 
bill, 
which 
is 
crowding 
out 
other 
needed 
current 
expenditures 
and 
investment,  and 
affecting 
service 
quality.  The 
situation 
of 
the 
social 
sectors 
in 
Morocco 
can be characterized 
by: 
o 
a 
relatively 
high 
but 
inefficient 
budget 
allocation 
for 
Education 
(6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
or 
29 percent 
of 
primary 
public 
expenditures 
of 
the budget); 
an 
increasing yet 
still 
insufficient 
allocation 
for Health 
(1.2 
percent 
of 
GDP 
or 
6 
percent 
of 
budget), and 
a 
very 
low 
allocation 
for 
social 
safety nets 
(mostly through 
food 
subsidies) 
with 
a notable exception 
of 
the 
recent drought 
emergency 
program. 
13. 
Institutional 
inefficiencies 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
remain 
substantial. 
Excessive 
centralization 
has 
resulted 
in 
slow 
program 
implementation, 
lack 
of 
cross-sector 
coordination 
and 
insufficient  participation 
from 
stakeholders, 
while 
failing 
to 
promote  better 
prioritization 
or 
efficient 
use 
of 
public 
resources. 
Thus, 
public 
hospitals 
occupancy rates stand 
at 
around 
50 
percent; 
many recently 
built 
schools 
remain 
unattended 
for 
lack 
of 
basic services such 
as 
water 
or 
access 
roads; and 
in 
secondary education,  student-to-teacher 
ratios 
average 
only 
12, 
a 
very 
low 
level 
by 
international 
standards. 
Recently, however, 
consensus 
has 
emerged 
in 
Morocco 
that 
the 
centralized 
administration 
model 
has 
become an obstacle 
to 
development,  and 
reform 
efforts underway 
focus 
on 
decentralization.

14. 
Management 
of 
real 
assets 
follows 
a 
similarly 
inefficient 
pattern. 
Expenditures 
on 
real 
estate are 
dominated 
by 
new 
construction (Table 
1.) 
Education, and 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent 
Health, 
are 
rapidly 
increasing 
their 
buildings 
portfolio, 
but 
are 
failing 
to 
maintain 
what 
they  already  have. 
Maintenance 
is 
almost  non-existent 
and most 
buildings 
interventions 
take the 
form 
of 
overall 
rehabilitation. 
As 
a 
result,  many 
buildings 
are 
in 
poor 
or 
very 
poor 
condition, 
which 
is 
affecting 
service 
delivery.

18. 
Education 
is 
currently 
the 
greatest 
challenge 
for 
Morocco’s 
development. 
Even 
though 
education 
spending 
has 
traditionally 
been 
higher 
than 
in 
other 
lower-middle 
income 
countries,  results  have been 
lower 
because 
of 
low 
expenditure 
efficiency. 
Input 
costs are 
high 
due 
to 
teachers’ 
wages 
substantially 
above 
comparable 
countries’ 
and 
high 
student-teacher 
ratio. 
Wages absorb 
90 
percent 
of 
current expenditure 
and 
82 
percent 
of 
the 
overall 
education 
budget. 
As 
a result, 
Morocco 
lags 
behind 
most 
other.low 
and 
middle-income 
countries 
in 
key 
indicators 
such 
as 
literacy 
and 
access 
to 
education 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Recent 
progress 
includes 
the 
adoption 
in 
1999 
of 
a 
“Charter 
for 
Education” 
prepared 
by 
a 
Royal 
Commission 
composed 
of 
all 
key 
stakeholders. 
The 
charter 
focuses 
on 
decentralization, 
community 
involvement, 
universal 
access 
and 
improved 
quality. 
Access 
to 
education 
in 
rural 
areas 
has 
also 
improved 
dramatically 
since 
the 
mid- 
199Os, 
especially 
for 
girls. 
The 
gaps 
in 
terms 
of 
access 
and 
literacy remain 
large 
however, 
implying 
the need 
for 
significant 
and sustained 
efforts. 
Key 
challenges 
now 
consist 
in 
implementing 
the 
broad 
reforms 
embodied 
in 
the 
Charter, 
while improving 
quality 
and 
progressively redressing 
the 
inefficient 
pattern 
of 
public 
expenditures. 
This 
will 
require a 
comprehensive 
implementation 
plan, 
as 
well 
as 
increased 
flexibility 
through a 
variety 
of 
measures, 
such 
as 
the development 
of 
community 
schools, increased 
parental 
involvement 
and a 
new incentive 
structure 
to 
improve 
quality. 
The 
Bank 
is 
assisting 
in 
this 
major 
effort 
through 
ongoing 
projects, 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
preparation 
of 
a 
broad-based 
education 
reform 
support 
operation. 
A 
key 
issue 
facing 
Morocco 
is 
that, 
despite the 
current 
backlog 
in 
access, 
a linear 
expansion 
of 
the system 
is 
not 
a feasible solution. 
This 
conclusion 
is 
reinforced 
by 
the 
demographic 
trends that 
will 
bring 
about 
a 
drop 
in 
primary 
enrollment 
in 
the 
next 
five 
years. 
Consequently,  the 
means 
to 
achieve the 
objective 
of 
larger 
enrollment 
Page  9
5 
stated 
in 
the "Charter" 
should 
be 
found 
in 
a 
higher 
teacher 
utilization 
in 
secondary 
and 
higher 
basic  education; 
in 
more 
flexible 
alternative 
delivery 
mechanisms 
in 
primary 
education;  and 
in 
improved 
efficiency 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
more 
flexible 
asset 
management  (outsourcing, 
leases, 
and 
asset 
rationalization 
program). 
The  Education 
Ministry 
is 
in 
charge 
of 
what 
is 
probably 
the  largest 
real 
estate 
portfolio 
of 
any 
ministry. 
Its 
replacement cost 
is 
estimated 
at 
about 
USD 
1.9 
billion, 
equivalent 
to 
5.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
(Table 
2.) 
This 
portfolio 
has 
been 
increasing 
rapidly 
as 
the 
Ministry 
has 
been 
investing 
close 
to 
USD 
86 
million 
per annum 
since 1997-98. 
Most 
of 
the 
new 
construction 
has 
been 
in 
primary 
schools rather 
than 
secondary 
or 
technical 
schools. 
The 
Education 
Ministry 
is 
the 
ministry 
spending  the 
most 
on 
buildings 
(on 
average 
6.4 percent 
of 
its overall 
budget) 
with 
the 
quasi 
totality 
going 
into 
new 
construction. 
Additional 
resources 
for 
rehabilitation 
have  been  made 
available 
since 
2000 
through a 
special 
fund 
(the 
Fond 
d'Entretien 
Communal) 
but 
the 
Ministry 
has 
had 
difficulties 
spending 
it 
- 
only 
USD 
2.7 
million 
has 
been 
spent 
out 
of 
the 
USD 
5 
1 
million 
available 
in 
2000 
and 2001.  Since the need 
is 
there, 
the 
problem 
is 
clearly 
one 
of 
absorption.

There 
appears 
to 
be 
substantial 
inefficiencies 
in 
the 
Ministry's 
management 
of 
its 
land 
and 
building 
portfolio. 
Current practices do 
not allow 
the 
full 
exploitation 
of 
alternative 
mechanisms, 
such 
as 
renting, 
outsourcing 
construction 
to 
NGOs, 
or 
using 
more traditional 
building 
techniques. 
Although 
there exists 
no 
systematic analysis 
of 
this 
issue, 
anecdotal evidence 
abounds 
on 
schools 
or administrative 
buildings 
located 
on 
land 
of 
excessive  size 
or 
value. 
As 
to 
the 
land 
acquisition 
process, 
poor 
management 
has 
resulted 
in 
the 
accumulation 
of 
arrears 
on 
payment 
for 
land 
acquired 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
which 
amount 
to 
USD 
214 
million 
(equivalent 
to 
0.5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and 
8 
percent 
of 
the 
education 
budget.) 
Unsettled expropriation 
purchases are 
a 
burden 
on 
future 
budgets 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education. 
C. 
Health 
Sector 
21. 
The 
health 
system  also  lags 
behind 
most 
low 
and 
middle-income 
countries 
and 
regional 
comparators 
in 
terms 
of 
quality 
and 
access, 
resulting 
from 
low, 
inequitable 
and 
inefficient 
spending 
on 
the 
health 
sector. 
The 
recent 
increase 
in 
budget 
allocations 
for 
health 
has 
been 
mostly 
absorbed 
by 
the 
rise 
in 
salaries 
of 
certain 
categories 
of 
medical 
personnel 
by 
almost 
50 
percent 
in 
1999-2000. 
22. 
Overall, 
Morocco's public 
expenditure 
in 
health 
is 
not 
pro-poor, 
but 
tilted 
towards 
the 
more affluent. 
40 
percent 
of 
public 
spending 
on 
health benefit 
the 
top 
quintile 
of 
income distribution, 
against 
20 
percent 
of 
spending 
for 
the 
two 
bottom 
quintiles. 
The 
government 
is 
aware 
of 
the 
issues 
and 
has 
initiated 
actions 
in 
various  fronts: 
(i) 
relative 
budgetary 
increases 
compared 
to 
other 
sectors; 
(ii) 
hospital 
rationalization; 
Page  10

23. 
24. 
25. 
26. 
(iii) 
initiation 
of 
health 
insurance  reforms; 
and 
(iv) 
increased 
allocations 
and 
programs  towards 
rural 
areas, 
especially 
in 
poor 
provinces. 
As 
in 
education, 
a 
sustained 
effort 
will, 
however, 
be 
required 
to 
improve urban-rural 
disparities 
and 
low 
outcome 
indicators, 
such 
as 
maternal and 
infant mortality 
rates. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
spends 
a 
relatively 
smaller 
share 
of 
its 
overall 
budget 
on 
real 
estate 
(4.8 
percent 
on 
average) 
possibly 
because 
its 
overall 
investment 
and 
maintenance expenditures 
need 
to 
include 
heavy equipment. 
It 
also represents 
much 
less 
than  education 
in 
absolute  amount:  over  1996-2000, 
annual 
expenditures 
on 
buildings 
averaged about 
USD 
16 
billion, 
while 
the replacement 
cost 
of 
the 
portfolio 
is 
around 
2.2 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Maintenance 
is 
also 
woefully 
inadequate, 
both 
for 
buildings 
and 
for 
equipment. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
is 
aware 
of 
these 
problems and 
has 
been 
taking 
decisive 
steps 
to 
address 
them. 
It 
has 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
improving 
health 
sector 
management 
and  financing, 
notably  through 
the 
health 
insurance 
reform. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
has 
also  become  one 
of 
the 
pilot 
ministries 
pioneering 
performance 
budgeting 
under 
the 
budget 
reform 
exercise 
under way. 
It 
is 
also 
a 
key 
champion 
of 
asset 
management. 
IV. 
PROPOSED 
PROGRAM 
OF 
REFORMS 
A. 
Background 
Morocco, 
like 
many 
other countries, treats 
its 
public land 
and 
real 
estate 
holdings 
as 
public 
goods, 
rather than 
productive 
assets 
capable 
of 
producing 
a 
mix 
of 
significant 
returns 
and 
social benefits 
if 
properly 
managed. 
Yet, 
land 
and 
real 
estate 
typically 
represent 25 
to 
50 
percent 
of 
public 
entities’ 
assets. 
In 
Morocco, 
the 
private 
domain 
of 
the 
state 
includes 
about 622,000 ha 
of 
land 
and 
36,000 
buildings, 
mostly 
under 
the 
custody 
of 
line 
ministries; 
the replacement cost 
of 
the 
buildings 
of 
the 
ministries 
of 
Health, 
Education 
and 
Higher 
Education 
alone amounts 
to 
nearly 
9 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The 
potential 
savings 
from 
improved 
management 
of 
this 
land 
and 
real 
asset 
portfolio 
are large: 
lessons 
from 
corporate 
real 
property 
management, already 
applied 
by 
a 
number 
of 
governments,  have 
shown 
that 
improved 
asset 
management 
systems 
generate 
significant 
economic 
and 
efficiency 
gains. 
One  such  lesson 
is 
the  need 
for 
cost-effective 
maintenance  systems 
for 
public 
buildings, 
an 
aspect 
that 
has 
been 
neglected 
in 
Morocco. 
Priority 
is 
given 
to 
new 
investment, 
which 
absorbs 
15 
percent 
of 
the 
national 
budget 
(excluding 
defense), 
while 
maintenance accounts 
for 
less 
than 
0.2 percent. 
In 
the 
Health, 
Education 
and 
Higher 
Education 
sectors, 
resources 
allocated 
to 
maintenance 
are 
between 
1/10 and 
1/20 
of 
the  amounts needed 
(Table 
3). 
There 
are 
no 
programming or 
budgeting 
systems 
for 
real 
asset 
maintenance. 
Preventive 
maintenance 
is 
non-existent, curative 
maintenance rare, 
with 
most 
buildings 
intervention 
taking 
the 
form 
of 
rehabilitation. 
This 
adversely 
affects 
the 
quality 
of 
public 
services 
as 
many 
public 
buildings, 
including 
schools, 
hospitals and 
clinics, 
are 
in 
poor 
conditions. 
It 
is 
also 
a 
costly 
and 
wasteful 
practice: 
USD 
1 
spent 
on 
maintenance 
typically 
saves 
USD 
3 
on 
rehabilitation.’ 
For 
the 
Health, 
Education 
and 
Higher Education 
sectors, 
the cost 
of 
foregone maintenance can 
be 
estimated at 
USD 
257 
million 
per 
year.

27. 
However, 
the massive increase 
required 
in 
maintenance budgets 
is 
not 
out 
of 
reach. 
Buildings 
in 
good condition 
require 
annual maintenance expenditures 
equivalent 
to 
2 
to 
3 
percent 
of 
construction 
cost, 
depending 
on 
the 
sophistication 
of 
the 
building. 
Given 
the 
portfolio 
of 
the 
Health, 
Education 
and 
Higher 
Education 
sectors, 
it 
implies 
an 
annual expenditure 
of 
about 
USD 
63 
million. 
This 
is 
more 
than 
20 
times 
what 
was 
allocated 
in 
2001, 
yet 
it 
amounts 
to 
only 
3 
percent 
of 
the 
ministries’ 
budget. 
Further, 
it 
amounts 
to 
about 
half 
what 
is 
spent 
annually 
on 
new 
construction. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
maintenance 
of 
public 
buildings, 
there 
is 
a 
clear 
need 
to 
rationalize 
overall  real 
asset 
management. 
Information 
on 
the 
land 
holdings 
constituting 
the 
private domain 
of 
the 
state 
is 
dispersed 
across 
a number 
of 
agencies. 
There 
is 
no 
central 
management 
mechanism 
or 
easily 
accessible 
database 
that 
identifies 
public 
property, 
its 
current 
or 
potential 
use, 
or 
the 
managing 
entity. 
Nor 
is 
there any 
incentive 
for 
ministries 
to 
rationalize 
the 
use 
of 
property 
in 
their 
custody 
or 
return 
the 
property 
for 
which 
they have 
no 
direct 
need. 
Decisions 
to 
build 
or 
rent 
buildings 
are 
made 
on 
an 
ad 
hoc 
basis, 
rather 
than 
based 
on 
an 
overall 
sectoral 
asset 
management 
plan. 
Finally, 
a number 
of 
ministries 
are 
building 
on 
land not 
yet 
acquired, 
creating 
liabilities 
of 
USD 
257 
million, 
of 
which 
USD 
180 
million 
is 
attributable 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education. 
This 
is 
due 
in 
part 
to 
poor 
planning 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
ministries, 
but 
also 
to 
cumbersome and 
dated 
land 
acquisition 
processes, 
which 
result 
in 
more than 
half 
the 
cases 
going 
into 
costly 
and 
drawn 
out 
litigation 
process.

The 
same 
budget 
code 
is 
used 
for rehabilitation 
and 
for installation 
of 
new 
buildings. 
It 
is 
sometimes 
but 
not 
always 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
between 
the 
two. 
** 
Starting 
in 
2001, most 
university 
expenditures 
were 
funneled 
through 
block 
grants 
to 
universities, 
the 
detail 
of 
which 
was 
not 
available. 
The 
average 
annual 
expenditure 
for 
the 
period 
1996-2001 
was 
USD 
1.2 
million 
on 
maintenance 
and 
rehabilitation, 
and 
USD 
20 
million 
for 
new 
construction. 
Assumption: 
maintenance 
needs 
averaging 
2% 
of 
construction 
cost; 
30% 
of 
buildings require rehabilitation 
equivalent 
to 
20% 
of 
replacement cost. 
29. 
Clearly, 
strengthened 
asset 
management 
is 
a 
key 
component 
of 
overall 
expenditure 
rationalization 
efforts. 
By 
developing 
ministerial 
asset 
management 
strategies 
and 
asset 
maintenance 
systems, 
Morocco 
would 
avoid 
costly rehabilitations 
and 
wasteful 
investments. 
Economic 
savings 
to 
be 
generated 
from 
this 
operation 
for 
the 
Government 
in 
the 
long 
run 
are, 
therefore, 
considerable. 
Improved 
asset 
Page  12
8 
management 
is 
also 
important  to 
improved 
sector 
performance 
in 
health 
and 
education, 
particularly 
in 
rural 
areas 
where 
they 
primarily 
serve 
the 
poorer 
segments 
of 
society. 
B. 
The 
Ongoing 
Reform 
Process 
30. 
Budgetary 
reform 
has 
been 
initiated 
with 
a gradual 
move 
away 
from 
a centralized 
input-based system 
to 
a 
deconcentrated performance-based 
budgetary 
management. 
To 
this 
end 
the 
government 
has 
established 
two 
inter-ministerial 
working 
groups 
to 
work 
on 
the deconcentration 
of 
budgetary procedures 
and 
on 
civil 
service 
reform. 
The 
groups have the mandate 
to 
go 
beyond 
recommendations and 
to 
draft 
the laws, 
regulation, 
and  management 
tools 
to 
operationalize 
their 
proposals. 
They 
are 
overseen 
by 
a 
high 
level 
Steering 
Committee 
composed 
of 
the Secretary Generals 
of 
participating 
ministries. 
The 
group 
working 
on 
budgetary 
reform 
is 
contributing 
to 
the 
asset 
management 
reform, 
which 
is 
an integral part 
of 
the 
Government’s 
overall 
budget 
reform. 
31. 
Based 
on 
the recommendations 
from 
the 
inter-ministerial 
working 
groups, the 
new 
system and 
the 
steps 
to 
implement 
performance-based 
budgetary 
management 
are 
detailed 
in 
a memo 
(“circulaire”) 
from 
the 
Prime Minister. 
The 
system 
is 
currently 
being 
piloted 
in 
Health. 
Budget programming 
at the 
local level 
has 
been supported 
by 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
programming 
guide 
for 
external 
services 
of 
the 
central 
administration 
and 
of 
a 
standard contract 
between central and external administration. 
The 
buildings 
management system 
promoted through 
the 
AMRL 
will 
be 
managed 
through an 
annex 
to 
this 
contract. 
The 
budget 
working 
group 
has 
also established 
a 
legal, 
budgetary 
and 
financial  framework 
for 
partnerships 
with 
NGOs 
and 
local 
community 
to 
promote alternative 
delivery 
mechanisms. 
C. 
Reform 
Measures 
and 
Areas 
of Intervention 
32. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
CAS 
base case 
scenario, 
the 
overarching objectives 
of 
the 
operation 
are 
expenditure 
rationalization 
and 
efficiency 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
through 
improved 
asset 
rationalization 
and management. 
The 
proposed 
reform 
program 
has 
identified 
three  essential 
areas 
of 
reform 
needed 
to 
establish 
an 
overall 
asset 
management 
system 
in 
the 
long 
run: 
A. 
a 
National 
Asset 
Management 
Policy 
that establishes the 
framework 
for 
the  management 
of 
the 
private 
domain 
of 
the 
state. 
This 
includes 
broad 
strategic decisions 
(would 
the 
Government 
only retain 
property 
that 
is 
immediately useful 
in 
the 
production 
of 
public 
services? 
or 
would 
it 
constitute 
reserves and 
land 
banks?) 
as 
well 
as 
the 
rules 
and 
regulation governing 
land 
acquisition, 
cession and custody, 
physical 
and 
safety 
norms. 
This 
policy 
needs 
to 
be 
decided 
at the 
national 
level. 
B. 
Strategic 
Portfolio  Management Plans 
that examine, 
for 
each 
ministry, 
whether  the 
ministry 
has 
the 
land 
and 
building 
portfolio 
needed 
to 
deliver 
on 
its 
mandate, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
budgetary 
implications 
of 
the 
investment 
and 
exploitation 
plans 
associated 
with 
this 
portfolio. 
These 
plans 
need 
to 
be developed 
by 
each 
individual 
ministry. 
Page  13

33. 
34. 
C. 
Buildings 
Management 
Systems 
that 
allow 
for 
each 
ministry 
to 
identify 
the 
buildings 
in 
their 
portfolio, 
their current 
use 
and 
condition, 
and 
to 
program 
and 
budget 
their 
maintenance 
and 
rehabilitation 
needs. 
This 
two-year operation 
is 
designed 
to 
trigger 
and 
set 
in 
motion 
the 
long-term 
reform 
process 
of 
setting 
up 
such 
a 
system, 
as 
described 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
(Annex 
3). 
Experience 
from 
other countries, 
shows 
implementation 
of 
the 
full 
reform 
takes 
fifteen 
to 
twenty 
years. 
The 
strategy 
followed for 
this 
operation 
was 
to 
sketch 
the 
broad 
structure 
of 
the 
reform, 
and 
identify 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Government 
counterparts the 
measures 
that 
could 
be taken 
to 
bring 
immediate 
improvements 
and 
jump 
start the broader 
reform. 
Thus, 
the 
AMRL 
promotes 
specific 
reforms 
in 
only 
two 
of 
the 
broad 
areas 
identified 
above, 
namely 
Asset 
Management 
Policy 
and 
Buildings 
Management 
Systems. 
Concerning 
(B), 
strategic 
portfolio 
management 
plans 
require 
underlying 
sectoral 
reforms and 
health 
and 
education 
maps that 
are 
not 
yet 
advanced enough. 
Ongoing 
work 
supported 
through 
sectoral 
dialogue should 
help promote 
improvements 
in 
this 
area, 
but 
it 
is 
best 
to 
leave 
it 
to 
subsequent 
phases 
of 
the 
reform. 
Hence, 
although 
(B) 
has 
been 
identified 
and 
recognized 
as 
a 
critical 
element,  the 
AMRL 
will 
not 
be 
addressing 
it, 
except 
through 
informal 
dialogue 
and 
collaboration 
with 
the 
health 
and 
education 
teams. 
Asset 
Management 
Policy 
Reforms 
35. 
The 
proposed 
reform 
operation 
will: 
i) 
Expedite 
resolution 
and 
reduce 
settlement 
costs 
for 
the 
DH 
3 
billion 
(USD 
260 
million) 
in 
pending 
land 
acquisitions, 
most 
of 
which 
accumulated 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education; 
in 
particular, 
procedures 
will 
be  revised 
to 
create 
technical  commissions 
that 
are 
better 
suited 
to 
establish a 
fair 
and 
reasonable 
price 
and 
allow 
them 
to 
hear 
0wne1-s.~ 
This 
should 
help 
reduce 
the 
proportion 
of 
dossiers that 
end 
in 
expropriation 
procedures and 
speed 
up 
resolution 
of 
the 
267 
affairs 
(accounting 
for 
USD 
29 
million), 
which 
are 
being, 
or 
are about 
to 
be, 
contested 
because 
of 
price 
issues. 
These tend 
to 
get 
resolved 
in 
courts 
at 
a very 
high 
cost 
for 
government 
and 
private 
citizens; 
ii) 
Prevent 
a  reconstitution 
of 
this 
debt 
by 
creating 
mechanisms 
to 
prevent 
construction 
on 
unsecured 
land 
and 
developing 
incentives 
for 
ministries 
to 
release 
the  unused 
or 
under-utilized 
properties 
in 
their 
custody. 
The 
inter- 
ministerial 
committee 
working 
on 
the 
budgetary 
reforms 
and 
on 
the 
PER 
has 
proposed 
a 
number 
of 
measures, 
which 
allow 
ministries 
to 
benefit 
from 
the 
product 
of 
the 
sale 
of 
land 
or 
building; 
Currently 
a 
large commission,  composed 
of 
representatives 
of 
deconcentrated 
agencies, 
has 
authority 
to 
both 
chose the 
land to 
be 
expropriated 
and 
fix 
the 
price 
to offer 
the 
owner. 
If 
the 
owner 
refuses, 
the 
dossier 
enters 
the 
administrative 
phase 
of 
expropriation, 
and 
once 
various 
steps 
are taken, 
the 
legal 
phase 
in 
the 
courts. 
There 
is 
no 
provision for 
hearing 
the 
owner 
or 
discussing 
the 
price. 
This 
adds 
to 
the 
perception 
of 
arbitrariness 
of 
the 
public 
land 
acquisition 
process. 
This 
proposal 
emerges 
from 
the 
PHRD 
funded 
study 
and consultation. 
Page  14

38. 
iii) 
Develop 
more 
effective 
instruments 
for 
the 
management 
of 
public 
lands 
and 
buildings. 
This 
includes 
developing 
simplified 
and 
more effective 
sets 
of 
procedures 
to 
govern 
land 
acquisition,  management 
and disposal 
and designing 
an 
information 
system 
for 
land 
and 
public 
buildings 
that 
can 
be 
shared 
across 
administrations 
and 
allows 
for 
easier 
monitoring 
of 
the 
portfolio 
and 
its 
current 
use. 
The 
specific 
reforms 
needed 
are 
described 
in 
details 
in 
Annex 
4 
along 
with 
a 
succinct 
analysis 
of 
their 
cost and 
benefits. 
Most 
require 
changes 
in 
regulations 
and practices 
(rather 
than 
laws) 
and 
are 
relatively 
straightforward 
to 
implement. 
Buildings 
Management 
System 
Reforms 
The 
objective 
is 
expenditure 
rationalization, 
notably 
the 
reallocation 
of 
expenditures 
between 
maintenance and 
new construction 
to 
ensure 
the 
adequate 
maintenance 
of 
public 
assets. 
This 
goal 
can 
only 
be reached 
progressively 
since 
it 
entails 
major 
changes 
in 
culture 
and practices 
as 
well 
as 
substantial 
budgetary re-allocations. 
The 
decision then 
is 
to 
pursue 
it 
in 
three 
broad 
stages: 
i) 
Definition 
of 
buildings 
management 
systems, 
that 
allows programming 
and 
budgeting 
of 
works; 
ii) 
Implementation 
and  adjustment 
of 
these 
systems 
in 
a number 
of 
regions, 
acadkmies 
or 
universities, 
including 
reporting 
and 
auditing 
mechanisms 
adapted 
to 
the 
ongoing 
budgetary 
reforms; 
iii) 
Gradual 
rollout 
of 
systems 
to 
cover 
the 
whole country 
and 
all 
ministries. 
The 
operation 
will 
therefore 
help 
the three 
participating 
ministries 
(Health, 
Education 
and 
Higher 
Education) 
adopt buildings 
management 
systems 
and 
implement 
them 
fully 
in 
one 
fifth 
of 
the regions 
(Health), 
acadkmies 
(Education) 
and 
universities. 
One 
region, 
one 
acadbmie 
and 
one 
university 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project, 
and 
three 
more 
of 
each 
in 
the  second year. 
Full 
deployment 
across 
the 
country should 
take 
5 
years 
in 
order 
not 
to 
overstretch budgetary and 
managerial 
capacity. 
Budgetary 
implications 
have 
been 
reviewed 
with 
the 
PER 
team  and 
deemed reasonable. 
The 
total 
cost 
of 
the 
reform 
for 
the 
two 
years 
covered 
by 
the 
proposed operation 
is 
around 
USD 
20 
million. 
The 
feasible 
calendar 
for 
the 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
reform (which 
stretches 
beyond 
the 
current 
operation) 
is 
presented 
in 
Annex 
5, 
along 
with 
a detailed 
description 
of 
the 
reforms 
and 
their 
budgetary 
implications. 
If 
successful, 
the 
AMRL 
will 
achieve 
short-term 
gains 
in 
efficiency 
in 
public 
expenditures 
while 
also 
creating a 
sustainable and 
more 
conducive 
environment 
for 
ongoing 
budget 
reform 
efforts. 
The 
broader 
framework 
of 
budget 
reform 
(including 
deconcentrated 
performance 
based 
budgeting 
within 
a 
medium term 
expenditure 
framework) 
as 
well 
as 
civil 
service 
reform 
is 
planned 
for 
next fiscal 
year. 
In 
addition, 
the 
AMIU 
will 
help 
promote  a 
cross-sectoral 
and 
participatory 
approach 
to 
budgetary and 
institutional 
reforms 
both 
in 
Morocco 
and 
within 
the 
Bank.

PROPOSED 
LOAN 
A. 
Loan 
Amount 
39. 
The 
proposed loan, 
in 
the amount 
of 
USD 
45 
million 
equivalent, 
will 
help 
fund 
the 
proposed 
reform 
program 
on 
the 
asset 
rationalization 
and 
management. 
The loan 
will 
be 
made 
to 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
Morocco 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an adjustment 
loan 
of 
two 
tranches, 
with 
an 
expected disbursement 
period 
of 
two 
years. 
The 
first 
tranche 
of 
USD 
20 
million 
would 
be disbursed 
upon 
effectiveness. 
The 
second tranche 
of 
USD 
25 
million 
is 
to 
be 
disbursed 
in 
June 
2004 
upon 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
set 
of 
predetermined 
conditions. 
B. 
Tranching and Conditionality 
40. 
The 
proposed 
reform 
program 
will 
follow 
a very 
simple input-output 
structure 
as 
presented 
in 
the 
policy 
matrix 
(Annex 
2). 
In 
terms 
of 
input, 
procedures 
(amicable 
alternative 
to 
legal 
expropriation, 
maintenance 
systems) 
have 
been adopted 
prior to 
negotiations. 
In 
the 
few 
cases 
where 
additional 
work 
is 
required 
(revised 
code 
domanial, 
information 
systems) 
terms 
of 
reference 
has 
been 
agreed 
upon, 
resources 
identified 
and procurement 
set 
underway 
prior 
to 
negotiations. 
41. 
Second tranche 
disbursement 
of 
USD 
25 
million 
will 
be conditional 
upon 
results 
(technical 
dossiers 
established 
for 
pending 
land 
affairs 
incurred 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
education, 
reduction 
of 
the 
backlog 
of

land  or 
build 
on 
unsecured  land; 
and 
buildings 
maintenance 
systems 
tested, 
modified 
and 
ready 
for

and 
satisfactorily 
implemented 
in

regions), 
and 
means 
for 
the 
continued 
implementation 
of 
the 
program 
(approval 
by 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
of 
a Finance 
Law 
containing 
adequate 
financial  provision 
and 
signed  performance 
contracts 
between 
MOF, 
line 
ministries 
and deconcentrated 
agencies.) 
Annex 
2 
contains the 
policy 
matrix, 
which 
is 
also summarized 
below. 
42. 
The 
following 
has 
been 
implemented 
prior 
to 
negotiations: 
Asset 
Management 
Policy 
o 
The 
Government 
has 
adopted 
a 
strategy 
of 
rationalization 
of 
its 
policies 
on 
public 
land 
and 
real 
assets, 
as 
exposed 
in 
the 
Letter 
of 
Sector 
Development 
Policy 
signed 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
by 
the 
Minister 
delegated 
to 
the 
Prime 
Minister, 
in 
charge 
of 
economic 
affairs, 
general 
affairs 
and 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
economy 
(Annex 
3.) 
The 
Prime 
Minister 
has 
issued 
a 
circulaire 
allowing 
the 
evaluation 
committees

The 
Prime 
Minister 
has 
issued 
a 
circulaire 
that: 
(i) 
allows 
Ministries to 
obtain a 
credit 
within 
the 
Fond 
de

Domanial 
for 
the proceeds 
of 
ceded

in 
resources  otherwise 
allocated 
to  them 
for  building 
acquisition,  towards 
buildings 
rehabilitation 
or 
maintenance; 
and 
(ii) 
instructs 
ministries 
to 
budget 
for 
land 
acquisition 
when 
budgeting 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
buildings. 
This 
will

(i) 
based 
on 
the 
result 
of 
the 
Audit, 
that 
the 
overall 
implementation 
of 
building 
management 
systems was 
satisfactory. 
(ii) 
on 
a 
remedial 
plan 
for 
identified 
shortcomings. 
The 
three

ministries 
have 
each issued 
a

designate the 
3 
regions, 
3

and 
3 
universities 
where the system 
will 
be 
implemented, 
as 
well 
as

total 
of 
4 
regions, 
4

and 
4 universities. 
o 
o

Additional 
requirements 
are 
that  the 
macroeconomic 
framework 
be 
considered 
adequate and that 
if 
requested 
by 
the 
Bank, 
an 
audit 
of 
first

has 
been 
received 
within 
9 
months 
of 
request, 
and 
found 
acceptable

C. 
Borrower 
Commitment 
45. 
The 
reform 
program 
was 
initiated 
at 
the request 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
which 
has 
demonstrated 
continued 
leadership 
in 
its 
development. 
Substantial 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
technical 
assistance 
were  made 
possible 
by 
a 
PHRD 
grant  that 
funded 
two 
studies. 
46. 
One 
study 
focused 
on 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
public 
domain 
of 
the 
state, 
and 
has 
been 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
a 
committee 
chaired 
by 
the 
Direction 
des 
Domaines, 
Page  18
14 
the agency 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
that 
acts 
as 
the Government’s 
real 
estate 
agent 
and 
financial 
manager 
for 
the 
private 
domain, 
and 
a number 
of 
other 
agencies 
with 
interest 
in 
land 
issues. 
The 
Direction 
des 
Domaines 
has 
contributed 
its 
substantial 
technical 
expertise and 
guided 
the 
selection 
of 
reforms 
to 
pursue. 
It 
has 
also helped 
foster 
consensus 
among 
committee 
members 
through 
a 
one-week 
workshop 
conducted 
to 
validate 
the 
diagnostic  and 
orient 
the 
recommendation 
of 
the study. 
The 
final 
workshop 
on 
March 
28, 
2002 
was 
presided 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance, 
attended 
by 
the  secretary 
generals 
of 
all 
concerned 
ministries, 
had 
over 
100 
participants, 
including 
a number 
of 
representatives 
from 
the 
press, 
and generated 
wide 
press 
coverage and 
public 
debate. 
47. 
The 
second 
study, 
on 
maintenance 
systems, 
was 
overseen 
by 
a committee 
composed 
of 
the 
buildings 
and 
works  directors 
of 
the 
ministries 
of 
Health, 
Education,  and 
Higher 
Education, 
and 
chaired 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Equipment. 
The 
study 
required 
substantial 
involvement 
of 
the 
committee 
members 
as 
well 
as 
regional 
and 
local 
delegates, 
resulting 
in 
proposed maintenance 
systems 
tailored 
to individual 
ministry’s 
requirement, and “owned” 
by 
the 
buildings 
and 
works 
staff 
that 
would 
need 
to 
apply 
them. 
A 
seminar,  that 
took 
place  February 
18’ 
and 
19’h 
2002, 
allowed 
for 
dissemination 
of 
the proposed maintenance 
systems 
and a broad consultation 
with 
regional 
and 
local officials who 
will 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
implementing 
it. 
The 
seminar 
was 
extremely 
well 
attended, 
and demonstrated 
ownership 
at the 
grass 
root 
level. 
48. 
More 
than 
anything, 
borrower commitment 
is 
demonstrated 
by 
the actions 
taken 
prior 
to 
negotiations. 
D. 
Alternative 
Operations Considered 
and 
Reasons 
for 
Rejection 
49. 
The 
alternatives  considered 
to 
this 
adjustment 
loan 
were  a 
TA 
loan, 
a 
traditional 
investment 
loan, 
a 
Sector 
Wide 
Approach (SWAP) 
loan 
or 
the 
merging 
of 
the 
loan 
into 
a 
future 
larger administrative 
reform 
loan. 
50. 
A 
TA 
loan 
offers 
limited 
leverage 
and 
would 
have been 
be small 
(less 
than 
USD 
7 
million 
over 
3 
years 
or 
USD 
14 
million 
over 
five 
years.) 
A 
USD 
30 
million 
investment 
loan, 
split 
between the three 
participating ministries 
was 
not 
appealing 
to 
participating 
ministries, 
for 
which 
it 
creates 
heavy 
bureaucratic requirements 
without 
necessarily 
providing 
additional 
resources. 
As 
to 
SWAps, 
which 
have 
recently 
emerged 
as 
an 
attractive alternative 
to 
the 
traditional 
investment 
approach, they 
do 
remain 
investment 
projects, 
and 
are 
therefore 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
successful 
as 
instruments 
to 
promote 
the 
ongoing 
broader budget 
reform 
effort. 
In 
addition, 
while 
the 
CPAR 
shows 
Moroccan 
procurement 
procedures 
to 
be broadly 
acceptable, 
some 
non-trivial 
differences 
in 
practice 
would 
have 
needed 
to 
be 
adapted 
to Bank 
fiduciary 
requirements. 
51. 
Merging 
the 
AMRL 
into 
a 
larger, 
future  administrative 
reform 
loan would 
imply 
loosing 
the 
momentum 
generated 
by 
active 
dialogue  and preparation 
work 
funded 
through 
a 
PHRD 
grant. 
In 
addition, 
one 
objective 
of 
this 
carefully 
designed 
relatively small 
adjustment 
operation 
is 
to 
help move 
the 
public 
expenditure 
reform 
process 
during 
its 
initial 
critical 
stage. 
Nevertheless, once 
visibility 
and 
knowledge 
is 
gained, 
follow-up 
reforms 
could 
easily 
be 
merged 
in 
future 
larger 
adjustment 
operations.

Disbursement, 
Financial 
Management 
and 
Auditing 
52. 
Disbursement 
arrangements 
will 
follow 
the 
simplified 
procedures  approved 
on 
February 
1, 
1996. 
The 
Borrower would 
open 
a 
deposit  account 
in 
Euros 
in 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Morocco. 
Upon 
completion 
of 
first 
and 
second tranche conditions, 
the proceeds 
would 
be 
deposited 
in 
this 
account at the request 
of 
the borrower. 
If 
after 
deposit 
in 
this 
account, the proceeds 
of 
the 
Loan 
are 
used 
for 
ineligible 
purpose 
(i.e. 
to 
finance items 
imported 
from 
non-member 
countries or 
goods 
and 
services 
in 
the standard 
negative 
list), 
the 
Bank 
would 
require 
the 
Borrower 
either: 
(i) 
to return 
that amount 
to 
the account 
for 
use 
of 
eligible 
purposes; 
or 
(ii) 
to refund 
the 
amount 
directly 
to 
the 
Bank, 
in 
which 
case 
the 
Bank 
would 
cancel 
an 
equivalent 
undisbursed 
amount 
of 
the 
loan. 
An 
audit 
of 
the account 
may 
be required 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
should 
be 
conducted 
in 
accordance 
with 
acceptable 
auditing 
standards 
by 
independent 
auditors acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
and 
under 
terms 
of 
reference 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
said 
audit 
report 
should 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
within 
9 
months 
from 
the date 
of 
request. 
The closing 
date 
for 
the 
AMRL 
is

will 
promote 
expedited 
resolution 
for

disagreements 
for 
lands 
not 
yet 
in

by 
allowing 
for

Benefits 
and 
Risks 
55. 
Benefits 
- 
The 
benefits 
of 
the 
reform 
program 
are 
substantial. 
It 
supports 
improved 
social 
sector  performance, 
particularly 
in 
basic 
education  and 
health, 
which 
are 
services 
mostly 
used 
by 
the 
poor. 
It 
offers 
direct 
economic  benefits, 
including 
substantial savings 
from:

An 
improved land 
acquisition 
process 
that 
allows 
negotiation 
on 
the 
price 
and favors 
speedy 
and amicable 
resolution 
at 
a reduced cost 
for both 
private 
citizens 
and 
the 
State 
-- 
courts 
in 
recent 
years 
have 
typically 
penalized 
the 
State  and 
allowed 
for  land 
payments 
higher 
than 
the 
amount 
originally 
offered 
(66% 
on 
average, 
but 
often 
much 
more), 
or 
the 
amount required 
for 
settlement. 
56. 
The 
Loan 
will 
also 
help 
develop 
the 
local 
and small-scale 
construction 
industry 
by 
encouraging 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
maintenance and 
rehabilitation 
of 
public 
assets. 
Finally, 
it 
will 
support 
the 
ongoing 
process 
of 
deconcentration and 
strengthen 
asset 
management 
capacity 
at 
regional/local 
levels. 
57. 
Risks 
- 
A 
number 
of 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
operation have been 
identified 
during 
preparation. 
Mitigating 
factors 
or 
measures 
are 
in 
italics: 
o 
Macroeconomic 
stability 
not 
maintained. 
Success 
of 
this operation 
is 
not 
critically 
dependant on 
macro 
stability. 
o 
Adequate 
resources 
for 
the maintenance 
of 
public 
assets 
are 
not 
secured 
in 
the 
budget. 
Appropriate 
and 
suficient 
resources 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
public 
assets 
are 
a 
condition 
for 
loan 
disbursement. 
However, 
the risk 
to 
the 
Bank 
is 
minimum 
since the amounts 
are relatively 
small 
and 
most 
of 
loan 
disbursement 
would 
only 
take 
place 
when 
this condition 
is 
met. 
Commitment 
by 
line 
ministries 
to 
delegate 
and 
decentralize 
to  regional 
and/or 
local 
authorities 
is 
weak. 
Program 
implementation 
(which 
includes 
deconcentration 
to 
the 
local 
level) 
is 
a 
condition 
of 
second 
tranche 
disbursement. 
In 
addition, 
deconcentration was 
the 
focus 
of 
a 
recent 
Policy 
Letter 
from 
the 
King,  which 
has 
raised 
its 
visibility 
and 
made 
it 
a 
key 
objective 
of 
Morocco’s 
administration. 
Finally, 
continued 
commitment 
would 
be 
secured 
by 
maintaining 
policy 
dialogue throughout 
the 
operation 
and 
by 
organizing 
a 
series 
of 
in-country 
workshops 
on 
asset 
management 
and 
maintenance 
that 
bring 
together  representatives 
from 
central 
ministries, 
provincial 
and 
local 
authorities. 
Slow 
procurement 
and disbursement 
by 
the 
Moroccan 
administration 
holds 
back 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
program. 
This 
very 
real  risk 
is 
being 
mitigated 
by 
already 
earmarking 
resources 
in 
the 
current 
budget 
for 
the 
needed 
TA 
and 
studies 
and 
by 
allowing 
for 
an 
early

Subject: 
Letter 
of 
Sector 
Development 
Policy 
On 
Public 
Land 
and 
Real 
Assets 
Dear Sir, 
As 
you 
well 
know, 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
Morocco 
has 
experienced 
over 
the 
last 
40 
years 
a 
high 
level 
of 
activity 
in 
real 
assets 
acquisition 
and 
building 
to 
meet the 
socio-economic 
development 
needs 
of 
the 
country, 
particularly 
in 
the 
Health, Education, and 
Higher 
Education 
sectors, 
and 
to 
ensure 
accessibility 
to 
public 
services 
for 
the 
larger 
part 
of 
the 
population 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
their 
living 
conditions. 
The 
Government’s 
efforts 
in 
that regard, 
which 
are 
likely 
to 
intensify 
to 
support ongoing 
sector 
reforms, should 
be accompanied 
by 
improved 
public 
assets 
management 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
the 
sector 
development  objectives  and 
to 
ensure 
the 
sustainability 
of 
public 
assets, 
as 
well 
as 
optimize 
operations 
in 
this 
area. 
This 
will 
be done 
through 
renovated 
policies 
and strategies that 
will 
allow 
for 
a 
more 
integrated 
and coherent 
vision 
of 
both 
public 
land 
and 
public 
buildings. 
I 
- 
Characteristics 
of 
Public 
Assets 
Public 
Assets 
represent an 
important 
tool 
for 
urban development and 
public 
equipment, 
but 
they face 
major 
constraints: 
- 
decreasing 
public 
land 
reserves 
; 
- 
a 
mismatch 
between 
the 
potential 
supply 
of 
public 
land 
and 
identified 
needs, 
which 
occur 
mostly 
in 
densely 
populated 
urban 
areas; 
- 
heavy 
payment 
arrears 
stemming 
from 
purchases 
of 
private land 
and allocations 
of 
public land 
for 
public 
equipment: 
- 
an increase 
in 
real 
assets 
costs. 
In 
order 
to 
optimize 
the Government’s 
efforts 
to 
mobilize 
land for 
the 
provision 
of 
public 
equipment 
in 
urban 
areas, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
simplify 
the 
land 
acquisition 
procedures needed 
to 
streamline 
land 
management and 
to 
coordinate 
more 
efficiently 
between 
the 
various 
concerned 
agencies. 
Morocco’s 
buildings 
portfolio 
is 
characterized 
by 
its 
importance,  and 
functional 
and 
technical 
diversity. 
It 
is 
also 
widely 
spread 
out 
throughout 
the 
country 
and 
involves 
many 
different 
agencies 
in 
its 
management 
and 
operation. 
Page  26
22 
Preserving 
this 
portfolio 
will 
require 
strengthening 
its 
maintenance (preventive, 
routine 
and 
corrective) and 
rehabilitation to 
conform 
to 
safety 
standards 
and 
to 
adapt 
its 
use 
to 
improve 
working 
conditions 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
services. 
This 
is 
why 
maintenance 
activities 
should be 
at 
the center 
of 
all 
interventions 
on 
the 
buildings 
portfolio, 
and 
this 
as 
early 
as 
the 
planning 
and design 
phases, 
so 
that 
technical 
choices 
meet 
needs 
at the 
lowest 
possible 
cost. 
11- 
Government’s strategy 
for 
public 
asset 
management 
In 
the 
context 
of 
its 
policy 
of 
public 
management 
rationalization, 
the 
Moroccan 
Government 
wants 
to 
develop 
a 
strategy 
for public 
asset 
management that 
will 
have 
four main 
goals: 
- 
improving 
the 
legal 
and 
financial 
situation 
of 
the 
public 
buildings 
portfolio 
by 
registering 
buildings 
in 
the 
national 
land 
registry, 
paying 
off 
real 
property 
taxes 
or 
other 
bills 
that 
burden 
them, 
identifying 
situations 
of 
irregular 
occupation,  and 
straightening 
such situations; 
- 
paying-off  liabilities 
stemming 
from 
the 
real 
estate 
purchases 
of 
some 
ministerial 
departments 
through 
a 
simplified 
procedure 
allowing 
amicable 
resolution 
of 
disputes 
with 
private 
landowners; 
- 
improved 
land 
coverage 
through  urban 
management documents  that 
define  more 
appropriate 
standards 
for 
public 
buildings 
location 
and 
land 
use; 
- 
development 
of 
a 
public 
buildings 
information 
system 
to 
gain 
a 
better 
understanding 
of 
the 
portfolio, 
to 
improve 
its 
management, 
to 
provide 
network 
access 
to 
public 
buildings 
operators, and 
to 
design a 
public 
asset 
database. 
As 
regards 
to 
the 
public 
buildings 
portfolio, 
the 
Government 
is 
adopting 
a comprehensive 
vision 
based 
on 
a cross-sectoral strategy that 
focuses 
all 
stakeholders 
involved 
in 
public 
buildings 
construction  around 
the 
concept 
of 
“life 
cycle” 
to 
improve 
programming, 
design, 
construction, 
operation 
and maintenance 
of 
those 
buildings. 
The 
major 
portfolio 
management 
policies 
will 
be used 
to 
implement 
this 
strategy: 
- 
technical 
and 
budgetary 
programming 
policy 
using 
the 
concept 
of 
preventive 
maintenance. 
In 
this 
regard, a 
“total 
cost” approach 
will 
be 
developed 
to 
take 
into 
account, 
as 
early 
as 
at 
the  pre-investment 
stage, 
possible 
savings 
from 
future 
maintenance  and 
operating 
costs. 
This 
will 
be 
rooted 
in 
the general 
rationalization 
of 
public 
expenses 
implemented through 
new 
budget 
procedures 
developed 
during 
the 
ongoing public 
finance 
reform. 
- 
Rational 
decision 
making 
mechanisms 
to 
choose 
between 
construction,  purchase 
or 
renting. 
New 
and 
innovative 
ways 
to 
streamline the use 
of 
public 
assets 
will 
need 
to 
be 
developed; 
Page  27
23 
- 
The 
promotion 
of 
local 
maintenance  contractors, 
to 
ensure 
that 
public 
assets 
management responds 
to required 
conditions 
of 
professionalism, 
rigor 
and 
efficiency; 
- 
Public 
awareness 
policy 
to 
inform 
users 
about 
optimal 
uses 
and 
care 
of 
public 
goods. 
Public 
awareness 
campaigns and 
trainings 
will 
be 
designed 
for public 
service 
users, 
civil 
servants 
and 
all 
citizens 
to 
promote 
the 
notion 
of 
good 
use 
of 
public 
assets. 
The 
success 
of 
this 
streamlined 
public 
asset 
management 
will 
require 
setting 
up 
of 
an 
appropriate and 
up 
to 
date 
regulatory, organizational 
and 
budgetary framework. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
Government 
will 
introduce 
reforms 
to 
reach 
the 
following 
objectives: 
- 
revision 
of 
procedures 
for 
land 
purchases 
by 
mutual 
agreement 
or 
by 
expropriation, 
and 
revision 
of 
management procedures 
with 
the 
view 
of 
reaching  a  regulatory 
framework 
that 
gathers 
all 
laws 
and 
rules 
governing 
public 
asset 
management; 
- 
deconcentration 
of 
public 
asset 
management; 
- 
improved 
planning 
for 
land 
purchase 
and 
public 
equipment 
activities 
to 
avoid 
reconstitution 
of 
liability; 
- 
setting 
up 
of 
incentives 
for 
public 
administration 
to 
make better 
use 
of 
buildings 
or 
to 
return land 
that 
is 
unused 
or 
under-utilized; 
- 
search 
for 
best practices 
in 
budget 
resource 
allocation 
to 
ensure 
the balance between 
maintenance and 
rehabilitation on 
the one 
hand, 
and 
new 
construction 
on 
the 
other 
hand; 
reform 
of 
current 
programming 
methods and practices 
to 
focus the actions 
of 
the 
administration 
on 
maintenance and 
rehabilitation 
of 
existing 
public 
buildings. 
I11 
- 
Sector Policies 
Although 
efforts 
have been made 
over the last 
few 
years 
to 
rehabilitate 
and 
maintain 
the 
public 
buildings 
portfolio, 
these 
efforts 
will 
have 
to be 
strengthened 
by 
routine 
and 
preventive 
maintenance 
in 
order 
to 
preserve the 
portfolio, 
reduce 
its 
operating 
cost 
and 
optimize 
its 
use. 
Greater 
attention 
will 
have 
to 
be 
given 
to 
the development 
and 
implementation 
of 
public 
asset 
management strategic 
plans 
as 
means 
of 
support 
to 
general sector objectives. 
These strategic 
plans 
will 
be 
based 
on: 
- 
a 
thorough knowledge 
of 
the 
portfolio 
(characteristics, 
usage, 
status)  based 
on 
a 
nomenclature 
of 
building 
conditions 
subject 
to 
regular 
updates 
after 
each 
maintenance 
or 
rehabilitation 
work; 
- 
a 
regular 
follow-up 
of 
the 
portfolio to 
know 
how 
it 
is 
used and 
establish a diagnostic 
to 
define, 
in 
an  exhaustive  manner,  the 
list 
of 
routine 
maintenance 
tasks, 
their 
frequency,  the 
necessary 
maintenance 
to 
be 
performed,  and 
finally, 
the decision 
to 
rehabilitate 
when routine 
maintenance 
is 
insufficient;

- 
a 
program 
of 
routine 
maintenance and 
partial 
rehabilitation 
operations 
as 
well 
as 
the 
definition 
of 
a 
program 
of 
priority 
rehabilitation 
and 
related implementation 
plan. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
you  for 
the 
assistance 
you 
are 
providing 
us 
in 
implementing 
this 
important 
program.

CURRENT 
ISSUES 
AND 
REFORMS 
PROPOSED 
MANAGEMENT 
OF 
THE 
PRIVATE 
DOMAIN 
IN 
MOROCCO 
- 
At 
the  request 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
a 
PHRD-funded 
study 
was 
undertaken 
on 
the 
private 
domain 
of 
the 
state. 
The 
study 
was 
managed 
by 
a  Committee, 
piloted 
by 
the 
Direction 
des 
Domaines, 
and 
including 
representatives 
from 
the  directions 
in 
charge 
of 
urbanization, 
territorial 
administration, 
Conservation 
Foncibre 
(in 
charge 
of 
the 
Cadastre) 
as 
well 
as 
from 
the 
Budget 
and 
the 
Ministbre 
des 
Affaires  Gbnbrales du 
Gouvernement. 
A 
broader 
consultative committee includes 
representative 
from 
consumer 
ministries 
(Education, 
Tourism, 
etc.) 
The 
study 
has 
allowed for 
an 
extensive 
assessment 
of 
the 
problems 
of 
the 
private 
domain 
of 
the 
State. 
Its 
conclusions 
and 
policy 
recommendations were presented 
in 
a 
seminar, 
presided 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance, 
including 
all 
government stakeholders 
and 
opened 
to 
the 
press 
on 
March 
28, 
which 
generated 
wide 
and 
extremely 
positive 
press  coverage. 
The 
general 
management 
of 
the 
private domain 
has 
been 
heavily criticized 
in 
the 
press 
in 
the 
past, 
because 
of 
the 
opacity 
of 
the 
administration  and 
the 
sense 
of 
arbitrariness  associated 
with 
land 
acquisition 
procedures. 
The 
seminar 
was 
hailed 
as 
constituting 
a 
first 
in 
an 
opening 
of 
the 
Direction 
des 
domaines and 
permitting 
an 
open 
discussion 
of 
issues 
of 
land 
administration. 
The 
study 
and the dialogue 
initiated 
in 
December 
1999 
have 
shown 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
issues. 
Establishing 
a complete 
National 
Asset 
Management 
Strategy 
will 
take 
many 
years. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
has 
also 
helped 
debunk 
many 
myths 
(such 
as 
the need 
to 
provide 
free 
land 
to 
attract  investors.) 
Most 
importantly, 
the 
study 
and 
the 
policy 
dialogue 
it 
generated 
has 
generated 
broad 
consensus 
around 
the 
fact  that 
a 
number 
of 
immediate 
improvements 
could 
be 
brought to current 
rules 
and 
practices, 
that 
have 
substantial immediate benefits. 
Thus, 
the strategy 
followed 
for 
the 
present 
operation 
is 
to 
pursue 
"technical" 
reforms 
that 
are 
attainable 
in 
the 
short 
run 
and have 
important 
identified 
benefits, 
notably 
in 
terms 
of 
reducing 
arbitrary 
decisions and 
protecting private 
property. 
THE 
PRIVATE 
DOMAIN: 
SUMMARY 
DIAGNOSIS 
4. 
The "private domain" 
of 
the 
Government includes 
622,000 
ha 
and 
about 
36,000 
buildings.' 
The 
vast 
majority 
(78%) 
is 
in 
rural 
or 
periurban 
areas. 
The 
higher 
value 
buildings 
in 
urban 
areas 
are 
to 
a 
large 
extent allocated 
to 
public 
administration. 
It 
is 
generally 
poorly 
identified, 
managed 
by 
many 
different 
agencies, 
may 
be 
under-utilized 
but 
cannot 
satisfy 
demand, 
and 
is 
governed 
by 
cumbersome and 
costly 
rules 
and 
regulations. 
A 
poorly 
identified 
land 
and real 
estate 
portfolio 
.... 
5. 
There 
is 
limited 
information 
on 
public 
property, 
its 
current 
or 
potential 
use, 
or 
the 
managingkontrolling 
entity. 
The 
Direction 
des 
domaines 
has 
a 
database 
that 
includes 
all 
36,000 
buildings 
but 
it 
suffers 
from 
some 
limitation: 
This 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
lands and 
buildings 
belonging 
to 
the 
State 
but which 
the 
state 
can sell 
or 
otherwise 
transfer 
to 
other owners. 
It 
does 
not 
include 
the 
"public 
domain" 
of 
the 
State 
(land 
used 
for 
public 
goods 
such 
as 
roads 
or 
other 
large infrastructure 
projects) 
or 
the 
assets 
of 
religious 
and 
ethnic 
communities 
or 
local 
governments. 
Page  30
26 
It 
does 
not 
include 
geographic 
or 
topographic  data 
- 
including 
this 
information 
should 
not 
be 
too 
difficult 
however, 
since 
91% 
of 
the 
land 
is 
either 
already 
immatriculated 
with 
the 
Direction 
de 
la 
Conservation 
Foncidre, 
the  service  that  administers 
the  national 
cadastre, 
or 
the 
process 
is 
under 
way 
so 
a basic 
plan 
exist. 
Information 
on 
the 
current 
use 
is 
often 
not 
up 
to 
date, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
systematic 
way 
of 
verifying 
whether the 
current 
use 
is 
that 
for which 
the 
land or 
building 
was 
originally 
granted. 
There 
is 
presently 
no 
systematic 
means 
of 
identifying 
vacant 
or 
underutilized 
land 
. 
A 
number 
of 
ministries (Army, 
Justice) have undertaken an exhaustive 
inventory 
of 
the 
land 
and 
buildings 
under 
their 
control. 
The 
Ministries 
of 
Education 
and 
Health 
have embarked 
upon 
similar 
exercises.

The 
private 
domain 
of 
the 
state 
includes: 
. 
land 
and housing allocated 
to 
the 
administration, and 
managed 
by 
the 
ministries 
to which 
they 
are affected; 
land 
managed 
by 
public 
entities 
who 
are 
responsible 
for 
their 
development 
and 
possible 
sale 
(SODEA,  SOGETA, 
SNDE 
for 
agricultural 
land, 
ANHI 
for 
social 
housing, 
SNEC 
and 
ERAC 
for 
urban 
and 
regional 
development); 
urban 
and 
peri-urban 
vacant  and 
unallocated 
land,  managed 
by 
the 
Direction 
des 
Domaines; 
and 
land 
and 
buildings 
allocated 
or 
rented 
out 
to 
private 
users, 
but 
which 
the 
State 
can 
eventually 
choose 
to 
retrieve. 
. 
. 
The 
Direction 
des 
domaines 
acts 
as 
the Government's 
real 
estate 
agent. 
Its 
responsibilities 
include 
acquiring 
land, 
based 
on 
demands 
by 
line 
ministries, 
allocating 
properties 
across 
alternative 
users, 
managing 
contested 
land 
acquisitions, 
and disposing 
of 
surplus 
assets. 
It 
has 
no 
managerial 
responsibility 
for 
land or 
buildings 
that 
have been allocated 
to 
ministries 
or 
public 
agencies, 
although 
ownership 
of 
these 
allocated 
assets 
remain 
with 
the State (rather 
than 
with 
the 
managing entity). 
The 
Direction 
des 
Domaines 
is 
also the 
financial 
manager 
of 
the 
private 
domain. 
When 
an 
administration 
plans 
to 
acquire 
land 
or 
asks 
for 
the 
use 
of 
a 
publicly 
owned 
building, 
it 
needs 
to 
include 
in 
its 
budget 
the amount needed 
for 
the operation. 
This 
sum 
is 
then affected 
to 
a 
special 
treasury 
account, 
the 
Fond 
de 
Remploi 
Domanial 
(FRD), 
managed 
by 
the 
Direction 
des 
Domaines, 
in 
exchange 
for 
either 
the 
purchase 
or 
the 
allocation 
of 
a 
property. 
... 
that 
is 
under-utilized 
but cannot 
satisfy demand 
9. 
Although 
no 
systematic  analysis 
of 
the 
issue exists, 
received 
wisdom 
is 
that  the 
private 
domain 
of 
the 
State 
is 
under-utilized. 
Anecdotal 
evidence  abounds 
on 
land 
acquired 
by 
various 
public 
agencies 
for 
development 
projects 
that were never funded, 
resulting 
in 
the 
land 
lying

after the

was

A

that 
only 
13%

had 
been

nor 
can 
the 
Domaines retrieve 
land 
or 
buildings 
allocated 
to 
line 
ministries 
and 
public 
agencies. 
At 
the 
same 
time, there 
is 
a 
poor match 
between demand and 
supply. 
In 
2000, 
about 
83% 
of 
expenditures 
of 
the 
Fond 
de 
Remploi 
Domanial 
were 
for 
new 
acquisitions, and 
only 
17% 
for 
the 
re-allocation 
of 
public 
property. 
A 
number 
of 
development 
projects 
have 
been 
postponed 
due 
to 
the 
impossibility 
of 
accessing 
land. 
The 
Direction 
des 
investissements 
exte'rieurs, 
which 
helps 
foreign 
investors 
set 
up 
operations 
in 
Morocco,  reports 
great 
difficulties 
in 
identifying 
suitable 
land. 
Many 
administrations 
are 
lodging 
their offices 
in 
rented 
apartment 
buildings 
-- 
a practice 
that 
may 
not 
be 
cost-effective. 
... 
that relies 
on 
cumbersome 
and 
costly rules 
and 
regulations 
11. 
12. 
Rules 
and 
regulations 
covering 
land 
acquisitions 
are 
cumbersome  and 
slow. 
Public 
acquisition 
processes 
do 
not allow 
for 
a hearing 
of 
the owner, 
let 
alone 
negotiations. 
Prices 
are 
decided 
by 
a 
commission, 
and 
no 
framework 
exists 
for 
appropriate 
compensation. 
If 
the 
owner 
refuses 
the 
price 
offered 
or 
there 
are 
other 
difficulties 
(about 
a 
third 
of 
the 
cases), 
the 
dossier 
enters 
an 
administrative 
phase 
of 
expropriation, 
and 
then a 
legal 
phase. 
A 
judge 
then 
sets 
the  price;  there 
is 
no 
possibility 
for 
the 
administration 
to 
refuse 
the  land, 
once 
the 
indemnity 
is 
set, 
nor 
is 
there 
a 
framework 
for 
judges 
to 
establish 
indemnities 
for 
land 
already 
occupied 
illegally 
by 
the 
administration. 
A 
review 
of 
recent 
cases 
shows that 
judges 
set 
indemnities 
on 
average 
190% 
above 
the 
originally 
offered 
price 
(median 
of 
67%), 
reaching 
1000% 
in 
prime 
urban 
locations. 
As 
a result 
of 
these 
heavy procedures 
(but 
also 
because 
of 
poor 
planning 
and 
as 
a 
way 
of 
circumventing 
resource 
limitations), 
a  number 
of 
ministries, 
such 
as 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
build 
on 
land 
that 
has 
not 
yet 
been purchased 
or 
even budgeted 
for. 
The 
number 
of 
pending 
land 
acquisitions 
is 
large, 
representing 
an estimated 
value 
of 
about 
DH 
3 
billion, 
of 
which 
DH 
2.1 
billion 
are 
attributable 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, equivalent 
to 
USD 
183 
million. 
If 
one 
includes 
the 
probable 
indemnities 
that 
may 
be 
set 
by 
the courts, the 
real 
cost 
will 
probably be 
closer 
to 
USD

Based 
on 
past experience 
of

shows 
that 
in 
about 
73% 
of 
cases, 
the

are 
resolved 
without 
needing 
to 
go

Of 
the 
cases 
that 
go 
to

about 
58% 
go 
because 
of 
disagreement 
over 
the

In 
such

are 
on

To 
place 
these 
pending acquisition 
in 
perspective, the 
Direction 
des 
Domaines 
managed 
to 
process 
about 
DH 
115 
million 
in 
2001, 
most 
of 
which 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education. 
At 
this 
speed, 
it 
will 
take 
more 
than a 
decade 
to 
clear the 
backlog. 
REFORMS 
PURSUED 
14. 
The 
reforms 
pursued 
have three 
broad 
objectives: 
(i) 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
backlog 
of 
pending 
dossiers 
in 
a 
manner  that 
reduces 
its 
cost 
to  both 
private 
citizens  and 
the 
state, 
(ii) 
mechanisms 
to 
avoid 
the 
reconstitution 
of 
this 
backlog,  and 
(iii) 
means 
to 
promote a more 
cost 
effective 
use 
of 
the 
private 
domain. 
Resolution 
of 
the 
backlog. 
15. 
An 
analysis 
of 
the 
backlog 
for 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
shows 
it 
comprises three category: 
Land 
for which 
a technical 
dossier 
has 
not 
yet 
been established:  869 
dossiers, 
DH 
1.2 
billion 
(estimated value) 
Land 
for 
which 
the dossier 
has 
been 
established 
but 
the attempts 
at 
amiable acquisition 
have 
not 
yet 
been concluded: 548 
dossiers, 
DH 
677 
million 
(estimated value) 
Land 
under 
expropriation 
proceedings 
(58% 
because 
of 
price 
refusal 
by 
owners):  290 
dossiers, 
DH 
273 
million 
(estimated 
value.) 
Concerning 
the 
first 
category, 
the 
Direction 
des 
Domaines 
proposes 
to 
take 
on 
the 
constitution 
of 
these 
dossiers, 
which 
are 
normally 
the 
responsibility 
of 
expropriating 
ministries,  and 
estimates 
it 
could 
process 
them 
over a 
period 
of 
approximately 
18 
months. 
All 
that 
will 
be required 
is 
the issuance 
of 
a 
joint 
circular 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(to 
which 
the 
Direction 
de 
Domaines 
belongs.) 
The 
cost 
will 
be 
approximately 
DH 
3 
million, which 
can be 
funded 
through 
the 
Fond 
de 
Remploi 
Domanial. 
16. 
Concerning 
dossiers 
with 
a 
price 
disagreement, 
procedures 
will 
be 
revised 
to 
allow 
the 
evaluation  commissions 
to 
hear  owners  and 
be  guided 
by 
the 
report 
of 
a  technical 
~ommittee.~ 
This 
proposal, 
which 
emerges 
from 
the 
PHRD-funded 
study 
and 
consultation, 
should 
reduce the 
perception 
of 
arbitrariness 
in 
the 
public land 
acquisition 
process. 
It 
should 
also 
help 
reduce the 
proportion 
of 
dossiers 
that 
end 
in 
expropriation 
procedures and 
speed 
up 
resolution 
of 
the 
267 affairs (accounting 
for 
USD 
29 
million), 
which 
are being, 
or 
are 
about 
to 
be, 
contested 
because 
of 
price 
issues. 
Finally, 
it 
should 
allow 
for 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
indemnities, and 
most 
importantly 
in 
the 
cost 
to 
the 
private 
citizens, 
who 
will 
benefit 
from 
speedy 
resolution. 
17. 
It 
should 
be clear  that  the 
proposed 
revision 
to 
current 
procedures 
will 
only 
offer 
a new 
opportunity 
for 
owners 
to 
be heard. 
It 
will 
in 
no 
way 
affect their 
ability to 
obtain legal 
recourse. 
Nor 
will 
it 
affect 
cases 
where 
there 
is 
a dispute 
over 
ownership, 
or 
affect 
third 
party 
interests,  since  owners 
or 
interested  parties 
would 
still 
have 
all 
the 
rights 
and 
practical 
recourses 
that 
current 
legislation 
offer. 
18. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
has 
also 
agreed 
to 
accelerate 
payment 
of 
cases 
for which 
a 
price 
has 
been agreed upon. 
The 
practice 
of 
allocating undisbursed 
funds 
at 
the end 
of 
the 
fiscal 
year 
will 
be 
accelerated, 
so 
that 
a 
total 
of 
MAD 
430 
million 
is 
disbursed 
over 
2002-2003. 
Currently 
a large commission,  composed 
of 
representative 
of 
deconcentrated 
agencies, 
has 
authority 
to 
both 
chose 
the 
land to 
be 
expropriated 
and 
fix 
the 
price 
to 
offer 
the owner. 
If 
the owner 
refuses, 
the 
dossier 
enters 
the 
administrative 
phase 
of 
expropriation, 
and 
once 
various 
steps 
are taken, 
the 
legal 
phase 
in 
the 
courts. 
There 
is 
no provision for 
hearing 
the 
owner 
or 
discussing the 
price

Mechanisms 
to 
avoid 
a reconstitution 
of 
the 
backlog 
19. 
The 
Working 
Group on 
the 
Budget 
Reforms, 
which 
is 
at 
the center 
of 
the 
ongoing 
public 
expenditure 
review, 
was 
asked 
to 
propose a 
mechanism 
to 
prevent 
the 
reconstitution 
of 
the 
backlog 
and 
to 
look 
at 
incentives 
to 
encourage 
ministries 
not 
to 
hoard 
under-used 
land 
and 
buildings. 
Its 
suggestion 
is 
for 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
to 
issued 
a 
circulaire 
that 
allows 
Ministries 
to 
obtain 
a 
credit 
within 
the 
Fond 
de 
Remploi 
Domanial 
for 
the proceeds 
of 
ceded 
land 
and 
buildings, 
and 
to 
re-deploy 
the 
equivalent 
amount 
in 
resources 
otherwise allocated 
to 
them 
for 
building 
acquisition, 
towards 
buildings 
rehabilitation 
or 
maintenance. 
to 
include 
a 
clause, 
in 
the 
circulaire 
written 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
finance 
that 
instructs 
ministries 
on 
preparing 
for 
the annual 
budget 
law, 
that 
requires 
ministries 
to 
budget 
for 
land 
acquisition 
when 
budgeting 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
buildings. 
20. 
In 
addition, 
there 
are 
several texts 
circulating 
to 
revise 
the 
expropriation 
law 
(one 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Urbanization 
and one 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Equipment.) 
The 
final 
PHRD 
study 
report 
is 
making 
concrete 
recommendation concerning 
these. 
The 
Government 
has 
agreed 
to 
create a 
commission to 
review 
the 
various 
drafts 
with 
the 
view 
of 
accelerating 
adoption 
of 
a 
revised 
text 
that protects 
private 
interests 
while 
reducing 
transaction 
costs. 
More 
efJicient instruments 
for 
the 
management 
of 
public 
land 
and buildings 
21. 
As 
mentioned 
earlier 
the 
private  domain 
is 
ruled 
by 
a 
complex,  antiquated 
and 
often 
contradictory 
set 
of 
rules 
and 
regulations. 
It 
is 
therefore proposed 
to 
constitute 
a code 
domanial, 
which would 
group 
all 
texts 
related 
to 
the domain, 
would 
streamline 
them 
and 
include 
revised 
and 
simplified 
procedures. 
22. 
In 
addition, 
there 
is 
a pressing 
need 
to 
improve information 
on 
the consistency 
of 
the domain, 
its 
current 
use 
and 
location. 
As 
mentioned 
earlier, 
this 
information 
is 
dispersed 
across 
ministries 
-the 
Direction 
des 
domaines 
has 
incomplete 
information 
on 
all 
assets, 
while 
others 
may 
have 
more 
complete 
information 
on 
parts 
of 
the 
Domaines. 
The 
proposal then 
is 
to 
create a 
platform for 
sharing the 
databases 
and 
having 
more 
complete 
information 
on 
use 
and 
location, 
using 
GIS 
technology. 
TORS 
will 
be  completed, 
resources 
identified 
and 
procurement  under 
way 
before 
negotiations. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the  design 
of 
the 
system 
should 
be 
finalized 
in 
2004, 
and 
ready 
for 
full 
deployment 
thereafter. 
BUDGETARY 
IMPLICATIONS 
OF 
THE 
REFORMS 
23. 
Most 
of 
the cost 
will 
be 
attributable 
to 
the 
backlog 
of 
lands 
already 
occupied 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
- 
an 
additional 
DH 
300 
million 
over 
2002-2003. 
TA 
for 
establishing 
the 
Rbglement 
des 
procedures domaniales 
should 
cost about 
MAD 
2 
million 
(USD 
170,000) 
and 
for 
the 
information 
system about 
MAD 
3.5 
million 
(USD 
300,000). 
24. 
The 
benefits 
of 
the 
reform 
will 
be 
substantial 
although 
they are 
difficult 
to 
estimate precisely. 
First, 
there 
will 
be 
substantial 
benefits 
for 
civil 
society 
as 
the 
reforms  promote 
better 
protection 
of 
private 
property 
and  reduce  the 
transaction 
costs 
associated 
with 
land 
acquisition.  There should 
also 
be 
important 
savings 
for 
the 
state 
from 
reduced reliance 
on 
the 
court 
system and 
from 
reduced 
land 
and 
buildings 
consumption 
by 
line 
ministries.

supports  the  design  and 
implementation 
of 
systems 
to 
budget,  plan,  and 
manage maintenance and 
rehabilitation 
of 
buildings. 
The 
objective 
is 
a 
reform 
of 
asset 
management, 
rather 
than 
specific 
investments 
or 
a  one  shot 
upgrading 
operation. 
Implementation 
mechanisms 
will 
also 
seek 
to 
build 
upon 
the 
deconcentration 
process 
currently  taking 
place 
in 
the 
three 
ministries, 
and  represent  a 
step 
forward 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
ongoing 
budgetary reforms.

CONTEXT 
OF 
BUDGETARY 
AND 
INSTITUTIONAL 
REFORMS 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
The 
three 
ministries 
are 
undertaking 
ambitious 
deconcentration 
programs. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Health, most responsibilities 
have been delegated 
to 
16 
regions. 
'In 
the 
case 
of 
Education 
and 
Higher 
Education, 
AcadLmies 
and 
Universities 
will 
have the 
status 
of 
Etablissements 
Publics, 
with 
even 
more 
autonomy 
as 
well 
as 
the 
eventual ownership 
of 
the 
assets 
currently 
in 
their 
custody. 
The 
budgetary reforms 
under 
way 
and supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
the 
context 
of 
an 
ongoing 
public 
expenditure 
review 
aim 
to 
globalize 
resources 
(rather 
than 
line 
itemize 
them) 
in 
exchange 
for 
set 
performance obligations. 
These 
obligations 
will 
be 
defined 
in 
a contract 
signed 
between 
the 
parent 
ministry 
and the 
individual 
region, 
academy, 
or 
university. 
This 
new institutional 
and budgetary 
framework 
makes 
buildings 
management 
reform 
more 
urgent. 
It 
is 
extremely 
important 
in 
a system 
of 
globalized credit 
to 
specify 
obligations 
in 
terms 
of 
the maintenance 
of 
assets. 
Otherwise, the 
incentives 
are 
to 
let 
the 
asset 
depreciate 
while 
using 
available 
resources 
for 
improved 
service 
delivery 
within 
a 
short 
time 
frame 
(the 
impact 
of 
deferred 
maintenance 
is 
only 
felt 
after 
a time.) 
The 
new framework 
also 
provides 
an 
opportunity 
to 
implement 
the 
buildings 
management 
system 
intelligently 
and 
integrate 
it 
into 
the  discussion 
of 
the 
budgetary 
allocation 
and 
contracts 
of 
the regions, 
acadLmies 
and 
university.

the 
model 
developed 
by 
the 
MOF 
has 
been

Morocco. 
The  new  framework 
allows 
for 
performance

INTRODUCING SIMPLE 
AND 
INNOVATIVE, 
BUILDING 
MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEMS 
7. 
The 
buildings 
management 
systems 
have been designed 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Finance, 
Health, 
Education 
and 
Higher 
Education 
and 
tailored 
to 
the 
needs 
and 
specificities 
of 
each 
ministry. 
The 
work 
was 
undertaken 
by 
consultants 
funded 
through 
a 
PHRD 
grant, 
in 
consultation 
with 
both 
central 
agencies 
and 
representatives 
of 
regions/academies/universities. 
8. 
Draft 
systems 
were presented 
for 
validation 
at 
a 
national consultation 
February 
18 
and 
19 
that 
included 
140 
participants, 
mostly 
from 
the 
regional  level. 
Workshops 
allowed to 
consult 
on 
specific 
issues 
and 
resulted 
in 
a 
number 
of 
concrete 
recommendations 
to 
fine-tune 
the 
systems 
and 
identify 
the 
measures 
and 
technical 
assistance 
needed 
to 
accompany 
the 
reform. 
Overall 
the reactions were 
extremely 
positive: 
the general 
position 
is 
that 
buildings 
management 
systems 
are sorely 
lacking. 
In 
addition, 
the 
proposed 
systems 
were 
thought 
to 
be simple 
and 
user-friendly 
tools 
for 
the 
rationalization 
of 
expenditure. 
A 
quick 
overview 
is 
presented 
in 
Box 
1 
below. 
ROLLING 
OUT 
THE 
PROPOSED 
REFORM 
9. 
The 
calendar 
developed 
with 
Moroccan 
counterparts 
would roll-out 
the 
full 
reform 
in 
the 
three 
ministries over 12 
years: 
five 
years 
to gradually deploy 
buildings 
management 
systems 
in 
all 
the regions, 
academies 
and 
universities 
(table 
l), 
and 
an 
additional 
seven 
years 
to 
complete 
the 
rehabilitation 
program 
and 
gradually 
increase maintenance 
budget 
from 
the 
minimum 
amount  (equivalent 
to 
1% 
of 
construction 
cost) 
to 
a 
more 
desirable one 
(3% 
of 
construction 
cost.)5

It 
is 
neither 
desirable 
nor 
feasible 
to 
extend the maintenance 
and 
rehabilitation 
management 
systems 
to 
the 
whole country 
at once. 
This 
would 
require an 
important 
and 
brutal 
increase 
in 
the 
ministries’ 
real 
asset 
budgets, 
but 
most 
importantly 
because 
the 
systems 
will 
need 
to 
be 
adapted and 
fine-tuned 
and 
capacity 
will 
have 
to 
be 
built. 
The 
proposal 
is 
to 
spread 
out 
rehabilitation 
works 
over 
8 
years, 
starting 
from 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
integration 
of 
a 
region 
into 
the 
program. 
The 
total 
number 
of 
years 
to 
bring 
the 
rehabilitation program 
to 
completion 
would 
therefore 
be 
12 
years, 
as 
the last group 
of 
regions 
would 
start 
their 
rehabilitation 
program 
at 
year

Morocco’s 
Maintenance 
Management 
System 
The 
maintenance management system designed 
for 
Morocco’s 
educational 
and medical facilities 
aims 
to 
optimize 
the economic 
lifetime 
of 
real property 
assets, 
while 
respecting 
existing 
norms, 
legislation, 
and 
functional 
needs. 
The 
underlying methodology 
was 
developed 
in 
North 
America 
and 
in 
some 
European 
countries, 
particularly 
in 
universities 
and 
colleges 
that 
had 
been 
faced 
with 
costly 
rehabilitations 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
funding 
for 
maintenance  and/or  a 
lack 
of 
a systematic  approach 
to 
the maintenance 
of 
built 
assets. 
Maintenance 
here 
is 
defined, 
following 
the 
European 
Standard, 
as 
“the 
combination 
of 
technical, 
administrative and 
managerial 
actions 
over 
the 
life 
cycle 
of 
an 
item 
(Le. 
asset) 
intended 
to retain 
it 
in, 
restore 
it 
to, 
a 
state 
in 
which 
it 
can 
perform 
a 
required 
function”. 
The 
system 
encompasses 
four 
major 
components 
: 
A. 
A 
framework 
of 
maintenance  standards 
for 
each 
building 
element 
(using 
the

including 
: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
the 
maintenance 
objective 
(s) 
for 
each 
element, 
the maintenance 
tasks 
required 
to maintain 
the element, 
the nature 
of 
degradations 
to be 
expected, 
and 
the 
time 
required 
performing 
the 
maintenance tasks.

In 
terms

its 
objective

the 
Ministries 
of  Health, 
Education

have 
fully

systems 
that 
meet 
with 
the agreement 
of 
the 
MOF 
in 
terms 
of 
budgeting 
and

by 
objective, 
and are 
well 
in 
line 
with 
their 
deconcentration

THE 
COST 
OF 
THE 
REFORM 
12. 
This 
includes 
(i) 
the cost of 
accompanying 
measures 
(training, 
information 
technology, 
etc.), 
(ii) 
the cost 
of 
the maintenance program, 
as 
well 
as 
(iii) 
the cost 
of 
identified 
rehabilitation. 
(i) 
Accompanying 
measures 
include: 
. 
the 
sensitization 
of 
users 
and 
decision 
makers 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
maintenance 
(this 
includes 
a one day  seminar 
for 
school principals, 
and 
directors 
of 
primary 
health 
centers 
to 
sensitize 
them 
to 
their new 
role 
in

(ii) 
Maintenance Program 
14. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Morocco, 
the  suggestion,  based 
on 
well 
accepted 
models 
of 
buildings 
depreciation, 
is 
to 
start 
with 
an 
allocation 
of 
about 
1%, 
to 
be 
increased 
gradually 
to 
reach 
the 
equilibrium level 
of 
3% 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
12 
years 
of 
the 
reform. 
This 
is 
reasonable 
given 
that a 
key problem 
is 
often 
the 
inability 
of 
ministries to 
spend, 
let 
alone spend 
well. 
Further, 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
the 
system and a 
proposed accompanying 
technical audit 
structure 
will 
need 
some 
time 
to 
be 
fully 
functional. 
It 
is 
better then 
to 
increase the 
flow 
of 
resources 
gradually. 
Page  38

15. 
The 
cost 
of 
a 
1% 
allocation 
over the 
full 
portfolio 
of 
the three 
ministries 
is 
USD32 
million. 
This 
amount 
would 
be 
required 
by 
the 
fifth 
year. 
It 
would 
then 
be gradually 
increased 
to 
a 
more 
desirable 
3% 
in 
the 
12'h 
year, 
reaching 
USD 
95 
million 
(table 
2, 
see 
Annex 
table 
A2 
for 
details 
of 
the maintenance program.) 
(iii) 
Rehabilitation 
16. 
The validation 
of 
the 
methodology 
and 
costs 
for 
rehabilitation 
was 
done 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
sample 
of 
30 
buildings 
spread 
across 
the 
three 
ministries. 
This 
information, 
along 
with 
the 
results 
of 
other 
studies, 
provided  information 
that 
allows 
to 
determine 
the 
order 
of 
magnitude 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
needs. 
17. 
The 
first 
step 
in 
introducing 
the 
buildings 
management 
systems 
will 
be 
a 
buildings 
condition 
assessment, 
which 
will 
help 
establish 
a 
maintenance 
and 
rehabilitation 
program. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
working 
hypothesis 
is 
that 
30% 
of 
buildings 
require  rehabilitation 
amounting 
to 
an 
average 
of 
20% 
of 
replacement cost 
- 
implying 
that 
rehabilitation 
costs 
would 
represent 
6% 
of 
the 
replacement 
costs 
of 
the 
portfolio. 
Other 
estimates 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
suggests 
that 
rehabilitation 
needs 
may be 
much 
higher, 
at 
20% 
of 
the 
replacement  cost 
of 
the 
portfolio. 
Two 
points 
should 
be noted 
however: 
first, 
that 
the 
Ministry 
of 
health 
estimates 
includes 
rehabilitating 
buildings 
that 
are 
in 
a 
shape 
such that 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to 
demolish 
them; 
second, 
that 
these 
estimates 
include 
complete 
rehabilitations. 
The 
methodology  allows 
to 
establish 
priorities 
and 
follows 
a 
partial 
rehabilitation 
approach 
- 
a 
more 
realistic 
approach 
when 
resources 
are 
limited. 
18. 
The proposal 
is 
to 
let 
each 
regionlncude'mieluniversity 
spread 
its 
rehabilitation 
program 
over 
8 
years. 
The 
total 
cost 
would 
be 
about 
USD 
191 
million 
spread 
over 
12 
years, 
since 
program 
beginning 
would 
be 
staggered 
across 
regions 
over 
the 
first

years 
(table 
A5.2, 
see 
table 
A5.6 
for 
details 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
program.) 
19. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
emphasize that 
rehabilitation 
is 
not 
the objective 
of 
the 
reform. 
Instead 
the 
objective 
of 
the 
reform 
is 
to 
eliminate 
the need 
for 
rehabilitation 
springing 
from 
deferred 
maintenance. 
Nevertheless,  experience 
from 
the 
road 
sector  where 
similar 
reforms 
have 
been 
implemented 
in 
a number 
of 
countries,  shows 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
bring 
the 
overall 
portfolio 
to 
a 
level 
where 
it 
is 
in 
good 
enough 
condition 
to 
integrated 
it 
into 
maintenance 
programs. 
Only 
then 
can the 
virtuous circle 
of 
good 
building 
management 
be 
reached. 
BUDGETARY 
IMPLICATIONS 
OF 
THE 
REFORM 
20. 
The 
total 
cost 
of 
the 
reform 
is 
substantial, 
but 
reasonable 
relative 
to 
current  ministries 
budget. 
It 
amounts 
to 
less 
than 
1% 
of 
non-wage expenditures 
of 
the three 
ministries 
the 
first 
year, 
rising 
to 
about 
10% 
by 
the 
fifth 
year. 
It 
is 
generally estimated that 
buildings 
whose 
rehabilitation 
costs 
amount 
to 
more 
than 
40 
or 
50% 
of 
the 
replacement 
costs, 
should 
be 
rebuilt 
rather than rehabilitated. 
' 
Budgetary 
implications 
are 
estimated 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
2001 
budget and 
are 
examined 
for 
the 
first 
five 
years 
of 
the 
reform 
(the 
time 
needed 
for including 
all 
regions 
into 
the 
program, and beyond 
which 
budgetary extrapolations become somewhat 
meaningless.) 
Page  39

21. 
The 
program 
does 
entail 
substantial increase 
in 
the maintenance budget, 
which 
currently 
stands  at 
about 
USD3.3 
million 
for 
the 
three 
ministries. 
Table 
4 
below 
shows 
the 
incremental 
costs 
over the 
two 
years 
of 
the 
loan.

A5.3.

It 
is 
unfortunately 
impossible 
to 
identify 
the 
current 
rehabilitation 
budget: 
current practice 
is 
to 
use 
the 
same 
budget 
code 
(872) 
for 
rehabilitation 
and 
for 
installation 
and 
furnishing 
of 
new 
buildings. 
The 
best 
estimate 
is 
to 
say 
that  the  three 
ministries  currently 
spend 
somewhere 
between 
USD 
4 
million 
and 
USD 
30 
million 
(in 
comparison, 
new 
construction 
absorb about 
USD 
11 
1 
million; 
see 
Annex Table 
A.5 
for 
details.) 
In 
addition, 
there 
may 
be 
external 
funds 
that 
provide additional 
resources 
for 
rehabilitation, 
such 
as 
the 
FEC 
for 
education. 
It 
is 
therefore 
not 
possible 
at 
this 
stage 
to 
estimate the 
incremental 
cost 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
program. 
ECONOMIC 
IMPACT 
OF 
THE 
REFORMS 
23. 
The 
reforms promoted 
aim 
to: 
(i) 
Improve 
public 
expenditure 
efficiency: 
Every 
dirham well 
spent 
on maintenance 
saves 
about 
3 
dirham 
on 
rehabilitation.8 
The 
USD 
I2 
million in 
incremental maintenance expenditure over the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
the  reform 
will 
therefore  economize 
about  USD 
36 
million. 
More 
generally, 
conservative 
estimates 
are  that 
today  the  accumulated 
need 
for 
rehabilitation 
in 
health, 
education  and 
higher 
education 
is 
around 
USD 
190 
million. 
The 
cost 
of 
deferred 
maintenance 
would 
increase 
to 
some 
USD 
500 
million 
over the next 
5 
years 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
appropriate 
maintenance. 
(ii) 
Create 
a 
link 
between 
the budgets 
for 
current 
and 
capital 
expenditures: 
The 
proposed 
buildings 
management 
system 
aims 
to 
minimize 
the 
total 
life 
cycle 
cost 
of 
a 
building, 
noting that 
for 
a 
building 
with 
a 
life 
expectancy 
of 
50 
years 
or 
more, 
design 
and construction 
should  absorb 
20 
to 
25% 
of 
the 
total, 
while 
maintenance 
should  represent 
75 
to 
80%. 
Thus, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
minimize 
cost 
over 
both 
investment 
and 
maintenance decisions, 
hence 
link 
current 
and 
capital 
budgets. 
(Any 
construction 
should give rise 
to 
an 
automatic 
increase 
in 
the 
following 
year's 
budget, 
equivalent 
to 
1 
to 
3% 
of 
the replacement 
cost 
of 
the 
building's 
excessively 
rapid 
and 
costly 
decapitalisation. 
) 
(iii) 
Improve 
the 
ability to 
spend 
and 
spend 
well 
Currently Ministries 
have 
a 
very 
high 
share 
of 
undisbursed 
capital 
expenditures. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
education, 
out 
of 
the 
MAD 
900 
million 
on-lent 
through 
the 
FEC, 
only 
MAD 
38 
million 
has been 
spent 
so 
far. 
Part 
of 
the 
problem 
is 
the lack 
of

structure 
to 
organize and 
plan 
the 
work, an 
issue 
the 
buildings 
management 
systems 
will 
help 
address. 
In 
addition, 
the 
systems 
introduced 
will 
be 
integrated  into 
the 
contrats 
d’objectif 
introduced through 
the budgetary 
reform 
and 
will 
be

by 
a 
technical 
audit. 
24. 
A 
key 
issue 
of 
course 
is 
the 
impact 
on 
public 
expenditure 
allocation. 
As 
shown 
above, 
this 
impact 
will 
be 
minimal 
however 
because 
(i) 
the amounts 
are 
small, and 
(ii) 
the approach 
will 
be 
gradual, 
so 
that maintenance expenditures 
will 
increase 
as 
the 
need 
for 
new 
investment 
decreases.
