The operation was successful\n            in large part because the proposed reform agenda came at the\n            right time. Significant changes can be made with limited\n            resources. Maintenance is too often delayed because of lack\n            of funding. Experience under the operation has shown that,\n            even with limited funding, significant changes can be made.\n            Delegation to local levels and training are key elements for\n            success. Initiation of the maintenance program worked\n            because the central level delegated responsibilities to\n            local teams, who were under pressure from the population to\n            show results."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
