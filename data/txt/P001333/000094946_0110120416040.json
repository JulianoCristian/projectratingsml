   sustainability likely, and the institutional development\n            impact is substantial. Lessons highlight the need for clear\n            project objectives at appraisal, when the development\n            objectives depend on implementation of a broad program,\n            enhanced by an appropriate design which should include both\n            a project, and program monitoring criteria, including the\n            joint review arrangements of the program by the cooperating\n            partners. Such monitoring, and evaluation requires\n            measurable, verifiable indicators for a fair assessment of\n            project performance. Moreover, on addressing sexually\n            transmitted diseases (STD), and HIV/AIDS epidemic, a shift\n            from the narrow biomedical paradigm to a development one is\n            required. Underlying the biological transmission of HIV, and\n            STDs is a huge issue of social vulnerability, thus a\n            programmatic approach is better suited to consolidate\n            efforts, aimed at reducing, and mitigating the impact of the\n            epidemic, focused on the underlying vulnerability issues.\n            Greater efforts are also needed to involve both the private\n            sector in the provision of services, and public-private\n            partnerships collaborative efforts in sharing costs,\n            emphasizing the promotion of an enabling sociopolitical\n            environment. In addition, decentralized project\n            implementation requires strong political commitment, and the\n            decentralization of fiscal responsibility should be matched\n            with authority, carefully supported by institutional\n            capacity building. Finally, financial management should\n            develop mechanisms for financing nongovernmental\n            organizations, and, financial accounts, and reporting\n            requirement systems should be recorded in a uniformed manner."}, "docdt": "2001-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
