Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory.\n            Project experience also suggests several lessons. First,\n            strong monitoring and evaluation programs--clear and\n            measurable indicators that are systematicaly collected over\n            time--are essential to assess program impact and to improve\n            the effectiveness of future interventions. Second, the\n            socio-political environment has a strong influence on the\n            effectiveness of national HIV/STI prevention programs. The\n            Bank and partners can contribute /to strengthened political\n            commitment by promoting dialogue with and among political\n            leaders and other stakeholders, but this tends to be a\n            long-term process. Third, decentralizing project activities\n            to district level can improve local implementation, but\n            needs to be accompanied by capacity building and\n            institutional reforms to give districts greater autonomy\n            over planning and budgeting. Finally projects planning to\n            finance nongovernmental organizations/community activities\n            need to develop clear modalities for doing so, and develop\n            strategies to ensure that high-risk groups are targeted and\n            that mechanisms are in place for monitoring, evaluation, and\n            sharing lessons."}, "docdt": "2002-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
