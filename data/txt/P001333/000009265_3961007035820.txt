MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Kenya for SDR 27.7 million, the equivalent of US$ 40
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a Sexually Transmitted
Infections Project. The following Government/donor agencies have agreed to co-finance this
project on a grant basis: UK., ODA (US$ 12.5 million); DANIDA (US$ I million); KfW,
Germany (US$ 4 million); and The Netherlands (US$ 4 million).
2.   Sector Background. Kenya's 27.7 million people suffer from a heavy burden of premature
mortality and severe ill health, even though national health and mortality indicators are somewhat
better than those of other Sub-Saharan African nations and many other low-income countries. Life
expectancy at birth was estimated to be 59 years in 1991, up from 42 years at the time of
independence in 1963. The infant mortality rate (IMR) of 67 and under-five mortality (USMR) of
105 reflect substantial progress since 1963, when the IMR was estimated to be 120 and the U5MR
200. In particular, the national U5MR is far better than the 177 deaths per thousand average for
Sub-Saharan Africa, and compares well with the 98 deaths per thousand average for all low-
income countries.
3.   Despite these achievements, improvements can and need to be made in further reducing
excess mortality and morbidity. Most alarming, the spread of the Human Immuno-Deficiency
Virus (IRV) threatens to reverse three decades of hard-won progress. The Government health
system has failed to keep pace with new strains resulting from the HIV/Acquired Immuno
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic and the influx of refugees from neighboring countries.
HIV has spread widely in Kenya. The Kenyan National AIDS Control Program (NACP) estimates
that about 900,000 adults were infected with HIV at the end of August 1994 -- one in every 14.
Additionally, it has been estimated that 50,000 children may be infected. The number of I-UV
infected persons is projected to increase to 1.7 million by 2000 and 2.2 million by 2010. The
HIV/AIDS epidemic in Kenya is likely to have a significant impact on the demography of the
country, including infant and adult mortality, life expectancy, and population growth rates.
4.   The major mode of HIV transmission in Kenya is heterosexual and the epidemic primarily
affects the young, sexually active population, which at present includes over forty percent of the
population. HIV sero-prevalence levels among pregnant women attending antenatal and Sexually
Transmitted Diseases (STD) clinics at urban and semi-urban sentinel sites have risen significantly.
HIV prevalence is generally greater in urban areas. Geographic distribution of HIV is highly
variable. The highest prevalence occurs in the regions that border Tanzania, Uganda and Lake
Victoria on the transportation route from Rwanda, Burundi and eastern Zaire.
5.   Prevention remains the only way to reduce the spread and impact of Sexually Transmitted
Infections (STIs). There are two main strategies for prevention in Kenya as outlined in the
Medium Term Plan prepared by the Ministry of Health (MOH):
promotion of safer sexual behaviors, which may include: abstinence before marriage
and faithfulness to one's partner after marriage - if there is any variation at all from
these requirements, a condom is essential and the only way to save lives;



2
prevention and treatment of the classic STIs.
6.   Recognizing the severity of the AIDS epidemic, the Government has increasingly begun to
pay attention to the growing problems of AIDS. In August 1993 the President made a strong
public statement about the probable impact of the epidemic and called for a concerted plan of
action. In March 1994, the Government took steps to elevate the position of Director of the AIDS
program to the rank of a Deputy Director Medical Services thereby vastly increasing the status and
bureaucratic importance of the AIDS program in the Ministry of Health. It also integrated the
STD and AIDS programs. In addition, a number of steps to streamline, strengthen and upgrade the
program's Secretariat are underway.
7.   The MOH has been poorly staffed and inefficiently managed. In recent months several key
developments which will impact the sector have taken place. A Health Policy Framework Paper
has been approved by Cabinet. It has endorsed the concept of essential health services and has
begun to reallocate resources accordingly. It has also begun to decentralize health services. A
major new thrust is the evolving partnership with NGOs and the private sector. These strategies
are sound and provide an appropriate policy and institutional framework for this operation.
8.   Project Objectives. The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)  to strengthen the institutional capacity at the national and district levels to design,
implement, monitor and evaluate interventions;
(b)  to promote preventive measures to reduce the risks of STI transmission; and
(c)  to enhance both health sector and community provision of physical and psychological
care and develop strategies to mitigate the socio-economic consequences.
Expected key outcomes by the end of the project include:
(a)  ability of 75% of the target population to cite at least two acceptable ways of
protecting themselves from HIV;
(b)  increase by 30% of reported condom use among the target population;
(c)  decrease by 20% of reported non-regular sexual partners; and
(d)  increase in appropriate STD case management to 70% of those individuals seeking
STD care.
9.   Project Description. Strengthening of the Institutional Capacity to Design, Implement
and Evaluate Interventions (US$ 13.9 million) through identification of key policy issues within
Government (e.g. elevating the status of women), religious, NGO and private sectors; integration
of policy activities within the health sector; strengthening the ability of Kenyan implementing
institutions to successfully design, implement and evaluate HIV/AIDS prevention programs at the
national and district levels; and strengthening surveillance, monitoring and evaluation activities.
The essence of the health reform efforts planned by the Kenyan Government is to decentralize the
decision-making and budgetary process for health services to the district level. This project takes



3
the first step towards this goal by decentralization of STI activities; it facilitates the development of
managerial and planning capabilities at the district level.
10.  Preventive measures to reduce the risk of STI transmission (US$ 26.7 million) through
diagnosis and treatment of persons with STDs, provision of condoms and the development of
national information, education and communication programs. To reduce the direct cost of AIDS
and the workload of health facilities, the project will support social interventions to help
households cope with the impact of AIDS. Guidance and operational support will be given in
particular to NGOs, to help them identify and assist AIDS stricken families. Increased use of
condoms is expected and the project would make them widely available. Condoms will be supplied
to districts, municipalities, NGOs and to those providing health services to the military, police and
security services and refugees.
11.  Health and community care for infected persons (US$ 19.4 million) through treatment of
those with opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB), palliative home care, and provision
of protective supplies. Behavior change interventions will emphasize interpersonal techniques,
such as peer education and utilization of multiple reinforcing communication channels, including
mass media campaigns. The AIDS epidemic results in over-stretching of existing hospital capacity
to provide health care in Kenya. Many AIDS patients need social and counseling services that
cannot be provided by Government facilities. Numerous NGOs and CBOs are involved in
supporting HIV/AIDS patients, but they often lack funds to meet the full extent of the needs or
provide services which are not cost-effective and sustainable. NGOs, CBOs and families will be
identified by the District Health Management Teams and supported through this project. The
services provided to AIDS patients will include at a minimum drugs for opportunistic infections,
supplies for AIDS care provision of counselors and social support.
12.  Project Implementation. The Ministry of Health will have responsibility for overall project
coordination. Within MOH, the Permanent Secretary will be the Project Director in charge of
coordination and implementation. The majority of project activities will be implemented at the
district level by the District Health Management Teams, district based organizations, community
groups and NGOs. The National AIDS and STD Control Program (NASCP) will provide national
policy and technical support to the districts. The technical aspects of the project will be the
responsibility of the Director of the NASCP.
13.  A Project Steering Committee, chaired by the Pernanent Secretary, MOH with
representatives from the Office of the President, Ministries of Health, Finance, Information, Local
Government, Planning and National Development, Department of Defense, Universities of Nairobi
and NASCP has been established to act as an advisory body to the implementing parties. NGOs,
other ministries and specialized divisions within the MOH will be invited to participate in the
Committee whenever necessary. The Project Coordinator will be the Secretary to the Steering
Committee.
14.  At the district level, the District Medical Officer will be responsible for coordinating project
activities. He will work closely with NGOs active in the district as well as with members of the
District Health Management Team and community groups to ensure that services are provided to
the largest group of people within the district that could play an active role in the control of STIs.
15.  A project coordinator (a Kenyan national), has been appointed and located in the NASCP.
The role of the Project Coordinator will be to (a) facilitate the implementation of the project,



4
including handling the administrative requirements of IDA; and (b) work under the technical and
administrative guidance of the Program Manager of the NASCP. Accountants, procurement
specialists, and other support staff already in place and financed by the MOH as part of its
recurrent budget for the two Population and the Health Rehabilitation projects will support this
project as necessary.
16.  The total project cost of US$ 65.5 million equivalent will be financed as follows: a proposed
IDA Credit of US$ 40 million; the Government will finance US$ 4 million; ODA, KfW
(Germany), DANIDA and the Government of the Netherlands will provide parallel financing
totaling US$ 21.5 million. Details of project costs and financing plan are provided in Schedule A.
Procurement arrangements and credit allocation and disbursements are given in Schedule B. The
timetable of key events is given in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations is
summarized in Schedule D. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13385-KE is being distributed
separately. A map is also attached.
17. Project Sustainability. The recurrent cost implications of the project are small. No new
buildings are being constructed, and no additional staff likely to be hired. The Government will
finance the maintenance costs of new equipment, through the MOH budgetary allocation. These
costs are estimated at 5% of the purchase price annually. The project will be managed by staff
already in place except for a project coordinator, secretary and driver.
18.  Given that the health sector has been seriously underfunded over the past several years, the
MOH has been unable to finance the purchase of drugs. It is expected that Treasury allocations
for health will increase slightly. At the same time a number of cost recovery measures are being
introduced and revenues through the health care financing scheme are expected to rise significantly,
particularly since the Government is gradually removing exemptions under the scheme. However,
in view of the magnitude of the present gap between health expenditures and needs it is not possible
that at the end of the project, the Government will be able to take over and sustain the financing of
condoms and all drug needs, particularly if the incidence of HIV-related illnesses continues at
current rates. On economic grounds, diseases with large externalities are unlikely to be adequately
controlled without full or partial public financing. Hence, expenditures on condoms and STD
drugs are substantial and likely to remain high over the medium term. Donor funding for these
commodities will be necessary for the foreseeable future.
19.  Many of the consumable items being funded restore good health or prevent illness.
Condoms, drugs for TB treatment and gloves for health workers are examples. The provision of
these items reduces rather than incurs recurrent costs in the health sector; every TB patient treated,
or every HIV-infection averted, reduces the number of future patients seeking health care. Left
unchecked, STD infections in men cause mild to severe genital or urinary tract problems and can
cause infertility. The consequences for women, who are often asymptomatic and therefore
unaware of the infection, include adverse outcomes of pregnancy for mothers and newborns,
infections in newborns and infants, infertility, cervical cancer, and in some cases death. These
impose vastly higher costs than STD treatment which is an extremely cost-effective health
intervention.
20.  Without the inputs to be provided through the project, a much more serious sustainability
problem would arise. The large amounts of money spent on health facilities and the training and
wages of health workers are wasted if adequate drugs and other supplies are not available.



5
Therefore, the project is helping to ensure the sustainability and impact of past and existing large
investments in health care.
21.  Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. Disbursements under the Population and Health
Rehabilitation Projects have been slow because of inadequate attention to planning procurement
details during project development, and poor familiarity with Bank procedures by Government
staff who are responsible for implementation. Documents for the first tenders need to be reviewed
well before effectiveness. Project management systems need to be well established at the outset of
the project and strengthened systematically, through a combination of adequate staffing in MOH,
short courses and on-the-job training, use of local consultants, and provision of office equipment
and supplies. Closer attention to project implementation by senior management of the MOH has
resulted in identification and speedy resolution of bottlenecks. These steps are expected to result in
a significant increase in disbursements during this fiscal year.
22. IDA has financed STI/AIDS projects in Zaire, India, Zimbabwe, Brazil, Burkina Faso and
Uganda. There are no simple solutions to prevent the spread of STIs since interventions must cope
with complex and personal aspects of human behavior. Lessons learned from AIDS programs
worldwide show that effective and sustained behavior change can be achieved only where the
communities take responsibility for addressing and changing unsafe sexual behavior and
maintaining safer sexual practices.
23. Rationale for IDA involvement. The AIDS epidemic is already having a severe impact on
the economy, especially since so many of its victims are in the prime of their active economic lives.
IDA is separately developing freestanding Nutrition and Health Projects which will provide
support for other essential interventions. These three operations will be closely linked and provide
a unique opportunity for IDA to play highly effective role in policy discussions in the entire
health/nutrition sector and to act as a catalyst to attract additional donor funding. Donors have
indicated a strong desire for IDA to take the lead in this area. Moreover, expenditures needed for
AIDS and STI interventions are substantial and it has been demonstrated over the years that the
Kenyan AIDS Control Program has been severely underfunded. The project is in complete
conformity with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on April 5, 1994
which calls for a shift from curative to preventive health activities, emphasizes poverty
alleviation measures and calls for the urgent development of prevention programs to combat
STDs, including AIDS. The preventive component will help the population avoid AIDS-related
poverty, while the treatment of infected persons component will assist those who are afflicted.
24.  Agreed Actions. Actions, which have been completed, include: (i) Government's
submission of an approved health policy framework, organizational and manpower analysis of the
NASCP and a time-bound implementation plan for the identified recommendations including local
and overseas training; (ii) submission of a paper detailing mechanisms to support, monitor and
evaluate NGO/CBO activities; (iii) appointment of a Project Coordinator whose qualifications and
experience are satisfactory to IDA; (iv) establishment of a Project Steering Committee; (v)
submission of a draft implementation manual for all project components including the annual work
and training program for the first year of project implementation; (vi) appointment of procurement
agents for all procurement in the project; and (vii) submission of all outstanding audits for the
health and population projects.
25.  The following would be conditions of Credit Effectiveness: (i) the Ministry of Health issue
the provision of the authority to incur expenditures to the District Medical Officer for district



6
health activities starting with STIs; (ii) the Government issue a set of guidelines for NGOs, CBOs
and families for community-based care; and (iii) the Government furnishes IDA with a final
implementation manual for all project components.
26.  During negotiations assurances were obtained: (i) that the MOH disaggregate and publish
budgets at least to district levels starting with the 1996/97 financial year; (ii) that all ainual district
health plans include earmarked funds for NGO and CBO activities; (iii) that the MOH would
contract appropriate agencies for the administration and implementation of research grants by
January 1, 1996; (iv) that the NASCP would develop annual workplans and submit them to IDA
for review and approval by March 31 of each year; (v) that the Project Coordinator be acceptable
to IDA at all times during project implementation; (vi) that the reports for both the internal and
external program reviews would be made available to IDA within two months of completion; (vii)
that (a) the annual IEC plans would specify prevention interventions and approaches and (b) the
production of IEC materials would be undertaken through open competition; (viii) that progress
reports and beneficiary assessment data would be consolidated by the NASCP and sent to IDA,
through the Permanent Secretary, MOH, every six months; (ix) that a Mid-Term evaluation of the
project be held in 1997 and that the implementation evaluation report be prepared by Government
within six months of the project closing date, (x) that all research proposals would be reviewed by
an independent review panel; (xi) (a) that the annual work plans will be prepared in time for
inclusion in the annual budget; (b) that adequate provisions be made in accordance with relevant
budget items to ensure adequate counterpart funding each year; and (c) that the Government
provide, on an annual basis, evidence that funds thus allocated in the previous year's budget were
used for the intended purpose; and (xii) that all project accounts will be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA and that all audited accounts, together with the auditors' report, will be
submitted to IDA not later than six months after the end of each Government's fiscal year.
27.  Poverty Category. HIV/AIDS will alter the distribution of income in society and create
new groups of poverty. HIV/AIDS will reduce labor supply within households and lower
productivity of people with AIDS and family members who care for them. In coping with the
impact, households are likely to change their levels and composition of production, consumption,
savings and investment. Many of the project activities will prevent and cure illness and therefore
reduce spending on health care, reduce potential productivity and income losses because of illness
and death and the loss of accumulated human capital of people who die young of AIDS.
28.  Environmental Aspects. The project is classified as Category C, with no adverse impact on
the environment.
29.  Program Objective Categories. The program objectives which will be impacted by this
project are:
Primary:    Health, Nutrition, AIDS;
Secondary:  Poverty Alleviation, Women in Development.
30.  Participatory Approach. The project was prepared by the Government with assistance
from an outside consultant. Its objectives and activities have been formulated within the
framework of the Medium Term Plan 11. NGOs, CBOs and the private sector were involved in the
preparation and appraisal of this project. Their contributions have provided very useful inputs in
the design of the project. In this connection, a nationwide AIDS workshop was organized in April
1993 to bring together all the different stakeholders as part of project preparation.

31.  Benefits. The project would have an immediate impact by making STD care available
nationally. Through the provision of condoms, the project would have an immediate effect on the
transmission of STDs. It will provide condoms to an estimated 5 million persons, thus protecting
them and their sexual partners from the risk of contracting HIV and STDs. The project will
furnish sufficient diagnostics to test every pregnant woman who seeks care from syphilis during the
life of the project, benefiting them and their unborn children. More than 1.7 million people with
HIV will receive care for various infections. The project will also directly benefit 100,000
tuberculosis patients and their families.
32.  Prevention of STDs and HIV will result in large savings in sickness care expenditures. The
drain on society by the loss of life from AIDS is staggering in human, social and economic terms.
Investment in reducing STDs and HIV will produce savings and increased economic activity
through carefully targeted interventions. For instance a Nairobi program found that 6,000 to
10,000 new HIV infections a year were averted at a cost of $0.50 per Disability-Adjusted Life
Year (DALY) gained. Palliative home care costs between $30 and $75 per DALY gained. Curing
each case of gonorrhea in a core group saves 120 DALYs, at a cost well below the $1 per DALY
gained if the benefits of fewer secondary cases and the reduced risk of HIV transmission are
included. Thus the project will be an effective means for protecting large numbers of Kenya's
labor force against the disease and their dependents against AIDS-related poverty.
33.  Risks. The principal risk for the project is that the incidence rates of HIV, STDs or TB, all
high already, may increase so quickly as to overwhelm even the integrated and intensified effort of
Kenya's STI program. The only way of averting this risk is to mount the most inclusive, cost-
effective program possible in the shortest time. The project has been designed to observe the need
for speed, its components are simple, easy to supervise and rapidly implementable. A secondary
risk is that the health services may lack sufficient experience and capacity to implement an
effective STD screening and prevention program. The project provides for training of health
workers in STD diagnosis and treatment. During supervision missions, technical experts will
assess the capacity and determine if any other special training or refresher courses are needed.
Another risk is that the capacity of the NASCP may prove inadequate for the huge coordination
task facing it. A project coordinator will be appointed and short-term technical assistance provided
if necessary. The final risk is that the behavioral changes the STI program seeks to promote are
likely to prove difficult to achieve. Limited experience in other countries, however, suggests that
the literal life-and-death choice posed by the proliferation of STIs has proven compelling enough to
override even the inherent resistance to change.
34.  Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
