         promote preventive measures to reduce the risks of sexually\n            transmitted infection (STI) transmission; and to enhance\n            both health sector and community provision of physical and\n            psychological care and develop strategies to mitigate the\n            socioeconomic consequences. The medium term plan identifies\n            the following strategies and components to address these\n            objectives: 1) prevention of sexual transmission of HIV\n            through syndromic case management and the provision of\n            standardized drug kits, promoting safer sexual behavior and\n            promoting and providing condoms through primary level health\n            facilities; 2) prevention of transmission through blood and\n            blood products; 3) mitigation of socioeconomic impact by the\n            treatment of turberculosis, providing drugs for\n            opportunistic infections and protective supplies for\n            government and non-government district health facilities and\n            training health provider staff, and supporting district\n            based nongovernmental and Community Based Organizations\n            (CBO) home-based health care and counseling for HIV/AIDS\n            patients; 4) epidemiology and surveillance; 5) coordination\n            of research; and 6) management and coordination of a\n            multi-sectoral AIDS control program."}, "docdt": "1995-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
