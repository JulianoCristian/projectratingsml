The\n            project aims to further improve and enhance the role of\n            financial intermediaries in resource allocation in First\n            Tanzania, and to contribute to the foreign exchange\n            resources available to medium size investment in the sectors\n            involved. There are no major institutional risks associated\n            with this project as TDFL is a fairly well established\n            financing institution. However the industrial sector, the\n            primary beneficiary of TDFL financing, faces a number of\n            serious operating problems which could affect TDFL's\n            ability to expand as projected in this report."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
