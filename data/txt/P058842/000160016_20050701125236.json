The first Mindanao Rural Development Project\n            (MRDP 1) provides an operational model on how a national\n            sectoral agency like the Department of Agriculture can\n            decentralize functions and responsibilities. 3) Well-defined\n            and constructive partnership between national government\n            agencies and local governments is key to effective\n            devolution. 4) Strengthening grass roots organizations,\n            local governments and communities is vital to meaningful\n            participatory and integrated development. 5) Using regular\n            government personnel, instead of contracted personnel\n            provides for greater institutionalization of project\n            initiatives. 6) Effective operation and use of a\n            well-designed monitoring and evaluation system hinge on the\n            adequacy of the budget, good quality staff, and a high level\n            of prioritization. 7) Disbursements and financial management\n            are better facilitated if  technical implementation and\n            financial management, are tightly linked and monitored by\n            qualified staff right at the beginning of implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
