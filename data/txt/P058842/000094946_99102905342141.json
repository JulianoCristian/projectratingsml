Careful\n            planning will minimize and offset impairment of cultural and\n            historical sites. During the design phase, the area\n            surrounding the spring box and reservoir will be fenced to\n            prevent traffic by people or stray animals and act as a\n            barrier to runoff that could possibly contaminate the\n            source. To reduce soil erosion from exposed areas and\n            deterioration of water quality, soil filled trenches should\n            be compacted and vegetation planted. Flooding of lots and\n            farmlands adjacent to roads will be mitigated by carefully\n            planning drainage facilities, and including bridges, box\n            culverts, reinforced concrete pipes, and side ditches.\n            Properly storing spoils and using silting ponds will\n            alleviate stream sedimentation. Dust will be controlled by\n            spraying road surfaces and imposing speed limits on\n            motorists. No protection measures are recommended to\n            mitigate against deforestation and other losses of\n            agricultural lands and ecology due to road construction, but\n            offsetting actions are planned during spring development. To\n            prevent social conflict arising from water use distribution,\n            limited water rights will be offered. Social inequities\n            resulting from resettlement will be checked by careful planning."}, "docdt": "1999-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
