INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION
PROPOSED SPRING DEVELOPMENT LEVEL II
WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS FOR
COTABATO AND SULTAN KUDARAT
I.   Introduction
1.          This is a component of APL-1 that is one of four Adaptable Program
Loans (APL) of the Mindanao Rural Development Program. A General Guideline
for the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) of this kind of project was
prepared. The possible environmental issues and problems that need to be examined
are listed and discussed to serve as a guide in the conduct of IEE for the specific
projects. The proposed level 2 water supply projects are located in several
municipalities in Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat.
2.          At the time of the site visit, the spring development level 2 water
supply projects were not included in the list of projects for first year
implementation. As such, these were not among the project sites visited.
II.   Description of the Project
3.          Included are 18 spring development level 2 water supply projects 4 of
which are located in Cotabato and 14 in Sultan Kudarat.
4.          The geometric and design specifications to be followed are:
One unit spring box and reservoir on ground with 2,000 linear meters
of 4" diameter P.E. pipeline and provisions of standpipes (communal faucet) in
strategic locations.
5.          The construction activities will include the following:
a.          Clearing of the area surrounding the spring and fencing it to provide
protection to the spring.
b.          Construction of the spring box and reservoir. This will involve
excavation and masonry works.
IEE for Water Supply. Page I of 4



c.          Laving of distribution lines and installation of standpipes. This will
involve clearing the path of the pipeline and excavation works.
6.          Activities During the Operation of the Project
a.          Protection of the watershed area.
b.          Repair and maintenance of spring box and reservoir.
c.          Repair and maintenance of pipeline.
III.  Screening of Possible Environmental Impact and Mitigating Measures
7.          The environmental issues concerning the projects may be grouped
into four namely:
a.          Environmental Problems Relating to siting
b.          Problems Relating to Design Phase
c.          Problems Relating to Construction Stage
d.          Problems Relating to Operation
8.          Possible environmental problems relating to siting will include
pollution of the water source from sources within the watershed; water use conflicts;
resettlement of people displaced; and impairment of historical/cultural monuments
or areas. Although there are no industries nearby the sources that may contribute to
pollution, pollution from pesticides used in agriculture such as in fruit farms as well
as pollution from animal excreta should be investigated to assure that the source
will be suitable for its intended purpose.
Water use conflict may arise if others use the spring for other
purposes. This should be investigated to make sure that there is enough water for all
users.
If there will be people that will be displaced because of the project,
then these people should be relocated. This problem however is very unlikely
considering that the area required for the development of the source is small.
Likewise, the design and construction of the pipeline without displacing people is
not difficult.
If there are any historical or cultural monuments or areas nearby that
may be affected bv the project, then the design should avoid affecting these. This
IEE for Water Supply, Page 2 of 4



should not be difficult since the pipeline could be rerouted although this may
increase cost. If the spring is within an area with historical or cultural significance,
the spring box and reservoir may be designed to blend with the natural beautv of
the area.
9.          The environmental problems and issues related to the design phase
include inadequate protection of intake works, poor spring water quality, problems
from transmission lines such as encroachment into precious ecology, impairment of
environmental aesthetics, and continuing soil erosion from non-resurfaced areas.
The issue on inadequate protection of the spring box and reservoir should be taken
into consideration during the design phase. The area surrounding the spring box
and reservoir should be fenced to prevent people or stray animals getting into the
area and possibly contaminating the source. The spring box should also be designed
to prevent runoff from surrounding areas to get into the box.
Before the spring can be considered as a source, samples should be
taken and tested to make sure that it is potable and meet the standards for drinking
water. This is verv necessary in as much as no treatment of the water is
contemplated in the design. If the water is shown to be suitable, there will still be a
need to protect the watershed and the intake facilities to maintain good water
quality. Part of the operation and maintenance program should include the
protection of the watershed and intake facilities.
The issue of possible encroachment into precious ecology arising from
the laying of the transmission lines should be investigated. If necessary, alternative
routes will be considered to avoid encroaching into precious ecology. The issue on
impairment of environmental aesthetics should not be a problem since the pipes will
be underground. The issue on continuing erosion from non-resurfaced areas will not
be a critical one since grasses will readily grow in these areas considering that the
areas traversed are agricultural.
10.         The environmental problems and issues related to the construction
phase include soil erosion and silt runoff from the construction operations;
continuing soil erosion and silt runoff from non-resurfaced exposed areas; safety
and health problems of construction workers; and inadequate monitoring of
construction activities.
Careful planning of construction activities and techniques will reduce
soil erosion and silt runoff during the construction stage. The soil filled trenches
should be compacted and planted with grasses which is readily available in the
area. Excess soil may be brought to low lying areas, compacted and likewise planted
with grass or other vegetation.
Sometimes contractors build temporary quarters for their laborers
during the construction period. If they fail to provide adequate sanitary facilities,
this could lead to health problems that will not only affect the workers themselves
IEE for Water Supply, Page 3 of 4



but also people living nearby. Considering that the transmission lines are short, and
since it is expected that the laborers will be local residents, it is unlikely that the
laborers will stay in construction camps. Thev are expected to stay in their own
homes. This is therefore probably not a problem. However, in the event that
construction camps are erected, the contractor will be required to provide adequate
sanitary facilities to lessen the problem. Likewise, the contractor should always
follow and observe safety rules and regulations.
There are times when there are negative impacts arising from the
construction stage but which are not the results of the construction activities but
rather on the failure to monitor the construction activities. This leads to defects in
the construction that may lessen the life or the effectiveness of the water supply
system. Early deterioration of the system could lead to several problems such as
water leakage, and water contamination. This impact could be very significant but
this is avoided by making a good monitoring program and having good people to do
the monitoring.
11.         Environmental problems and issues during the operation of the
system will include water source contamination, and inadequate monitoring of the
system. The operation and maintenance program should include the protection of
the watershed and intake facilities to make sure that water flowing through the
pipes is safe to drink. The operation of the system should be monitored and the
deficiencies noted so this could be corrected and any design flaws or deficiencies
corrected in future projects.
IV. Recommendations
12.        What have been discussed above is presented in checklist form shown
on pages A-21 and A-22. It is recommended that this will be used to make the initial
assessment once the proposed spring sources are identified.
