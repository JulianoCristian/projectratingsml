The main components are:\n            rehabilitation of rural roads and farm-to-market access\n            roads, ensuring that provincial roads meet essential\n            criteria and link to existing all-weather roads. Communal\n            irrigation will be supported through improved management and\n            schemes maintenance. Spring development projects will\n            provide safe potable water to the communities, while water,\n            sanitation, and health associations' management and\n            institutional development will be strengthened; 2) the\n            Community Funds for Agricultural Development will be\n            established to address priorities of the communities. The\n            funds will be provided initially, from loan proceeds, and\n            municipal contributions, to support agricultural and\n            fisheries development, particularly targeting, poor\n            communities, specifically women, and indigenous groups; 3)\n            institutional and implementation support, to strengthen\n            local capacity of micro-finance institutions; enhancement of\n            rural development planning, and resource allocation; and,\n            financial management assistance; and 4) coastal\n            bio-diversity conservation, whose incremental costs, will be\n            financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)."}, "docdt": "1999-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
