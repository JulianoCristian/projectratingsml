NORTHWEST SELANGOR INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower: Malaysia
Amount: US$26 million
Term: 17 years, including 4 years of grace
Project Description:  The proposed project would improve the productivity
and incomes of 32,000 smallholder families in northwest
Selangor (of whom the overwhelming majority are below
the relative poverty line and 65% of whom have incomes
below the absolute poverty line), through the provision
of improved drainage and irrigation facilities, access
roads, training and intensified agricultural supporting
services; it would also improve the regional drainage
systems with subsequent subsidiary benefits for the
region's towns and estates. The major risk associated
with the project involves the uncertainties associated
with the implementation of the integrated agricultural
support services system.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO MALAYSIA FOR THE NORTHWEST SELANGOR INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$26 million to help finance an
integrated agricultural development project in the northwest portion of the
State of Selangor. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 4 years
of grace, with interest at 7.45% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report, "Malaysia:  New Perspectives on the
Third Malaysia Plan" (No. 1594-MA), is dated October 14, 1977. Detailed data
on Malaysia's economy are shown in Annex I.
3.        By most economic indicators, Malaysia has done well in the past
and, in particular, during the Second Malaysia Plan (SMP, 1971-75). The per
capita income of US$860 (in 1976) is among the highest in Southeast Asia.
Public and private investment activity was stepped up and, as a result,
economic growth, which during the 1960s averaged 6% a year, increased during
the SMP to 7%. During the Second Plan the proportion of agricultural house-
holds in poverty in Peninsular Malaysia was reduced from 68% to 63%./l
Progress has been made in reducing the economy's dependence on rubber, and
the manufacturing sector has performed well, in terms of output, employment,
and exports. With a high export component in GNP, the country is very
vulnerable to external fluctuations, which were significant during the SMP.
In spite of the increased investment activity and resulting current account
deficits in the balance of payments, Malaysia managed to maintain a strong
external position during the SMP with relatively low debt service payments
and growing international reserves.
4.        Notwithstanding this good performance, there are still substan-
tial racial inequalities in income and employment, generally correlated with
racial background; and considerable poverty remains, especially in the
countryside. The inferior income position of the Malays is related to the
concentration of Malays in traditional smallholder agriculture and their
complementary meager ownership of corporate assets; moreover, Malays are
poorly represented in the modern industrial sector, especially in managerial,
professional, supervisory and clerical occupations. These inequalities have
threatened the stability of the country and in 1971 prompted the Government
to introduce a New Economic Policy, which is designed to achieve national
unity through the two-pronged objective of eradicating poverty and restruc-
turing society to eliminate the identification of race with economic function.
/1 For our purposes, we have defined the per capita poverty level in Malaysia
as US$215 per annum, based on the cost of a subsistence diet and of other
basic necessities.



5.        The Government recently initiated the Third Malaysia Plan (TMP,
1976-80). In addition to reconfirming the goals of the New Economic Policy,
the TMP stresses that national unity as well as social and economic progress
can only be achieved in an environment of security and order. The major
objectives of the TMP are: (a) to reduce the overall incidence of poverty
(from 44% in 1975 to 34% by 1980, which would mean reducing poverty in the
agricultural sector from 63% to 49%); (b) to increase Malay employment in the
modern sectors of the economy (from the 1975 Malay share of 32% towards the 1990
goal of 50%); and (c) to increase the share of Malays in the equity ownership of
the corporate sector (from the 1975 Malay share of 8% to 16% in 1980).
6.        One of the principal means set out in the TMP to reduce poverty is
to raise agricultural production. In the Third Plan one quarter (M$4.7 billion)
of total public development expenditures is allocated to this sector (compared
with 22% or M$2.1 billion in the SRV). Of this more than one third will be
spent on increasing productivity in existing agricultural areas. In addition,
one million acres of new land are scheduled for development. As a means of
reducing poverty, the TMP also provides for improved housing and other essential
services for the poor in both rural and urban areas. The TMP also stresses
that greater attention will be given to improving the less developed states in
Malaysia.
7.        The TMP goals are set out in a framework of substantial economic
growth. The target growth rate for GDP is set at 8.5% per annum. Private
investment is targeted to grow about 10% a year and public investment at
about 6%, resulting in an investment of M$44 billion, in current prices, over
the TMP period. Public development expenditures were set at M$18.6 billion,
with a higher level of M$20 billion targeted if resources became available.
8.        During 1976,  significant increases in exports, both in prices and
volumes, particularly of oil exports, combined with moderate import increases,
resulted in a current account surplus equivalent to 6.2% of GDP. Despite a
reduction in market borrowing by the Government, reserves increased by US$900
million. At the end of 1976, gross official reserves were the equivalent of
about seven months of imports.
9.        Current projections of oil exports and export prices in general
are higher than those used as a basis for the TMP. Therefore, the resource
outlook for Malaysia is now brighter than was forecast in the Third Plan.
Overall export earnings during the Plan period should be about US$5 billion
more than was forecast in the TMP. Largely as a result of this increase,
public sector revenues are also expected to be higher by about US$3 billion.
The likelihood of these additional resources has prompted the Government to
increase its TMP target for development expenditures to M$20 billion, and if
implementation constraints are overcome, an even higher target could be set.



- 3 -
10.       During the next five years Malaysia's balance of payments should be
in substantial surplus. The cumulative current account surplus could amount
to over 5% of GDP compared to a negligible current surplus in the previous
five years. Since such a current account surplus would be sufficient to
provide for an adequate level of reserves, capital inflows may moderate in
the future. At present about 19% of public debt outstanding and disbursed is
from the Bank; this percentage may increase somewhat by the early 1980s.
Reserves are also expected to continue to increase slowly, while the debt
service on public obligations is likely to remain at its present level of
4-5% of export earnings. The Bank's share of debt service is currently about
11% and may increase to 12-14% by the early 1980s.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
11.       The Bank has made 37 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
sewerage, telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and urban transport.
Under the proposed project the federal Drainage and Irrigation Department
(DID) in the Ministry of Agriculture will be responsible for the implemen-
tation of all project civil works. DID has successfully completed on schedule
and at the estimated original costs two large Bank irrigation projects (Loans
434-MA and 500-MA) and is currently implementing the major drainage and
irrigation components of two other Bank projects (Loans 973-MA and 1294-MA)
and supervising the implementation of a national irrigation project (Loan
1444-MA).
12.       Although in many cases disbursements have been slower than expected,
the execution of Bank projects in Malaysia has generally been satisfactory.
As of December 31, 1977, the loans to Malaysia held by the Bank amounted to
US$715.9 million. Thirteen loans have been fully disbursed. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans as well as notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
13.       While currently Malaysia is a resource surplus country, the openness
of the economy (exports are 45% of the GDP) and the volatility of the prices
of Malaysia's main exports (rubber, palm oil and tin) make the continuance of
large surpluses uncertain. Furthermore, to cushion against fluctuation in
exports, large reserves are needed. As far as the Bank is concerned, the
primary consideration in lending is not resource transfer; rather, it is
institution building and helping Malaysia to expand its capacity to implement
programs to combat the deep-rooted problems of poverty and unemployment,
particularly in the rural areas.
14.       Malaysia's commitment to assist its low income groups has streng-
thened significantly in the past few years. The Bank can justifiably take
some measure of credit for its efforts to help Malaysia identify and prepare
projects of this type geared toward the rural poor. In view of Malaysia's
otherwise weak preparation capability, the number of rural development
projects recently financed and in the current pipeline appears impressive.
The bulk of these projects has been financed by the Bank. In the past a
large share of our lending for rural development was modeled on the successful



FELDA land settlement model. More recently, we have been focusing more on
in-situ type projects, such as small-scale irrigation, area development and
agricultural support services. The National Small Scale Irrigation Project
(approved in FY77) is assisting over 60,000 smallholder farmers through the
construction and rehabilitation of about 200 small irrigation schemes. In
Kelantan, Malaysia's poorest state, we are providing about 100,000 families a
package of development activities including improved access roads and a
strengthening of the state's agricultural support services. This year, under
a third project, we have provided assistance for expanding and strengthening
Malaysia's national extension services including training, technical assist-
ance, production of improved seeds, a revision of the approach to extension
and a provision for improving program monitoring and evaluation.
15.       While these recent projects are by themselves impressive, they are
not truly representative of the Government's general capacity to develop
projects; this remains very weak, largely because of a shortage of trained
staff. With the help of the UNDP-financed and Bank-executed State and Rural
Development Project, which provides technical assistance in selected federal
departments and states, we are helping the Government to develop further its
programs and projects for reducing poverty.
16.       The country needs assistance to help develop future poverty programs
and projects that reach out directly to low-income families in the rural
and urban areas. The central thrust of the Bank's future lending program is
poverty redressal in the rural areas through improved support services and
better facilities. Our loans will assist those in absolute poverty by
providing irrigation and drainage facilities and farm-to-market roads for
existing smallholders, as well as by providing landless laborers with newly
developed land. Our program will also improve support services by expanding
extension; by increasing agricultural, small-scale, and industrial credit;
and by producing higher quality seeds. We plan to mount a concentrated
effort to help such institutions as RISDA, FELCRA and the Agricultural Credit
Bank. The groundwork for this assistance has already been laid by the North
Kelantan Rural Development, National Small-Scale Irrigation, Agricultural
Research and National Extension projects. We also plan to help the Government
expand social services, in particular for low-income groups through assistance
for formal and informal skill training and the expansion of family planning
services. Assistance to infrastructure development will be very selective,
concentrating on secondary rural road links, extending electricity into the
rural areas and providing assistance to lower income families in the urban
areas through low-cost housing.
17.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made six invest-
ments totaling US$8.69 million. The total commitments under the investments
held by IFC as of December 31, 1977 amounted to US$1.55 million (Annex II).



PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND THE STATE OF SELANGOR
An Overview
18.       Malaysia's agricultural sector occupies a predominant position in
international trade in natural rubber, palm oil, hardwoods and pepper.
Agricultural commodities account for about 60% of the country's exports and
about 30% of GNP. Most of the agricultural land in Malaysia is under three
crops: rubber (61%), paddy (14%), and oil palm (10%). Except for oil palm,
acreages of all principal crops consist mainly of smallholdings, although
private and public estates continue to play a vital role in the production of
rubber and coconuts. Reflecting world market conditions, oil palm is
gradually replacing rubber production in coastal areas more suited to the
former. This trend is evident in both smallholder and estate production.
19.       During the Third Malaysia Plan (1976-80) agricultural production
is targeted to grow by about 7% per annum, compared to 5.6% during the Second
Plan (1971-75). Export demand will continue to be the major growth determinant,
but its influence relative to domestic demand will decline. Agriculture will
continue to be the largest source of employment, providing about 17% of total
new employment. The sector also accounts for the largest number of poor
households; an average of 63% of the farm households in Peninsular Malaysia
are in poverty, with the incidence of poverty rising as high as 77% among the
paddy farmers. One of the Government's basic policy objectives is to help
eradicate poverty through programs aimed at productivity increases on existing
smallholdings.
20.       With most of its arable land and much of its labor force devoted to
tree crops and forest products, Malaysia has long been a rice importer.
However, the gap between consumption and production has narrowed significantly
in recent years, principally because of an impressive large-scale irrigation
development program. During the Third Plan, the Government will continue to
give high priority to increasing rice production, in order both to raise farm
incomes and to approach self-sufficiency in rice production.
The State of Selangor
21.       The State of Selangor is in the center of the west coast of Penin-
sular Malaysia, bounded by Negeri Sembilan to the south, the Central Mountain
Range and Pahang to the east, the Bernam River and Perak to the north, and
the Straits of Malacca to the west. It surrounds the administratively
independent Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. The State is now divided into
six administrative districts, of which two (Kuala Selangor and Sabak Bernam)
form the present project area.  Selangor had a population of 1.63 million in
1970, of which 870,000 were in Kuala Lumpur. Selangor is Malaysia's most
prosperous state, due mainly to the large tin mining and manufacturing
industries in the Klang Valley and the concentration of civil service and
commercial employment in the Kuala Lumpur area. However, the two relatively
isolated districts in the northwest of the State are almost entirely dependent
on agriculture, and income levels are well below the rest of the State.



- 6 -
22.       The project area, which covers most of the inhabited area of the
two districts, had a population of 213,000 in 1970, of which almost two-thirds
were Malay, one-fifth Chinese, and 15% Indian. The Chinese population
is largely urban, the Indians chiefly engaged as estate laborers, and the
Malays largely concentrated in smallholder agriculture. The present small-
holder agricultural population of the project area is estimated at 192,000
(32,000 households), most of whom are Malay. About 12,000 smallholder
households are engaged in paddy farming, while the rest cultivate a wide
variety of tree crops. The project area includes nearly 20,000 ha of paddy;
28,500 ha in Sabak Bernam largely planted with smallholder coconuts; and
48,500 ha of tree crops in Kuala Selangor (rubber, coffee, oil palm, coconuts,
and cocoa), evenly divided between smallholdings and estates. The size of
landholdings is small, with paddy farmers averaging 1.5 ha; coconut small-
holders, 2.8 ha; and other tree crop farmers about 2 ha. The average annual
per capita income of paddy farmers in the project is presently about US$235
and per capita incomes in the tree crop areas average US$150. About 65% of
the smallholder families have incomes below the absolute poverty line (see
para. 42).
Irrigation and Drainage Development
23.       Irrigation and drainage works in Malaysia constitute a basic
infrastructure network on which the prosperity of hundreds of thousands of
farmers and town dwellers in coastal areas depends. In this sense water
control is at least as important as roads, railways, and electricity.
The most productive paddy and tree crop areas of the country were developed
from coastal swamp jungles and marshland which required drainage to permit
agricultural development, settlement, construction of transport links, and
alleviation of the once endemic malaria. Channelization of rivers and bunding
of river banks and the sea coast were required to prevent annual heavy flooding of
both crops and towns in monsoon seasons, salt water intrusion, and severe
erosion of the coast in storm seasons. Irrigation was required to expand the
production of the population's basic food, rice. All of these activities fall
within the purview of DID, which began the survey and design of its first
major project (the Krian Irrigation Scheme) in 1880.
24.       In Peninsular Malaysia, rice production is largely confined to
irrigated areas situated in the coastal plains, among which are the project
areas of Muda (Loan 434-MA), Kemubu (Loan 500-MA), North Kelantan (Loan
1294-MA), and the Tanjong Karang irrigation area originally developed from
virgin swamp jungle by DID beginning in 1936. The Bank-assisted schemes
account for the bulk of Malaysia's marketable rice. Nevertheless, despite
the fact that 60% of Peninsular Malaysia's paddy land is now double-cropped,
an average of 11% of the Peninsula's rice requirements, or about 140,000 tons
per annum, have been imported in recent years.
25.       The yields of the region's tree crops are closely correlated with
the adequacy of surface drainage, as high and fluctuating water tables
prevent adequate root development and stimulate weed growth. In a 1974
sample survey of the region's coconut smallholders, close to half the
respondents reported waterlogging of their land, and a significant proportion
of them experienced serious damage to their crops as a result. Many of the
farmers had excavated drains on their holdings, but the majority lacked
collector drains to which their farm drains could be connected.



-7-
Agricultural Supporting Services
26.       The Department of Agriculture (DOA) in the Ministry of Agriculture
is responsible for agricultural extension to rice and coconut smallholders
and is thus the key agricultural support agency in the project area. Extension
services for 32,000 families within the project area are supervised by an
Agricultural Officer, two Agricultural Assistants, and 20 Agricultural Techni-
cians. Most Federal and State DOA units in Selangor are understaffed and ill
equipped. The shortage of personnel, facilities and equipment would be
ameliorated by this project, in conjunction with the proposed National
Extension project.
27.       The State DID is responsible for operating and maintaining drainage
and irrigation systems in the project area, including the existing Tanjong
Karang Irrigation scheme. Although not formally charged with responsibility
for extension, DID field staff frequently must advise paddy farmers on
questions which are closely related to their water management responsibilities.
A substantial increase in the number of field staff and provision for joint
training and extension operations with DOA field staff are necessary to
ensure that DID can continue to perform this important role.
28.       The Selangor Farmers' Organization Authority (FOA), under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture, operates three Farmers'
Development Centers (FDCs) in the project area, and there are 66 private
farmers' cooperatives, organized for rice-milling, revolving credit, and
rubber processing activities. Both FDCs and private cooperatives supply
inputs and planting materials and, in recent years, have become involved in
the marketing and processing. However, they have not yet attained the level
of technical skill or the volume of business required for commercial viability.
Input supply for smallholders, processing of tree crops, and provision of
credit are still largely in the hands of private enterprise, and are likely
to remain so in the foreseeable future. The marketing of rice in the project
is, however, dominated by a Government agency, the National Padi Authority
(LPN).
29.       The Bank Pertanian Malaysia (BPM), also under the Ministry of
Agriculture, provides short-term paddy production credit in the Tanjong
Karang irrigation area as part of a national program for irrigated paddy.
The credit is supplied chiefly in kind and is provided through the FDCs and
cooperatives, which function as local credit centers for BPM. This program
reached a peak of 2,400 paddy farmers (20% of the total) in 1973, but has
since largely retrenched following problems involving the management of two
Farmers' Organizations, to a point where only 280 farmers took credit in
1976. This credit program can be revived and extended to a majority of the
area's paddy farmers, given adequate staffing and controls.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       Project formulation originated in the efforts of Selangor DID to
upgrade existing drainage and irrigation infrastructure and to promote
agricultural improvement in the major agricultural subregion of the State.
Over time it became apparent that only piecemeal drainage and irrigation works



were possible as long as development was dependent on routine annual budget
allocations; it is also essential that the other agricultural agencies be
4,-olvpvp with local DID staff in an integrated extension effort if smallholder
farm practices are to be upgraded in conjunction with full-scale improvement
in agricultural infrastructure. The preparation of this project thus involved
the long-term planning of irrigation works and regional drainage systems on
the engineering side and the working out of a complete operational methodology
of field extension so as to integrate the activities of DOA, BPM, FOA, and
DID at both the State and Federal levels. The project was appraised by the
Bank in March 1977, and loan negotiations were completed in January 1978.
Annex III of this report presents the timetable for key project events, as
well as special conditions for the loan.
Description
31.       The project would improve the productivity and incomes of small-
holder farmers throughout the Northwest Selangor region through provision of
improved drainage and irrigation facilities, access roads, and intensified
agricultural supporting services, and would improve regional drainage systems
with subsequent subsidiary benefits for the region's towns and estates. The
average capital costs of the proposed irrigation works for padi are
US$1,390/ha (US$2,100/family), while costs of tree crop drainage works in
smallholder areas are US$225/ha (US$540/family). Average capital costs of
drainage directly allocable to estate areas are US$33/ha (or US$52/ha if
costs of regional drainage works are allocated pro-rata). Incremental annual
costs of agricultural services at project completion (1983) would amount to
about US$12 per smallholder family. The main components of the project are
summarized below.
32.       Tanjong Karang (Paddy) Irrigation Improvement:  The main canal
delivery system, serving 20,000 ha of paddy land, would be improved by
enlarging the canal and rehabilitating the primary structures. Improvement
and construction of tertiary canals and drains would give each farm direct
access to both canals and drains, permitting the optimal degree of water
control by each farmer and evacuation of five-year frequency storm floods in
72 hours. Equipment required to maintain the system would be provided and
access roads would be constructed within the area.
33.       The proposed structural tertiary canal system, using glass-reinforced
polyester (GRP) flumes, has been completed by DID in one area as a pilot scheme,
with a minimum of engineering or social problems. The GRP system, which would
be installed in some other parts of the present project, was approved by the
Bank for installation in the Lemal Irrigation area under the North Kelantan
Rural Development Project (Loan 1294-MA), after completion in July 1977 of a
one-year accelerated testing program undertaken by DID to confirm the long-term
structural and chemical properties of the system.
34.       Tree Crop Drainage Improvement:  Rehabilitation and improvement of
existing main drainage and flood control systems serving 77,000 ha of tree
crops would be based on evacuating a five-year frequency storm in 48 hours.
In smallholder areas existing main drains would be improved and new main



- 9 -
drains constructed where necessary. Secondary drains would be constructed
with water control devices to hold up the water during low flow periods to
prevent over-drainage. Feeder drains would be constructed to collect water
from farm drains and convey it to the secondary drains. Construction of farm
drains is the responsibility of individual farmers; in many cases the small-
holders have already excavated them, while the remaining tree crop areas in
the region are expected to be covered between 1978 and 1983. In the tree
crop estate areas, project works would consist of the construction and rehab-
ilitation of main drains and the construction of bridges across main drains
to provide access for smallholders and estate laborers.
35.       A total of 167 miles of bunds protecting the entire coastline
of the project area and low-lying areas along the lower reaches of the
major rivers would be upgraded or reconstructed under the project. Tidal
gates, bridges, and gated culverts would also be provided.
36.       Operation and Maintenance Equipment.  Vehicles and excavation and
earth-moving equipment would be purchased under the project to improve the
capability of Selangor DID to operate and maintain completed project works.
The equipment would be allocated to the Sabak Bernam and Kuala Selangor
District DID offices, which are capable of performing routine equipment
maintenance. Major repairs of heavy equipment and fabrication of parts would
be undertaken by DID's central maintenance shop in Ipoh.
37.       Agricultural Supporting Services.  This component would provide an
intensified integrated program of agricultural extension, agricultural credit,
input supply and marketing services to all project area smallholders on a
reliable and timely basis. Achievement of this goal requires the upgrading
and expansion of the field operations of the four key agencies responsible
for promoting smallholder agricultural development in the project area (DOA,
FOA, BPM, and DID), and the integration of their operations. The project
would finance offices, quarters, vehicles, equipment, and training, which
would be required by new staff. To facilitate common operations, a single
project headquarters to be shared by supervisory staff of the agencies would
be constructed under the project. Seven new Farmers' Development Centers
(FDCs) would also be constructed and the three existing FDCs expanded.
Project Coordination and Implementation
38.       All the Federal agencies which would be involved in the implemen-
tation of the project - DID, DOA, FOA, and BPM - are under the jurisdiction
of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). While each agency would be responsible
for implementing specific activities within its jurisdiction, responsibility
for coordinating all project activities would rest with a Project Manager in
MOA. The Project Manager would be guided on policy matters by a Steering
Committee composed of the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture,
the State Secretary of Selangor, and other officials they may nominate.
Such an organization has proved successful in the North Kelantan Rural
Development Project. Appointment of a suitably qualified and experienced
Project Manager, and establishment of the Steering Committee (Draft Loan
Agreement Sections 3.02 and 3.03) would be conditions of effectiveness of the



- 10 -
proposed loan (Draft Legal Agreement Section 5.01). DID would be responsible
for implementing all project civil works. DOA would assume primary responsi-
bility for the organization and operation of the agricultural services
component of the project, and would prepare an agricultural services operations
manual as a guide for field extension staff (Draft Loan Agreement Section
3.08). BPM staff would work closely with FOA staff in reviving and expanding
institutional smallholder credit in the project area. Although the credit
situation at present is far from satisfactory, our experience in the North
Kelantan Rural Development Project has shown that, with a concentrated effort
by BPM and the FDCs, it is possible to increase rapidly the use of credit.
It would be a condition of the loan (Draft Loan Agreement Section 3.07) that
the Government ensure that adequate credit is available through BPM to enable
farmers to purchase recommended inputs. Assurances were also obtained that
all staff required to operate and maintain the project would be appointed
(Draft Loan Agreement Section 3.09).
39.       The project would be implemented over a period of five years, and
would be completed by January 1983. The agricultural support components
provide for a buildup of staff and facilities phased over the implementation
period. Much of the survey work in the paddy area has already been done and,
except for two drainage blocks in Kuala Selangor, all surveying should be
completed in 1978. Construction of irrigation works begun in July 1977
would be completed in 1982. Building of offices, quarters, and FDCs would
begin in February 1978. Construction of drainage works would begin in Sabak
Bernam in May 1978.
Project Cost and Financing
40.       Total project costs are estimated at US$60.0 million, of which
US$26.0 million (43%) would be foreign exchange.  Cost estimates for civil
works are based on recent contracts for similar works in Malaysia. All
incremental operating costs for the project period, including salaries, have
been included for the agricultural services component. Cost estimates for
equipment and vehicles,ire based on recent suppliers' quotations, net of
taxes and duties. Physical contingencies of 15% on construction costs and
10% on equipment have been included. All cost estimates have been adjusted
to February 1978 levels. Expected price increases due to inflation of 9% in
1978-79 and 8% thereafter have been included for civil works, land, and
operating and personnel costs. For equipment, price increases of 7.5% in
1978-79 and 7% thereafter have been allowed. Expected price increases amount
to 27% of base costs plus physical contingencies.
41.       The proposed Bank loan of US$26 million would finance the foreign
exchange requirement of the project. It is proposed that the loan would
finance retroactively about US$500,000 for the installation of a GRP flume
tertiary canal system on approximately 1,000 ha; total costs of this work,
which commenced after completion of appraisal in May 1977, are estimated at
US$1.1 million. As this is a Federal project, all local costs would be borne
by GOM throughout the implementation period of the project. Activities
falling under constitutional State jurisdiction, such as operation and
maintenance of the completed irrigation and drainage works, would thereafter
be financed through normal GOM procedures as necessary (see Draft Loan
Agreement Section 4.05).

Cost Recovery
42.       The overwhelming majority (over 85%) of project area smallholders
subsist on annual incomes below the national relative poverty line (US$340 per
capita), while over 65% of the beneficiary population receive incomes below
the estimated absolute poverty line (US$215 per capita). Among the smallholders,
the average income of the tree crop farmers (US$150) is substantially below
that of the paddy farmers (US$235). Despite these low incomes, smallholders
pay drainage and irrigation rates which recover all or most of the operation
and maintenance (O&M) costs, and which are gradually raised as O&M costs rise.
In addition to these charges most of the paddy farmers are legally liable to
pay the Islamic paddy production tithe (zakat) to the Selangor Department of
Religious Affairs, which uses the receipts to finance the religious school
system, teachers' salaries, welfare expenses, and maintenance of mosques.
Estimated zakat payments average US$69/ha, and are projected to rise an
increment of US$40/ha with project induced yield increases, far in excess of
incremental O&M costs. It should be noted that O&M of irrigation
facilities in Malaysia is totally divorced from irrigation charge collections,
that irrigation O&M is financed out of general revenues supported by a highly
efficient and generally progressive tax system, and that the level of O&M is
not constrained by a shortage of funds. In view of these factors and the
income level of smallholder beneficiaries, the present structure and level of
charges are considered acceptable. Assurances were obtained (Section 4.04
Draft Loan Agreement) that the Selangor State Government would continue to
collect irrigation and drainage charges whose level would be determined
taking into account O&M and capital costs, incentives to farmers, farmers'
ability to pay, and other taxes and charges imposed upon them; and that the
Government would exchange views with the Bank from time to time on the level
of these charges.
43.       The estates in the project area pay drainage rates set to cover O&M
costs as calculated by Selangor DID. They also pay export duties, averaging
10% of the value of rubber and oil palm production, and quit rents (property
taxes) to the Selangor State Government. In addition, all estates in the
project area belong to registered private companies liable to pay the standard
Malaysian company tax equivalent to 45% of net profits. A financial projection
of the incremental tax payments of the 40 estates in the project area which
would be associated with incremental production due to the project indicates
that the net present value of such incremental taxes far exceeds the investment
costs of drainage works in estate areas. The cost recovery index in these
terms is over 430%. Finally, all dividend income received by owners or share-
holders of the estate companies is again subject to personal income tax at
rates of up to 55%.  In sum, the drainage works benefitting estates would not
constitute a burden on Malaysian public finances.
Production and Marketing
44.       Average paddy yields in Tanjong Karang would increase substantially,
with a total incremental output of 46,000 tons of paddy, equivalent to
30,000 tons of milled rice. The incremental paddy production would be
entirely marketed in Malaysia, which is projected to be a net importer of



- 12 -
rice at least through 1990. Most of the incremental production would be
milled and marketed by LPN which purchases paddy from farmers at farmgate
prices roughly equivalent to current world market prices.
45.       The tree crop drainage component would provide an intensive drainage
system serving most of the tree crop smallholdings directly, which would
provide for the first time a reliable degree of control over the depth of
the water table in the tree crop areas. The main drainage systems, river
canalization works, and coastal bunds would also provide flood protection to
smallholder and estate tree crop areas, as well as provide outlets for
numerous internal drainage systems constructed by the estates. The results
would be the opening up of 3,800 ha of previously unused land and yield
increases of from 10 to 25% on existing holdings. Copra production would
increase by about 4,500 tons by 1990, or roughly 3% of present production;
cocoa production would increase by 2,000 tons, or one-third of current
exports; and palm oil and rubber output by 14,000 tons and 1,200 tons
respectively, each less than one half of one percent of Malaysian exports.
Marketing and processing of the projected incremental output of tree crops
would present no problems. Malaysia is the world's largest exporter of
natural rubber and oil palm, and efficient private bulking and milling
facilities serving both estates and smallholders are available throughout the
region. The country has also long exported coconut oil, and several private
coconut oil mills operate in the region. The initiation of cocoa production
by estates along the Perak and Selangor coasts opened up international
marketing channels, which have now been extended to reach the smallholders
by a network of small middlemen, who process the beans and sell the dried and
fermented product to international agency houses. The project's incremental
output of Liberica coffee would be largely destined for the domestic market;
domestic demand for this variety is strong, and an effective private marketing
and processing network already exists for this commodity. The Federal
Agricultural Marketing Authority is active in the processing and marketing of
smallholder copra and cocoa in the project area, serving to ensure fair treat-
ment of smallholders by private wholesalers and processors.
46.       Most of the smallholders have enough experience with the crops they
are growing to be able to take advantage of the improved infrastructure systems
through changes in cultivation practices and input usage. However, the inte-
grated agricultural extension effort provided by the project would insure
quicker and fuller use of improved facilities.
Procurement
47.       Project irrigation works, totalling US$28.3 million, would be
implemented through five ICB contracts. Drainage works would be implemented
through seven contracts averaging US$2.5 million which, because of their small
size and dispersed location, would not attract international interest. These
would be awarded after competitive bidding advertised locally. Buildings and
facilities (costing a total of about US$2.7 million) would also be tendered
locally. Earth works and fabrication of drainage gates amounting to US$2.2 mil-
lion would be executed by force account. The local contracting industry is
extremely competitive and strong, and local tendering is well managed and



- 13 -
publicized. Bids would be accepted from foreign contractors who wish to
participate, and no preference margins would be utilized in the evaluation
and award of civil works contracts.
48.       Equipment and vehicles (US$2.0 million) would be procured under
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
A 15% preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty if lower, would be
extended to local manufacturers of these items. Small off-the-shelf items,
costing less than US$20,000 each and limited to a total of US$500,000, would
be procured through normal Government procedures, which are acceptable to the
Bank.
Disbursements
49.       Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% against foreign
exchange expenditures on all directly imported equipment, vehicles and
training; 100% of the ex-factory cost of items manufactured locally; and 80%
of the total cost of locally procured items. Disbursements for all civil
works would equal 48% of total costs. It is expected that disbursements
would be completed by August 31, 1983.
Benefits and Risks
50.       The expected value of the economic rate of return of the overall
project, assuming effective implementation of the agricultural services
component, is 21%. This estimate is a composite of the estimated return of
the Tanjong Karang irrigation component (19%) and the tree crop drainage
component (22%). The effects of the tree crop drainage component were further
segregated into costs and benefits primarily related to either smallholder or
estate areas. This analysis indicates that the return on drainage invest-
ments in the smallholder areas would be 15% and in the estate areas, 30%.
The difference would be due to the higher sunk cost of existing works (largely
on-farm drains and roads) constructed by the estates themselves, the higher
sunk cost of existing stands of estate tree crops, and the higher standards
of upkeep and labor management. Almost all project works would be justified
on the basis of effects on smallholder production alone, however. The above
rates of return do not include possible project effects on increases in areas
planted of various tree crops, on rates of conversion between varieties of
coconuts planted, nor on the feasibility of proposed settlement schemes in
waste lands which could be drained and developed after project completion.
51.       The project is designed to raise the incomes of 17,000 families
(100,000 people), the bulk of the very poor in the project area, above the
absolute poverty line, and to place those currently living on incomes above
the poverty line more securely and permanently outside the absolute poverty
group. Per capita incomes in most of the paddy areas would rise from about
US$235 to US$296 in constant terms by 1987, while income in the tree crop
areas should rise from US$150 to between US$378 and US$616, depending on the
choice of primary crops and intercrops.



- 14 -
52.       The major risk associated with achievement of project benefits
involves the uncertainties associated with the implementation of the inte-
grated agricultural supporting services system. With a 50% reduction in the
anticipated yield effects of the proposed training and visit system of
extension, the expected value of the economic rate of return of the Tanjong
Karang irrigation component would decline from 19% to 16%. Smaller risks
would be associated with the drainage component, as the starting base of tree
crop yields in the region is quite low, the projected incremental yield
increases are quite small, and the required changes in production techniques
are quite simple. However, the implementing agencies have already begun to
organize the proposed field extension system in a pilot irrigation block, in
anticipation of expanding the system throughout the region in step with infra-
structure improvements. Furthermore, the proposed system has been initiated
with considerable success under the North Kelantan Rural Development Project
(1294-MA), providing a training ground for Selangor staff and more importantly
a demonstration that the training and visit extension system is feasible in
Malaysia. Finally, the National Extension Project (Loan 1493-MA) would
provide the Federal and Selangor Departments of Agriculture the general
organizational support and strengthening they would require to direct and
manage effectively the proposed extension program in Northwest Selangor.
Environmental Effects
53.       The project would not greatly affect the regional environment, as
most of the project works would merely intensify water control systems
which have been established for decades. Drainage works would reduce local
mosquito habitats and facilitate ongoing malaria and dengue fever control
programs. The volume of drainage into the sea would remain essentially
unchanged and should have no effect on marine fish or shellfish. The Tanjong
Karang peat swamp plays an important role as a water storage reservoir for
the paddy area. Assurances were obtained (Section 4.03 Draft Loan Agreement)
that the swamp would be protected as a forest area, and that the portion of
the swamp which serves as a catchment for the irrigation area would not be
drained, logged, or developed in a manner which would jeopardize the supply
of water for irrigation purposes.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
55.       Features of special interest in the Loan Agreement are described in
Section III, Annex III.



- 15 -
56.       It is an additional condition of effectiveness that a suitably
qualified and experienced Project Manager would be appointed and a Steering
Committee would be established to advise the Project Manager.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 599   Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of May 23, 1969;
Effective Date: September 16, 1969; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
The Project provides US$8.8 million for the construction of
technical, vocational, agricultural and general secondary schools and one
teacher training college. All project institutions have been completed and
are in satisfactory operation. US$1.9 million of project funds still remain
undisbursed because of lower than expected project costs and the shift in the
exchange rate. The Bank has accepted the proposal of the Borrower to utilize
this balance to finance additional project items transferred from the Second
Education Project (Loan 810-MA). The disbursement of the balance is expected
to be completed very shortly.
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Prolect; US$16.1 Million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Effective Date: August 24, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Work has been satisfactorily completed on the new berths at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan. Slow progress in completing the access road to
Sandakan delayed full use of the latter facilities until mid-1977. The new
headquarters building has been occupied. The total and foreign exchange
costs of the works are now estimated to be US$47.1 million and US$24.4 million
respectively, about 1.5 times the appraisal estimate. Settlement of a large
outstanding claim will delay the final account and the closing date of the
loan has been postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1978.
Loan 799  Railway Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of February 11. 1972;
Effective Date:  April 17, 1972; Closing Date:  March 31, 1978
All equipment and materials have been received. Malayan Railway (MR)
operations showed an all-round improvement during 1976 and 1977 although some
key efficiency indicators were still below acceptable standards, especially
those pertaining to locomotive and rolling stock maintenance. As a result of
the successful marketing drive, freight traffic during 1976 registered a recov-
ery for the first time in five years and increased by 24% over 1975 levels.
Passenger traffic continues to grow modestly. These results produced MR's first
annual profit since 1962. A substantial wage increase effective July 1, 1977
imposed a new strain on MR's financial recovery, but subsequent tariff increases
and economies in expediture should produce a break-even result in 1977 and
enable a profit to be earned in 1978 and thereafter.

Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of April 5,
1972; Effective Date:  July 7, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
The project is financing the establishment of a curriculum develop-
ment center, science schools for the University of Penang, vocational schools,
and an educational television system. Implementation has improved but is
still about two years behind schedule mainly due to delays in the appointment
of consultant architects, in the approval of the designs and the campus plan,
and in the preparation of documents by the Public Works Department.  Staff
shortages in the Project Unit have also contributed to the delays. The delays
are reflected in slow disbursements, but the problem is currently being
addressed by the Bank and the Government. Project cost overruns are expected
to be financed by the Government.
Loan No. 851   Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project (Highway I);
US$16.0 Million Loan of July 20, 1972; Effective
Date: September 20, 1972; Closing Date: April 30. 1978
The project is designed to improve the transport facilities between
Kuala Lumpur and the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. It consists of improvement
of about six miles of Federal Route 2, including detailed engineering, widening
of the road, construction of interchanges and cycle tracks, and relocation of
services. Civil works are about 11 months behind schedule, due to initial short-
comings in the contractor's project management. These problems have since been
overcome and implementation is being accelerated. The project also includes
a transport study for metropolitan Kuala Lumpur (completed), a national road
maintenance study (draft final report completed), and detailed engineering of
about 137 miles of Federal Route 1 (completed).
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Effective Date: June 21, 1973; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
The civil works component continues to make progress. Out of 571
buildings, 127 have now been completed and another 101 are under construction.
Tenders have been awarded for an additional 17 buildings. Until recently,
the most delayed construction component has been the provision of 31 Family
Planning Clinics. This has now been corrected and of the 31 clinics two are
now in the stage of preparation of tender documents. Preparation of layout
site plans has been started for another 12 clinics. The National Family
Planning Board (NFPB) has selected a supplier for the computer to handle the
management information system; a draft contract is being prepared. A review
of the project was carried out by an external team of experts in April 1977.
Program performance in 1976 was even better than in 1975 when the number
of new acceptors was the highest since 1971.

Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;
US$25.0 Million Loan of March 30, 1973: Effective
Date:  June 22, 1973; Closing Date:  December 31, 1981
The project (including the First and Second Jengka Triangle Land
Settlement Projects which have been completed) consists of clearing the forest,
planting 62,000 acres of oil palm and 35,000 acres of rubber, and settling
10,000 families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). The Federal Land
Development Authority (FELDA), responsible for the execution of the projects,
operates efficiently, keeping high standards of planting and maintenance.
Delays of about six months in the planting program and in infrastructure develop-
ment will result in similar delays in housing and settler intake. Standards of
agricultural development under the project are generally satisfactory.
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project consists of the expansion of water supply facilities
to meet increasing demands in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley area. The
first part of the project, comprising ordinary water works, was virtually
completed in 1976, practically on schedule and within the cost estimate, and most
of the works are in operation. The contract for the construction of the Langat
Dam was awarded late, in mid-1976, but construction is now progressing satisfac-
torily. The dam is expected to be completed by the end of 1979, more than two
years behind schedule, and will cost about 25% more than originally estimated.
However, no difficulties are foreseen in raising the additional funds required.
The Selangor State Water Department, which is responsible for the Project,
performs well in spite of staffing problems. Its financial management still
needs some strengthening.
Loan No. 931   Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of August 22,
1973; Effective Date: October 25, 1973; Closing Date:
March 31, 1980
Overall, the project is about 70% complete. Many of the earlier
problems (land acquisition, eviction of squatters from right-of-way, poor
contract management) which have delayed progress significantly have been
largely overcome. The Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Expressway was opened in October
1977. Consulting services for various studies and detailed engineering have
been completed. Construction costs have escalated sharply because of rapid
inflation, and the total project cost is now estimated to be US$46 million,
compared to an appraisal estimate of US$37 million.

Loan No. 967   Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of
February 27, 1974; Effective Date: May 16, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of planting 65,000 acres
of oil palm and settling 4,400 families in the state of Johore. The agri-
cultural development is progressing satisfactorily in line with the appraisal
estimates. Delays in road development, due in part to coordination problems
between FELDA and Kejora (a regional development authority) have delayed
settler intake by up to two years. However, improvements are noticeable since
construction of roads is now being contracted to private contractors, and
since responsibility for coordination has been unified under the Ministry of
Lands and Regional Development.
Loan No. 973   Western Johore Agricultural Development Project; US$45.0 Million
Loan of April 5, 1974; Effective Date: August 14, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project includes the construction of integrated drainage systems,
roads, and agricultural installations required to accelerate agricultural
development in the smallholder tree crop region along the west coast of the
state of Johore. The project is still nearly two years behind the original
schedule due to substantial redesign of project works in 1974 and an across-
the-board Government hiring freeze in 1975-76. However, all major drainage
basin systems have been designed and 10 of 11 basin contracts have been
tendered. Work is essentially completed for force account works, agricultural
development centers, and one basin contract, and a second basin contract is
considerably advanced. Agricultural developments in the project area have
begun to demonstrate the beneficial effects of improved major drainage, in
terms of tree crop replanting and accelerated intercropping.
Loan No. 974   Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of April 5,
1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project assists the Government to develop technical training,
preservice teacher training, and an East Malaysia educational television
system. Implementation is about 12 months behind schedule due to earlier
delays in the selection of sites for the Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs).
Contracts have been awarded for 8 out of 13 project institutions. Con-
struction began in early 1976 and most of the project institutes are scheduled
for completion in late 1978. The estimated total project cost is about 25%
over the appraisal estimate.  The Project Unit is functioning satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1031 Sixth Power Proiect; US$45.0 Million Loan of July 25, 1974;
Effective Date: October 22, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,

Loan No. 1178 Seventh Power Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of December 17,
1975; Effective Date: March 10, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981
Progress of the Sixth Power Project (275 kV transmission lines
from Temengor to Papan and from Port Dickson to Malacca and extension
of transmission and distribution system) and the Seventh Power Project (the
Prai Power Station extension, 3 x 120 MW) is generally satisfactory.
Based on the Bank's recommendation, the Government has agreed to
apply fuel surcharges to commercial and industrial consumers since mid-1975
and to provide NEB with equity of about US$200 million on a year by year
basis to bridge NEB's financial gap. Maximum demand and energy sales for
FY77 were 975-MW and 5,253 GWH respectively (15% above FY76 levels).
Loan No. 1044 Keratong Land Settlement Project; US$36.0 Million Loan of
October 3, 1974; Effective Date:  January 9, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of planting 55,000
acres of oil palm, settling 3,400 families, constructing two palm oil mills
and establishing two urban settlements. The agricultural development is
progressing satisfactorily. However, progress of urban development and of
phasing in nonagricultural activities is still behind schedule. Lack of
progress in the construction of village infrastructure and housing has caused
delays in settler intake. The supervision mission's findings and recommen-
dations for corrective measures were transmitted to the implementing agency,
the Pahang Tenggara Development Authority and the Ministry of Land and
Regional Development under which control of regional authorities and land
development agencies have recently been unified.
Loan No. 1115 Agricultural Research and Extension Project; US$28.5 Million
Loan of May 30, 1975; Effective Date: October 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Project implementation continues to fall further behind schedule.
However, the major bottleneck (terms and conditions of employment of inter-
nationally recruited scientists) was overcome with the Government's approval
of "Terms and Conditions of Employment" on August 19, 1976 and acceptance
by the Bank on September 22, 1976. Project implementation has also been
constrained by three changes in Directors since appraisal. However, the
appointment of the former General Manager of the Muda Agricultural Development
Authority (MADA) as Director General in June 1977 gives promise for the dynamic
leadership required to strengthen and expand research activities under the
project. This is the first indication that the project could show some
progress. Action is also being taken to expedite procurement under local
procedures and disbursements have started.

Loan No. 1213 Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project; US$21.5 Million Loan of
March 11, 1976; Effective Date: August 25, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981
The project is the first stage (1976-81) of a 30-year master plan
for the sewerage development in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. It
includes extension of sewers (about 70 miles of trunk and lateral sewers)
to serve an additional population of 200,000 in Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory;
establishment of a separate Sewerage Department within Kuala Lumpur City Hall
with its own finance and accounting system; engineering and management con-
sultants services; staff training; and preparation of pollution control
measures for the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. The project is in its
initial stage. It has started about six months behind schedule because of
delays in engaging consultants but can be completed on time. Work is
proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1214 Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$26.0 Million
Loan of March 11, 1976; Effective Date: November 11, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The main objective of the project is to increase the efficiency
of the transport system in Kuala Lumpur. Public transport services will
be improved while the use of private cars will be restrained. Although the
project is essentially an urban transport project, it also contains important
components and initiatives in other urban sectors such as squatter upgrading
and development of new low-cost settlements. The main components are: (a)
about 7 miles of new roads and 10 miles of road improvements; (b) traffic
engineering and control schemes; (c) sites and services for about 1,400
households and 150 businesses; (d) upgrading of infrastructure services for
about 2,100 households; and (e) feasibility and engineering studies for a
Kuantan Urban Development Project and for a national sites and services pro-
gram. Related policy measures include the introduction of minibus services,
traffic priorities for high-occupancy vehicles and area road pricing.
Progress is generally satisfactory.
Loan No. 1294 North Kelantan Rural Development Project; US$21.0 Million
Loan of July 21, 1976; Effective Date: October 28, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project includes the Lemal Irrigation component which will
provide drainage and flood protection to 30,000 gross ha of farmland and
intensive irrigation to 12,000 net ha of paddy; construction of 190 km of
rural roads throughout North Kelantan; 15 small irrigation schemes serving
1,300 ha of paddy; construction, rehabilitation and equipping of 25 Farmers
Development Centers (FDCs); and establishment of an effective agricultural
extension service for Kelantan. The project start-up period has seen rapid
implementation of the FDC component, good progress on the agricultural
extension component with planning, staffing and preparation of equipment
specifications proceeding on schedule,and a welcome degree of cooperation
between the Farmers Organization Authority and the Kelantan Department of
Agriculture in joint planning of agricultural service buildings and field
operations. Some delay in engineering of roads and irrigation works has
occurred due to delays in approval of staff, but this problem appears to have
been largely resolved.

Loan No. 1329 Fourth Education Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of
November 18, 1976; Effective Date: January 14, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project is designed to improve the quality of primary schooling
and to redress existing imbalances in the provision of primary education
by providing additional classrooms in poverty areas, facilities for teacher
training and one teacher training college in Sarawak. The project includes
three new Industrial Training Centers and expansion of two existing ones. It
includes also a study on community education in preparation of government
investment in nonformal education. Project implementation began in January
1977 and appears satisfactory.  Problems in the processing of disbursements
have been resolved.  Shortage of staff in the Project Unit is being remedied
by the Government.  Disbursements are expected to start on schedule in the
first half of FY78.
Loan No. 1376  Third Highway Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of April 4, 1977;
Effective Date: May 4, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The main objective of the project is to improve the highway network
in the East Malaysian State of Sabah through the reconstruction and upgrading
of priority links and the development of the Public Works Department's
maintenance capacity. A further objective is to protect road investmerts in
Peninsular Malaysia through a pilot road maintenance and pavement strengthening
program in three states. The project also includes an urban study of Kota
Kinabalu in Sabah and a transport/railway study in Peninsular Malaysia. The
project is still in the early stages; of implementation. While good progress
has been made in implementing the road program in Peninsular Malaysia, some
delays have occurred in getting the Sabah road components of the project
underway. Construction works on the East and West Coast Roads in Sabah
started in July 1977. The consulting services for the studies are generally
on schedule.
