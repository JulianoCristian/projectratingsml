objective of the Animal Health\n            Services Rehabilitation Project is the rehabilitation of\n            Kenya's animal health services, and the provision of a\n            viable and sustainable institutional framework for animal\n            health services which can be maintained over the long-term.\n            The project will also aim to introduce gradually full cost\n            recovery for animal health services over the life of the\n            project.  The project will provide support to:  (i) develop\n            specific management systems for the Department of Veterinary\n            Services, and (ii) train the staff of the Department of\n            Veterinary Services to apply the newly designed management\n            systems.  In addition, it will (iii) support disease and\n            pest control activities; (iv) rehabilitate veterinary\n            laboraties and support livestock disease surveillance\n            activities.  Finally, the proposed project will support (v)\n            the National Tick Control Program; (vi) clinical services;\n            and (vii) pilot trials for developing cheaper methods of\n            control of tsetse flies and ticks.  The project will benefit\n            pastoralists and smallholders who own 90 percent of the\n            livestock of Kenya."}, "docdt": "1986-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
