Project for Kenya was unsatisfactory. The project\n            did not achieve all of its objectives, it impact on\n            institutional development was modest, sustainability is\n            unlikely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, simplification of project design and\n            management may not necessarily produce better results, and\n            adequate attention should be paid to the overall\n            macroeconomic context and the specific ecological and\n            socio-economic setting in which the project is to be\n            implemented. Second, tse-tse trapping and tick control pilot\n            trials were successful because they were participatory and\n            demand-driven, and an appropriate institution was assigned\n            the task, rather than the trials being handled through the\n            public sector. Third, given the promising signs of\n            GOK's commitment and support to the privatization\n            process with regards to animal health services, future\n            projects should aim at supporting efforts in this direction,\n            rather than diffusing resources to support a variety of\n            activities. Finally, the financial burden imposed on the\n            recurrent budget of the Borrower by the maintenance and\n            operating costs related to public sector capital investments\n            should be evaluated up-front as well as during project implementation."}, "docdt": "1994-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
