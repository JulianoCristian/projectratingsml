Some lessons learned included: 1) to sustain\n            outcomes in a situation where new concepts and processes are\n            introduced, the focus on institutional development needs to\n            be maintained during the project and beyond. The risk to dam\n            safety in this project remains moderate or\n            substantial/considerable due to relatively lower attention\n            to institutional development vis-a-vis physical activities\n            during implementation and inadequate follow-up thereafter;\n            2) new regulatory institutions require technical expertise\n            and adequate operating budgets to function in a capable and\n            independent manner. In this project, shortage of\n            experienced/qualified staff and inadequate operating budgets\n            contributed to under-performance of the dam safety\n            regulatory unit; 3) building dam safety institutions can be\n            a long process when it requires major changes in\n            organizational attitudes, establishing new work methods, and\n            upgrading technical expertise. In such cases, the Bank\n            should consider an extended commitment through a sequence of\n            projects or through adaptable program lending (APL); and 4)\n            new techniques and equipment should be tailored to the\n            existing level of capacity; facilities and funds for ongoing\n            maintenance; and site security. Most of the relatively\n            sophisticated instrumentation installed at dams under this\n            project has deteriorated for lack of maintenance."}, "docdt": "2009-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
