As in the\n            case of India, the introduction of dam safety institutions\n            creates requirements for unfamiliar technical specialist\n            skills, a need for both a technical and regulatory\n            management focus and coordination between the national level\n            and the now functionally-independent provinces. Although\n            many institutional teething problems were encountered and\n            substantial legal and performance upgrading is still\n            required, a strong start has been made in the institutional\n            area.  Lessons of general and technical significance of this\n            project are:   1) There is a need for realistic project\n            preparation and design. 2) The project design should have\n            given more emphasis to initial effective capacity-building\n            before commencing the Basic Dam Safety Facility (BDSF) and\n            Remedial Works components. 3) The determination of\n            hydrological criteria for Probably Maximum Precipitation\n            (PMPs) in different climates takes time and requires special\n            study.  4) Engineering of dams is a specialized subject.\n            Appropriate quality assurance arrangements need to be in\n            place through an improvement of implementing agency\n            management or the use of proper technical assistance with\n            adequate powers and authority (task concept) to manage the\n            design and construction phase. Frequent rotation of\n            engineers and technicians involved in dams should be\n            avoided. Those staff must have adequate training and\n            experience. Training in dam safety should be\n            institutionalized so that all engineers working with dams\n            undergo specific personnel capacity-building training. 5) It\n            is important to establish priorities for remedial works\n            investments, and appropriate risk analysis needs to be used,\n            based on public hazard and dam safety condition criteria. 6)\n            The preparation team should have been instructed not to\n            accept the MPW Inspectorate General as the source for\n            technical audit, as this unit is a financial auditor and\n            incapable of undertaking technical audits, even with\n            technical assistance. 7) A model Operation and Maintenance\n            Manual incorporating dam safety considerations needs to be\n            prepared early in the project for guidance."}, "docdt": "2003-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
