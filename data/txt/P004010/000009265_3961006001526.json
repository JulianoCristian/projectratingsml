The project includes the following main components:\n            (a) support for the recently established Dam Safety\n            Commission (DSC) and Dam Safety Unit (DSU) at central\n            government level and Dam Monitoring Units (DMU) at central\n            and local dam owners' levels; (b) provision of basic\n            dam safety facilities at dams where at present such\n            facilities are lacking; and (c) implementation of remedial\n            works at dams with safety deficiencies.
