solid base for its expansion, especially in rural areas;\n            (ii) in technical education, the project will provide\n            increased capacity and quality of teacher training through\n            the proposed new college enrolling 340 students; (iii) in\n            vocational training, additional construction and equipment\n            at existing centers will allow increased enrollments and\n            improved training quality, and increase the supply of\n            skilled workers for the modern industrial sector; and (iv)\n            in university-level training, proposed institutions will\n            help meet Senegal's critical need for qualified\n            technical and managerial manpower through their annual\n            output of about 40 agriculturalists and 40 business managers."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
