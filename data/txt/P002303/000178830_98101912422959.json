designed to achieve the following objectives: (i) in\n            primary education, the project will provide increased\n            quality and allow preparation of cost-reduction measures to\n            help establish a solid base for its expansion, especially in\n            rural areas; (ii) in technical education, the project will\n            provide increased capacity and quality of teacher training\n            through the proposed new college enrolling 340 students;\n            (iii) in vocational training, additional construction and\n            equipment at existing centers will allow increased\n            enrollments and improved training quality, and increase the\n            supply of skilled workers for the modern industrial sector;\n            and (iv) in university-level training, proposed institutions\n            will help meet Senegal's critical need for qualified\n            technical and managerial manpower through their annual\n            output of about 40 agriculturalists and 40 business managers."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
