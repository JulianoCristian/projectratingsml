It would be located about 45 miles\n            northeast of Cochabama and would consist of a 34 MW\n            hydroelectric plant using tailrace water from the Corani\n            plant, a 4 mile transmission line to connect at the Corani\n            substation to the existing power system, and engineering\n            services.
