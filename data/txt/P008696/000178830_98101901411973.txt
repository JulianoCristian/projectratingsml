FLOOD RECOVERY PROJECT
EVALUATION OF FLOOD DAMAGES
I. INTRODUCTION
During the first ten days of July 1975, serious floods caused ex-
tensive economic and other damage in Romania. On July 10, Romania requested
assistance from the Bank, which organized an interdisciplinary mission to
survey flood damages and explore the possibilities of a flood rehabilitation
project. The mission arrived in Bucharest on July 21 with Mr. Munir Benjenlc,
Vice-President of the Bank, and worked in Romania until July 30. This report
on evaluation of flood damages has been prepared by Messrs. Sadove (mission
chief), Mulligan, Niaz, Kohli, Haile-Mariam and Noon who participated in the
mission.
1.02      While Romania has experienced a series of relatively local floods
in recent years, the 1975 floods were more widespread and caused more serious
economic damage than any earlier floods.  Five major river basins with con-
tiguous headwaters near the junction between the eastern and southern
Carpathian mountains were seriously affected as described in Chapter II.
There was also some flood damage along the Danube and in a number of other
river basins. Flash floods in the upper reaches of each river basin and on
the Transylvanian plateau, and numerous landslides, caused extensive damage
to industry and transport. Low-lying agricultural land further down in the
basins was innundated with resulting damage to crops, agricultural assets and
some industry. Rain and flood water collected in relatively flat and poorly
drained agricultural land between river basins and also caused extensive
damage to crops.
1.03      Total losses directly attributed to the floods in agriculture, in-
dustry, transport and flood protection works have been estimated at about
$793 million. In addition to these quantified economic losses, about 1,300
villages, 65 towns, and portions of Bucharest were flooded, where there was
extensive damage to housing and public facilities and sixty-two people lost
their lives. The Bank mission also reviewed the Government's program for
flood recovery, and that review has provided the basis for the Flood
Recovery Project for which a lending of US$60 million is proposed.

II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.CG      Romania is endowed with abundant natural resources, a good climate,
fertLhe soils, and an ample sunply of "and relative to the population of some
21 million people.  0' the total land area of 237,500 km2, about 15 million
na (63%) are suitable fcr agriculture and about 6.3 million ha (27%) are
covere2 by forests. About 9.7 million ha are cultivated each year with field
crops, 4.5 million ha are covered by permanent pastures and meadows and the
remaining area is under vineyards and orchards.  The Carpathian mountains,
with elevations exceeding 2,500 m, dormiinate the central part of the country;
their three distinct ranges - the eastern, the southern and the western -
encircle the relatively flat area of the Transylvania region. Almost all
Romanian rivers originate from the Carpathian mountains, flowing in all
directions and eventually draining into the Danube River, which forms
Romania's southern boundary with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.  Although there
is considerable variation in rainfall ranging from around 95 mm to 280 mm
between March and June (a critical period for cereal growth), annual levels
above 1,000 mm and nearly 1,500 mm are common in the mountains. Despite
risks of seasonal drought and annual flooding in various parts of the coun-
try, water resources abound with many low-lying valleys which are drained
by numerous rivers and basins.
2.02      Romania's continental climate is influenced from the north by the
polar winds and from the south by the milder Mediterranean climate. Persist-
ent dry summer wind from the south, however, can give the southeast severe
drought with resulting crop failure. Considerable variations in the climate
within the country are masked by the average figures, which indicate a mean
annual temperature of 110C in the Danube plains and the Black sea region and
6'C in the mountainous areas. Almost the entire country receives snow during
winter.
B. The River Basins
2.03      The water resources of the countrv are dominated by the Danube, and
virtually all the country's rivers are tributaries to the Danube (Annex 1,
Table 1). Aniono the most important rivers are the western (the Somes, the
Mures), the scuthern (the Jiu, the Olt, the Arges and the Ialomita) and the
eastern i       èhe et and the Prut) groups (Map 11833).  These rivers together
d-rain abou. 74,% `72,000 kmi2) of the Romanian part of the Danube catchment.
The Romarnian rivers are short in length flowing through narrow and steep
valleys; most tributaries do not exceed 200 km and the major stems vary from
303 kr-; to 500 kim, and are liable to flash floods during periods of heavy rain-
fI_.I   '-he si-uation worsens rapidly if a storm covers a large mountainous



- 3 -
area causing the flood peaks of the tributaries of a river basin to synchronize
and contiguous river basins to be flooded simultaneously. Thus Romania's
substantial water resources must be regulated to modify the effects of season-
al and sudden changes in discharge, and to ensure regular supplies of drinking
and industrial water to the towns and cities. The cost of such infrastructure
is increased by the lack of large lakes to act as natural reservoirs and
regulators.
2.04      Systematic hydrologic observations on the rivers were started in
1924, although observations on some rivers date back to 1870. The hydro-
logic network is very extensive with several hundred rainfall and discharge
observation stations. In each major basin, as many as 70 to 80 discharge
observation stations are maintained, where daily measurements are made.
2.05      The Danube.  The catchment area of the Danube lies in 12 countries
of central and eastern Europe and amounts to 813,000 km2 (Annex 1, Table 2),
of which 28% lies in Romania.  The normal flow in the Danube varies from an
average high of about 13,000 m3/sec to a low of about 3,000 m3/sec. The high-
est discharge ever recorded in the Danube at Turnu Severin (upper reach),
Oltenita (middle reach) and Braila (lower reach) corresponded to about 100
year flood of 16,500 m3/sec (in 1940), 18,000 m3/sec (in 1897) and 20,000 m3/
sec (in 1897) respectively. The high flow in the Danube generally corresponds
to the periods of snow melt and any intensive rain storms that may cover a
substantial portion of its catchment. Normally, the high flow period extends
from mid-March to mid-June, after which the flow starts receding quickly.
Low flows occur during September and October. Over 1,000 km of levees along
the left bank have been constructed during the past 70 years and are designed
to contain a 100-year flood. They protect industrial and urban areas and im-
portant agricultural lands from river floods. Before a high flood enters the
Romanian part of the Danube, adequate warning is available to organize a
strict watch on the levees. As a result, the Romanians are able to identify
and repair weak points in the levees before they become major problems.
Strict maintenance standards and adequate warning has reduced serious flooding
along the Danube. Future projects planned for the Danube include hydroelectric
and irrigation schemes, which will not include any flood control storage, but
will involve substantial raising of levees along the river.
The Rivers Particularly Important in the 1975 Flood
2.06      The Mures River, has a catchment of 27,800 km2, and concentrations
of population and economic activity at many locations along its course. It is
a particularly important river which is subject to significant flooding. It
originates in Transylvania (central Romania) and flows westward until it joins
the Tisa (a major tributary of the Danube) in Hungary. Two of its main tri-
butaries join the Mures at Alba lulia. Although the normal maximum annual
flow at this location is only about 500 m3/sec, a peak of 2,450 m3/sec was
recorded in 1970.



- 4 -
2.07      In the Mures basin, about 2.1 million ha of agricultural land ex-
ists, or over 20% of the country's total, of which only about 128,000 ha are
irrigated. The principal rail and road links to Hungary and Western Europe
pass through the Mures valley and several important industrial and agricul-
tural towns. Some of these towns have for many years been protected from
river overflows by embankments, but during high floods in 1970, these embank-
iMents we-e breached causin.g extensive flooding, with serious damage to urban
houses, -industrial property, roads, railway lines, and agricultural enter-
orises. Although some locations irn the valley are flooded every year, the
1970 flood was the largest ever recorded and it was nearly equalled in 1975.
2.08      The Olt River, with the catchment area of 24,000 km2, drains the
westerr, and northern slopes of the Carpathian range where rainfall is partic-
ularly heavy. The normal maximum flow of the river is 400 m3/sec but the
record flow of 1,700 m3/sec was experienced during the 1975 floods. The
upper reaches of this river flow parallel to the Mures through a scenic
narrow valley, highly valued as a tourist attraction as well as for its
orchards and vineyards. Its basin contains about 1.4 million ha of agri-
cultural area, of which about 130,000 ha are irrigated. Important national
roads and railway lines serve several industrial towns along the valley
close to the river for much of its length.
2.09      The Arges River, which lies to the south and east of the Olt basin,
has a catchment area of about 12 600 km2. One of its tributaries, the
Dimbovita, drains about 1,100 km and passes through Bucharest.  The normal
maximum flow of the Arges is around 250 m3/sec at Budesti but, prior to the
1975 floods (when a peak of 1,800 m3/sec was reached), the maximum peak re-
corded was 1,650 m3/sec in 1941. The Arges basin contains about 800,000 ha
of agricultural land, of which about 150,000 ha are irrigated. Due to its
proximity to Bucharest, a number of national roads and railway lines pass
through its basin and several industrial plants are also located in this area.
2.10      The Ialomita River originates from the southern slopes of the
Carpathian mountains, flows in a southeasterly direction and joins the
Danube River downstream of Slobozia. The normal annual maximum flow is
around 200 m3/sec, but the maximum peak recorded prior to the 1975 peak of
1,400 m3/sec, was 1,170 m3/sec in 1972. The lalomita basin covering 10,400
kr,2 has an agricultural area of about 600,000 ha, of which about 160,000 ha
are irrigated. Like other river basins, several industrial plants and agri-
cuLtural enterprises are located within the lalomita valley.  National roads
a1d ra.lway lines linking Bucharest with Slobozia and Constanta pass through
t.-e basin, close to the river in several reaches.
2.;       T:he Ω>-zau River, a tributary of the Siret River, has a total catch-
mcen-c area of about 5,600 km2. This river originates from the eastern slopes
of the Carpathian mountains near Brasov and after flowing eastward for about
300 km joins the S_-ret River.  The Buzau is well-known for its flash floods
h.re narrow valley in its upper reaches.  The normaL annual high flows
ad{  _, the order of 300 m3/sec; but during 1971, a peak of 1,320 m3/sec was



recorded at Nehoiu compared to a new peak of 1,500 m3/sec in 1975. As in
other rivers, the peak normally lasts for less than 24 hours.
C. Floods Prior to 1975
2.12      Although the numerous Romanian rivers are vulnerable to frequent
flooding, such floods normally have occurred in isolated river basins. Wide-
spread concurrent flooding of a large number of river basins with maximum
flows has been recorded only once before in May and June 1970, when floods
of serious magnitude occurred in the western rivers of Transylvania, followed
by those of Moldavia, raising the Danube to high levels. These floods were
caused by heavy rainfall when the ground was already saturated with above
normal rainfall in earlier months. The Mures river and its tributaries,
and the Somes, the Crasna and the Cris rivers experienced their worst floods
on record. Other rivers were also in high floods at that time: namely the
Olt, the Trotus, the Prut, the Siret, the Bahlui and the Arges, and even the
Danube.
D. The 1975 Floods
2.13      The June Flood - Northeastern Romania.  Rainfall in Romania had
been above normal for most of the early months of 1975. In the northeastern
part of Romania, which consists of the basins of the Prut, the Bahlui, the
Trotus and the Siret (Map 11832), rainfall during the months of April and
May 1975 exceeded the normal for these two months by 50% to 100% (Annex 1,
Table 3). This resulted in saturation of the catchment areas as well as the
river beds.
2.14      During the first ten days of June a low pressure disturbance settled
over northeastern Romania and resulted in heavy rainfall. During the ten day
period, several stations recorded a total rainfall of 100 mm to over 150 mm,
about one-half of which fell during the 24 hour period from 8 a.m. on June
7 to 8 a.m. on June 8. Isohyets for this storm are illustrated in Map 11832.
Heavy showers of June 7/8, coupled with saturated ground and river beds, pro-
duced flash floods in almost all rivers in the northeastern part of the
country. Because of the high rainfall in their small catchment areas, the
Bahlui and Trotus had record floods of 270 m3/sec and 2,025 m3/sec (Annex 1,
Table 4). These discharges were respectively 69% and 35% higher than the
previous records of 1969. The Siret (43,900 km2), being a much larger
river, was not flooded to the same extent as the Bahlui and the Trotus.
Damage in this northeast area was significant but relatively localized.
2.15      The July Flood.  As a result of the storm that covered the north-
eastern part of Romania in the first ten days of June, appreciable rainfall
was also received by the rest of the country. Total rainfall in the five



basins of the Mures, Olt, Arges, Ialomita and Buzau during April-June 1975
exceeded the normal figures for this period by 50% to 75%. Consequently,
the river basins were saturated and the rivers were flowing with above
normal discharges prior to the storm of July 1975.
2.16      On June 30, 1975, a heavy storm moved quickly from northwest to
southeast over central Europe and covered almost the whole of Romania by
July 1/2.  T.is storm slowed down as it moved southeast and was virtually
stationary over the central and southeastern parts of Romania for over two
days. On July 4, it slowly started moving northeast and cleared the Romanian
territory by July 11. Total rainfall during these 11 days at several sta-
tions in the five basins ranged from 100 mm to 245 mm, of which about 70% to
90% fell in the first three days (July 1 to July 3) and, at certain stations,
107 mm to 140 mm fell in 24 hours from July 1 to July 2 (Annex 1, Table 5).
The rainstorm centered around Sinaia, about 40 km south of Brasov, and cover-
ed almost the whole country.   The intense rainfall during 24 hours of July
1/2, the short lengths of the tributaries of these basins, the saturated
ground, and the storm pattern all contributed to produce flash floods in the
five rivers and their tributaries. In most of these, flood peaks were the
highest ever recorded. In others the peaks were just below the highest re-
corded in earlier years. Table 4 in Annex 1 lists the flood peaks observed
in 1975 and also summarizes the previously recorded peaks and the years of
their occurrence. It will be noted from this table that the Olt, the Arges,
the Dimbovita (the tributary of the Arges flowing through Bucharest), the
Ialomita and the Buzau experienced their worst floods on record. The areas
affected by flooding are shown on Map 11833.

III. GENERAL IMPACT OF THE 1975 FLOODS
3.01      The 1975 floods have dealt a serious blow to the Romanian economy.
It will take one or two years to complete rehabilitation of flood damages and
several years for the economy to recover fully. The $793 million in estimated
direct losses was split about evenly between production losses (including
crops) and asset losses. The production loss represents about 2.4 percent of
the national income, and the asset loss 6.2 percent of gross domestic invest-
ment in 1974. These global figures give only a partial appreciation, however,
of the disruptive effect of the floods as there was also considerable damage
to about 250 local industrial enterprises, housing, and community facilities
in 1,300 villages and 65 towns which were flooded.
Losses in the River Basins
3.02      The measured impact of the floods in each of the river basins dis-
cussed in Chapter II, and on each of the key economic sectors, is summarized
in the following table, and detailed at Annex 2, Table 1:

treated separately.
/2  Includes agricultural and some industrial damages in the Danube basin
which cannot be given separately.
/3 Asset and production losses.
3.03      Flooding in the Mures basin, which drains the Transylvanian plateau
through western Romania, was especially serious and accounted for over 25 per-
cent of all losses from the 1975 floods. Losses of crops, agricultural facil-
ities and transport works in the Mures basin were serious, but industry was
damaged more seriously than anywhere else in the country. Over 40 percent of



industrial damage was concentrated in this region, especially where the Tirnava
Mare, Tirnava Mica and upper Mures tributaries converge to form the main chan-
nel of the Mures. Chemical and textile and other light industries in this
area were particularly hard hit.
3.04      With a few exceptions, the distribution of losses for each sector
among the remaining river basins was in proportion to total damage in each
basin. The Olt basin had exceptional losses to transport, largely because of
the railways and national roads located for long stretches beside the river
in the narrow valleys which characterize the upper Olt. Relatively high
transport losses also occurred in the Buzau basin. There were also signifi-
cant agricultural losses in other basins. These losses are attributed to
both flooding along the Danube and to heavy rains and poor drainage in a
number of smaller basins.
Types of Losses
3.05      About half ($407 million), of all flood losses were crops and indus-
trial production. The distribution of types of damage among the key economic
sectors is summarized in the table below, and detailed at Annex 2, Table 2:

This table accounts only for the first order effects of the flood, and it has
not been possible to quantify the linkages between these losses and their
indirect effect on the economy. Nonetheless, the impact of these first order
effects alone on export earnings and on funds available for investment are
serious and are discussed in paragraphs 3.06 and 3.07 below. In addition,
about a third of all flood losses resulted from damage to buildings and other
infrastructure which must now be replaced or rehabilitated; the major portion
of these losses was in transportation. Only a relatively small proportion
of total losses were to machinery and equipment. Concentration of much of
the equipment loss in industry, however, resulted in the estimated $74 million
loss of industrial production noted above.
Export Losses
3.06      Production losses from the flood are serious because of their nega-
tive impact on Romania's balance of trade, particularly on convertible cur-
rency earnings. Romania has relied heavily on agriculture to provide about
50 percent of convertible currency earnings which are essential to the indus-
trial investment program. As a result of the flood, Romania can be expected
to lose about US$225 million in export earnings from agriculture, about US$V25
million of which in convertible currency. (The mission was not able to quan-
tify the loss of export earnings for industry.) The lost agricultural exports
are equivalent to 4.6 percent of 1974 exports. A shortfall of exports in 1975
will make it particularly difficult for Romania to recover from the US$191
million overall trade deficit posted in 1974. Romania is now likely to have
to curtail its investment dependent upon convertible currency earnings.
Planned Investment
3.07      As a result of the flood, a significant amount of investment plan-
ned for 1975 and 1976 will have to be deferred because of (a) resources being
diverted for about US$386 million of quantified and a substantial amount of
rehabilitation which could not be quantified by the mission and (b) the US$407
million in crop and production losses which will reduce both funds available
for investment and domestic consumption. In agriculture alone, the US$324
million crop loss will result in about US$205 million reduction in funds
available for agricultural investment in 1976, while rehabilitation of
damaged assets will divert about US$60 million. The resulting US$265 mil-
lion reduction represents 19 percent of agricultural investments planned for
1976. A similar situation prevails for industry where the US$127 million loss
of convertible currency earnings from agriculture noted above will further
constrain imports of necessary equipment.

IV.  INDUSTRIAL SECTORS INCLUDING POWER, MINING AND PETROLEUM
A. Background
4.01      All important and large industrial units in Romania are state-owned
and managed by the national government through nine ministries. Two of these
Yanistries manage the Power sector and the Mining, Petroleum and Geological
sector. National industrial undertakings in other fields (henceforth called
industry Sector) are managed by seven ministries: (i) Ministry of Forestry
and Building Materials; (ii) Ministry of Light Industry; (iii) Ministry of
Chemicals; (iv) Ministry of Industrial Construction; (v) Ministry of Heavy
Machinery (including automobiles); (vi) Ministry of MIachine Tools and Electro-
Technics; and (vii) Ministry of Metallurgy. 1/ However, in addition to the
national enterprises, there are a large number of smaller industrial units
owned by local governments at the judet and municipal level. Since the
mission was in field within three weeks of the floods, and because these en-
terprises are decentralized, it was not feasible to obtain information on the
substantial damage suffered by over 250 of the total 500 local enterprises.
Consequently, only damage to the national enterprises, and its consequences,
are discussed here (Annex 4, Tables 1 to 3).
4.02      This Chapter consists of four sections: the first three discuss the
impact of the floods on the Power, Mining and Petroleum and Industry Sectors
and the fourth discusses the cost of the flood rehabilitation program in these
sectors.
B. Power Sector
4.03      The floods caused extensive damage to the power sector.  The damage
this year is much more extensive than that caused by any previous flood, in-
cluding the 1970 flood. The main reason for this large damage is the combina-
tion of three factors: (a) sudden simultaneous overflowing of most of the
rivers which inundated many low-lying electric power installations; (b) a large
number of landslides caused by the floods which damaged or carried away power
facilities; and (c) accumulation of large volumes of mud which damaged equip-
ment.
4.04      Most of the damage was to the transmission and distribution facil-
ities. As detailed in Annex 4, Table 4, the main transmission lines were
damaged at 378 locations (some 700 km of lines were down) while 3,946 trans-
former staticns were put out of commission.  The national power grid was
affected in many areas (see Map 11831), interrupting power supplies to numer-
ous cities and inaustrial units. In addition, many access roads and bridges
1I   Slnce Sepcr.:ber 1975, the number of ministries in the sector has been
,ecucad to six. A new Ministry of Machine Building Industry combines
_.e i1inistries of Heavy Machinery, and Machine Tools and Electro-
Technics.

leading to power installations were either washed away or seriously damaged.
Although no damage was reported by any operating hydroelectric plant, some
infrastructure facilities near Vilcea Hydroelectric plant were affected, and
materials and equipment at a few hydroelectric projects under construction
suffered extensive losses. Only one Thermal Power Station, at Tirnaveni, was
affected as flood waters damaged equipment like pumps, electric motors, boiler
accessories and transmission facilities.
4.05      The total damage to the assets belonging to the Ministry of Electric
Energy this year is estimated at Lei 175 million compared to about Lei 77.5
million during the 1970 floods. Over one-half of the losses in 1975 (Lei 88
million) are due to the damage to the transmission lines. Loss of materials
and inventories, and damage to projects under execution total Lei 49.9 million
(28.5% of total). Detailed breakdown of the losses are given in Annex 4,
Table 5 and summarized below:

4.06      The maximum damage to the power sector was in the Olt basin (Lei 66.8
million or 38.2% of the total) and not in the Mures basin which suffered maximum
overall damage during the 1975 floods. Estimates of damage to power installations
in different basins are detailed in Annex 4, Table 5 and summarized below:

-  2-
4.C,17     immmediately after the floods were reported, the Ministry of Electric
anergby took urgent remedial steps to restore power supplies to all parts of
the country. A three-step action program was drawn up. The first step involved
restoring emergency power supply to all consumers, particularly public services
and industrial units. The second step aimed at making temporary provisions to
restore supplies at the pre-flood level, by using all available reserve capacity.
And, the third step would involve repairing all damaged facilities to ensure
supply on a permanent basis by redeveloping the necessary reserve capacity.
To Dut this action program ilnto immediate operation, a coordination committee
was formed in the Ministry. This committee assigned to each of the affected
areas a senior official to take all possible corrective measures.  The work at
the most seriously affected places was supervised on site by some of these
officials. In addition, the coordinating committee receives regular status
reports from each enterprise and provides necessary support to them; immediate-
ly after the floods, reports were received three times a day, but by end of
July frequency was reduced to one a day.
4.08       These efforts have paid off handsomely.  Power supplies were quickly
restored to most locations and the national grid is operational again, though
supplies were still not completely normal by end July. Of 378 breaks in the
transmission lines, only 14 remained to be fixed, while only 127 of 3,946
transformer stations were still to be repaired; some of the repairs were tem-
porary and further work is necessary to restore power supplies on a permanent
basis. This is a very creditable achievement by any measure. The Ministry is
currently consolidating the plans developed by individual enterprises to com-
plete steps two and three of the rehabilitation program mentioned above. In
addition, engineers from its Design Institute are currently in field to as-
certain if any route changes are necessary to minimize similar flood damage
in future. Current estimates of the cost of rehabilitation of the damage
are discussed in para. 4.32.
C.    Mining, Petroleum and Geological Sector
4.09       The mining, petroleum and geology sector, another key sector in the
Romanian economy, also suffered extensive damage. Since the 1975 floods were
sudden and appeared after the normal spring flood season, many mining and petro-
leum enterprises could not take adequate flood protection measures in time.
As a result, several open mines and quarries were flooded and later covered
with mud; water also entered some underground mines. Large amounts of mate-
rials were washed away, substantial neasuring and control instruments and
earthmoving equipment at mines were damiaged, gas supplies were interrupted,
and some petroleum drilling and extraction equipment was affected.  Fortunately,
.he extent of the diamage was restricted due to the round-the-clock work under-
taken by tne workers and authorities to save the facilities as soon as flood
warnings were received.
4.10       Floods damaged 15 out of about 100 mines in the country (Map 11846).
3osmc or tnese were open mines for extracting non-ferrous and non-metallic ores
lL;e >'tnc, copper, lead, silver, coal, lignite and salt. A few quarries were
fiodcid w_'a up to 3-5 meters of water.  The concentrates factories at Copsa



- 13 -
Mica and Baia Borsa were also flooded and suffered heavy inventory losses as
large quantities of processed concentrates and ores were washed away. Land-
slides in some quarries carried doim earthmoving machinery (e.g. excavators)
and other equipment. All this interrupted production for a few days at most
facilities; production loss was particularly serious in mines and related
facilities near Medias and Sighisoara. Total production loss during July
1975 is roughly estimated at Lei 95 million. The cumulative production losses
will continue to increase, though at a slowver rate, until all affected faci-
lities are repaired and reach full production again.
4.11      Flood damage in the mining, petroleum and geology sector is estimated
at Lei 580 million; about Lei 200 million in the petroleum sector and the
remaining Lei 380 million in the mining and geology sector. As detailed below,
the largest loss, totalling Lei 205 nmillion (35.3%) was in finished goods
inventory, mainly at the Copsa Mica and Baia Borsa factories. Equipment
losses totalled Lei 100 million (17%), of which Lei 80 million was in petro-
leum equipment. Damage caused to mines and wells would require expenditures
of about Lei 180 million to restore the facilities to their pre-flood state.
This work includes making necessary structural changes in the flooded under-
ground mines and removing up to one meter deep mud left by the flood waters
in the open mines. Fortunately, damage to buildings (Lei 36 million) and
infrastructure (Lei 14 million), and the loss of inventories was relatively
limited as summarized below and detailed in Annex 4, Table 6:

4.12      As indicated in Map 11846, these losses are distributed in practically
all flood-affected basins. The largest losses were in the Mures basin (Lei
97 million), Arges basin (Lei 53 million) and Olt basin (Lei 47 million).
A breakdown of losses by various basins is summarized below and detailed in
Annex 4, Table 6.

4.13      Some of the locations affected by the latest floods were also damaged
by 1970 floods. After 1970, the authorities had initiated a number of flood
protection measures, which included moving of warehouses to higher levels,
construction of water channels and dykes around some flood-prone facilities,
and participation in the national flood protection works like regulation of
water flows and construction of dams. Even though all of the proposed protec-
tive measures were not fully completed, the efforts made during the last few
years helped prevent higher losses in 1975. The Ministry and the enterprises
are currently reviewing the existing flood control plans in light of the experi-
ence during the latest floods. However, it will take some time to complete
the ongoing studies and to coordinate the action program with the local and
national water control authorities. Future flood protection plans are discussed
in Chapter VI.
D. Industry Sector
4.14      The floods affected 152 (or 21%) of some 722 national industrial
enterprises under seven ministries which manage national enterprises in this
sector (para. 4.01). The largest number of affected enterprises are in the
Ministry of Light Industry (46 out of 254), Ministry of Forestry and Building
Materials (36 out of total 101), Ministry of Industrial Construction (20 out
of 60), and Ministrv of Chemicals (19 out of 97). As a result, about half a
million workers, whose wages are linked to production, lost part of their
earnings. Details of enterprises and workers affected are given in Annex 4,
Table 1, and summarized below:

4.15      The total book value of assets lost in these 152 enterprises is
estimated at Lei 1,688 million (over-US$85 million); the actual losses would
be higher as more detailed physical inventory of the damage is completed and
unit prices are changed to reflect replacement costs. Unlike some other
sectors, the most serious damage in the industry sector was to equipment and
machinery (Lei 892 million or 53%), though substantial inventory losses were
also incurred both in raw materials and other inventory (Lei 425 million) and
finished goods (Lei 197 million). Details of losses are given in Annex 4,

4.16      The largest loss of Lei 561 million (Annex 4, Table 7), was in the
Ministry of Forestry and Building Materials, because a large number of its
wood processing plants (e.g. furniture factories) are located in mountain
valleys and were damaged by the flash floods. Similar circumstances damaged
facilities at four cement factories. Chemicals Industry also suffered heavy
losses (Lei 486 million) due to the direct and indirect effects of the floods.
High water damaged electrical equipment, controls and instrumentations. In
addition, reaction of water with chemicals set off explosions at two locations
causing serious damage to equipment and machinery (see para. 4.24 below).
Many units (e.g. textile mills) in the Ministry of Light Industries had
delicate and, at some places, automated equipment which was particularly sus-
ceptible to damage due to flood waters and mud. As a result, this Ministry
suffered losses totalling Lei 310 million (para 4.23 and Annex 4, Table 8).
Fortunately, losses in three ministries -- Heavv Machinery, Machine Tools and
Metallurgy -- were relatively light because:  (a) the number of units flooded
were relatively limited due to their location; (b) many units located in
flooded areas had taken effective precautionary measures since 1970; and (c)
they had relatively smaller proportion of electrical and other delicate equip-
ment.
4.17      Losses by Basin.  The breakdown of losses by basins is detailed in
Annex 4, Table 3, and summarized below; details for individual ministries
are given in Annex 4, Tables 7 to 13. The Mures Basin suffered by far the
largest losses, totalling Lei 733 million (43% of total country), though the
industries located in the Arges basin (Lei 269 million) and the Olt basin
(Lei 235 million) also suffered heavy losses. Map 11846 shows the location
of industrial units in different ministries most seriously affected by floods.

4.18      Production Losses.  Due to the widespread damage to assets, produc-
tion was interrupted at least for a few days at practically all 152 affected
enterprises. Estimates of the resultant production losses, prepared at the
end of July, total Lei 1.5 billion (US$75 million). As detailed in table below,
the largest losses were reported by the Ministry of Chemicals (Lei 400 million).
While practically all affected factories have started partial production, most
of them are operating at between 50 to 80% of normal capacity due to the equip-
ment damage and loss of automatic controls. But a few factories (e.g. textiles
factory at Medias, ceramics unit at Sighisoara, etc.) are still totally in-
operational and cannot restart production until critical spare parts and
supplies are received. Even the units put back into production have done so
by finding temporary solutions and by often disregarding normal safety con-
siderations, and therefore cannot continue like this indefinitely. Conse-
quently, production losses and the resultant effects on other parts of the
economv will become more serious unless necessary spares, supplies and replace-
ment equipment are urgently provided. The estimates below do not take into
account losses due to production cutbacks much beyond July or their effects
on other parts of the economy.

4.19      The numbers alone do not reflect the full impact of the damage.
Some of the factories affected supply basic inputs to other parts of the
economy, while others are the only ones of their kind in the cotntry. Any
disruption in their operations could have serious indirect effects on the
economy. For example, the Chemicals Enterprise at Tirnaveni is the only
producer of calcium carbide, a product widely used in the chemicals, petro-
chemicals and engineering industries. The production losses at Tirnaveni
forced many factories in these industries to cut production. Similar produc-
tion losses in other basic industries like mining, heavy machinery and machine
tools will be multiplied due to linkages. Similarly, the silk factory at
Sighisoara, the only one of its type, affects other units solely dependent on
it for supplies. Finally, the floods may severely curtail exports of some
commodities and thus hurt the whole economy, as a substantial portion of
production of many units (e.g. textile factory at Medias, furniture factories



- 18 -
at Buzau and Tirnaveni, four cement plants) was destined for exports. A
brief description of losses in individual subsectors is given below.
4.20      Forestry and Building Materials.  Since a large number of enter-
prises in this sector are located in mountain valleys and along rivers, they
suffered relatively heavy losses.  About one-third (36) of total 101 enter-
prises (excluding the Central for Forest Exploitation) were affetted by flood;
15 of the damaged enterprises manufacture wood products like furniture, 4 are
cement plants, and the balance 17 are engaged in the production of construc-
tion materials like bricks, prefabricated concrete parts, concrete pipes,
ceramics, etc. Substantial losses were also incurred as swollen rivers
carried away large quantities of wood. Two export-oriented furniture factories,
in Nehoiu and Medias, were totally washed away resulting in large -losses of
inventories and equipment.  Other factories producing wood products, parti-
cularly those with automated equipment, also suffered heavy losses as floods
damaged electrical lines and equipment and put auxiliary facilities like water
and gas supply systems out of commission. Most of these units were new and
exported 60-70% of their production, mainly to lWest Germany, France, Sweden,
Austria, Hungary, Poland and USSR.
4.21      Four of the 10 cement plants in Romania were damaged.  These plants
are also located in the valleys and, as a result, some facilities came under
2-2.5 meters of water. At three of these locations, thermal power plants were
partially damaged. At all four sites, conveyors bringing raw materials to the
main plant were affected, electrical equipment and controls were rendered in-
operative and large quantities of raw materials like limestone were lost. The
authorities were able to restart the affected plants at 60-75% of normal capa-
city by making temporary power connections, but full production cannot be
achieved until necessary spare parts and replacements are received.
4.22      Seventeen of the total 26 enterprises producing construction materials
suffered similar damage due to high waters. Fortunately, due to their safer
location no major damage is reported from paper and pulp factories and from
units producing equipment for forest industries.
4.23      Light Industry.  This industry includes textiles, glassware, leather
and other consumer goods plants. In all, 46 enterprises under the Ministry
of Light Industry were damaged. Of these, 7 were most seriously affected;
6 of these are located in the Mures basin cities of Sighisoara (3), Medias (2)
and Tirnaveni (1), and one in the Prahova valley -- the sand mine for glass
production at Valeni de Munte. The factories at Sighisoara, Medias and
Tirnaveni were flooded with up to 3 meters of water. When water finally sub-
sided, up to one meter of mud was left behind. As a result, raw materials and
finished products inventories were heavily damaged. Most of these factories,
being export-oriented, had modern and automated equipment, and flood water
played havoc to their electronic controls and instrumentations. The two tex-
tile factories ard one silk weaving factory at Sighisoara, all equipped with
precision machinery, suffered additional damage as flood waters brought che-
micals from nearby chemical stores and thus corroded equipmert. The Consumer
Products plant at Medias and the glass factory at Tirnaveni suffered damage
when water entered high-temperature furnaces before they could be cooled and



- 1 9 -
damaged refractories and furnace walls. The damage in this industry would
have been even higher if authorities had not taken timely action in dismantl-
ing and removing to safety sensitive equipment from about 20 plants in Arad,
Deva, Alba Iulia and Bucharest areas.
4.24      Chemical Industry.  In all, 19 chemical plants were affected by
the floods. All except 6 were recommissioned within a few days. The most
common reason for temporary production stoppage was the sudden increase in
the impurities and suspended matter in river waters, which clogged and damaged
the water purifying and pumping stations. As a result, water supplies to
thermal power stations and main chemical plants for cooling or other production
purposes were stopped, resulting in complete plant shutdowns. Fortunately,
no serious permanent damage was suffered in the main facilities at most of the
plants and therefore production could start as soon as water supplies were
restored, either on a temporary or permanent basis.
4.25      However, six plants suffered much more serious damage, of which the
worst affected is at Tirnaveni. This plant produces calcium carbide, other
chemical materials and ceramics and suffered a total damage of about Lei 200
million. On July 3, flood waters, after breaking the protective dykes around
the city, suddenly entered the plant and rose to 2-3 meters height within
two hours. The water stayed above floor level for two days before receding,
leaving large quantities of mud in and around the machinery. As a result,
most of the electrical machinery, instrumentation and automatic controls were
permanently lost, and large quantities of materials and supplies were destroyed.
Finally, flood water permanently damaged the refractories in ovens and the
instrumentation in the ceramics plant. However, extensive damage was caused
by the severe explosion set off when water entered the calcium carbide store
(located in the center of the factory) and produced acetylene and tremendous
heat. As a result of this explosion, a number of buildings were blown up and
equipment damaged.  Another seriously affected unit is the Petrochemicals
Plant at Pitesti, which produces about 300,000 tons of petrochemicals annually
and includes a refinery. It suffered permanent damage, totalling Lei 150
million, when both its water treatment plants were suddenly flooded, cutting
off cooling water supplies to the main plant. As a result, boilers, gas-
turbines, a liquified gas plant, rectifiers and many other facilities were
damaged. Similarly, the Carbon Black plant at Copsa Mica incurred heavy
losses when up to 2 meters high water stayed in for 3-4 days, damaging elec-
trical equipment and instrumentation, water and gas systems, granulation and
polymerization facilities, as well as many structures and foundations. Similar,
though less serious, damage was suffered at the Chemical Complex at Turda,
Enamel Factory at Medias and Chemical Equipment plant at Gaesti.
4.26      Industrial Construction.  The Ministry of Industrial Construction
is responsible for the construction of all new national industrial plants.
It operates through 21 construction trusts and 4 industrial centrals which
manage 60 enterprises engaged in supplying construction materials. In mid-
1975, construction trusts were working on some 300 construction sites. By
the verv nature of the work, the construction sites have large volumes of



- 20 -
work-in-progress, materials and equipment in the open, which can suffer serious
damages by flash floods. The 1975 floods affected about 150 or one-half of
the construction sites, most of which are located either in the Mures basin
(mainly around Medias, Alba Iulia, Tirnaveni and Tg. Mures) or the Ialomita
basin. At most sites, flash floods brought up to 2-3 meters high water, which
caused substantial damage (exceeding Lei 60 million) to civil works already
completed (Annex 4, Table 12).  Tn addition, construction materials (e.g.
amenz, inr.e, pipes) stockpiled for further work were lost.  Some of the
construction and earthmoving equipment and much of the electricals (e.g. elec-
tric motors) on site were damaged.  In addition, some equipment delivered to
sites for erection was also damaged though such losses are not charged to this
Ministry. But, the setbacks in the construction schedules will reduce revenues
an force the enterprises to borrow additional funds for their extra working
capkal needs (about Lei 90 million) on which interest charges will have to
be paid. Twenty of the 60 enterprises under industrial centrals were also
affected by floods. Most of these enterprises operate sites for producing
construction materials like sand, gravel, etc.
4.27      The Ministry has already taken urgent measures to expedite the
reconstruction effort. A special department has been formed in the MIinistry
to consolidate the estimates of losses and to provide assistance to the enter-
prises. It has already approached the Investment Bank for the financing needed
to execute the reconstruction program. Another department is coordinating
the allocation of supplies to various enterprises. In consultation with
other involved ministries, priorities are being assigned to various construc-
tion sites for the resumption of work and for recouping some of the lost time.
The same department is also coordinating with other ministries responsible
for supplying materials and equipment needed by the enterprises. While much
still remains to be done in this area, the Ministry has made a credible start
in organizing and coordinating the help needed by the construction trusts
and production enterprises in rehabilitating the flood damage.
4.28      Ileavy Machinery, Machine Tools and Metallurgy.  The flood damage
in these three subsectors was relatively limited becatuse: (a) a large number
of plants are located in areas which were not seriously flooded; (b) many
plants had erected effective flood protection works after the 1970 floods;
and (c) most of the equipment in the affected plants is mechanical which is
less prone to permanent damage than electrical equipment.
4.29      In the Ministry of Heavv Machinery, only 14 of about 100 enterprises
suffered flood damage, of which the most seriously affected enterprise is the
Automecharica factory in Medias which produces refrigerators. The factory,
located on the river bank, was inundated by high water and equipment and mate-
rials worth Lei 50 million (60% of total damage in the ministry) were lost
(Annex 4, Table 10).  Temporary arrangements had enabled the factory to start
production at about 50% of normal capacity by end-July, but full production
cannot  be resumed until necessary spares are received.
4.;^3Tn th.e Ministry of Machine Tools and Electro Technics, fourteen of
total 510 enternrises were affected. In these enterprises, only ancillary units



- 21 -
(e.g., gas supplies, electrical supplies) were damaged and the main equipment
was not affected. Major damage was at the Electrical Equipment plant in Titu,
where high waters damaged inventories. The damage to equipment and machinery
in all the affected units was limited to Lei 5 million and the total damage
in the Ministry to Lei 26 million (Annex 4, Table 11).
E. Cost of Reconstruction Program
4.31      The authorities are still assessing the cost of restoring the
affected facilities to their pre-flood status, since immediately after the
floods first priority was given to cleaning the facilities and restarting at
least partial production. It was only in the last week of July that the en-
terprises started drawing medium- and long-term reconstruction plans and es-
timating the resources needed to achieve them. Therefore, firm cost estimates
of the reconstruction efforts were not available to the Bank mission.
4.32      It is estimated that the Power sector will requ.re about Lei 102
million to repair buildings, structures and infrastructure facilities, in
order to restore its capabilities to the pre-flood level, including Lei 73
million for structures and facilities associated with transnission lines
(Annex 4, Table 14).  In addition, approximately Lei 16^> million would be
needed for purchasing necessary spares, machinery and equipment (Annex 4,
Table 15); this estimate includes Lei 65 million (38.6%) for transport and
earthmoving equipment, Lei 74.5 million (44.2%) for machinery and materials,
Lei 17.9 million (10.6%) for electrical equipment and Lei 11.0 million (6.5%)
for spare parts. Total cost of rehabilitation is estimated at Lei 270.2 mil-
lion (para. 4.35).
4.33      In the Mining, Petroleum and Geology sector, the total cost of
rehabilitation is likely to exceed the estimated damage of Lei 580 million
because actual replacement cost of assets will be higher than the book value
on which the damage estimates are based and because additional equipment (e.g.
earthmoving machinery) is required to clean up the after-effects of the floods.
It is estimated that spare parts, machinery and equipment worth Lei 201.8 mil-
lion would be required to repair the damage, including Lei 43.0 million for
spare parts, Lei 105.9 million for transport and earthroving machinery and
Lei 25.5 million for electricals, instrumentations and controls.  In addition,
it would cost about Lei 180 million to bring mines and oil wells to their pre-
flood physical state and another Lei 60.1 million to repair buildings and in-
frastructure (including Lei 1.8 million for cement and Lei 1.7 million for
steel). A summary of the rehabilitation costs, excluding the cost of replacing
inventories (over Lei 250 million), is stmmarized in para. 4.35 below and de-
tailed in Annex 4, Tables 14 and 15.
4.34      For the Industry sector, first estimates indicate that over Lei 214
million (including Lei 13 million for cement and Lei 34 million for steel)
would be needed for buying materials and supplies to repair damages to sites,



- 22 -
buildings and infrastructure. In addition, spares and equipment totalling
Lei 897 million would be needed to repair damage to fixed assets. These
estimates exclude the cost of labor, most of which would be in-house. Thus,
as summarized below, the total cost (excluding labor) of repairing fixed
assets in the Industry sector would exceed Lei 1,111 million. In addition,
the Government would have to replace inventories whose book value exceeds
Lei 425 million (para. 4.15).
4.35      The estimated total cost of rehabilitating the fixed assets in
the Power, Mining and Petroleum and Industry sectors exceeds Lei 1,822
million, as detailed in Annex 4, Tables 14 and 15 and summarized below:

The above figures underestimate the financing needs because: (a) they are based
on book values and not the replacement costs; (b) these are the first estimates
and as a complete physical inventory of losses is taken the losses may increase;
and (c) they do not take into account any permanent loss in the productivity
of the salvaged equipment due to its prolonQed immersioni in water and mud, an
important factor in facilities with precision eouipment. Also these estimates
cover the fixed assets only and do not take into account inventory losses of
about Lei 920 million.

V. TRANSPORT AND TELECOI?IUNICATIONS SECTORS
A. Background
5.01      This chapter evaluates the flood damage and the Government's rehabil-
itation program in the Transport and Telecommunications Sectors. The evalua-
tion is based on the substantial amount of information concerning the sectors,
particularly on traffic flows in different parts of the country, provided to
the mission. The mission also received detailed information on damages caused
to local roads in five judets, though it was not possible to obtain such data
for all flood-affected judets when the mission was in the field due to the
decentralized management of these roads. However, it was not considered
necessary to include a detailed discussion of the traffic flow data or of the
data on local roads in this report.
5.02      This Part consists of four more sections; the first discusses the
impact of 1975 floods on the Transport and Telecommunications Sectors. The
second section gives a background of the Romanian transport network and de-
scribes the physical damage caused to it. The third section discusses the
Government's Rehabilitation Program, and the last evaluates the organization
available for carrying out the reconstruction program.
B. Main Impact of the Floods
5.03      Damage to transportation facilities was caused in two principal ways.
First, the sustained rains brought river flows in most of the major basins to
unprecedented peaks. Many of the river valleys are deeply indented; flood
flows were therefore deep and fast, topping and in some cases destroying
bridges. Road and rail links along these narrow valleys were also flooded
and cut.
5.04      Second, the prolonged rains had so saturated and loosened the soils
that in hilly terrain land-slides occurred which breached road and rail align-
ments. Telecommunications facilities also suffered in these ways.
5.05      Damage was severest in the basins of the Mures and Olt rivers as
the following table indicates:

C. Transportation and Telecommunications Networks
5.06       In the past railways have been the major mode in Romania's transport
system; the 11,000 km network is so evenly spread that no point in the country
is far from one of the two thousand or more railway stations (Map 11830). Addi-
tionally there are good connections to Western Europe through Hungary and
Austria, to the USSR, and to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta. About
2,500 km. of the network is double-tracked, and about 1 ,200 km electrified.
The railways carry a major share of total freight; in 1973, nearly 57 bil-
lion ton-km, on an average haul of about 250 km.  In consequence the July
1975 floods which resulted in a large loss of assets (Annex 5, Table 1) (Lei
634 million or about US$31.5 million replacement value) in destroyed embank-
ments, track and bridges, signalling and control equipment, also caused a
major interruption to the economy, a measure of which is indicated in Annex 5,
Table 2, where the magnitudes of average daily freight flows for the disrupted
rail sections are shown. About 2,625 km of track (24%o of the network) were
affected by flooding in about 390 locations, of which 275 km of rail bed and
permanent way were destroyed, as well as 20 bridges.
5.07      Il'oads are assuming increasing importance as a transportation mode.
Traffic, already considerable on many of the national roads (Annex 5, Table 3
and Map 11829), is presently growing at about 10% annually.  Some roads are
already congested and investments to increase capacity are planned.
5.08      There are nearly 13,000 km of national roads administered by the
Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications.  Of this total length about
12,200 km are asphalted, the remainder have gravel or macadam surfaces.
About 500 km of the asphalted network has 4-lane carriageways, the remainder
are two-lane with 7 m carriageway and shoulders of 1-2 m.



25 -
5.09      Traffic was disrupted for about 3,400 km, or 25% of this network,
by flooding or landslides caused by saturated soil conditions. Nearly 120 km
of road were destroyed in over 730 locations (Annex 5, Table 3). Also 18
bridges were destroyed and 19 badly damaged. Replacement value of the assets
destroyed is about Lei 430 million (US$21.5 million). No attempt has been
made to quantify the loss to the economy through interrupted traffic flows,
although some indication of this loss can be found in the average daily
traffic figures for the affected road sections shown in Annex 5, Table 3.
5.10      The 63,000 km network of district and village roads, about 15% of
which are asphalted, also suffered severe damage (Annex 5, Table 4). These
roads are administered by 39 county authorities of which 19 suffered flood
damage. In all, about 1,120 km of district roads, 1,170 km of village roads
(about 4% of the network) and nearly 680 bridges were destroyed. The esti-
mated cost of rehabilitation is about Lei 2.28 billion (US$114 million).
5.11      Of the 25,000 km of exploitation roads administered by the Forestry
Industry about 1,500 bridges and 6,000 km of road were damaged. The principal
timber extraction roads follow the streams in the predominantly hilly country
where forestry is exploited, and although some damage is caused annually by
flooding, there has been none comparable to that caused by the 1975 floods
and landslides totalling about Lei 320 million (US$16 million).
5.12      The telecommunications network, where lines generally follow rail
and road alignments also suffered considerable damage (Annex 5, Table 5).
About 250 km of overhead line, 100 km of underground cable between towns and
90 km of underground cable within towns, were destroyed in over 600 locations.
Rehabilitation is expected to cost about Lei 46 million (US$2.3 million).
D. Government's Rehabilitation Program
5.13      The Iinistry of Transport and Telecommunications has detailed the
damage caused to road, rail and telecommunications facilities as a result of
the flooding and prolonged heavy rain. The Ministry prepared detailed cost
analyses of works required for railways and national roads, examples of which
are shown in Annex 5, Tables 6 and 7. In addition much detailed information
on repair costs of district and village roads was provided. These data form
the bases of the other tables of Annex 5. Unit costs used are those prepared
in 1963 and updated in 1973. As domestic prices have been largely protected
from foreign inflation, and as the foreign inputs to the work of rehabilitat-
ing communications facilities will be small, no allowance for escalation has
been made, and the only contingency allowance is 10% to cover possible quantity
increases.
5.14      Romania produces the materials needed for this reconstruction work -
cement, reinforcing steel, telecommunications cables and construction equip-
ment. The foreign exchange cost of the rehabilitation works is expected to
be about 5%.

E. Organization for Reconstruction
5.16     There are two Institutes of Design in the Ministry of Transport and
Telecommunications, one responsible for railways, the other for national roads
and other civil works. Each Institute is presently concentrating on the de-
sign of works needed to bring the rail and national road networks into its
condition prior to the flooding and, where feasible to include a safety factor
against further damage by comparable floods. For district and village roads
this work is done by each district administration; the 19 districts affected
by the 1975 flooding are giving priority to this redesign work. The Forestry
Exploitation Central in the Ministry of Forests is also concentrating on
rehabilitation work.
5.17      All civil works construction in Romania is carried out by State
enterprises. Within the Ministry there are two Trusts for Construction, one
for railways, and the other for civil works; they have independent organiza-
tions within the Ministry and are responsible directly to the Minister. Both
Trusts are deployed geographically into seven regional enterprises which carry
out all works in those regions as would a contractor, but on the basis of nego-
tiated prices in a Bill of Quantities.
5.18      The Rail Construction Trust has an annual construction capacity of
about Lei 2.5 billion (US8125 million), and the Trust for national roads about
Lei 1.3 billion (US$63 million). Both Trusts appear capably managed and ef-
fective. Each of the 39 district authorities is responsible for the execution
of its ovn civil works. The 19 districts in which transportation facilities
were affected by the July floods each has on average a construction capability
of about Lei 200 million (US$10 million) per year. Similarly the construction
of telecommunications facilities is also handled by a Central within the
Ministry. All agencies concerned with the rehabilitation of transport and
communications facilities damaged by the flooding have the capacity and cap-
ability to reconstruct them without contractual assistance from outside the
country, albeit at the expense of capacity diverted from their development
programs.



- 27 -
5.19      Immediately after the floods subsided, all agencies concerned with
transport and communications began an immediate action program to open as many
links as possible if even on a temporary basis. By the time of the mission's
first field visit, July 22, road traffic could pass on the principal routes
in most of the worst affected areas, and rail traffic was also able to use
most of the affected links if even under severe restrictions. With temporary
accommodation of traffic secured, efforts are being diverted to full scale
rehabilitation works. As planning for each individual project is completed
the construction Trust concerned deploys its resources to implement it.

VI. AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS
Background
6.01      This chapter evaluates the flood damages and rehabilitation programs
in the Agriculture and Water Sectors (Irrigation, Drainage and Flood Protec-
"ion Works), ar.d also discusses the long-term programming for water control.
It consists of four sections - the first two deal with agricultural sector
damages and their impact on the Romanian economy, and the next two deal with
the water sector - the first describes the damages to irrigation, drainage
and flood protection works and their repair; and the second discusses Govern-
ment's efforts towards long-term programming for water control with a view to
provide permanent protection against floods.
A. Losses in Agricultural Sector
6.02      Cropped areas which were flooded are estimated at 1.1 million ha,
or about 10% of the total cultivated lands in the country. Of these, 55%
were used to grow cereals, 27% fodders and pastures, 4% vegetables and pota-
toes, 3% sugar beets and the balance oilseeds, fruits and other crops. The
floods, excessive ground moisture and hails resulted in losses of 75-90% of
the planned production of crops in the affected areas. Furthermore, about
190,000 heads of livestock and 3 million poultry were drowned, 6,500 ha of
tree crops were permanently destroyed, 18,000 tons of stocked cereals valued
at about Lei 20 million (US$1.0 million) and about Lei 100 million (US$5 mil-
lion) worth of livestock products were lost; damages to farm buildings and
equipment are estimated at about Lei 530 million. About 30% of the flooded
areas and the livestock and poultry drowned were owned by the State Agricul-
tural Enterprises and the balance by the Agricultural Cooperatives. These
losses would cost the economy an estimated Lei 7.7 billion (US$384 million).
The agricultural losses by river basins are summarized in Annex 3, Table 1.
Details of flooded cropped areas by river basins, and crop and livestock-
products losses are in Annex 3, Table 2. Details of permanently damaged
tree crops, livestock losses, and damages to farm buildings and equipment
are presented in Annex 3, Table 3.
6.03      The total volume of cereals lost represents about 8% of the planned
nati'-nal production of these crops in 1975. The corresponding percentage
losses for other crops are: 10% each for sugar beets and vegetables, 6% for
oilseeds, and less that 3% each for grapes and fruits. Similarly, the numbers
of drowned livestock and poultry represent about 1% and 5% respectively of the
total national population of livestock and poultry. Although the losses are
small by national standards, they are devastating to farmers who are seriously
affected by them, particularly to members of the cooperatives.



- 29 -
Crop Losses
6.04      Cereals.  About 602,000 ha of the flooded areas were used to grow
maize, wheat and barley. The normal harvesting season for maize is September
10-October 20; July 1-20 for wheat; and June 20-30 for barley. Most of the
damages to the young maize plants were caused by hail and excessive ground
moisture. The mature wheat and barley crops were lodged and mixed with mud by
the rains and floods so that harvesting became difficult and un uneconomical.
It was possible to recover some crops from less seriously damaged fields, but
losses would still represent about 78% of the planned production of each crop
in the affected areas. The volumes of these losses are estimated at 932,000
tons of maize, 493,000 tons of wheat and 161,000 tons of barley. In addition,
18,000 tons of stocked cereals were lost. The value of these losses is esti-
mated at about Lei 3.1 billion (US$155 million).
6.05      Fodders and Pastures.  Most of the fodder crop damaged by flood was
standing silage maize. The pasture fields comprised mainly of alfalfa. About
110,800 ha and 181,900 ha of the flooded areas were used to grow fodders and
pastures respectively. Losses amounted to 478,000 tons of dry matter equiv-
alent silage maize and 561,000 tons hay equivalent of alfalfa with a total
value of Lei 519 million (US$25 million).
6.06      The silage maize plants destroyed were young and were expected to
be harvested during September 1 - October 30. Some of these young plants were
damaged by excessive hail and moisture while others were lodged, covered with
mud or washed off. A few plants in the partially affected areas have grown
to maturity but yields from such fields would be reduced to about half of
those which were expected before the flood and total harvests are not expected
to exceed 15% of the planned production.
6.07      The damage to pastures was caused by settling mud which completely
or partially buried the plants. About 50,000 ha equivalent of scattered
pasture fields out of 181,900 ha were destroyed. It is a general practice
in Romania to establish pasture in mountainous and marginal lands and to
reserve more productive agricultural lands for use in the production of high
value crops. Of an estimated 4.5 million ha under pastures, only about 0.5
million are located in flat low lands. The flood inflicted little or no damage
to pasture lands in the mountainous area. Most of the damaged fields were
scattered in low flat lands, where it was not economical to grow other crops,
and consisted of parts of large fields attached to organized livestock farms
owned and operated by the State Agricultural Enterprises and the Agricultural
Cooperatives.
6.08      Vegetables and Potatoes.  Romania produces large amounts of vege-
tables in large-scale commercial green houses but all of the damaged crops
were grown in open fields. The floods came at a time when the plants were in
their early growing stages as harvests were not expected before October. The
excessive rains and hail arrested growth of the plants in large areas of the
affected farms while productivity of surviving plants was reduced in others.
Tomatoes, potatoes and other vegetables occupied 46,000 ha and no harvests
were expected from 33,600 ha (73%).



- 30 -
6.09      About 69,000 tons of tomatoes and other vegetables, and 49,000 tons
of potatoes were expected to be recovered from less seriously affected areas
but losses would represent about 85% of the planned production of tozaatoes and
other vegetables and 90% of potatoes. The total value of the losses is esti-
mated at Lei 1.1 billion (US$57 million).
6.10      Sugar beets.  These were grown on 30,000 ha of the flooded lands and
planned harvest from these areas was expected to exceed a million tons. The
plants were young and growing and harvesting was not expected until September
and October. The damages were caused by growth -arresting excessive hails and
ground moisture. Only about 264,000 tons would be recovered from the partially
damaged cropped areas but loss represented 75% of the planned output. This
was equivalent to 110,000 tons of refined sugar with a value of about Lei 341
million (US$17 million).
6.11     - Oilseeds.  Sunflower, soybean, linseed, castor, and other oilseeds
occupied 82,000 ha of which 33,600 ha were completely destroyed; the plants
were maturing and were expected to be harvested beginning late August. Yields
on the balance 49,000 ha were reduced by about half primarily due to hails and
excessive ground moisture. About 52,000 tons of oilseeds might have been
harvested from the partially damaged areas but these would represent no more
than 25% of the planned output of 193,000 tons. The total value of the losses
is estimated at Lei 648 million (US$32 million).
6.12      Fruits and Other Crops.  These included grapes, peaches, apricots,
cherries, hops, rice, tobacco and various other crops which were grown on
43,700 ha of the flooded area.  About 10,200 ha were under grapes and 7,500
ha under various fruits; no more than 15% of planned production of grapes and
fruits were expected to be recovered from partially affected areas. The value
of harvests foregone amounts to about Lei 629 million (US$31 million).
Livestock Losses
6.13      About 10,000 heads of cattle, 80,000 pigs, 100,000 sheep and 3 mil-
lion poultry were drowned. Most of the livestock were able to swim to safety
but those which were drowned were either too young and/or were confined in
buildings which were flooded. The losses were worth about Lei 195 million
(US$10 million). The quantitative losses are insignificant compared with
national populations of 5.9 million cattle, 9.0 million pigs, 14.3 million
sheep and 66.5 million poultry, but, the qualitative damages could be sub-
stantial because some of the lost cattle, pigs and sheep were used for breed-
ing and their losses could hamper the planned development of the livestock
sub-sector in the next few years.
Permanent Damages to Tree Crops
6.14      Permanent damages have been done to scattered vineyards, orchards
and hops fields, particularly to trees which were grown on hilly areas. Most
of the damages occurred because of landslides and falling trees caused by ex-
treme erosion. These damages are equivalent to 3,000 ha each of grapes and



- 31 -
fruits and 500 ha of hops with a total value of about Lei 486 million (US$24
million). The value of the loss is obtained by discounting at 10% the net
values of harvests from the permanently damaged trees assuming these trees
would have had 20 more years of productive lives.
Damages to Farm Buildings and Equipment
6.15      The flood has caused about Lei 530 million (US$26 million) worth of
damages to farm buildings and equipment. Some of the buildings were old and
the flood induced the collapse of portions of their walls; others are not as
seriously affected, but the cumulative cost of repairing minor damages to many
farm buildings which are scattered over 1.1 million hectares of flooded area is
substantial. Equipment which was damaged or lost included pumps, sprinklers,
movable irrigation pipes, vegetable and fruit grading machines and electrical
installations.
B. Impact of Agricultural Losses on the Economy
General
6.16      The direct impact on the economy of the lost output of crops and
livestock products would be to reduce the national income by about Lei 6.5
billion (US$325 million) or about 2% of the national income in 1974; this
excludes damages to capital assets. However, the total direct and indirect
impact may be much greater because of the complex inter-relationships among
different sectors and sub-sectors of the economy. Some of the commodities
which were lost would have been exported to earn convertible foreign exchange
which is badly needed to import new technology. Furthermore, the income
foregone would deprive the economy of domestic investment resources and may
seriously hamper planned investments and economic growth in the next few years.
Foreign Trade Impact
6.17      The foreign trade effect of the loss in crop production would be
to reduce exports rather than to induce imports of food and feed. The country
is a net exporter of virtually all of the commodities which have been damaged
by flood. The foreign exchange foregone as a result of reduced volume of



- 32 -
exports of crops alone is estimated at about Lei 4.5 billion (about US$225
million). 1/
6.18      The export losses may reduce the country's capacity to import
capital goods and slow investments in sectors such as industry whose growth
and development is constrained by shortage of convertible foreign exchange.
The industrial sector needs rapid and timely inflow of new technology to help
improve the quality of fast growing output. A substantial amount of conver-
tible foreign currency is required to achieve such an objective.
6.19      The economy would lose about Lei 2.5 billion (US$125 million) in
convertible foreign exchange as a direct result of foregone exports of agri-
cultural products. The indirect impact of such a loss on national income is
not known but it would be substantial.
Impact on Investments
6.20      The current loss in production would have a significant influence
on the achievement of planned investments. The planned national investments
in agriculture and agro-industry in 1976 would cost about Lei 26.6 billion.
About Lei 14.9 billion was expected to be financed from the State budget,
Lei 6.9 billion from "depreciation funds", 2/ Lei 2.2 billion by loans from
the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry and Lei 2.6 billion from the Agri-
cultural Cooperatives savings.
6.21      The flood losses would have no effect on financial flows from BAFI
and from "depreciation allowances" but would reduce the planned flow of funds
from the State budget and the Cooperatives' savings by a total of about Lei 4.1
billion (US$205.0 million).
1/   The volume and value of export  losses are estimated as follows:
(volume in '000 tons, price in Lei/ton and value in Lei million);
Crop                             Volume   FOB Price   Value
Wheat                              493       3,200    1,578.0
Maize                              500       2,300    1,150.0
Tomatoes and Other Vegetables    200         2,800       560.0
Potatoes                           150       1,300       195.0
Sugar beets                        110         500        55.0
Fruits                              30       2,800        84.0
Grapes                              51       2,600       133.0
Oilseeds                           143       5,000       715.0
Total                         -           -      4,470.0 (US$224 million)
2/   This refers to depreciation on investments in the State Agricultural
Enterprises. They are paid by the beneficiary enterprises to separate
account kept by BAFI and used as a source of financing future investments.



- 33 -
6.22      The State would have earned the revenues which are required for
investment financing by buying agricultural commodities at low farmgate prices
and selling them at higher world prices, and from profits earned by the State
Agricultural Enterprises. Revenues from these sources which would be lost as
a result of flood damages would amount to about Lei 2.4 billion (US$120.0
million).
6,23      Normally, surplus production in the Agricultural Cooperatives (i.e.
net of all production costs and incomes to members) is deposited with BAFI to
be used as an important source of investment financing in these farms. The
flood damages are not expected to affect the incomes to members of the co-
operatives but would reduce the investment funds from these farms by about
Lei 1.7 billion (US$85.0 million).
6.24      In the past, investment in agriculture has been low compared to the
sector's size and scope for development. Partly because of this, agriculture
has lagged beh1ind other sectors and labor productivity in agriculture is about
one-third of that in industry. This may have a long-run retarding effect on
the growth and development of the economy. The flood induced shortages of
investment funds could worsen the situation by slowing agricultural invest-
ments in the next few years.
6.25      Although damages to capital assets in agriculture are substantial,
most of the flood losses represent foregone harvests of crops. Of an esti-
mated Lei 7.7 billion (US$384 million) damages, Lei 1.2 billion (US$60 million)
represent losses to capital assets and Lei 6.5 billion (US$325 million) to
crops, stocked cereals and to livestock products. The crop losses alone would
reduce the planned investment program for 1976 by about Lei 4.1 billion (US$205
million).
6.26      The Lei 1.2 billion (US$60 million) damages to capital assets are
scattered among a large number of farms and localities throughout the flooded
areas. Government is capable of carrying out all necessary repairs or recon-
struction of damaged assets and intends to finance the repair of these damages
through its existing agencies in cooperation with the local Governments. This,
however, would involve use of funds which were intended to be utilized for
financing investments planned to be implemented in 1975 and 1976, bringing
the total of investments to be deferred as a result of the floods to Lei 5.3
billion (US$265 million).
C. Losses to Irrigation, Drainage and Flood Protection Works
6.27       Irrigation  Works.  The floods of 1975 caused extensive damages in
the river basins of the Mures, the Olt, the Arges, the Ialomita, the Buzau,
the Trotus and the Bahlui.  Substantial damage was also caused in the Siret
River basin as well as in areas along the Danube. About 1.2 million ha is
irrigated from these rivers. Most of this area is served by schemes, which
consist of small check dams in the river beds and a pumping plant to lift
water to the irrigated area. A few storage dams and barrages on the Olt, the



- 34 -
Arges and the Ialomita provide water for irrigation in addition to other uses,
and two barrages on the Mures provide water mainly for industrial use. Several
pumping stations along the Danube, provide water either for irrigation or for
urban and industrial water supply. Of the aforementioned works, the larger
schemes have suffered smaller damage, while the smaller have suffered relative-
ly large damages. The total value of the loss is estimated at Lei 101.5 mil-
lion (US$5.1), of which damage to earthwork is about 57%, to concrete and
masonry about 32% and to equipment (pumps and transformers) about 11% (Annex 3,
Table 5). Of the total loss, maximum. damage was to the Danube schemes (63%),
and to the works in the Arges basin (21%) and the Ialomita basin (6%).   All
damage is of such a nature that it can be repaired in a short time and before
the next irrigation season (April 1976).
6.28      Drainage Works.  Small surface drainage schemes are located in the
river basins affected by floods, mostly in the irrigated areas. The open
drains overflowed their banks causing extensive damage to the channels and
to some masonry works on these channels. Total damage to drainage works is
estimated at Lei 51.7 million (US$2.6 million), of which about 73% was to
earthwork, 23% to structures and 4% to equipment (Annex 3, Table 5). Rela-
tively high damage was suffered by the drainage works in the Olt basin (31%)
and the Arges basin (26%), while other basins suffered minor damages. These
damages are also of a minor nature and can be repaired quickly.
6.29      Flood Protection Works.  Because of floods that were experienced
several times in the past 50 years in many river basins of Romania, dykes or
levees were constructed along many reaches of these rivers and their tribu-
taries to protect urban and industrial property and in the case of the Danube,
also to protect large agricultural areas. Along the Mures, the Olt, the Arges
(including the Dimbovita), the Ialomita (including the Prahova), and the Buzau
rivers, about 160 km of flood protection dykes exist, whereas along the Danube
river, over 1,000 km of levees have been constructed in the past. The 1975
floods have caused extensive damage to the dykes along the smaller rivers and
lesser damage to the Danube levees. Total cost of repairing this damage is
estimated at Lei 164.5 million (US$8.2 million), of which about 86% was dis-
tributed in the basins of the Mures (27%), the Arges (21%), the Bahlui (12%),
the Siret (10%), the Danube (8%) and the Buzau (8) (Annex 3, Table 5).  A part
of the damaged dykes will be restored to their original design (mostly along
the Danube), but a larger part will be reconstructed to improved design in
accordance with the currently available long-term plans for flood protection.
D. Long-Term Programming for Water Control
Need for a National Water Control Program
.30     The ,975 floods have demonstrated the need for a national program
for water control, and the Government has already begun a major reorganization
or responsibilities for water management in Romania. Full responsibility for
th-is work. has now been assigned to the National Water Council (NWC).  This
agency used to be under the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAIA),



- 35 -
but from July 1975, its control has been shifted to the Council of Ministers.
Other tasks of NWC include preparation of five-year development plans, in
accordance with the approved long-term programs, coordination and control of
all activities related to water management and licensing and monitoring all
construction activity in the water sector including licensing of operation
and regualtion procedures for completed water projects.
0.31      The Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (IMH) and the Institute
of Design and Research (IDR), both of which are under NWC, assist NWC in its
planning tasks. Its five regional offices and 39 sub-offices (one in each
Judet or district) carry out the water management functions.  1MH is respons-
ible to maintain and operate all meteorological and hydrological data observa-
tion stations, to analyze the collected data and to feed all necessary data
to the planning staff of nWC and other institutes.  IDR is the main technical
organization, which carries out all studies and prepares the long-term plans
and programs. Whenever necessary for its work, IDR seeks assistance from
other specialized institutes such as the survey and design institutes for land
reclamation works, hydroelectric works, hydraulic research, etc. These in-
stitutes and agencies appear to be staffed with qualified and experienced
engineers, scientists, economists and other specialists. The reports produced
by NWC and other institutes on water development projects appear to be quite
comprehensive as indicated by a list of chapters (Annex 3, Table 6) that are
included in such reports, but the mission was unable to appraise fully the
quality of the planning efforts underway.
6.32      After a report is finalized by IDR, with assistance from other in-
stitutes, it is cleared by NWC through a committee on which all concerned
ministries are represented. It is then presented to the Council of Ministers,
after whose approval the plan is ready for implementation.
6.33      The Government is currently concentrating its efforts on preparing
flood protection plans for basins (excluding the Danube basin) which are
most flood prone, including the Mures, Olt, Arges, Ialomita, and Buzau which
were hardest hit in the 1975 floods. The Mures Basin planning effort is the
most comprehensive that has yet been carried out, and will soon be available
for Bank review. Other plans are in varying stages of preparation for each
of the major river basins in the country.
6.34      The Government has also included in its flood program about $2
million of hydrometeorological equipment consisting of a flood warning and
data gathering system. This equipment includes: automatic stations to trans-
mit data on precipitations and air temperatures at 74 isolated points;
automatic stations to transmit data on water levels, precipitations and air
temperatures at 70 isolated points; radio relay stations at 20 points to
secure radio connections between installation points of the automatic stations
and the collection and warning centers (control centers); and other related
equipment, plus testing apparatus for checking and repair of electronic in-
stallations. This equipment is needed to support the planning operations of
NWC outlined above.

Flood Protection Plans for Basins Most Damaged in 1975
6.35      General.  Since 1970, NWC and other design institutes are engaged
on preparing long-term development programs for all river basins in Romania
with a view to ultimately provide up to 85%. protection from a 100-year (in
some cases a 200-year) flood. Priority is being given to those river basins,
where economic losses from the past floods have been higher and where damaging
floods have occurred more frequently.  For some basins (like the Upper Mures),
planning has been completed, while for others it is in various stages of com-
pletion. The proposed works consist of storage dams (both multipurpose and
for flood control only), river channel improvement (widening of river channel
and protection of its banks against erosive action of the floods) and flood
protection dykes. Construction of complete programs will be spread over 15
to 25 years, but in order to provide as much protection to valuable indus-
trial and urban centers as is possible in the period prior to completion of
storage dams, river channel improvement and protection dykes are planned to
be constructed in several reaches of many rivers in the next five years
(1976-1980). These works, which are a part of the long term program, by
themselves would provide protection against floods of a lesser magnitude
(varying from 20 years to 50 years).
6.36      The Mures Basin Program.  The Mures river (para 2.06) has a catch-
ment area of 27,800 km2, of which the area of the upper basin above Alba
Iulia, where its three main tributaries - Tirnava Mare, Tirnava Mica and Aries
loin, is 19,200 km2 or 69%.  Of this about 200,000 ha are subjected to flood-
ing from the rivers, 85,000 ha require drainage facilities and 850,000 ha need
soil erosion control works. Because its tributaries are located in an area
of high rainfall (1,000 mm to 1,300 mm), the Mures river gets substantially
high floods every 3rd or 4th year. In 1970, the river and its tributaries
experienced the worst flood on record, when a peak flow of 2,450 m3/sec was
observed at Alba Iulia: almost all tributaries also carried the highest dis-
charge on record. This flood caused an extensive damage to industrial, urban
and agricultural areas and destroyed long stretches of lines of communication.
Directly recorded losses amounted to Lei 1,700 million (US$85.0 million), of
wqhich 64%o. was in industry.  The indirect losses were of about the same magni-
tude. After this flood, Government decided to undertake a comprehensive
study of the Upper Mures basin and to prepare an overall development plan
including flood control and flood protection works for important urban and
industrial areas. Government also requested UNDP to provide technical assist-
ance for this study, because its complexity called for the application of ad-
vanced technicues.  UNDP approved an assistance program of US$1.0 million,
and by now has :rovided specialized hydrologic, flood forecasting and office
equiprMent  specialist technical advice in the fields of hvdrology and flood
forecasting, water resources planning, including use of simulated models,
so-l and water conservation and land reclamation, agricultural, agro-
industrial anc. forestry development and water pollution control. With this
assistance, Gover-mment has finalized a long term program for the overall de-
v7e.opmert of the Miures basin, which has been phased over five 5-year develop-
:.er,- e ans ar.c. wll be realized by year 2000.

6.37      The long-term program for the upper Mures basin consists of:
(a)  16 storage dams with a total capacity of 1,095 Mm3, of which
six (949 Im3) are multipurpose (including hydroelectric power)
and the remaining basically for flood control;
(b) two reservoirs in natural depressions (capacity 43 Mm3);
(c) river channel improvement and flood protection works in 14
reaches, protecting 16 major urban and industrial centers
and 27 rural communities, with partial protection to 29
other rural communities. These works will also protect 127
km of national highways and 78 km of railroad track; and
(d)  other works comprising drainage facilities: soil erosion con-
trol, water supply, fish development and anti-pollution works.
These works are estimated to cost about Lei 14,500 million (US$725 million).
The storage dams, when fully operational, will reduce the peak volume of a
100-year flood by 46% (equivalent to 270 Mm3). All flood control and pro-
tection works are expected to reduce the flood damages, such as those suf-
fered in 1970 or 1975, by 95%,. During 1976-1980, five storage dams, one
reservoir in a natural depression (listed at Annex 3, Table 7) and channel
improvement and flood protection works in several river reaches totalling
117 km (listed at Annex 3, Table 8) are planned for construction. The cost
of these works, which are illustrated in Map 11833, is estimated at Lei 2,850
million (US$142.5 million), of which the cost of channel improvement and
flood protection works to be completed in 1976 and 1977 amounts to Lei 596
million (US$29.8 million).
6.38      The Olt Basin Program.  The Olt river (para 2.08) has a catchment
area of 24,000 ckm2, of which about 13,000 km2 (54%) lies in the upper part
of the basin above Turnu Rosu. NWC, with assistance from other institutes
especially ISPII has also prepared a long-term program of development in this
basin. No flood control work has so far been carried out in this basin, al-
though about 58,000 ha are subjected to floods. About 240,000 ha require
surface drainage works and about 220,000 ha need soil erosion control works.
During 1976-1980, two multipurpose storage dams (capacity 43 Mm3) (Annex 3,
Table 7) are planned for construction, and 130 km of flood protection dikes
and channel improvement (Annex 3, Table 8) will be carried out. Total cost
of this five year program is estimated at Lei 622 million (US$31.1 million),
of which the cost of channel improvement works and dikes, which are to be
constructed in 1976 and 1977, is Lei 200 million (US$10 million).
6.39      The Arges Basin Program.  The Arges river (para 2.09) has a catch-
ment of 12,600 km2, of which about 145,000 ha are subjected to floods, 175,000
ha require drainage works and 140,000 ha need soil erosion control works.  A
long range development program for this basin has been completed by NWC and
other institutes.  Four storage dams, without any capacity for flood control,
have already been completed.  During the next five years (1976-1980), 4 stor-
age dams (capacity 227 Mm3) are planned for construction, of wqhich 3 will have



- 38 -
a flood control capacity of 39 Mm3 (Annex 3, Table 7). In addition channel
improvement works and flood protection dikes (length 315 kmi) are planned
(Annex 3, Table 8). Total cost of these works is estimated at Lei 3,962
million (US$198.1 million), of which Lei 172 million (US$8.6 million) will
be spent on flood protection works to be completed in 1976 and 1977.
6.40       The Ialomita Basin Program.  The Ialomita river (para 2.10) has a
catchment of 10,400 km2, of which about 66,000 ha are subjected to floods,
397,000 ha need drainage and 146,000 ha require soil erosion control works.
A long range development program for this basin has been completed by NWC.
Two storage dams (capacity 65 Mmh3), without any capacity allocation for flood
control, have already been completed; one of these needs some repairs, which
are planned to be carried out in 1976.  During 1976-1930, one storage dam
(capacity 98 Mrn3) with a flood control capacity of 23 En3 will be constructed.
In addition channel improvement and flood protection works will be carried
out in river reaches totalling 84 kirn, and drainage works in 60,000 ha. Total
cost of this program is estimated at Lei 1,569 million (US$78.5 million)
(Annex 3, Tables 7 and 8), of which the channel improvement and flood pro-
tection works to be carried out in the first 2 years (1976-1977) will cost
Lei 208 million (US$10.4 million).
6.41       The Buzau Basin Program.  The Buzau river (para 2.11) has a catch-
ment of 5,600 kn2, of which about 140,000 ha need drainage and 210,000 ha re-
quire soil erosion control works.  During 1976-1980, only one dam with a
capacity of 110 mm3 is planned. Construction of this dam, which has a flood
control capacity of 36 Mm3, was started in early 1975 prior to the floods.
Total cost of this project is estimated at Lei 767 million (US$38.4 million)
(Annex 3, Table 7). No channel improvement and flood protection works are
planned for this river basin during the next 5 years.
Summary of Programs for 1976-1980
6.42       For the five river basins of the Nures, the Olt, the Arges, the
Ialomita and the Buzau, the work program planned for the next five years
(1976-1980) is listed in Annex 3, Tables 7 and 8 and summarized below:
