                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's main objectives are to: (a) improve the capacity for increased agricultural yields through support to high priority rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation
                         infrastructure; (b) reduce the risk of damage from flooding to land, crops, property, infrastructure as well as reducing risk of life loss from flooding in project areas; and
                         (c) improve water resources management and strengthen the associated water resource management institutions and policies.
