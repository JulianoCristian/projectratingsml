                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's main objectives are to: (a) improve the capacity for increased agricultural yields through support to high priority rehabilitation of drainage and
                         irrigation infrastructure; (b) reduce the risk of damage from flooding to land, crops, property, infrastructure as well as reducing risk of life loss from flooding in
                         project areas; and (c) improve water resources management and strengthen the associated water resource management institutions and policies.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is continuing to make good progress towards meeting its development objectives. Adoption of the Water Law in late spring 2010 and project restructuring of February
                         2011 removed the last obstacles holding up activities on the Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building component. Activities on rehabilitation of flood control infrastructure

                         progressed well and according to the plan, while works on development of minor irrigation schemes still lag behind due to time lost in adoption of the enabling legislation.

                         Since the project start, almost 160,000 hectares country-wide have been protected under fourteen completed flood protection schemes. Eight drainage rehabilitation contracts have
                         been completed and production should increase under those schemes by the next cropping season. Civil works on ten flood control and drainage rehabilitation schemes are ongoing.
