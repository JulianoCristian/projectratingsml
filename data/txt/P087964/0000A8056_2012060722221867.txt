                         component continues steadily, with activities on drafting Water Users Association's relevant legal documents gathering speed. The works on development of minor irrigation schemes
                         continue to lag behind due to time lost in adoption of the enabling legislation and current difficulties in raising the end-user's counterpart financing.

                         Since the project start, over 380,000 hectares country-wide have been protected from floods, providing an increased level of protection to over 1 million people.
