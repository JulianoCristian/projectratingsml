The\n            river's embankment was reinforced and heightened.\n            Repairing drainage canals allowed farmers to irrigate and it\n            increased the safety of those living near river beds and\n            dykes. Around Serbia, more than 160,000 hectares have been\n            protected from flooding, and over 300,000 people have\n            directly benefitted from the project."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T06:28:04Z"}
