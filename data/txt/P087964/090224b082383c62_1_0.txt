                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's main objectives are to: (a) improve the capacity for increased agricultural yields through support to high priority rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation
                         infrastructure; (b) reduce the risk of damage from flooding to land, crops, property, infrastructure as well as reducing risk of life loss from flooding in project areas; and
                         (c) improve water resources management and strengthen the associated water resource management institutions and policies.

                         resource management institutions and policies - is moderately satisfactory. Activities related to civil works on a number of flood protection and minor irrigation schemes are still
                         ongoing, with several of of these likely to be completed before the Project closing date. This particularly relates to works on 2 flood control/drainage rehabilitation schemes and 3
                         irrigation scheme developments.

                         In spite of the challenges faced by the Project, it has already achieved the following: (i) rehabilitated over 40 flood control and drainage schemes, covering 440 thousands ha of land
                         in the areas of most developed infrastructure (over 20% of the country's most productive agricultural land), and providing increased level of flood protection to approximately 1.1
                         million people (which represents over 15% of country's population); (ii) supported the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management in preparation of the framework Water
                         Law, enacted in 2011; (iii) strengthened the water management institutions by providing participation at training courses related to EU water management policy and practices; (iv)
                         supported irrigation sector reform by drafting the new Law on Water Users Associations; (v) provided priority rehabilitation works on 2 pilot Water User Associations; (vi) provided
                         support on establishment and training members of 26 Water Users Associations, thus laying grounds for further activities in the Serbian irrigation sector; (vii) increased the national
                         capacity for reaction to severe weather events by providing national Hydro Met services with high-capacity weather radar, covering around 60% of Serbian territory.
