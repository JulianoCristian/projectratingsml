sustainability, high institutional development\n            impact, and highly satisfactory performances by both the\n            Bank and the Borrower. The project's achievements\n            included both health outcomes and institutional changes.  In\n            terms of health outcomes the project has made contributions\n            in four areas: extending the primary care model to nearly\n            100 percent of the population; reducing the demand for\n            hospitalization in areas of avoidable morbidity; reduction\n            of infant mortality; reduction of  hospital infections\n            through improved monitoring and evaluation under the\n            management agreements and the development of quality\n            assurance mechanisms. With regard to institutional changes,\n            the project demonstrates progress in terms of the\n            introduction of the PHC model, the separation of functions,\n            changes in financial resource management, and the\n            introduction of performance based payment systems. The\n            lessons learned are divided into overall comments on project\n            design and implementation; issues related to the separation\n            of functions, resource allocation and reimbursement\n            mechanisms; and the redefined primary health care model."}, "docdt": "2003-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
