These reforms must be\n            continued and consolidated to provide a base for sustained\n            and equitable development. The government aims to improve\n            the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of health\n            services. This project will support the Government's\n            effort to implement critical policy, institutional and\n            operational reforms. It will assist the Costa Rican Social\n            Security System (CCSS) institutional reforms at the central\n            level; support the implementation of a redefined model of\n            primary health care which would reinforce national priority\n            health care programs, while being responsive to regional and\n            local programs, and address operational and management\n            issues such as clinic protocols, referral systems, staffing\n            patterns, and monitoring and evaluation; strengthen the CCSS\n            financial complex; and prepare for the establishment of a\n            National Surveillance and Quality Control Laboratory. The\n            project will also explore alternatives and establish\n            parameters for further refinement in the sector. It will lay\n            fiscal and strucutral frameworks for complete reform of the\n            entire health sector. These measures will have far reaching\n            medium and long term impacts on the social security and\n            health care provision systems in the country. It represents\n            the first step in the restructuring of the CCSS to improve\n            efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the social\n            security system."}, "docdt": "1993-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
