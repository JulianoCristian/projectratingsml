 assistance and supporting the building blocks of larger public investment programs across a range of sectors.Ã¢ÂÂ

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Progress on Component 1: Emergency Support to Core Government Functions in Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) - US$13.0
 million:

 1.1: Financing of eligible civil service salaries in non-security sectors in Mogadishu – US$11.47 million

 This was expected to cover payment of salaries from July to December 2014 at an estimated amount of US$1,911,667 per month for 3,909 staff based
 on the FGS 2014 budget.

 July and August salaries have been paid while salary payment for September commenced on 25 October 2014.

 1.2. Financing to subject matter experts and allowances US$0.75 million Ten Subject Matter Experts have been confirmed for payments under the
 RCRF Project based on the terms of their on-going contracts with government. The related SMEs are three SMEs in the Prime Minister’s Office; SME
 for procurement, Debt Management, Inland Revenue, Customs, Budget, Central Bank and the Auditor General. New contracts were entered into for six
 months from July to December 2014 to be financed under the RCRF Project. The total contract sum is about US$450,000.

 1.3. Financing of eligible non-salary recurrent cost expenses for 4 MDAs US0.78million This activity has not commenced. Government has set up a
 Payment System Reform Task Force who amongst others, are tasked to set up systems for approval of non-salary recurrent costs and lay out criteria
 for eligible expenditure in this category. Until this system is put in place; this activity cannot be approved for reimbursement. The Payment System
 Reform Taskforce is made up of the Director General of Finance, Accountant General, Budget Director, PFM Coordinator, Chief of Staff to the Minister,
 and a Senior Advisor. The team will define a reformed payment process and associated criteria which must be met before expenditures in this category
 can be considered eligible for reimbursement. This will include ex ante controls, and clear separation of roles between commitment, procurement and
 payment authorization and execution. The EAFS manual forms a good basis for the work of the Taskforce which is expected to develop a draft guideline
 and benefit from inputs from the Monitoring Agent. The draft guideline has not been produced.

 Progress on Component 2: Strengthening Systems for Expanded Operations and Service Delivery (US$1.0 million)

 2.1 Expanding support for recurrent cost expenditures to other regions (Puntland and the Interim Jubbaland Administration) US$0.225 million. Two
 consultants have been engaged and have commenced mission to the regions in October. The regions covered are Puntland and Jubbaland. A
 stakeholder workshop is planned for verification and dissemination of the report. The activity is planned to be completed in January 2015.

 2.2: Reliability and Integrity of payroll US$0.3 The government informed the team that a related activity is in progress and being carried out by the
 Monitoring Agent under a different contract. It is pertinent that there is clarity on the details of this as well as the outcome which would form the basis of
 this engagement under the RCRF project.

 2.3: Strengthening support to the Social Sectors (Education and Health) US$0.350 million Terms of Reference has been agreed and in the government
 is in the process of finalizing the single source engagement of a firm.

 2.4: Strengthening the External Affairs Fiduciary Section (EAFS) US$0.125 million The government is engaging a consultant, as part of the EAFS team,
 for extensive M&E of the donor activities.

 Progress on Component 3: Project Management and Coordination (US$ 2.0 million)

 Project Management (EAFS; FMU Consultants) All contract for seven EASF/FMU consultants approved for seven months and ending in February 2014
 at project closure.

 Audit: The project is in the process of engaging an external auditor to cover all three active projects in Somalia. The mission had discussions with the
 Auditor and because of on-going challenges in strengthening of the functions of the Auditor General, the project would engage and external auditor to
 audit the three Bank active projects in Somalia.

 Operations (Training, vehicle and other operational costs): Vehicle specification sent in by the Project Management has been reviewed and approved by
 the Bank. Thirty three government staff from the Ministry of Finance (External Affairs Fiduciary Unit) and procurement unit were trained on Bank

 operations, financial management, procurement and disbursements during this supervision mission. The training also included an exposure to the
 Somalia Financial management Information Systems.

 The component includes an unallocated amount of US$1 million. This is not allocated and emerging needs will be reviewed during the December 2014
 implementation support mission.

 Disbursement: As of October 27, 2014, out of the signed Grant Agreement amount of US$6 million, IDA has disbursed US$5,288,789.18 (88 percent)
 into the Designated Account. This is from two Withdrawal Applications; first for the initial deposit of US$ 4 million and for a replenishment of
 US$1,288,789.18 mostly in respect of the July salaries. The government is in the process of preparing and submitting Withdrawal Application three
 mostly in respect of the August salaries. The government and Bank are expected to sign an additional Grant Agreement (GA) for US$10 million as soon
 as funds are available from MPF donors. A draft of this GA has been prepared. Unless the funds are available by early November 2014 and the GA
 signed, the project may not be able to pay for November and December salaries and other project expenses.

 Support by Monitoring Agent: The GoN have extended the contract of the MA to March 2014 to cover the entire project period for the RCRF Project.
 The MA has prepared Advisory Opinion which formed the basis of replenishing the Withdrawal Application two in respect of the July salaries. The
 Opinion advised a reimbursement of US$1,228,758 as presented by the implementing team in the Statement of Expenditure. The Advisory Opinion for
 Withdrawal Application three in respect of August salaries in being finalized
 a) Project is for US$16 million but Grant Agreement was signed for US$6 million due to insufficient funds in the MPF account. With the payments of
 additional funds from MPF donors, an amendment to the Grant Agreement to increase the signed amount to US$16 million.
