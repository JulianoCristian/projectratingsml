F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Development Objective for the Series of Projects is to enable the Somali Government
to achieve reliable and transparent financing of critical civil service operations to help
strengthen the legitimacy of the state. The Development Objective of this first Project in
the Series is to finance and support an operational payroll and payment system for the non-
security sectors. This aligns with the MPF objective "to foster socio-economic recovery
and stabilization by supporting the payment of civil service salaries, and the running costs
of government institutions; financing technical assistance and supporting the building
blocks of larger public investment programs across a range of sectors."

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
There were no revisions in the PDO when the Project was restructured and the Grant
Agreement amended in February 2015.

                Partially achieved. This indicator was initially in percentage terms (target being
                – salaries of 80 percent civil servants paid on time) but was later revised to
                ‘reduction in the days of delay up to 12 days’. The payment lag consistently
                reduced for the first six months of the project. As of December 2014, the original
                closing date, the payment lag was 8 days from 58 days in June 2014 when the
Comments
                project took over. However, with the restructuring of the project, there were

                financial accounting software (SFMIS) which was implemented in a short period
                of time and was expected to improve the controls around payrolls. The process
                of loading all civil servants’ data on the SFMIS and ensuring the controls were
                effective, delayed payments in February 2015 to 58 days; the data migration
                over may have attributed to the delay. Though, the last payroll was paid in 58

                          11
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Federal Republic of Somalia has experienced conflicts for two decades
since 1991. This destroyed legitimate institutions, created widespread vulnerability and
undermined basic service delivery severely impacting the human development outcomes.
Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and human development outcomes were among
the lowest in the world with the estimated per capita GDP at $284 against a sub-Saharan
Africa average of $1,300 per capita. Somalia therefore needed stability and investment in
legitimate institutions to facilitate basic service delivery, infrastructure financing and
inclusive growth. The August 2012 transfer of power from a transitional to a full federal
government revived hopes in the country’s ability to move from fragility towards
sustainable stability and improved governance and triggered international re-engagement.

2.     New Deal for Somalia – “The Somali Compact”: The September 2013 Brussels
Conference provided a stimulus for a more sustainable and committed international re-
engagement with Somalia and endorsed a new Deal pledging US $ 2.4 billion against the
Somali Compact (the “Compact”) successfully mobilizing international financial support
to be delivered in part through a new financial facility: The Somalia Development and
Reconstruction Facility (SDRF), which the Bank played a key role in establishing.

3.      Bank Group re-engagement: The Bank re-established formal relations with FGS
in late 2012 and delivered a new strategy for Somalia to the Board in December 2013 –
Somalia Interim Strategy Note FY14-16 (ISN). This aligned the Bank work with the
framework of the new Somali Compact that was committed to prioritize peace and state-
building goals necessary to address the binding constraints to poverty reduction. Since
then, the Bank developed an intensive dialogue with the Somali authorities, putting in place
a new phase of operations. The World Bank established the Multi-Partner Fund (MPF1) to
implement the ISN. The Phase I Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing (RCRF) Project is
the first MPF grant made operational which reflects the particular and emergency
conditions facing the FGS at the sensitive point of Somalia transition.

Economic and Sector Context

4.      Somalia’s economy is shaped by sustained conflict and remains vulnerable to
shocks. In the absence of state regulation and institutions, a vibrant informal sector had
developed; however the absence of regulation coupled with elite capture in key economic
sectors undermined the inclusivity of economic development. The overall macroeconomic
situation was difficult to assess due to severe data limitations with accurate national
accounts data not being available for the whole of Somalia. The economy was largely
dollarized and the Somali shilling (used only for smaller transactions) was volatile. With



1The MPF is a discrete fund designed to consolidate donor funding under government leadership and accountability. It
was anchored within the wider aid architecture set out in the Compact with the estimates of MPF pledges between
US$70 - US$140 million in the first two years, with potential for further annual contributions thereafter of between
US$20 - US$70 million.


                                                        12
little or no control over domestic money supply and little foreign reserves, the Central Bank
had no influence over the exchange rate.

5.      Weak fiscal Situation: The FGS’s 2014 budget projected an expenditure of
US$182.3 million (excluding repayments of arrears and advances of US$30.42 million) and
revenue of US$188.5 million, resulting in a nominal surplus of US$6.2 million. However,
with the repayment of arrears and advances being factored in, there was a ‘fiscal gap’ of
US$ 24.2 million. The budget remained heavily focused on meeting the Government’s
operating obligations with 45 percent (US$ 91.0 million) of the recurrent expenditure being
allocated for compensation of employees. Disaggregated by sector, 47 percent of
compensation of employees is allocated to the security sector, 37 percent goes to the
administration sector, 10 percent to the economic sector and 7 percent to the social sector.

Rationale of World Bank Involvement and Link to the ISN

6.     The proposed operation responds to the need to support FGS in the context of
a highly fragile transition. The combination of stabilizing the budget through salary
payment and establishment of a core payroll system provided a financial and institutional
platform for the Government, corresponding with Strategic Objective I (Strengthening
Core Economic Institutions) of the ISN. This operation provided a natural platform,
compared to sectoral projects, to engage the Government in dialogue on how the overall
macro-fiscal framework supports the country institutional development and poverty
reduction objectives.

7.      The Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing (RCRF) program, implemented under
the modality of a “series of projects3”, is a key element in a wider effort to support the
Somali transition through the gradual establishment of accountable and effective core
government institutions. This Project (Phase I in the series) was an emergency operation
in response to the Government’s request for six-month financing support within the 2014
budget and was intended to facilitate the strengthening of core government functions and
basic service delivery. The project while supporting new planned public financial
management and public administration reforms in Somalia through other Bank Projects
(existing and planned) would lay the groundwork for future operations (“Phase II project”)
consolidating the gains made under Phase I, and moving to a more structured approach to
recurrent cost financing.

8.      Given the exceptional circumstances surrounding the new institutions in
Mogadishu (on-going insecurity and severe capacity gaps) this project has been processed
as an emergency operation under paragraph 12 of Operational Policy/Bank Procedures
(OP/BP) 10.0. Somalia meets these requirements because it: (i) has experienced violent
conflicts for the past twenty years; (ii) is experiencing conflict with an active Al-Shabab


2 This amount includes US$21.4 million of payroll arrears.
3 Series of Projects: In cases of single-borrower sequential Projects, documentation for the first Project presents the
rationale for a phased approach, the potential benefits and risks, the overarching DOs for the series, overall expected
results, and timeline for expected completion of each phase and the series. Subsequently, each Project in the series is
prepared and appraised individually, taking into account the performance to date of the preceding Project(s) in the series
–Annexure 2 of the Project Appraisal Document.

insurgency; and (iii) is at risk of future violence. Additionally, there was an urgent need
to support the country by financing its recurrent operational costs because: (i) public
revenue generation is still very low; (ii) the future expenditure needs of the Government
will increase as the reconstruction proceeds; and (iii) the existing SFF4 facility for recurrent
cost financing was available only up to June 2014 and FGS was unable to sustain the
payment of salaries beyond that period. A failure to ensure a seamless transition of salary
payments from the SFF to the World Bank-administered RCRF would undermine public
confidence in the FGS.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.      The Development Objective for the Series of Projects (SOP) is to enable the Somali
Government to achieve reliable and transparent financing of critical civil service operations
to help strengthen the legitimacy of the state. The Project Development Objective is to
finance and support an operational payroll and payment system for the non-security sectors.
This aligns with the MPF fund-level objective which is “to foster socio-economic recovery
and stabilization by supporting the payment of civil service salaries, and the running costs
of government institutions; financing technical assistance and supporting the building
blocks of larger public investment programs across a range of sectors.”

10.     The higher level objectives to which the Project contributes are: Federal
revenue is insufficient to cover civil service salaries and specialized instruments are needed
to finance the fiscal gap given Somalia's high risk context. The MPF's recurrent cost
window provides a platform for performance benchmarking and a policy dialogue platform
related to the establishment of a track record of economic governance. This project
supports: macro-fiscal stability by providing predictable financing of salary payments and
recurrent costs, and the injection of high capacity human resources; increase of government
legitimacy through support of service delivery; institutional capacity building; and
provides a financing stop-gap to allow government to have a financial buffer in case of
unforeseen but likely internal and external shocks.

PDO-Level Results

11.    The key results of the project were: (a) improved effectiveness of payroll controls;
(b) support the budgetary needs of the FGS to pay regular salaries to civil servants; (c)
smooth transition in reimbursement of civil servants’ salaries from SFF to RCRF program
funding; and (d) inject cash into the economy and enable government funds to be
concentrated on providing basic social services.




4The Government of Norway (GoN) had through the Special Financing Facility (SFF) financed a start-up recurrent cost
operation since August 2013. The SFF financed civil service salaries and small employment-generating works; based on
dialogue between the Government of Norway, FGS and the Bank.

PDO Level Results Indicators

12.    The PDO level results of the project would be measured using a combination of
three key indicators and six intermediate results indicators stated below:

Key Indicators

a) Number of civil servants in non-security sectors paid;
b) Percentage of registered civil servants salaries in non-security sectors paid on time;
   and
c) Number of payroll verifications undertaken by independent monitoring agent.

Intermediate Results Indicators: (a) withdrawal applications reviewed and approved by
independent agent ; (b) number of monthly updates of the personnel and payroll databases
in line with agreed eligibility criteria undertaken; (c) number of monthly payroll reports
published on MOF website; (d) operations Manual for external assistance fiduciary support
updated and approved; (e) office of the Accountant General equipped and upgraded for
payroll monitoring; and (f) verified reimbursements of non-salary recurrent cost
expenditures

1.3 Revised PDO

13.     The PDO was not revised during the Project period. Changes were made to the
indicators and/or the corresponding end targets consequent to Project restructuring in
December 2014:

Indicator 1: Number of civil servants in non-security sectors paid - A revision
downwards of the end target from the initial projection of 3,909 staff to 3,600 staff.

Indicator 2: Reduction in days of delay in payments of Civil servants salaries in non-
security sector - The indicator name was amended and rephrased and the unit of measured
changed from percentages to days. This reflects an indicator based on the lag between the
statutory and actual pay date of the salaries.

Indicator 3: Number of Payroll verifications undertaken by independent agent - With
the new closing date extension by two months, the end target value for this indicator is also
increased to six.

The intermediate results indicators were also amended to reflect the changes due to the
extension of project closure date/ delays in activities being carried out under sub-
component 1.3.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.    The main beneficiary of the Project is the Ministry of Finance, FGS.




                                             15
1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Emergency Support of Core Government Functions in Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (US$13.0 million)

15.    Sub-Component 1:1: Payment of salaries of eligible civil servants in Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs) (US$11.47 million). The project would support the
FGS to maintain core government functions during the July to December 2014 period by
financing the salaries of about 3,900 non-security sector5 civil servants in the MDAs.

16.     Sub-Component 1:2: Payment of salaries and allowances to Subject Matter Experts
in selected MDAs (US$0.75 million): The project would finance the salaries and allowances
of a cadre of SMEs who are largely recruited from the Somali Diaspora and hold key
positions and functions in government. These functionaries include the Auditor General,
Accountant General, experts in the Office of the Prime Minister; Ministry of Finance;
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation; Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs;
National Civil Service Commission; and specialists in budgeting, debt management,
Central Bank of Somalia, etc.

17.     Sub-Component 1:3: Financing of Eligible Non-Salary Recurrent Costs in selected
MDAs- (US$0.78 million): The project would support strengthening of controls for non-
salary recurrent costs expenditures through pilot support in four MDAs i.e. Ministry of
Finance, Office of the Accountant General, Office of the Auditor General and the Civil
Service Commission.

Component 2: Strengthening Systems for Expanded Operations and Service Delivery
(US$ 1.0 million).

18.    Sub-component 2.1: (US$0.225 million): Technical assistance for assessment,
review and analysis of salaries of civil servants in specific regions.

19.    Sub-component 2.2 (US$0.3 million): Carrying out a program of activities to
increase the reliability and integrity of the civil service payroll, e.g. supporting the Civil
Service Commission to develop and improve its operational processes and developing
human resource tools.

20.    Sub-component 2.3 (US$0.35 million): Technical assistance for assessment, review
and analysis of teachers and civil servants in the health sector including developing
databases and detailed operational guidelines and supply of equipment.

21.     Sub-component 2.4: (US$0.125 million): Providing technical assistance to the
office of the Accountant General for fiduciary management.



5 The following are considered core security actors and not eligible for financing under the Project: armed forces,

police, paramilitary forces, gendarmeries, presidential guards, intelligence and security forces, coast guards and custom
authorities.



                                                           16
Component 3: Project Management and Coordination (US$2.0 million)

22.    This includes: (a) technical assistance for Project management; (b) capacity
building for Project management including training of Project staff; (c) carrying out of
audit on the Project; and (d) financing of operating costs.

1.6 Revised Components

23.     As the result of a restructuring, the Project was extended for two months and US$2
million reallocated to component 1 to pay for salaries for the additional two months. The
support to strengthening the reliability and integrity of the payroll (sub-component 2.2)
was dropped as this was being supported by another development partner. The contract for
the Monitoring Agent was extended by the Government of Norway from December 2014
to February 2015. As a result, the project allocation under this component for monitoring
agent support from January 2015 to the project closure was not required and the
restructuring dropped this activity (sub-component 2.4).

1.7 Other significant changes

24.     The original Grant Agreement (GA) was executed for US$6.0 million 6 .
Amendment to the GA was made vide amendment dated November 10, 2014 increasing
the total Grant amount to US$16.0 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis:

25.     Backdrop of the intense and urgent needs of Somalia: Somalia’s population of
around 10 million remains vulnerable to shocks in the context of continuing conflict,
famines and destruction of legitimate institutions over the past two decades. Several
indicators are extremely low e.g. 2.3 million live on the margins of food insecurity, poverty
rates are at 73 percent and extreme poverty at 43 percent of the population. Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita is estimated at US$288 and thousands have lost their lives to
droughts and epidemics. Given its weak fiscal position, the FGS would have been unable
to sustain payment of salaries to civil servants.

26.     The multi-faceted risk of engagement in the Country: these include civilian conflict,
political unrest, and insurgency. On the governance front the key financial institutions were

extremely weak. The UN Monitoring Report7 for 2012 refers to questionable payments by
the CBS, diversion of port revenue, and misuse of the fiduciary agent model amongst others.
Based on the Corruption Perception Index, Transparency International has rated Somalia
as the most corrupt country, out of total 175 countries, since year 2012. In this backdrop
the most significant operational risk was restrictions on travel on Bank staff due to security
concerns and therefore a diminished ability to supervise an Investment Project Financing
(IPF) operation. Assessments highlighted the need for medium range capacity support
across the entire PFM cycle (budgeting, accounting, payments, audit) be it the legal
framework or implementation aspects.

27.      Justification for engagement in the Country despite the very high risk: Given the
fragile state of the economy where the FGS would have been unable to sustain payment of
civil servants’ salaries, there was an intense need for quick and continuing infusion of funds
into the Somali economy to prevent a possible collapse. Had basic services not been
maintained, insurgent groups could have again tried to establish their dominance over the
land and resources. The Bank as part of the larger Donor community needed to engage
with Somalia given the needs identified and despite the high risk – as mentioned in the ISN,
the risk of international inaction in Somalia was even higher.

28.    The Bank intervention through this Project was particularly responsive to the
request of the FGS as the SFF was coming to an end and there was an urgent need to fill
the gap that would be created in funding salaries of eligible civil servants estimated in the
annual budget for the year 2014, especially in the light of poor domestic revenue
performance (refer Table 1).

Assessment of Project Design:

29.     The PDO was appropriately aligned with the intent established at appraisal
and the development objective for the RCRF Program. The PDO was to finance and
support an operational payroll and payment system for the non-security sectors which
aligned well (being the first in the SOP) with the PDO for the SOP which was to enable
the Somali Government to achieve reliable and transparent financing of critical civil
service operations to help strengthen the legitimacy of the state. The components and sub-
components were also consistent with the PDO and included activities which provided the
underpinning for sectoral and regional expansions in follow-on projects.

30.    The Bank developed the RCRF Program under the modality of a “series of projects”
(SOP) focussing both on a short-term emergency operation under Phase I designed to meet
the urgent fiscal needs of the FGS and a more sustained program of institutional reform
and strengthening through follow-on Projects. The program complemented other Bank
interventions (on-going and/or planned) within the PFM domain contributing to establish
increased credibility and legitimacy of the FGS.

31.     The project was prepared in a very short span of time and the concept review and
effectiveness (August 2014) were only three months apart. The full team came together to
deliver a well and a fully prepared project in response to ending of the SFF and the urgent
FGS need. The Bank’s expertise and experience in supporting similar post-conflict
interventions in fragile and conflict-affected countries in Africa and other regions
supported the intervention and contributed to the design.

32.    Security issues placed significant restrictions on travel and movement of staff/
consultants. In this context a very important aspect of the Bank engagement was the
Monitoring Agent (MA) who was present on the ground and whose role was to comment
on each withdrawal application based on review of payroll data, staff files, actual payment,
etc.

Some issues with project design:

33.    Definition of eligible civil servant: Bulk of the project expenditure was allocated
towards financing of salaries of eligible civil servants. For exercising control at entry


                                                         19
“eligible civil servants” were defined in the GA; as per clause 8 of the Appendix to the GA
“eligible civil servants” means a civil servant employee of the Recipient’s non-security
sectors and who meets the eligibility criteria set forth in the Project Operations Manual
(POM). Definition of “Eligible Civil Servant” was however not part of the Manual referred
to in the GA. Thus there was lack of clarity on this definition. Additionally, it was agreed8
at appraisal that this manual would be merged with the SFF manual for developing a robust
POM which would guide implementation. This was not done.

34.      Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Donor Partner: The key assurance on
utilization of funds was to be derived from reports of a Monitoring Agent (MA) which had
been hired under a contract with Norway as part of the SFF. It was decided to continue to
finance the MA under the contract with Norway, but to establish a MoU between Norway
and the Bank to clearly define the role of each party since there was no contractual
relationship between the Bank and the MA. However, this MoU remained in a draft stage
and was not signed. It should, however, be mentioned that the MA did comply with
requirements of the contract which included an additional ToR at behest of the Bank and
submitted regular reports.

35.    Adequacy of the Government’s Commitment: The FGS exhibited adequate
commitment throughout the appraisal stage under the overall guidance and supervision of
the World Bank team.

36.     Assessment of risks: The Risks that the project faces have been clearly articulated
in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). These include risk relating to the overall
security situation, political instability, and macro fiscal challenges. Risks also include those
that relate to integrity of the payroll system, capacity constraints, risk of corruption,
weakness of the banking arrangements, and the role of the monitoring agent. However the
risk of hiring unsuitable staff (due to weak HR practices that may be susceptible to misuse)
has not been clearly articulated. Further, given the severe physical constraints that were
imposed due to security aspects, some of the mitigation measures9 seem un-implementable
during the project duration.

38.     Supervision of project activities was carried out diligently. The Bank undertook
three Implementation Support Missions during the life of the project (September/October
2014, December 2014 and April/May 2015). Training of the FGS staff was conducted by
the Bank in September 2014 (September 22 – 26) in Nairobi at project launch to share the
fiduciary aspects related to the project, Bank fiduciary and operational requirements, etc.
The Bank also conducted the Financial Management Supervision which was extended to
include in-depth review of the payroll transactions for the period July – October 2014. The
Bank Review Missions for December 2014 and April/May 2015 were held in Nairobi
(Kenya) as visits to Mogadishu (Somalia) were cancelled due to security reasons and travel
embargo.

39.     The project also fitted in well with the other ongoing projects in the country,
especially the one on Public Financial Management Capacity building which worked on
developing a Financial Management Information System in the Country. The fiduciary
framework established was focused on effective management of payment of salaries to
eligible civil servant considering the overall weak PFM environment. The arrangements
were similar to those developed under SFF as these were largely considered appropriate
with one significant difference viz. the EAFS in the Office of the Auditor General (OoAuG)
was made responsible for the Project implementation in accordance with the FGS desire to
build country systems.


                                                                  21
Some issues with project implementation:

40.     Monitoring Agent; engagement and findings: The MA had been given
responsibility for several wide ranging activities (other than review of withdrawal
applications) which included development of solution to manage the HR data of civil
servants to ensure different ministries maintained a list of active staff, suitable level of
access control, management of staff grade, history and qualifications, etc.; capacity
building of the EAFS section; revision of the EAFS Manual; review the process of
licensing of new banks and supporting the FGS in opening accounts for staff. This breadth
of MA’s responsibilities possibly diluted focus on the ‘Monitoring’ activities and review
of expenditure information. Despite the disclaimers as mentioned earlier, the MA reports
were rich in information and facts from the ground. These contained detailed information
on the salary payments; provided insights into other aspects of the payroll like internal
controls, risk of fraud and corruption, delays in collection of salaries, processing errors,
capacity limitations at FGS, etc. In this backdrop, the Aide Memoires of the Bank missions
lacked analysis of information or effectively communicating the several shortcomings that
were emanating from the MA reporting. Facts were available, but these were not forcefully
communicated to the FGS.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

41.     M&E Design: PDO-level results were monitored using three key indicators and
six intermediate results indicators of which all the key indicators and three intermediate
results indicators were linked to the financing of eligible civil servant salaries in non-
security sector. No revisions were made in the PDO on restructuring, though modifications
were made in the indicators to recognize the effects of decisions made on restructuring.

42.     In terms of the M&E design, the aforementioned indicators and measures appeared
to be sufficient given the focus of the project and the PDO-results to support the budgetary
needs of the FGS to pay regular salaries. There was a close correlation between the project
activities and the PDO level and the Intermediate Results Indicators. However, with project
implementation as per the POM being a legal covenant the intermediate results indicator
number 5 – “Operations Manual for external affairs fiduciary section updated and approved”
may have been considered as one of the key indicators with compliance to the payroll
systems and procedures prescribed therein as an intermediate results indicator. This would
also have identified well with the “reform” segment of the project and one of the PDO-
level results – “Improved effectiveness of payroll controls”. Further, an indicator for
measuring the performance of the FGS in achieving the PDO-level result – “Inject cash
into the economy and enable government funds to be concentrated on providing basic
social services” may have been considered. This indicator could have been linked to budget
outcomes and tracked changes in expenditure patterns on providing basic social services.

43.     M&E Implementation and Utilization: On the FGS side, the implementation
arrangements established for the project appeared reasonable, particularly with the
strengthening of the staffing arrangements at EAFS and provision for an Oversight Board
and Operating Team. However, the Oversight Board seems to not have met and/ or
effectively supervised the project activities.


                                            22
44.      Due to these restrictions on “reaching ground”, the role of the MA under the project
was extremely critical to the arrangements for monitoring and evaluation established for
the project. Their reporting covered several aspects of the M&E framework in addition to
the critical fiduciary function of review of withdrawal applications. The data source and
the agency responsible for data collection was identified in the Results Framework and
Monitoring Table (Annex 1 of the PAD) with information being primarily made available
through the monthly reports of the MA and the quarterly progress report of the FGS. The
actual progress against indicators was reported in the Bank ISR Reports (Sequence 1 and
2) and in the Aide Memoirs for the three supervision missions. This evaluation also
provided inputs for restructuring of the project including reallocation of MPF finances.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

45.    Financial Management: The overall fiduciary risk rating ranged between high to
substantial largely due to the weak institutional capacity and potential risk of financial
mismanagement. The payroll used in the payment of monthly salaries was manual and
maintained in excel sheets. The final payroll lists was generated by the Office of the
Accountant General upon reconciliation of the lists from MDAs and NCSC and dispatched
to Central Bank of Somalia for onward cash based payment through biometric system. To
mitigate the risk, a fiduciary framework was put in place which included: (i) centralization
of financial management function within the Ministry of Finance through the External
Assistance Fiduciary Section (EAFS)10 supported by technical assistance provided by the
Financial Management Unit: (ii) Monitoring Agent to pre-screen all withdrawal
applications and provide an advisory opinion on all the recurrent cost salary payments; (iii)
Bank Risk Management Expert to carry out in-depth transactional reviews and provide
additional assurance; (iv) external audits by the Office of the Auditor General with
technical assistance support from a qualified practicing audit firm in the region; (v) Bank
FM implementation support supervision undertaken every three months.

46.     The Grant Agreement (Schedule 2 clause 5) stipulated the role of the MA as
follows: “Prior to making payments under Part A[1] of the Project, the Recipient shall
ensure that an independent verification agent, whose qualifications and terms of reference
shall be acceptable to the World Bank, has certified as to the eligibility of the payments
sought to be financed and the accuracy of the amounts requested all in accordance with
the guidelines of the Project Operations Manual”. In this backdrop, the role of the MA
was visualized as the “eyes and ears” of the Bank given the security restrictions on access
to the project areas and the need for close monitoring. However, the ToR of the MA
repeatedly uses the term ‘advisory report’ (which is at variance with ‘certified’) when
referring to the deliverables of the MA. Thus, the two seem to be inconsistent and in
practice the Bank was not demanding the same from the MA as it had committed to in the
GA. Further, the MA prefaced each monthly report with specific disclaimers which would
tend to reduce confidence in their work.

47.    The project accounting, reporting and internal control processes were governed by
the EAFS Manual. The quarterly interim unaudited financial statements (IFRs), SOEs
based withdrawal applications were prepared and submitted to the Bank though some IFRs
were delayed; similarly the end of project audited financial statements together with the
management letter was submitted to the Bank though, with some delay11. All the IFRs as
well as the external audit reports were reviewed and feedback formally provided to the
Government.

48.     Ineligible expenditures amounting US$157,555 relating to payment salaries to
Commissioners for the period October- December 2014 were identified. The
Commissioners were political appointees from the Commissioners in National
Reconciliation Commission, National Constitution and Federal Affairs Commission and
the National Civil Service Commission, not eligible under the project. Additional ineligible
expenditures amounting to US$37,683 were also identified. These were related to internal
control weaknesses specifically unauthorized allowances, inclusion of National Civil
Service (NSC) unauthorized staff in the payroll, payment of salaries at higher grade other
than the approved the NSC. The Bank team worked closely with Government in ensuring
all the ineligible expenditures were excluded from the documented expenditures and the
related costs taken up by Government.

49.     Key areas of operational and policy dialogue with Government identified from the
various reviews undertaken include: (a) migration of the entire payroll function to the
Government Financial Management Information System (SFMIS) supported by well-
defined change management processes; (b) harmonization of salary scales and pay grade;
(c) define and assign designations for all undefined positions 12 ; (d) definition of all
allowance types and the qualifying criteria; (e) policy direction on accrued but
uncollected/unpaid salaries; (f) depending on the financial sector development, discontinue
cash based payments and embrace direct payments of salaries and vendors to bank accounts
through checks and/or telegraphic transfers. One shortcoming was that an internal audit
unit which was envisaged at appraisal to review the project activities, did not develop.

50.     The Government and the Bank took a proactive approach in addressing and
resolving the emerging issues and visibly improving the financial management capacity.
Although the FM risk rating was substantially rated the fiduciary rating for the ISR was
moderately satisfactory.

51.    Procurement: Procurement plan was prepared for RCRF Project taking into

Procurement Procedures in Situations of Urgent Need of Assistance or Capacity
Constraints, April 2013, Somalia in the current list of FCS countries.

52.     In using flexible and simplified procurement procedures, all the procurements were
undertaken expeditiously and within the timelines in the procurement plan. Various
individual consultants under component 1 - emergency support to core banking functions
were hired and deployed to the respective departments in Government in time with their
contracts commencing in August, 2014 to February, 2015. The outputs from the consultants
have provided the necessary information for the development of the PFM Phase II and
RCRF Phase II. Consulting firms were also contracted and engaged to undertake review of
the educational/ heath sectors. Outputs from the consultancies informed the design of
RCRF II; in particular the design of planned support to expenditures in social sectors.
Project management was supported by recruitment of consultants for the FM and EAFS
these provided support for processing of payments. The technical specialists provided
adequate support. Under goods category one 4WD vehicle was procured using shopping
procedures and delivered within the agreed time frame, as stated in the LPO.

53.     Environmental and social safeguards: During the identification and preparation
stage the project was screened regarding environmental and social impacts, and found to
have no adverse environmental or social risks or impacts. It thus was classified as
safeguards category C, meaning that there effectively were no requirements regarding
environmental or social assessment and management. The team monitored the project’s
implementation, especially regarding the compliance of the financed activities with project
design. This monitoring and supervision included spot-checking for any issues that might
have adverse impacts, and thus a relevance for the project’s safeguards classification.
Throughout project implementation the team could confirm that no adverse environmental
and social impacts occurred, neither caused by the project nor by directly associated
activities.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

54.     RCRF 1 was a short duration project which was processed as an emergency
operation. This is being followed up with a second project (the RCRF 2 project which,
considering the exigencies of the FGS has become effective in July 2015, and is expected
to be a five year project) which would ensure continuity of financing of civil servants’
salaries; and, in addition, support a wider set of activities including support to service
delivery, fiscal policy management and institutional capacity building.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

55.     The Project was restructured in December 2014, two months prior to the date of
closure with around 63 percent of the Project finance having being disbursed and utilized.
The restructuring was based on the findings of the mid-term review. There was no change
in the PDO and the PDO results indicators though revisions were made in the indicator
target values to recognize the effects of restructuring with one key indicator being
rephrased for a more robust measurement. Consequently despite restructuring, the
outcomes are assessed against the original objectives and targets


                                            25
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

56.     Substantial: The objectives, design and implementation of RCRF 1 are quiet
relevant and important in context of building legitimacy of the state and keeping it on a
positive trajectory of development. The PDOs were kept quiet simple and for a reason –
this was a response to the imminent and urgent needs of the FGS. This being Phase I of the
Series of projects, the objectives are appropriately aligned to the development objective of
the SOP which envision achievement of reliable and transparent financing of critical civil
service operations to strengthen legitimacy of the state. This is also consistent with the
Bank ISN (FY 14-16) for Somalia which states that the MPF’s recurrent cost window will
provide a platform for performance benchmarking and a policy dialogue platform related
to establishment of a track record of economic governance. The objectives (as conceived
at inception) are equally relevant today and remain fully aligned with the Country priorities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

57.     Substantial: The Project being the Phase I of the RCRF Program had an overall DO
for the Program and a PDO. The project has contributed towards the achievement of the
DO for the Program through a transparent and reliable financing of the critical civil service
operations by establishing legitimacy of the state. Two out of the three PDO indicators
were achieved as described below.
     PDO 1 – Number of civil servants in non-security sector paid: the project started
        by paying 2515 civil servants for the month of July 2014. This number increased
        significantly (55 percent during the project lifetime) and the last payment was to
        3907 civil servants for the month of February 2015. This is 108 percent
        achievement of the revised target of 3600 (which had been revised downwards from
        3909 on restructuring). Increase in number of civil servants over the period of the
        project indicated new hiring as well as other civil servants that were earlier
        considered ineligible but were later declared eligible once the required processing
        of documents was completed. This highlights a robust verification process while
        also placing importance on systems that were strengthened by implementation of
        the SFMIS (a full-fledged financial management system) which included payroll
        processing.
     PDO 2 – Percentage of registered civil servants salaries in non-security sector paid
        on time: This indicator was initially in percentage terms (target being – salaries of
        80 percent civil servants paid on time) but was later revised to ‘reduction in the
        days of delay up to 12 days’. The payment lag consistently reduced for the first six
        months of the project. As of December 2014, the original closing date, the payment
        lag was 8 days from 58 days in June 2014 when the project took over. However,
        with the restructuring of the project, there were commendable efforts by the
        Government to make all payments through a financial accounting software
        (SFMIS) which was implemented in a short period of time and was expected to
        improve the controls around payrolls. The process of loading all civil servants’ data
        on the SFMIS and ensuring the controls were effective, delayed payments in
        February 2015 to 58 days; the data migration over may have attributed to the delay.
        Though, the last payroll was paid in 58 days, the average delay over the project
        lifetime (eight payrolls) was 31 days. The follow up project, RCRFII was effective
        on July 2015 and has paid accumulated salaries from March to June 2015 within

                                             26
          three months of effectiveness. The Government has committed to paying up all
          arrears by December 31, 2015 and would pay on due dates from January 2016.
         PDO 3 – Number of payroll verifications undertaken by independent monitoring
          agent: This was required to ensure reimbursement of monthly salary to the FGS and
          the verifications were 100 percent of the eight verifications targeted. The payroll
          processing was undertaken at defined dates for each ministry during each month
          and was based on biometric verification of each employee by the CBS. Further
          reviews included checks by Bank hired Consultants as well.

3.3 Efficiency

58.       Modest. Refer to Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

59.     This project formed the bedrock of the Bank engagement in Somalia. Its linkages
with the PFM Project and the (proposed) Public Sector Capacity Project ensured a well-
rounded approach of the Bank to the country circumstances. However, effectiveness of
payroll controls (PDO Level Result) could not demonstrate a clear improvement on
account of the following: (a) significant delays in salary payments persisted; and (b) the
control environment around salary payments did not improve as highlighted by repeated
observations in the MA reports which were further validated by findings of the External
Auditor. Thus the overall outcome rating assigned is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.     The project being primarily aimed at financing salaries of civil servants in the non-
security sector was able to achieve the appraised targets. This would have a positive social
impact on their household including establishing the legitimacy and credibility of FGS
particularly in Mogadishu and peripheral areas. Financing of recurrent costs also led to a
significant infusion of funds into the Somali economy, and the spending by the civil
servants infused much needed resources in the economy, directly impacting poverty.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

61.     Since the project was implemented by the Ministry of Finance with direct
 involvement of the Auditor General, Accountant General including EAFS, and the CBS,
 this project was able to initiate a process of institutional strengthening and reforms for
 the key financial institutions of Somalia and lay the foundation for strengthening of these
 institutions during subsequent engagements. These changes though gradual, would be
 sustained in the long term. Further, since the changes impact key institutions of financial
 management, which are at the core of the government, these would have a continuing and
 positive impact on all aspects of the public sector including governance and service
 delivery.




                                              27
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

62.    None identified.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

63.    Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholders Workshop were not conducted.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

64.    The Bank has demonstrated its commitment to financing recurrent costs for the
FGS as part of a Series of Projects and this financing would continue through the second
phase of this project. The RCRF window forms an integral part of the Bank’s Interim
Strategy Note (14-16) and is considered as an enabler for engagement in other sectors. This
financing and allocation for salaries of new civil servants are part of the budget of the FGS
which get approved at the highest level. Given the planned and on-going Bank
interventions in the PFM domain and the RCRF program planned in the near future, risk
to development outcome is assessed as Significant, as delays in effectiveness/
implementation of these projects could negatively impact the assessment.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

65.      The Bank’s intervention through this project was relevant and consistent with the
strategy for re-engagement with Somalia and the MPF objective. It was responsive to the
request from the FGS with the SFF coming to an end and there being an urgent need to fill
the gap in funding salaries and other recurrent costs due to poor domestic revenue accruals.
Given the need for an emergency intervention, the Bank team conceptualized the project
in a short duration within the broader RCRF Program with a follow-on project for a
sustained engagement. The PDO and the components reflected the intent at entry with
financing the salaries of the civil servants in the non-security sector and laying the
groundwork for sectoral and regional expansion based on technical consultancies
undertaken in this project which would provide inputs for the design of the follow-on
project.

66.     Project implementation was designed to rely on country systems with interventions
for strengthening the existing arrangements given the weak PFM environment, some being
made a part of the legal covenants. With the overall risk being rated as high, project design
provided increased supervision and implementation support missions and a MA was
entrusted with responsibility for monitoring the monthly activities particularly salary
payments to civil servants and review of withdrawal applications with its ToR revised as
per the World Bank requirements.

                                             28
67.     However, the quality at entry had the following shortcomings: (a) eligibility criteria
was not articulated in the Project Operations Manual (as per requirement of the Grant
agreement) and nor did it form part of the ToR or reports of the MA; and (b) engagement
with the MA was inconsistent with the Grant Agreement (GA) since the GA required a
certification of expenditure while the MA reports were presented as advisory opinions.

(b)      Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

68.     The Bank team was adequately staffed taking into account major aspects of the
project design including Economists, M&E Specialists, Risk Management, Fiduciary,
Controllers and Safeguards. The supervision team had rightly recognized the high risk
nature of the project, provided periodic implementation support including FM supervision
and in-depth payroll review highlighting the implementation challenges. However visits to
Mogadishu were severely curtailed and could not be undertaken except during the first
mission due to the prevailing security situation and the Bank having to rely substantially
on reports of the MA. A restructuring which resulted in reallocation of resources, and
cancellation of certain activities which were being taken up under similar operations,
resulted in better utilization of resources and disbursement of 92 percent of the grant
allocation.

69.     The implementation related bottlenecks and areas of concern coming out of the MA
reports were not forcefully communicated to the FGS counterparts. However, the project
was for a duration of eight months only and the ratings were candid. The performance
ratings which were higher earlier were lowered in light of implementation performance and
the project closed with both the Development Objective and Implementation Performance
rating as Moderately Satisfactory. Supervision of the fiduciary aspects also appears
reasonable though the following is a surprising exception. The project auditors were not
provided copies of reports of the Monitoring Agent and, thus, an important piece of fact/
analysis was not made available to them.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

70.     With a Satisfactory rating for quality at entry and a Satisfactory rating for
supervision, the overall Bank performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

(a)     Government and Implementing Agency Performance

71.     The Project was implemented by the Ministry of Finance, FGS under the overall
supervision of the Oversight Board, an operating team and EAFS within the OoAG under
the Ministry of Finance. Further payment of salaries of civil servants in the non-security
sector, involved multiple MDAs. However given the size of the overall project

                                             29
implementation structure, performance of the Government and the Implementing
Agency/ies have been considered jointly and not segregated.

72.     The FGS extended reasonable level of support to the project both at entry and
during implementation despite a fragile security environment. It provided an enabling
environment for project implementation. Since bulk of the funds were used for the payment
of salaries to eligible civil servants, the FGS ensured monthly payments though the time
duration each month was much higher than the target set for the Project. However some of
the shortcomings in their performance included: (a) monitoring arrangements for the non-
salary expenditure could not be established and disbursed till end of the project period; (b)
issue of guidelines related to treatment of uncollected salaries were delayed; (c) delay in
establishment of the internal audit function; (d) persistent findings of the MA which were
subsequently confirmed by the in-depth payroll review; ( e) the Oversight Board did not
meet and thus did not guide the project as envisaged; and (e) physical and capacity
challenges relating to EASF staff and consultants which impacted their effectiveness.

(b)   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

73.   In view of the above the overall performance of the Government and Implementing
Agency/ies is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

74.     Use of Country Systems (UCS) was a bold step which ensured fiduciary
assurance as well as sustained client capacity building: The approach to use of the
country financial management architecture was a bold and positive step in the backdrop of
the security and governance challenges. The project used the Central Bank for payments
(the designated account was in the Central Bank of Somalia) and the government system
for accounting and reporting. This was guided by the ISN and the overall approach where
three key projects were designed as the initial troika of interventions in the Country. These
were the RCRF (focusing on payment of civil servants salaries and thus strengthening the
credibility and legitimacy of the state); the PFM Capacity Strengthening Project (which
continues to focus on creating/ strengthening of the accounting and payment systems and
which has led to implementation of the SFMIS i.e. the Somalia Financial Management
Information System which is gradually being rolled out in several MDAs); and the Public
Sector Capacity Injection Project (which focuses on defining the HR systems, including
harmonized pay scales etc. – though this is expected to be effective only by October 2015).
Though the associated risks were high; UCS ensured fiduciary assurance was better, that
supervision efforts will be optimized, and the improved capacity more sustainable –
benefiting future projects/ donor assistance.

75.     Payment Systems need to migrate to direct transfer of salaries to accounts of
civil servants in commercial bank accounts: Use of CBS (though it has its own capacity
challenges) for making payments was appropriate for this project. However cash payments
is not part of the core competence of any central bank and thus subsequent operations
should endeavor to transfer funds to personal accounts (in recognized commercial banks)
of civil servants. If the ‘Know Your Customer’ or KYC norms of these banks are


                                             30
reasonable, and it is assessed that the banks have reasonable internal controls, then transfer
of funds would reduce the hardship associated with the need to be physically present to
collect salary on a particular day.

76.     In context of travel restrictions, supervision needs to be augmented by using a
supervisory agent model: Restrictions on travel of Bank staff/ consultants are quiet
significant even at time of the ICR and this is usually ‘travel to and attend meetings at the
Mogadishu airport’. This significantly impedes ability of Bank professionals to form a
qualitative opinion of implementation of projects and what will/ will not work. Thus, as
the Bank portfolio becomes more varied, there is a need to use a supervisory agent (e.g.
ARTF supervisory agent in Afghanistan) who may be equipped with modern technology
and be able to provide in-depth, customized information to task team members. This will
be relevant for further stages of RCRF operations as well.

77.     Focus should not waver from core governance and anti-corruption
requirements: The Country risks will continue to be high and the Bank may gain from
services/ advice of the INT (preventive services unit) in terms of building stronger anti-
corruption measures as part of project design. Secondly, further engagements may also
explore effectiveness of anti-corruption legislation, and give attention to development of
anti-corruption institutions. Finally, the implementation of a Financial Management
Information System is a big leap in context of improving internal controls on this/ other
projects. However, reports are only as good as the quality of data inputs in the system; thus
attention should not deviate from ensuring quality of basic data, files, controls, and
approvals.

78.    ToR for the MA needs to be simplified: Drawing lessons from the engagement
with the MA for the ARTF; this is based on relatively clear and simple ToR which requires
a confirmation on the veracity of the recurrent costs on a monthly basis and the more
systemic issues to be addressed in depth in a quarterly report. Thus basic reports are timely
and more detailed issues are dealt with separately.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The usual Economic and Financial Analysis was not carried out at time of the project
preparation, given the paucity of economic data, the ongoing conflict and fragility; and the
uncertainty in determining costs and benefits.

However, implementation of the project increased legitimacy of the state and, thus, brought
benefits to the public. Payment of civil servant salaries in the non-security sectors is an
important aspect in context of restoration of public confidence in the state and with security
dividends that resulted from improved fiscal position of the recipient government and allow
the state to provide basic services to the population. Supporting salaries and allowances of
SMEs would result in strengthening and regularization of functioning of key MDAs of the
FGS. The project has also led to reduction in accumulation of the country’s financial
obligations and freed up resources for support of expenditure in the social sectors which would
support a peaceful state.

The project helped increasing the aggregate demand. As is clear from Table 1 (main report;
Summary of FGS Budget) that compensation to employees formed approximately 50% of the
annual FGS budget which was US$ 182.4 million for FY 2014. The Bank financing is
significant in context of the FGS budget (more than 10% of the budget on an annualized basis)
and the regular payment of salaries, and the resultant spending made by the civil servants would
have a significant impact on reviving of the economy and in reduction of poverty levels.

Injection of the money will expand trade, boost the aggregate demand and help the economy
recovery with benefits to the poor. Overall, the resumption of economic activities resulting
from payment of salaries should help in poverty reduction and enhancement of shared
prosperity. In the medium term, this will lead to growth in the state’s own resources and
receipts.

Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The full text of the Executive Summary of “End of the Project Evaluation Report (April 2015)”
on the Project prepared by FGS is reproduced below in this Annex.

1.      The End of the Recurrent Cost Reform Financing Project Evaluation was undertaken
over the period of 12th to 30th of April 2015 by an independent evaluator. The end evaluation
focused on measuring development results and potential impacts generated by the RCRF
project. It was based on the scope and criteria provided in the evaluation terms of reference
(TORs).
2.       Based on the review of contextual documents, the evaluation noted that the RCRF
project was implemented in an extraordinary period for Somalia and in a very complex and
difficult environment. The magnitude of the challenges in the newly established Federal
Government were quite phenomenal, particularly considering weak or inexistent public
institutions, high levels of poverty, weak government structures at all levels, and the limited
capacity within the civil service and public administration. Most importantly civil servants
working on voluntary basis and most of the times without any remuneration offered.
3.      The RCRF was designed to address institutional governance issues through multiple
approaches, over both the immediate and longer-term. Somalia’s governance challenges are of
a complexity nature and do not lend to a linear or singular approach. The RCRF project
addressed the challenges through a multi-nodal approach that included fiscal support (recurrent
cost), capacity injection, core systems building and policy-dialogue – so the RCRF project is
linked to several other Bank Projects to take advantage of synergy effects. The operations and
the implementation support were coordinated by well-designed inter-agencies institutions,
which involved established appropriate institutions under the overall coordination of PFM
program with needed support provided by technical expertise from other Bank’s projects. This
approach enabled the program to diversify the risks and build a system with its needed capacity
that promoted Government ownership and the use of country system. The RCRF project also
assisted the government to harmonize project implementation units inside government and
lowered the transaction costs.
4.      Following the revision of the RCRF strategy and approach, the RCRF project’s
approach was articulated and based on (a) the reality on the ground in addressing challenges
in the enabling environment – mainstreaming recurrent cost of non-security sectors, and non-
salaries recurrent cost expenditures and related activities within the context of national budget;
(b) developing and implementing specific interventions to build institutional capacity to
operate the program; (c) build ownership and using the country system in a transparent and
accountable manner.
5.     During the evaluation a few fundamental weaknesses have been observed in the RCRF
implementation approach. Particularly within the operationalization of interagency working
mechanisms, that’s MDAs, NCSC, MoF, Accountant General and CBS and more so with
Independent Monitoring Agent. The flow of information was very slow at beginning, these
was caused by poor capacity of MDAs being the one that had to initiate the process of salary
payments by submitting the list of personnel with needed details. Most of the time the



                                               39
information submitted was not adequate enough to be processed, so this led to back and forth
attitude; where the submitted list of personnel to the MoF had to be send back to MDAs for
corrections and clarifications. Second, the introduced innovative payroll system was slightly
different from the existing one. So there was a need to converge the two systems. Once the two
systems were converged and activities harmonized the process became smooth, efficient and
managed to eliminate all the delays.
6.      The Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing (RCRF) program, was implemented under
the modality of a “series of sub-projects”, this was a key element in a wider effort to support
the Somali transition through gradual establishment of accountable and effective core
government institutions. The series of projects aim to provide financing for civil service wage
bill and build the associated fiduciary elements of the payroll system. The Somali transition is
a unique opportunity for the country to escape a cycle of conflict and fragility and lay the
foundations for longer-term poverty reduction and shared prosperity, with positive spill over
into the broader Horn of Africa and Eastern Africa sub-regions.
7.      The Phase I of this project financed operational payroll and payment system at the
Federal Government level for the non-security sector and paid for salaries of existing non-
security sector staff of the Federal Government15 and provided technical assistance to targeted
Departments in the FGS Ministries of Finance and Planning. This facilitated the strengthening
of core government functions and basic service delivery – both essential contributors in the
Somali context to the increased relevance and legitimacy of government institutions,
ownership and the use of country system.
8.      Under the four components of the RCRF program, significant outputs were delivered,
and these contributed to outcomes in a meaningful ways. However, within the components of
the program, component two and three delivered their outputs only partially. This depended
on several factors included some of the delays in the implementations of component I.
Implementation delays at the early stage of project resulted from the failure of all stakeholders
to fully grasp constraints on the ground, including limited capacity and the introduction of
complex procedures that did not converge with the existing ones for quick delivery. Another
aspect that was overlooked by the project was on capacity building at the institutional level
needed to contribute to increased coordination, harmonization.
9.       RCRF outcomes with strongest results were noted under component 1: Emergency
Support to Core Government Functions in MDAs. The RCRF made significant progress in
establishing and consolidating inter-agencies institutions needed to operate the program.
Institutions had to be created or reformed from scratch, at a time when the FGS was attempting
to manage multiple and often competing demands on its scarce capacity and resources.
Component 1 of the RCRF was fully implemented in all aspects and the set objectives and
targets have been fully achieved. This contributed to improved ownership under the leadership



15The following are considered core security actors and not eligible for financing under the project: armed forces, police,
paramilitary forces, gendarmeries, presidential guards, intelligence and security forces, coast guards, and customs
authorities.




                                                             40
of the FGS and funds were disbursed in transparent and accountable manners within the federal
government budget system.
10.     Component 2: Strengthening Systems for Expanded Operations and Service Delivery.
Under this component key activities undertaken included: the project engaged two consultants
who undertook study missions to Puntland and Jubbaland to examine existing payroll systems,
administrative structure in place needed to implement similar program at the state and regional
levels. A report was prepared and presented to a stakeholders’ workshop in February 2015.
Consideration of the report is under way and expected negotiations and consultation with the
Bank are taking place to finalize the process. Under the same component a study is being
commissioned to review existing systems in the health and education sectors across South
Central, Puntland and Jubbaland. These involve documenting evidence of past reviews, policy
papers and recommendations as well as plans produced by FGS, Puntland and Jubbaland
authorities or development partners. The set targets have been achieved in a satisfactory
manner.
11.     Component 3: Project Management and including audit, training and operational costs.
This involved supporting the EAFS for the coordination, administration, communication,
management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation and dissemination of project activities.
The component contributed to strengthening financial management and oversight systems, and
building institutional capacity to develop policies and providing training to personnel. RCRF
project helped build state capacity through essential physical infrastructure and equipment and
training. The component gave stimulus to a process underway to build country systems by
using the capacity built under SFF, made up of Somali Diaspora consultants, to strengthen the
EAFS. Additionally, EAFS staff was supported with training to enhance their capacity. In
addition support was provided to the Office of the Auditor General with technical assistance
to support the staff of the Office of Auditor General to audit the project once during the six
month project implementation period.
12.      On the relevance – at the design stage the RCRF was developed on the basis of
identified needs and priorities of the Economic Recovery Plan (ERP) 2014-2015, New Deal
and the Somali Compact. The RCRF in its formulation took into account the objectives,
policies and strategies of the government guiding documents in its programming orientation
and priorities. Each one of the four components of the RCRF was supporting development
priorities set in the ERP, New deal and the Somali Compact, so it was aligned with the country
priorities.
13.     On the effectiveness – RCRF provided a cost – effective mechanism under the given
circumstances prevailing in the context Somalia security conditions, weak public institutions,
and poor credibility of the state. The RCRF has delivered substantial non-quantifiable benefits
of facilitating and building core government functions, systems and criteria for the
management of public expenditure. The cost effectiveness of RCRF relates primarily to its
relevance to a given operational context that’s it has enable the Government and the Bank to
build national capacity to support and operationalize the program. It might have somewhat
higher price given the fact of having have had to use experts from the Somali Diasporas and
international ones. The benefit is once the capacity is built then the cost will come down.
14.     Sustainability - is a long term process and impacted by both positive and negative
factors that can be mitigated or enhanced to increase the probability for the RCRF project to
continue after its completion. In the context of RCRF project a number of positive factors


                                              41
supporting the sustainability have been observed, such as the high level of transfer of
knowledge and skills from Independent Monitoring Agent, the EASF and the World Bank
experts with the established inter-agencies institutions. This combined with the higher degree
of ownership of the RCRF project and its integration within the FGS budget has the highest
chance of being sustainable in the future.
15.     Impact – significant positive impact of RCRF project has been noticed through it role
in capacity building played by the Bank experts, Independent Monitoring Agent, SMEs and
EASF. These activities and the “hand holding” were instrumental in a context of a weak
existing institutional capacity. These made a real and lasting capacity impact for the newly
established and reformed institutions. These have contributed to improve legitimization of the
state through the provision of services by the MDAs and created credibility for the FGS in
operating the core functions of the state.
Lessons Learned
16.     The evaluation identified key lessons that were emerging from the RCRF project
experience, which should be taken into account in future programming in order to enhance
inter-agency collaboration and to strengthen effectiveness of program results. In the first place
it was noticed that managing expectation was crucial for the successful implementation of the
program.
17.       The overall experience of the RCRF project was at the initial stage to manage
expectations among a range of stakeholders – national, international, clients, and intended
beneficiaries – by clearly articulating what an RCRF can and cannot deliver given the context
in Phase I.
18.       The speed of start-up, disbursements and results was planned in such a way as to
avoid disappointing clients, and intended beneficiaries. Project management have attempted to
manage expectations up front through clear communications by adopting a phased approach
to operationalization in order to increase prioritization and sequencing in line with the existing
capacities on the ground, provided technical assistance from the Bank, counterpart absorption
capacity, and the broader security context.
19.       Recurrent cost reform financing operations in this phase have enabled the project to
build and test country systems, generate counterpart capacity for managing funds and ensure
basic running costs are met in emergency contexts, while preparing for expanding operations
of the program to cover other areas.
