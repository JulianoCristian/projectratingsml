Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Progress on Component 1: Emergency Support to Core Government Functions in Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) - US$15.0
 million:

  1.1: Financing of eligible civil service salaries in non-security sectors in Mogadishu: This covered payment of salaries from July 2014 to
 February 2015 to staff based on the FGS 2014 budget. After the restructuring in December 2014 which allowed salary payments for January and
 February 2015, it was agreed that the number of staff to be covered will not exceed the figures for December 2014. Salary payments for June 2014 to
 January 2015 have been finalized while February 2015 is being finalized.

 1.2. Financing to subject matter experts and allowances:Ten Subject Matter Experts were paid under the RCRF Project based on the terms of their
 on-going contracts with government. The related SMEs are three SMEs in the Prime Minister’s Office; SME for procurement, Debt Management, Inland
 Revenue, Customs, Budget, Central Bank and the Auditor General. While some of the contracts terminated in December 2014, some others were
 extended till project closure on April 30, 2014.

  1.3. Financing of eligible non-salary recurrent cost expenses for 4 MDAs: This activity was not carried out. Government set up a Payment System
 Reform Task Force who amongst others, were tasked with settin up systems for approval of non-salary recurrent costs and laying out criteria for eligible
 expenditure in this category. Until this system is put in place; this activity cannot be approved for reimbursement. The Payment System Reform
 Taskforce is made up of the Director General of Finance, Accountant General, Budget Director, PFM Coordinator, Chief of Staff to the Minister, and a
 Senior Advisor. The team will define a reformed payment process and associated criteria which must be met before expenditures in this category can be
 considered eligible for reimbursement. This will include ex ante controls, and clear separation of roles between commitment, procurement and payment
 authorization and execution. The EAFS manual formed a good basis for the work of the Taskforce which is expected to develop a draft guideline and
 benefit from inputs from the Monitoring Agent. The draft guideline was produced lately and government did not meet the necessary criteria for
 reimbursement until project closure on Apruil 30, 2015.

 Progress on Component 2: Strengthening Systems for Expanded Operations and Service Delivery (US$1.0 million)

 2.1 Expanding support for recurrent cost expenditures to other regions (Puntland and the Interim Jubbaland Administration) US$0.225 million. Two
 consultants carried out a regional review of the recurrent costs requirements for Puntland and Jubbaland. A stakeholder workshop was carried out after
 the review for verification and dissemination of the report. The activity was completed in February 2015.

 2.2: Reliability and Integrity of payroll US$0.3 The government informed the team that a related activity is in progress and being carried out by the
 Monitoring Agent under a different contract. In order to avoid duplication, the activity was dropped in the December 2014 project restructuring.
 2.3: Strengthening support to the Social Sectors (Education and Health). The government engaged a firm to review the recurrent costs needs of the
 education and health sectors in FGS, Puntland and Interim Jubba Administration. The review is finalized and report issued to government. This formed
 a basis for the preparation of the suppoort to the social sector under phase II of the project.

 2.4: Strengthening the External Affairs Fiduciary Section (EAFS) This activity was expected to support the engagement of the Monitoring Agents after
 the funding of their contracts by the Norwegian government ended on December 31, 2014. However, the Norwegian government extended the contract
 to February 15, 2015. Additionally, it was agreed that the firm would be engaged by the MPF Technical Secretariat to cover all MPF projects in
 Somalia. As a result, this activity was dropped in the December 2014 restructuring.
 Progress on Component 3: Project Management and Coordination (US$ 2.0 million)

 Project Management (EAFS; FMU Consultants) All contract for seven EASF/FMU consultants approved for nine months from August 2014 to April 30,
 2015 at project closure.

 Audit: The project engagd an external audit firm to support the Offcie of the Auditor General of Somalia in the audit of the project. The audit is on-going
 and expected to be completed by June 30, 2015.

 Operations (Training, vehicle and other operational costs): Vehicle was procurement for the project implementation. Thirty three government staff from
 the Ministry of Finance (External Affairs Fiduciary Unit) and procurement unit were trained on Bank operations, financial management, procurement and
 disbursements during this supervision mission. The training also included an exposure to the Somalia Financial management Information Systems.
 Project Completeion Report: The project engaged a consultant who has prepared a project completion report.

 Disbursement: As of May 7, 2015, out of the signed Grant Agreement amount of US$16 million, IDA has disbursed US$14,235,022.71 (89 percent) into
 the Designated Account. The government has paid the January and February 2015 salaries and prepared the related Withdrawal Applications.
 However, due to some delays in engaging the Monitoring Agent by the MPF, these WA has not been reviewed (as indicated in the GA) and cannot be
 replenished by the Bank. Also, the salary payments for February 2015 is on-going. The project expects that all the advance of US$4 million will be fully
 revovered with the WAs for the January and February salary payments.

 Support by Monitoring Agent (MA): The GoN contracted the MA till February 15, 2015 for the Norwegian financed Somali Financing Facility (SFF)
 and agreed to extend their Terms of Reference to cover the activities under component I of the Recurrent Costs and Reform Financing Project. The
 MA prepared Advisory Opinion which formed the basis of replenishing the Withdrawal Application for all salary payments from July to December 2014.
 Due to delay in the sole source engagement of thesame agents to cover project activities up till the project closure, the salary payments for January and
 February 2015 is being delayed.

               Comments
               The actal delay for the January and February 2015 salary payments was 38 and 58 days respectively. There was substantial delays in the
               payments of the January and February 2015 salary payments for several reasons and importantly due to the changes in government and
               the migration of the financial systems to the Somali Financial Management Information Systems. The migration is expected to make the
               system more efficient and also reduce this time lag going forward.
