were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was significant, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and Grantee performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: use of country systems (UCS) was a\n            bold step which ensured fiduciary assurance as well as\n            sustained client capacity building. Payment systems need to\n            migrate to direct transfer of salaries to accounts of civil\n            servants in commercial bank accounts. In context of travel\n            restrictions, supervision needs to be augmented by using a\n            supervisory agent model. The implementation of a financial\n            management information system is a big leap in context of\n            improving internal controls on this and other projects.\n            Drawing lessons from the engagement with the monitoring\n            agent (MA) for the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund\n            (ARTF); this is based on relatively clear and simple terms\n            of reference (ToR) which requires a confirmation on the\n            veracity of the recurrent costs on a monthly basis and the\n            more systemic issues to be addressed in depth in a quarterly report."}, "docdt": "2015-10-30T22:28:03Z"}
