Despite its failure to achieve\n            satisfactory development outcomes, this project offers\n            valuable lessons, including confirmation of experience in\n            other countries. Specific lessons include: 1) If you amplify\n            HIV/AIDS messages in the face of uncertainty, you risk\n            undermining those activities that require that you\n            continuously nurture political and institutional support. 2)\n            If you fail to assess institutional options and\n            responsibilities prior to the launch of the project and fail\n            to develop local ownership, institutional arrangements\n            within the agency leading the AIDS response will become\n            unworkable. 3) To develop AIDS-related institutions and\n            services requires that engagement with clients for the\n            long-term, rather than through a three-year pilot operation.\n            4) More donor funds may be available in some environments,\n            particularly in the pre-epidemic stages of HIV, than\n            recipient countries are able to absorb. This is so in\n            particular for direct HIV/AIDS services that are provided\n            through nongovernmental organizations. 5) The physical\n            proximity of the task manager in the Country Office does not\n            necessarily strengthen supervisory support for project implementation."}, "docdt": "2005-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
