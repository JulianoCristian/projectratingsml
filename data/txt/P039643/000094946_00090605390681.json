The project was successful in developing a\n            laboratory system to support HIV/AIDS and STD testing and\n            surveillance, unfortunately support from the other\n            components was negligible. As a result, the project was not\n            able to produce a comprehensive model of proved\n            effectiveness for the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS\n            and STDs. Bank supervision was ineffective in pushing\n            attainment of project goals. Key lessons drawn this project\n            include: 1) the project was ambitious in its design and\n            objectives. Three years was too short a period for achieving\n            behavioral change targets, particularly since most\n            guidelines, manuals, modules, and information, education,\n            and communication materials materials were still to be\n            developed during the first years of the project. 2) The\n            decision to establish a Project Management Unit (PMU) led by\n            a Project Manager who was responsible not just for project\n            administration but also for technical matters proved to be\n            counter productive. 3) The project was a pilot that had to\n            deal with numerous activities in a short time frame,\n            involving multiple groups of people, numerous agencies and\n            individuals in different locations. 4) The project correctly\n            put an nongovernmental organizations capacity building\n            component in the project, which was directed particularly at\n            smaller nongovernmental organizations with strong ties to\n            particular groups of interest."}, "docdt": "2000-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
