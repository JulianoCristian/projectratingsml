intended to help implement the AIDS strategy presented in\n            the 1994 Presidential and Ministerial decrees. These policy\n            pronouncements are aimed at achieving lower STD and HIV\n            incidence and fewer deaths from AIDS in Indonesia, and the\n            aim of this project is to use intensive pilot efforts to\n            develop institutional mechanisms and interventions capable\n            of reducing transmission of STDs) and HIV in Indonesia. A\n            core program for STD and HIV prevention in two pilot areas\n            will be designed and implemented in partnership with local\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); extensive monitoring\n            and evaluation will identify which trial interventions were\n            promising and worth continuing. The project consists of\n            provincial level components and complementary central level\n            activities. Provincial (including district and\n            municipality-managed) interventions will introduce\n            simultaneously and in the same localities various behavior\n            changes and service delivery measures thought likely to\n            achieve significant outcomes. Behavioral trials and other\n            interventions to reduce or prevent risk will typically be\n            carried out by NGOs and will include peer and workplace\n            education, counseling and other measures targeted at\n            different groups."}, "docdt": "1996-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
