Modernization Project for Pakistan were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            well-structured consultative process involving all\n            stakeholders, particularly the beneficiaries, should precede\n            project preparation. A communication strategy should be\n            developed to keep constant liaison with all stakeholders for\n            projects of this nature. This will minimize complaints that\n            come forth during project implementation. The borrower\n            should be adequately informed at all levels that the\n            Bank's procedures need to be followed for all\n            procurements. The contractors must build good relations with\n            the local community to ensure smooth implementation.\n            Detailed engineering design of Employer's site\n            facilities to be constructed by the contractor and location\n            of contractor's site facilities should be a part of the\n            bidding documents to avoid variation orders later on and\n            social disruption. A sound financial management, accounting\n            and reporting system managed by qualified staff is a key\n            element for a smooth implementation of the project.\n            Consideration should be given to out-sourcing certain\n            aspects of financial management to professional firms,\n            instead of setting up in-house systems. Periodic review of\n            Project activities by an independent Panel of Experts (POE)\n            is an effective tool for taking corrective measures and\n            ensuring quality."}, "docdt": "2010-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
