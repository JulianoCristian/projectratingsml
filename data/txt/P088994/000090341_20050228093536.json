The objectives will be achieved through:\n            (i) rehabilitating and strengthening the Taunsa Barrage and\n            associated structures; (ii) renovation and modernization of\n            gates, hoists and operating and control facilities; (iii)\n            improving operation and maintenance capability; and (iv)\n            rehabilitation design studies for other barrages in Punjab.\n            The major benefits of the Project stem from securing\n            irrigation of the cultivated lands in the command areas of\n            over two million acres in the two canal commands of\n            Muzaffargarh and Dera Ghazi Khan, and through the\n            Taunsa-Panjnad Link Canal to supplement water supply to\n            Panjnad Headworks canals. Other benefits from the\n            rehabilitation of the barrage include: (a) long-term and\n            effective functioning of the critical oil and gas pipelines,\n            and telephone lines; and (b) ensuring continued availability\n            of vital rail and road links of strategic importance between\n            the Punjab and the Sindh and Balochistan provinces."}, "docdt": "2005-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
