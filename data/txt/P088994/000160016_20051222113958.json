The residence\n            of a squatter community on the left and right banks\n            downstream of Taunsa Barrage was anticipated as a problem in\n            that the contractor would be operating in the vicinity of\n            the settlements. The Irrigation and Power Department shifted\n            them to an alternate location. This shifting has resulted in\n            some problems and issues related to resettlement and\n            rehabilitation. This resettlement action plan's main\n            objective is to develop a policy and compensation framework\n            for resettling and rehabilitation of project affected\n            persons by quantifying their losses and adopting appropriate\n            mitigation measures for the adverse effects of displacement.\n            A total of 157 households on the left and right banks will\n            be affected by this project. Key effects of dislocation are\n            displacement of the dwellings of 157 households, loss of\n            income during transition, psychological distress due to\n            dislocation, debt burden for house construction, and loss of\n            communal amenities. Compensation for loss of housing\n            structures and income interruption allowances are to be paid\n            in cash to project affected individuals. Suggested\n            mitigation measures also include community development\n            schemes, arrangement of business investment schemes for\n            males and females, and arrangement of business investment\n            schemes for males and females, and arrangement of employment\n            opportunities with the construction contractor."}, "docdt": "2005-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
