In view of potential environmental\n            adversity during construction works, this environmental\n            impact assessment provides mitigation measures in compliance\n            with the Bank's operational directives on the\n            environment, the project having been classified as category\n            B. This category is justified, since environmental impacts\n            will be localized over immediate project areas and\n            agricultural lands will be avoided at the construction\n            stage. Contractors shall comply with specific contract\n            requirements and with the social framework agreement\n            precautionary clauses. In addition, retrogression downstream\n            and pulsating hydraulic jumps shall be in compliance with\n            technically sound and economical designs of the secondary\n            weir, as will all other aspects of construction, and/or\n            engineering design. Construction wastes will be disposed of\n            at selected sites, and is the responsibility of the\n            contractor as defined in relevant contracts. Soil erosion\n            will be controlled, and the terrain should stabilize\n            accordingly. Oil spills, lubricants, and hazardous materials\n            will be stored in covered tanks, to be disposed of per\n            standard international regulations. Drainage systems will be\n            regularly inspected to avoid any possible sedimentation or\n            obstruction. Embankments or concrete walls will be installed\n            around the construction perimeter to secure construction\n            sites. Regular discharges and water flows will be regularly\n            controlled to avoid potential surface and water\n            contamination, while construction surfaces, and materials\n            should be covered to avoid air pollution. To mitigate noise\n            disturbances, working schedules will be limited to daytime\n            working hours. Inspections will be conducted by wildlife,\n            forest, and fisheries officials to ensure environmental\n            protection of sites or enforce legislation as needed. The\n            report also addresses social issues, including tribal\n            issues, particularly on the uses of canals and aquatic life."}, "docdt": "2006-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
