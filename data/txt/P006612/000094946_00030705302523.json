  Borrower's performances were satisfactory. The key\n            lessons reinforce the notion that close cooperation with the\n            potential beneficiaries of public sector investments in\n            irrigation infrastructure, is advantageous, for it develops\n            not only their involvement, but the sense of ownership,\n            particularly essential when cost recovery is a requirement,\n            and also, because of its significant contributions to\n            on-farm development. Close attention should be given to\n            water usage, so as to achieve an efficient operational, and\n            infrastructure maintenance, for, its institutional\n            development, when adequately planned, and implemented pays\n            good dividends. Since decentralization facilitates\n            farmers' participation in demand-driven projects, a\n            close working relationship with sub-national governments\n            becomes essential, even if these are not the main source of\n            investment funding. Careful technical quality of\n            pre-investment analysis should be emphasized, for, projects\n            such as this one, require the farmers' commitment as of\n            the earliest stages, and, accurate cost estimates are\n            needed, to foster adequate budget planning. Unfortunately,\n            budget fragmentation, hindered budgetary allocation for\n            individual sub-components, and activities."}, "docdt": "2000-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
