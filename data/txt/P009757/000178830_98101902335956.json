production in five Indian States (West Bengal, Bihar,\n            Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh) through\n            construction of fish-seed hatcheries, improvements to fish\n            ponds, strengthening of fisheries extension services,\n            establishment of training centers, and provision of\n            technical assistance. The project will raise income and\n            living standards for about 100,000 fish farm families,\n            mostly low income members of the rural agricultural\n            community. The main risks are that: (i) Fish Seed\n            Development Corporations may require more time than\n            envisaged to build up managerial competence for successful\n            operation of the project hatcheries; and (ii) during years\n            of extreme water scarcity, sufficient surface water may not\n            be made available to the hatcheries in Madhya Pradesh during\n            critical periods."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
