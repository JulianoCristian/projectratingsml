UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the development of cotton
pioduction in the West of Upper Volta. Under the project some 46,000 cotton
growers would increase the area of cotton they now cultivate from about
41,000 ha to about 76,500 ha, and in addition adopt improved cultivation
methods which would increase per ha cotton yields. The project would be
tbe Bank Group's first operation for agriculture in Upper Volta. Cotton
is Upper Volta's main export earner after livestock and meat and accounts
for 20% of total exports. Production generated by the project would amount,
by 1975, to about 30% of the country's total cotton production. The bulk
of project produced cotton would be exported but this would not have a
significant impact on world prices since, including project production,
Upper Volta's exports of the crop would constitute only about 0.2% of
world trade. The project represents one of the best means, foreseeable at
this time, of substantially improving the standard of living of a large
segment of the rural population of Upper Volta, a country poorly endowed
with natural resources.
ii.       The project would be the final phase of a long term cotton develop-
ment program designed to establish a cotton industry in West Volta capable
of competing efficiently on world markets. Until now, the program which
st.rted in 1963, has been supported largely with financial aid from France.
The project would -be carried out over a five-year period commencing in 1971,
an(' area expansion and yield improvement would be achieved by improving
credit, extension and narketinr services, as well as communications in the
project area; and by providing processing facilities.  The project would
also provide funds for a feasibility study of a possible cotton production
project in an adjacent area, and for detailed engineering of the improve-
ment of two secondary roads within the project area.
iii.      Project costs are estimated at US$9.4 million of which US$1 mil-
lion would be for construction of a new ginnery; about US$5.3 million for
creating, staffing and equipping a new Regional Development Office (ORD)
to administer extension, credit and cotton marketing services in part of
the project area, and strengthening and further equipping the existing ORD
which covers the remainder of the area; US$1.5 million for a revolving
agricultural credit capital fund to finance equipment and seasonal inputs;
US$1.3 million for feeder road improvement; and US$0.3 million for studies.
Direct investments in the ginnery, ORD housing, offices and equipment account
for 28% of project costs. IDA would finance 66% of total project costs
representing the estimated foreign exchange component; FAC 19%; and Govern-
ment 12%. Farmers would contribute 3%, mainly down payments on farm equip-
ment obtained on credit, in addition to farm family labor and draft animals
which are excluded from project costs. Procurement would be by international
bidding where orders and contracts are of a sufficient value to justify this
procedure, and goods and services procured in this way are estimated to have
a value of US$2.8 million.



- ii -
iv.       The Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles
(CFDT), a non-profit French technical assistance agency, would provide
the project director and the personnel to manage the project; the project
manager would be assisted by a project coordinating committee. Final
responsibility for the project would rest wïth the Minister of Agriculture.
The project manager would supervise the operations of the two Regional
Development Offices which would provide services to project participants.
CFDT is well-managed and has been responsible for Upper Volta's cotton
production programs and for the ginning and marketing of the crop since 1951.
All existing ginneries are owned by CFDT, but these, together with the new
ginnery to be constructed under the project and which would be owned by
Government, would be operated under a joint venture arrangement which would
come into force in 1971, and for which CFDT would be manager. Project funds
would be channeled through the Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND).
v.        The project would increase foreign exchange earnings and would
raise the income of about 46,000 participating farmers. Upper Volta's annual
export earnings from cotton at the end of the project development period are
estimated at US$10 million as compared to export earnings from cotton of
US$5.6 million estimated for 1970. The value of project induced cotton ex-
ports over the five-year development period is expected to be about US$18
million.  Based on the Bank's price forecasts for Middling 1" cotton, the
economic rate of return from investment in the project is estimated at 31%.
A sensitivity analysis shows that, if cotton yields or prices were 15% less
than projected, the return would be 23%. This rate of return is particularly
satisfactory in a country with such poor resources as Upper Volta; and while
the return is calculated on the basis of incremental benefits generated by
the project, such a satisfactory return would not be possible without Govern-
ment and French financed earlier operations in the project area; these have
improved farming techniques and have resulted in farmers becoming receptive
to advice and assistance.
vi.       Although farm gate prices for cotton would have to be reduced
during the development period in view of the anticipated downward trend in
world cotton prices, improvements in productivity brought about by the
project would result in higher incomes than in the past. The average yield
of seed cotton in the project area is estimated to increase from 620 kg in
1968 to about 870 kg per ha in 1975. Other crops would also benefit from
the project, principally from the residual effect of fertilizer applied to
cotton. The average farmer's net cash income before tax is estimated to
increase from a range of CFAF 5-9,000 at present to one of CFAF 30-60,000
per annum by 1975.
vii.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$6.2 million.



UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
i.lji     The Upper Volta Government has requested an IDA credit to assist
in financing further development of cotton production.  The Project was pre-
pared by the French Societe d'Etudes pour le Developpement Economique et
Sncial (SEDES), assisted by the Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement
dzs Fibres Textiles (CFDT). Costs of project preparation were met by the
rrench Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC). The proposed project would be
tae Bank Group's first lending for agriculture in Upper Volta. IDA granted
a credit of US$0.8 million for telecommunications in 1969 (141-UV).
1.02      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission
crimposed of Messrs. K.H.S. Haasjes and E. Zimmer-Vorhaus (IDA), M. Palein
a'id C. Delapierre (PMWA), and J. Cantournet (consultant), which visited
4i"per Volta in February 1970. Mr. Sadoul of FAC appraised the project at
tUie same timre for possible FAC participation in its financing.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.J1      Upper Volta is in West Africa to the North of Ghana and borders
th;9 Sahira Desert. Comprising 274,122 km2, about half the size of France,
it is land-locked, and its principal outlet to the sea is Abidjan, Ivory
-oist, to which it is connected by rail and road (Map 1). Rainfall through-
out the country is low and occurs over a short period. In the Southwest,
becween 1,100 and 1,300 mm fall in four to five months; but in the North,
C;,1 'y 50n-700 mm in a three to four month period is usual (Map 2).  Due to
this rainfall distribution, its fluctuations, and high temperatures (250 to
301C), most of the country is suitable only for fast growing, drought
tolerant crops. Soils are generally poor. While alluvial soils in river
valleys are often fertile, these are not cultivated because valleys are in-
fested with flies that carry river blindness. Consequently, population is
concentrated on poorer upland soils, large areas of which are rendered
valtueless by bard pan.
2.02      Population is about 5 million, and is growing at about 2% annually.
Overall population density is 15 to 20 per km2, but on the Mossi Plateau it
exceeds 40 per km2. Cultivated area per capita is 0.4 to 0.5 ha, and farm
families cultivate about 2.5 ha. Some 85% of the population is involved in
crop cultivation and another 6% in livestock rearing. Due to the harsh



-2
environment and limited employment opportunities, about 300,000 Voltaics
work abroad, particularly in the Ivory Coast. Repatriation of earnings
constitutes a substantial source of income for the country.
2.03      In 1966, GDP totalled CFAF 58,220 million (US$233 million equiv-
alent), with agriculture contributing 48.8%; while national income per
capita was equivalent to US$49, rural income averaged US$28 of which US$8
only was cash, making Upper Volta one of the poorest countries in the world.
B. Agricultural Sector
2.04      Subsistence crops, principally millet, sorghum, maize and rice,
occupy about 85% of the cultivated area (see Annex 1, Table 2). Scope for
increasing their production is limited, since domestic markets for food and
industrial crops, with the exception of sugar, are saturated. Livestock ex-
ports, largely cattle produced by nomads, dominate exports and show continued
growth. Livestock's share of agricultural exports has declined in recent
years, however, from about 75% in 1962-1966 to roughly 55% due to rising
cotton exports, a trend expected to continue. Cotton, groundnuts, sheanuts,
sesame, and other crops provided 38% of all exports, which were valued in
1968 at US$19 million equivalent with cotton accounting for US$3.7 million
or 19.6% (see Annex 1, Table 1). The mainstays of future agricultural devel-
opment will be livestock and cotton.
C. Cotton Production
2.05      Upper Volta began to develop cotton for export in 1951.  Progress
was slow up to 1965/66 when 7,500 tons of seed cotton were produced. Pro-
duction has since grown rapidly, to 17,300 tons in 1967/68 and to 36,250
tons in 1969/70. Although cotton acreage has expanded, production increases
have also been brought about by higher yielding varieties 1/ of superior
staple length and lint output; improved extension; and efficient arrange-
ments for providing credit and inputs to farmers, and for purchasing,
ginning and marleting the crop.
2.06      National average yields rose from 169 kg/ha seed cotton during
1962-1965, to 426 kg/ha in 1968-1969 (Annex 1, Table 3). Yields are
significantly higher in the areas with the best extension services. For
1/   Allen 333 (1l" - 1 1/32'; staple, 36% lint to seed cotton) is currently
grown. This will be replaced by 444-2 and BJA in the 1970 season (1"
- 1 1/16" staple, 38% lint to seed cotton).



-3-
example, the averagi 1968 yield in the Dedougou area, which produces about
5)7 of the country's cotton, was 620 kg/ha. Of the 28,000 ha grown in
î'edotl';ou in 1968, about 25% was treated with insecticide;~ only, and about 22%
vtitS both insecticiées and fertilizers; the balance received neither. In
thie country as a whole in 1968/69 only about 12% of the cotton area received
fertilizers (Annex 1, Table 4).
2.07      It is the Government's policy to increase cotton exports through
fuirtner productivity improvements, as well as by expanding the cotton area
per farm. The latter is possible only by reducing the area under food
crDns, a realistic tir-et, since present crop yields are low, and surplus
production is difficlut to market in Upper Volta's almost completely rural
sccietv. Yields of ood crons planted after cotton which has been fertil-
i2ed are increasine  nd the use of animal drawn implements is gaining
pepularity, particul r1y in such areas as Dedougou, where farmers, stimulated
h' the cash rewards , f intensive cotton growing, increased the number of
Jr i Jt animais froim L ;28 in 1966 to 2,426 in 1969.  Ile use of draft animals
erables farmers to ilcrease their cotton areas.
2.0i,>    Government Lacks the funds to finance any expansion of current
cnti-on developmuent eff=orts without external assistance. The French Fonds
(t idol et de Cooperation (FAC) has financed cotton development in the past,
b1:t maîinly on a year :o year basis. The proposed project represents the
iulh of the Governmenr: effort to expand cotton production over the next
five vears, unless additional financial aid is obtained.
D.   Institutions
2.('19    Responsibility for agricultural development policy and planning
is shared by the Ministry for Planning, Public Works and Industry (broad
policy); and tlhe Ministry of Agriculture (detailed agricultural development
planning). Execution of agricultural development programs is entrusted to
a number of foreign development agencies, all French but one:
-    Societe d'Aide Technique et de Cooperation (SATEC),
-    Bureau pour le Developpement de la Production Agricole (BDPA),
- ` Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles
(CFDT),
-    Compagnie Internationale de Developpement Rural (CIDR), and
-    Societe Technique pour le Developpement Agricole (SOTESA, Italian).



-4-
.ach agency manages one or more development areas, the program for which is
linanced either by FAC, the European Development Fund of the Common Market
(FFD), or the national budget. Six of these areas are classified as Orga-
nisme Regional de Developpement (ORD) and three more ORDs are to be esta-
1lished in the near future.  Map 3 shows location of existing and proposed
ÛPRDs, the responsible agencies and financing sources.
2.10      Regional Development Offices (ORD)  -  ORDs are responsible for
agricultural extension work, provision of credit and inputs to farmers, and
for purchasing and marketing farmers' crops. Performance of the ORDs varies
depending on funds available, organization and management, and crops grown.
Because cotton marketing is well organized by CFDT throughout the country,
wnether or not it operates the ORD, and the credits are recovered from
farmers' sale proceeds, ORDs with cotton programs function well and have a
sizeable economic impact. In the case of food crops, groundnuts and sesame,
however, credit recovery and general efficiency of development programs has
been poor, mainly because the ORDs have difficulty in recovering credits
when farmers sell to private traders. Government is attempting to control
the situation by licensing produce buyers.
2.11 igricultural Credit - Agricultural credit is provided by the
Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) which, through its Agricultural
Credit Division, lends to the ORDs which on-lend in kind to farmers such
seasonal inputs as insecticides and fertilizers on short term, and agri-
ultural equipment on medium term. Two commercial banks operate in Upper
Volta, the Banque Nationale de Paris, and the Banque Internationale de
l Afrique de l"Ouest (BIAO); but neither lends for agriculture although
BIAO and BND finance jointly stocks of cotton and other commodities held
b[y exoorters between purchase and export. Commercial and agricultural
('redit interest rates range between 6% and 8%, and are based on the Banque
Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest 1/ discount rate of 3.5%. BND
has limited financial resources and these are insufficient for revolving
seasonal credits. BNI) borrows from the French Caisse Centrale de Coop-
eration Economique (CCCE), and uses BCEAO discounting facilities. Further
details of BND are given in paras. 6.06 through 6.11 and Annex 2.
2.12      Agricultural Research - Agricultural research is undertaken by
French organizations under a technical assistance agreement with France.
Research costs are shared equally between the two countries. Institut de
Recherches pour les Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO) carries out research on
groundnuts and sesame and acts as a development agency for these crops in
one limited area. Institut de Recherches Agronomiques Tropicales et de
Cultures Vivrieres (IRAT) undertakes general research including food crops
and animal traction, and Institut de Recherches du Coton et des Textiles
1/   BCEAO is the Central Bank for the West African member countries of the
African Monetary Union, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mauritania,
Togo, Dahomey and Niger.



Exotiques (IRCT) in collaboration with CFDT is responsible for cotton research
and seed multiplication. These organizations concentrate on applied re-
search. Their long experience and the pooling of results obtained from their
world-wide network of research stations also contribute to their efficiency.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Location, Population and Land Tenure
2
3.01      The project area is situated in West Volta, covers 57,885 km
and comprises the ORD Dedougou plus the cercles Bobo-Dioulasso and Orodora;
the latter are not yet part of an ORD (see Map 4).
3.02      Population was estimated at 764,000 in 1966, increasing at 1.75% 1/
per annum, and expected to reach about 893,000 by 1975. Toma cercle has
the highest population density - 23.56 per km2 and Hounde, the lowest -
7.34 per km2. Seven major tribes occupy the project area, with the Bobo
tribe, who are good farmers, predominating.
3.03      There are about 87,500 farms in the project area, of which some
46,000 cotton farms would be in the project. Average farm family consists
of ten persons of whom about five cultivate, on average, 5 ha annually.
Farmers do not own the land they cultivate, but have rights of usufruct
under traditional law. The present land tenure system does not impede
the adoption of improved farming practices, and farmers are encouraged to
organize their cultivation so that cotton is grown in blocks thus facil-
itating pest control.
B. Climate and Soils
3.04      Rainfall varies from about 800 mm in the North, to 1,300 mm in
the South, and falls largely between mid-June and mid-September. Rainfall
is more reliable and lasts longer (end April - end September) in the South
than in the North where, every 10 years or so, droughts occur.
3.05      A soil survey on 1:500,000 scale carried out by Office de la
Recherche Scientifique et Technique d'Outre-Mer (ORSTOM) 2/ indicates
that on average project area soils are suitable for cotton. Most soils

are of the leached lateric type, intersected by alluvial soils along the
borders of rivers. The best cotton soils of Upper Volta (25-50% clay)
make up about 18% of the project area. Sandy soils cover about 40% of
the area and although leached, they produce good cotton crops with ade-
quate fertilization.
C. Communications
3.06      The road network in the project area comprises about 1,000 km
of primary roads, and 3,000 km of secondary and tertiary roads. Primary
and secondary roads lead to the two cotton ginning 1/ centers of Bobo-
Dioulasso and Koudougou, and these centers are linked by rail and road to
Abidjan (Ivory Coast). The state of primary roads is satisfactory. In
contrast, secondary and tertiary roads are poor. 2/ Many tertiary roads
are impassable even by light trucks, particularly in the rainy season, and
consequently, most goods are either head-loaded or transported on bicycles
and animal-drawn carts.
3.07      The Public Works Department (PWD) is responsible for maintenance
of primary roads and, following reorganization of the PWD maintenance branch
in 1968, routine maintenance has been satisfactory. PTD is also responsible
for secondary roads, but these are not repaired regularly due to budgetary
restrictions. Village communities are supposed to maintain tertiary roads,
but do little for lack of equipment and funds. A road improvement program
would be initiated in the project area as part of the proposed project.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project consists of both expanding the area under cotton on
some 46,000 farms in West Volta from about 44,000 ha at present to about
76,500 ha, and of improving per ha yields. This would be achieved through
improving credit and extension services; improving communications in the
project area; and providing processing facilities for project induced
cotton production increases. The project would comprise the final phase
of a program supported until now with financial assistance from France,
1/   Ginning:  the process by which seed cotton-the prDduct of the cotton
plant - is separated into cotton lint and cotton seed.
2/   Annual cotton tonnage carried on tertiary roads range from 80 to 300
tons; on secondary roads from 2,000 to 4,000 tons.



-7-
and managed by CFDT.  The objective of the program is to develop the ex-
perience and technical ability of cotton growers in the project area to
levels where, by the end of the project development period:
(a)  project farmers would be achieving financial
returns from cotton adequate to ensure their
continued cultivation of the crop at least at
the production levels achieved at the end of the
program period;
(b) the intensive extension services provided under the
program could be progressively withdrawn and the
resources so released used elsewhere; and
(c)  revenues to Government accruing from cotton growing
activities in the project area would be adequate to
finance the provision of the essential level of support
services that would be necessary to be retained in the
project area.
The program started in 1963, and thus by the time of its, and the project's
completion, would have been in operation for 12 years. Expenditures by
Government during this overall period, net of Government revenues generated
by increased cotton production, represent the capital cost of developing
in West Volta, a cotton growing industry capable of competing on the world's
markets.  At present, no alternative form of agricultural development that
would produce equivalent benefits can be foreseen. Consequently, while the
proposed project has the unusual feature that IDA would partially finance
existing support services, these would be needed to achieve the yield in-
creases to be obtained from current acreage. The project's objective of
establishing a capital asset producing a continuous stream of benefits is
the same as that of all projects financed by the Bank Group.  The project
would be carried out over a five-year period starting in 1971. Principal
components of the project would be:
(a) creating, staffing and equipping a new Regional Deve-
lopment Office (ORD) to administer extension, credit
and cotton marketing services in part of the project
area - the ORD Bobo-Dioulasso - and strengthening and
further equipping the existing ORD Dedougou covering
the remainder of the project area;
(b) establishing a revolving credit fund to provide cotton
growers with incremental seasonal credits for fertili-
zers and insecticides; and medium-term credits for the
purchase of agricultural equipment;
(c) constructing an additional ginnery in the project area
to increase annual ginning capacity from 39,000 tons of
seed cotton to 64,000 tons;



- 8 -
(d)  establishing a mechanical road rehabilitation unit, and
rehabilitating, during the project development period,
about 820 km of tertiary roads;
(e) providing funds for:
(i) preparation of a cotton production project
in the Diebougou-Gaoua area adjacent and to
the Southeast of the project area; and
(ii) detailed engineering of two secondary roads
within the project area, which would enable
construction to start in 1972.
4.02      CFDT would provide the personnel for managing the two project ORDs,
and the project manager and personnel for overall management of the project
including supervision of construction of the ginnery, and of the tertiary
roads rehabilitation program. BND would provide agricultural credit. IRCT
would be responsible for cotton research and seed multiplication, and Gov-
ernment would engage consultants to carry out the Diebougou-Gaoua cotton
feasibility study, and the road engineering. Principal organizational
arrangements are described in Chapter VI.
B. Detailed Features
4.03      Project Headquarters - Project headquarters would be established
at or near Bobo-Dioulasso. Under the project a headquarters office and
housing would be provided for the Project Manager, Deputy Manager and
Project Accountant.
4.04      The ORDs - ORD Dedougou with headquarters at Dedougou has a chain
of branch offices, cotton storage silos, and stores throughout its opera-
tional area. Under the project an additional senier staff house, two cotton
silos, and one sector and seven village stores would be constructed. Project
activity in the Tougan district would be limited to the provision of two
extension agents for the introduction of cotton cultivation on a few demon-
stration farms.
4.05      ORD Bobo-Dioulasso would require a larger construction program
since the area has few existing facilities. Build-Lngs constructed under
the project would include an office, seven senior staff houses, a central
store, two cotton silos, one sector store, a workshop and 19 village stores.
Details and costs of building programs are given at Annex 10, Table 2.
4.06      A total of 57 vehicles, inclusive of replacements during the
development period, would be purchased under the project for ORD and head-
quarters staff (Annex 10, Table 3).



-9 -
4.07      Details of project staff requirements are given in Chapter VI and
rn Annex 3.  At present 285 staff of all grades are working in the project
area and most of these would be fully concerned with project activities
and would be financed under the project. To meet project needs staff
numbers would increase to 379 by the end of the development period, there-
after declining. By 1975 the ratio of field extension workers to project
farmers would be 1:285, which is adequate.
4.08      Credit Fund - Both seasonal and medium-term credit would be ex-
tended to project participants; details of the proposed arrangements are
given in paras 4.18 through 4.23.  It is estimated that in the period 1971-
75 project participants would purchase about 1,400 plows, 1,100 carts, and
9,100 hand-operated knapsack sprayers; and that by 1975 project participants
would be using some 2,800 metrie tons of fertilizer and 0.4 million liters
of pesticides annually.  Arn amount of CFAP 423 million (US$1.5 million) would
be needed for a revolving credit fund.
4.09      Ginnery - Project area cotton is now ginned at two ginneries at
Bobo-Dioulasso and Koudougou. Total capacity is 53,000 tons, and part of
Koudougou capacity is needed for non-project area cottoa. To process in-
cremental project production a new Governmenit owned g:trnery of 25,000 tons
capacity would be constructed in 1972 at Hounde, see M4ap 3.  This should
provide adequate ginning capacity until 1975. Annex 4 gives details of the
present ginning situation, and the justification for locati.on and capacity
of the ginnery to be constructed at lounde.  Planning and design of the
ginnery would be the responsibility of CFDT.
4.10      Rehabilitation of Tertiary Roads- A program to improve the
tertiary road system of the project area through the project development
period is inicluded in the project.  The program wou:Ld involve about 820 km
of roads used for the evacuation of cotton and would entail gradïng and
reshaping, improvement of drainage, and where necessary improving sections
by regraveling, building culverts and fords, arid other au.xciliary works.
Road works would be carried out by a small mechanized unit, the principal
components of which would be a bulldozer, a loader, two motor graders and
five dump trucks, under the supervision of a qual:ified téechnlcian w/ho would
be directly responsible to the Project Manager.  Tne tertiary road improve-
ment program is described in detail in Annex 5.  Durinîg -.iecotiations,
assurances were obtained from the Government that a program of road improve-
ment would be agreed annually with IDA, that all equipment purchased for
the program would be used and retained in the project area, and that the
project roads would be maintained adequately after the project has been
completed.
4.11      Cotton Feasibility Study - Conditions in the Diebougou area - to
the Southeast of the project area - appear suitable for cotton. A feasibi-
lity study would be made and if shown viable, a cotton development project
for Diebougou would be prepared. The study would be carried out by con-
sultants agreeable to and under terfs of reference approved by IDA.
Assurances to this effect were obtained from the Governr,aent durlng
negotiations.



- 10 -
4.12      Detailed Engineering of Secondary Roads - The improvement of two
secondary roads, Hounde-Bereba (27 km) and Koundougou-Solenzo (77 km), in
the project area is desirable and appears to be justified economically on
the basis of preliminary cost estimates 1/.   Detailed engineering for these
roads are anticipated to take about ten months. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from the Government that consultants agreeable to
IDA would be employed for this work under terms of reference approved by
IDA. After completion of the work this road project is expected to be
submitted to IDA for financing, but during negotiations Government's agree-
ment was obtained that in any case it would discuss with IDA the means that
it would employ to ensure construction of the roads.
C. Field Operations
4.13      Extension Methods - Extension methods would be those already
proved effective in Upper Volta and other West African countries.  They
are aimed at inducing cotton growers to graduate through four stages of
progressively increasing cotton cultivation intensity. These stages are:
(1) sowing cotton in rows, sowing and weeding at the optimum
time;
(2) using insecticides in addition to (1);
(3) using fertilizers in addition to (1) and (2); and
(4) using animal-drawn farm implements.
Each stage results in progressive increases in cotton production, and the
residual effect of the fertilizer increases the yields of the crop follow-
ing cotton in the rotation by about 20 percent. Consequently areas planted
to food crops decline and land freed is thus planted to cotton on other cash
crops, in particular sesame. Details of rotations, and use of insecticides
and fertilizers, in the project area are given in Annex 6. While project
extension workers would concentrate on cotton, they would also provide
advice and services for other crops. Models for the various ecological
zones are given in Annex 7.
4.14      Cotton Seed Supplies and Applied Research - Cotton seed would be
supplied to farmers free of charge and CFDT and IRCT would be responsible
for ensuring supplies. Annex 8 describes the process in detail. Apart from
seed multiplication IRCT would continue monitoring the performance of new
varieties and conduct pesticide and fertilizer trials.
1/ An internal economic rate of return of 14% is indicated.



- il -
4.15      During the project development period IRCT would conduct special
research into a virus disease which appeared in 1968 and is estimated to
have caused a yield depression of about 6 percent in 1969. Little is known
about host plants, and vectors; at the Government's request for research
funds UNDP has requested FAO to prepare a plan of operations and a cost
estimate for the research studies required.  IDA has informed UNDP that it
supports Upper Volta's request and recommended that FAO be the executing
agency and IRCT the agency to carry out the research program.
4.16      Fertilizers - Project farmers would use standard fertilizer rates
for cotton, i.e. a single annual application of 100 kg/ha NPS 20-37-7 com-
pound fertilizer costing about CFAF 4,200/ha.
4.17      Pesticides - Cotton pests would be controlled through, on average,
three annual sprays by using hand operated knapsack sprayers; currently a
DDT-Endrin mixture is used costing CFAF 3,550/ha. Both DDT and Endrin are
"hard" insecticides, but are cheap. Less persistent and dangerous insecti-
cides could be used, but only at the expense of substantially lower farm
incomes, and consequently loss of interest in cotton growing.  During the
project development period a gradual change would be made to an Endosulfan-
Methylparathion mixture, a safer and relatively cheap combination if this is
found to be effective; and research would continue to seek improved and eco-
nomic methods of pest control.
D. Credit Arrangements and Supply of Inputs
4.18      Seasonal Credits - Seasonal credits would be made to qualified
farmers by the ORDs, with funds borrowed from BND.  Credit would go only to
villages in an ORD sector in which no seasonal credit repayments were over-
due and overdue credit repayments did not exceed 10 percent for medium-term
credits, and only to farmers in a village group, 1/ recognized by the ORD,
with a repayment record on past seasonal and medium-term loans of 100
percent. Additionally farmers would pay an initial fee of CFAF 200 to
qualify.
4.19      Medium-Term Credits - Basic qualifications for obtaining medium
term credits would be the same as for seasonal credits. The farmer, how-
ever, would pay a fee of CFAF 800 to qualify; and would be required to ob-
tain credit for one year's supply of fertilizers and pesticides for a
minimum of 0.5 ha of cotton. Annex 9 gives details of project credit re-
quirements.
4.20      Apraisal Procedures - Existing appraisal procedures are satis-
factory and would not be changed. Farmers would apply to their ORD ex-
tension worker. Application for seasonal credits would be approved by the
1/   A group of farmers in a village and a type of mutual guarantee society,
although without legal status.



- 12 -
ORD Sector Chief and the village group. Criteria considered would be the
farmer's general standing in the community, and his technical capability.
Medium-term credit applications would be treated the same way, but would
be subject to screening by a Sector Loan Committee - comprising representa-
tives of the ORD, Administration, BND and locally appointed members.
4.21       Interest Rates and Terms of Loans - A commission of 5 percenit on
the value of the fertilizers and insecticides supplied would be charged bv
the ORD.  Taking into account a repaynent period of less than 10 months,
this is equivalent to an interest rate of slightly more than 8 percent. For
medium-term loans, repayable in 21 months for amounts below CFAF 10,000,
and in 33 months for amounts over CFAF 10,000, the 5 percent commission
charged by BND and a mandatory down-payment of 33 percent, respectively
25%, is equivalent to an interest rate of 7.6 percent, respectively 8.2%.
4.22      Credit Recovery - ORDs would keep records of farmers receiving
loans, and repayments wotuld be deducted from cotton sales proceeds. It
would be mandatory for farmers to sell their cotton to the ORD; in practice
there is no alternative market. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from Government and BND that the above credit appraisal, issue, and
recovery arrangements would be employed.
4.23      Supply of Inputs and Equipment - Sprayers, farm equipment, fertil-
izers, and insecticides procured by CFDT on the basis of estinates prepared
by the ORD are stocked at ORD stores fromi wlere they are issued to farmers
against vouchers authorized by ORD.
E. Development Schedule
4.24      The area under cotton is estimated to increase fron 44,000 ha in
1970 to about 76,500 in 1975. The new ginnery would start operation bv the
end of 1972 and total project ginning capacity would be 64,000 tons. After
1975, project headquarters would be disbanded, and the Directors of the two
ORD would assume fu1l responsibility for further developnent.

V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
A. Project Costs
5.01      Project cost estimates and their foreign exchange components
are shown in the following table, and are elaborated further in Annex 10.
Project costs are based on recent experience in Upper Volta and take
account of recent price changes caused by devaluation of the CFAF. All
costs include a provision for price escalation equivalent on average to
5% per annum, and additional contingencies of 10% have been allowed for
buildings, equipment and vehicles but not for fertilizers and pesticides
since increasingly large bulk purchases should offset price increases.
All costs include duties and taxes. Project costs include salaries and
allowances of all ORD staff engaged on the project, staff training costs,
managing agents' fees, and ORD operating costs. These expenses during
the development period accounting for 50% of total project costs are
included in the project costs, because they are essential to establish
a framework for extension and supply and marketing services and a standard
of cultivation by farmers that will continue to have an impact after the
development period. Increased production will then create sufficient
revenues to cover these costs which will be decreasing due to the phas-
sing out of expatriate staff.

B. Financial Arrangements
5.02      It is proposed that IDA should make a credit of US$6.2 million to
meet 96% of the foreign exchange cost (US$5.3 million less US$0.2 million
foreign exchange cost of on-farm costs financed by CCCE) and 27% (US$1.1
million) of the local cost of the project (US$4.1 million). The proposed
credit would cover about 66.1% of total project costs and the remainder
would be met by FAC/CCCE (18.6%), the Government (12.2%), and farmers
(3.1%). FAC/CCCE's contribution of CFAF 484 million (US$1.74 million) would
be a grant to the Government to meet: (a) 40% of the cost of salaries and
17.5% of operating cost, CFAF 428 million (US$1.5 million); and (b) credit
for on-farm costs, CFAF 56 million (US$0.20 million). The Government con-
tribution of CFAF 319.0 million (US$1.15 million) would be from budgetary
appropriations. The farmers' contribution, which excludes their and their
familv's labor and the cost of their work oxen, totalling CFAF 80 million
(US$0.3 million) would be for down payments on farm equipment and repayments
of equipment credits (Annex 9) and represents the maximum that they can af-
ford. The financing plan is summarized in the following table and given in
detail in Annex 11.

5.03      The proposed IDA credit would be made on standard terms to the
Government of Upper Volta. The Government would apply proceeds of the credit
together with its own and FAC/CCCE contributions, as follows:
(a) to BND
(1) CFAF 353.3 million (US$1.3 million) would be contributed
as additional equity in BND and used for:
(i) establishing a revolving fund for seasonal and medium-
term lending at 5.5% interest to the two project ORD
which in turn would make seasonal credits in kind to
farmers for 10 months at 8% interest per annum (CFAF 311
million); and medium-term loans to farmers for equipment
for 21 months at 7.6% interest or for 33 months at 8.2%
interest per annum (CFAF 42 million);
(2) CFAF 278.6 million (US$1.00 million) would be on-lent
to BND at 3.5% interest to be on-lent to the Caisse de
Stabilisation des Prix des Produits de la Haute Volta
(CSPP) at 5.5% interest, repayable over 15 years, for
construction and equipment of the proposed ginnery;
(3)  CFAF 1,826.5 million (US$6.6 million) would be channelled
through BND to meet other project investment and operating
costs. These funds would bear no interest.
(b)  to the Ministry of Planning, Industry and Public Works 55.6 mil-
lion (US$0.2 million) to meet costs of the road engineering
study;
(c)  to the Ministrv_of Agriculture CFAF 11 million (US$0.04 million)
to meet costs of the feasibility study for a second cotton project.
5.04      Assurances were obtained from Government and BND during negotia-
tions that BND's equity would be increased and that the terms and conditions
of the BND loan to CSPP would be as described above.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
5.05      Procurement of fertilizers, insecticides, sDrayers, farm equip-
ment and road improvement equipment (totalling about US$2.8 million)
would be by international competitive bidding. The new ginnery would also
be subject to international bidding following IDA's prior approval of the
design. Assurances to this effect were obtained from the Government during
negotiations. Tenders for the construction of stores, houses, and offices,
vaiued at about US$0.4 million would be let locally since the size of indi-
vidlual contracte would be inadequate to attract foreign bids. A satisfactory
degree of competition between experienced local contractors can be expected.



- 17 -
Other goode (furniture, office equipment, vehicles) valued at about US$0.4
million and for which there is a satisfactory degree of competition, would
be procured locally. Government procedures for local procurement are ac-
ceptable to IDA.
5.06      Disbursement of the proposed credit would be made against:
(a) 100% of the CIF Bobo-Dioulasso cost of goods directly import-
ed for the project such as the ginnery and road equipment,
estimated at US$0.63 million;
(b) 100% of the costs of the two feasibility studies, about US$0.28
million;
(c) 61% of the costs of local and expatriate staff salaries, office
equipment and furniture, construction, vehicles, and project
management and ORD operating, about US$4.04 million;
(d) 25% of the CIF Bobo-Dioulasso cost of fertilizers, insecticides
and agricultural equipment, about US$1.03 million.
About US$218,000 would be unallocated. Disbursements of the credit would be
made against import documents and appropriate records certified by the Proj-
ect Manager and BND. A detailed disbursement schedule appears in Annex 11.
5.07      It is recommended that any surplus funds remaining in the credit
account be cancelled.
D. Accounts and Audits
5.08      BND would handle all project funds, except those allocated for
the studies, and would keep separate accounts for the project. These would
be audited annually, as now, by both the French Caisse Centrale de Coopera-
tion Economique (CCCE) and by the Financial Controller of the Ministry of
Finance. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government
that audited annual reports would be submitted to IDA not later than four
months after closing of BND's financial year and that current audit arrange-
ments would be continued or replaced by others acceptable to IDA.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
6.01      Overall responsibility for the project rests with the Ministry
of Agriculture. The Government will engage Compagnie Francaise pour le De-
veloppement des Fibres Textiles (CFDT) to provide personnel to manage the
project under an agreement satisfactory to IDA. CFDT is a non-profit French



- 18 -
semi-Government development agency charged with the development of fiber
crops in ex-French territories and elsewhere. Further details of CFDT are
given in Annex 12. CFDT will supply a Project Manager, Deputy Manager, and
Financial Controller and such staff required for ORD positions that would
not be filled by Voltaics. The contract with CFDT will provide for training
of Voltaic personnel.
6.02      The Minister of Agriculture would appoint a Project Coordinating
Committee, of which the Project Manager would be the secretary. The Com-
mittee's primary responsibility would be to ensure the full support of
Government agencies providing services in the project area. The Committee
under the chairmanship of the Minister of Agriculture would comprise repre-
sentatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Planning, Indus-
try and Public Works, the Ministry of Finance and Commerce, the Caisse de
Stabilisation des Prix des Produits (CSPP), the Banque Nationale de Devel-
oppement (BND) and the Boards of the project ORDs. Members of the Committee
nominated by their appropriate Ministers would be of such seniority as to
commit their Departments and Agencies to specific courses of action at the
Committee's regular meetings which would be held at least once every six
months. The proposed composition of the Committee and draft terms of ref-
erence are at Annex 13 and terms of reference of the Project Manager are at
Annex 14. During negotiations agreement was reached between Government and
IDA on the composition of the Committee, its terms of reference and those
of the Project Manager. Appointment of the Project Committee, of the Proj-
ect Manager, and signature of the services contract with CFDT are conditions
of effectiveness.
B. Regional Development Offices
6.03      Under the project, transfer of the Hounde and Boromo districts
to the new ORD Bobo-Dioulasso, would reduce the area now covered by ORD
Dedougou to the districts of Dedougou, Toma, Nouna, and Tougan (see Map
3). The new ORD Bobo-Dioulasso would cover the districts of Bobo, Orodara,
Hounde and Boromo. CFDT, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Compagnie In-
ternationale de Developpement Rural (CIDR), and IREO now provide services
in the area of the new ORD Bobo-Dioulasso (see organization chart). A
condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit is the termination of
the existing arrangements and establishment of the ORD under a director
provided by CFDT. However, CFDT would not be precluded from sub-contracting
parts of its obligations to agencies such as CIDR and IRHO which are effi-
cient.  During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government
that such sub-contracts would be entered into only with the approval of IDA.



- 19 -
C. Financial Organization
6.04      BND would administer project funds (see para 5.08).  It is better
qualified for this role than any of the Government Departments since its
accounting system is sound, and it receives technical assistance from
CCCE.
6.05      Funds required for ORD operations would be made available to BND
by Government quarterly and in advance. Allocations would be based on
estimates prepared by the Project Manager and approved by the Project Com-
mittee and IDA, and BND would establish a project account from which the
project Manager would be authorized to draw. Each ORD would maintain
accounts of expenditures which would be consolidated into project accounts
maintained by the Project Manager. BND would continue to check ORD and
proJect accounts at least twice a year and would audit such accounts an-
nually. During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government and
BND that the above arrangements would be followed.
D. Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND)
6.06      Operations.  BND was set up in 1961 when it took over activities
of the Credit de la Haute Volta. Details are given in Annex 2. Paid-up
capital is CFAF 355 million contributed as follows: Government 63%, CCCE
28%, and BCEAO 9%. The BND Administrative Council of 12 comprises eight
Government nominees, and members representing CCCE, FAC, and BCEAO, and
a General Manager nominated by the Council and appointed by the President
of the Republic. The Minister of Planning and Public Works is responsible
for BND.
6.07      BND's objective is to provide technical and financial assistance
for projects furthering the economic and social development of Upper Volta.
Its operations cover a broad field of activity as shown by its pattern of
lending in 1968/69 when loans for agriculture accounted for 53% (11% produc-
tion, and 42% marketing); commerce 5%; housing 15%; industry 16%; and vehicles
and other equipment 12% of total lending volume. Since its establishment BND
has made loans totalling CFAF 5.7 billion (US$20.5 million) and has participated
in eight local industries to an extent of CFAF 74.7 millions (US$269,000).
Of loans current at September 30, 1969 and totalling CFAF 1.2 million (US$4.3
million) 36% were agricultural, 27% housing, and 27% for other purposes.
Interest rates are in line with commercial rates in the country ranging be-
tween 6 and 8%.
6.08      Apart from BND liquid funds, and deposits made by the Government
agencies, largely the ORDs, tlhe bank's main sources for borrowing are BCEAO,
and CCCE. BCEAO discounts, at 3.5% interest, medium-term loans for five
years up to 65%, and seasonal loans renewable every three months up to
90%. Discounting facilities are reconsidered from time to time by BCEAO's
National Monetary Committee following re-evaluation of BND's financial



- 20 -
situation. CCCE is providing credits to BND without ceiling, and these
credits bear interest at 3.5%. The bank is heavily dependent on CCCE and
BCEAO which in turn exercise considerable control over its activities.
6.09      Condensed balance sheets and profit and loss statements for the
period 1966/67-1968/69 are at Annex 2. These show that BND made a profit
of CFAF 53 million (US$190,000) in 1968/69, the first in its history; and
that its reserves at September 30, 1969 stood at CFAF 160 million equiva-
lent to 6.4% of total assets. BND performance in the past has been marred
by defaults on loans made to farmers. As of September 30, 1969, repayments
overdue by farmers amounted to CFAF 28 million, or 25% of BND's outstanding
balances of CFAF 111 million. Performance in 1968/69 was appreciably
better than in the preceding years, when amounts overdue on agricul-
tural loans were equivalent to 39% and 46%. In contrast repayments over-
due on all BND loans amounted to CFAF 76 million or 4%. This improved
performance should continue due to changes in lending policy made in 1968.
These included nationwide introduction of loan appraisal and qualification
procedures described in paras 4.18 through 4.22 and in Annex 2; transfer
of debt collection on medium-term loans to the ORD; and issue of a Govern-
ment decree treating repayments due to BND like taxes due to the Government;
this makes it obligatory for civil authorities to sequester property of
defaulters. Annex 2, Table 6 compares the performance in debt collection
in 1969 by the ORD Dedougou under the new arrangements (100%) with that
of BND in the same area for loans made previously and for which BND re-
tained the responsibility for collection (77%). The new agricultural
credit arrangements should work well; during negotiations assurances were
obtained from the Government that procedures described above would be ap-
plied to all lending for agricultural production and that they would not be
modified without the consent of IDA.
6.10      Management - BND management and accounting are good.  Staff total
60 of whom five, including the head of the agricultural credit division are
expatriate and provided by CCCE. Although BND's lending in agriculture
would expand, only one additional post, that of Inspector of ORD credit,
will be required, since credits will be administered at ORD level by BND
trained loan officers. During negotiations assurances were obtained from
Government and BND that during the 5-year project development period the
posts of Deputy Director, Agricultural Credit Division, and of Chief Account-
ant would be filled by persons whose qualifications and experience would be
acceptable to IDA, and that the ORD Inspector would be appointed.
6.11      Future Finances - Due to BND's dependence on CCCE and BCEAO, and
its broad lending program, it is difficult to forecast BND's future finan-
cial situation. However, with the increase in equity proposed under the
project the financial needs of the country's cotton development program,
(the only significant agricultural program) would be met adequately; and
it may be assumed that BCEAO discount facilities, and CCCE credit would con-
tinue to be available to meet credit needs for other lending which in the
opinion of BCEAO and CCCE are financially sound. Tentative projections of
BND's financial requirements are given in Annex 2, Table 3.



- 21 -
E. Staffing and Training
6.12      Annex 3 gives project staff requirements, at ORD and project head-
quarter level, by posts and years. The project would involve the recruit-
ment of 94 additional staff of all grades, of whom eight would be profes-
sionally or technically qualified, and the remainder would be extension
workers whose qualifications would be literacy and successful completion
of in-service training by CFDT.
6.13      CFDT should have no difficulty in recruiting and training personnel.
Government institutions would supply the small number of personnel requiring
specialized training such as surveyors, veterinary aides, and mechanics
required to teach repair and maintenance of crop sprayers and farm machinery.
In 1970 the Government assisted by ILO organized courses to train craftsmen
and instructors for metal work, wood carpentry and bricklaying and has sub-
mitted to UNDP a request to finance continuation and extension of the ILO
program until the end of 1974.
6.14      There is a shortage of Voltaic staff capable of filling key posts
in the ORDs, at the level of Sector Chiefs and above. It is expected that
about 55% of these posts have to be filled by expatriates recruited either
by CFDT or sub-contracted agencies such as CIDR. It is essential that Voltaic
personnel should be given in-service training to enable them to assume greater
responsibility. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Gov-
ernment that, prior to the start of each cotton season, the Government would
agree with IDA on the replacement of expatriates by local personnel. In
order to ensure effective staffing during the project period assurances were
also obtained that appointments to the ORD posts of Director, Deputy Director,
and Accountant would be agreed between the Government and IDA.  The filling
of these posts is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
F. Marketing and Ginning
6.15      Marketing - All project cotton would be purchased, at suitably
located cotton markets, by the appropriate ORD on behalf of CFDT. Payments
to farmers would be in cash after deductions of short and medium term cre-
dit repayments and would be based upon minimum producer prices set by the
Caisse de Stabilisation des Prix des Produits (CSPP) in advance of the crop-
ping season (see para 7.08). In return for credit collection the ORD would
receive CFAF 100 per ton of seed cotton purchased. These arrangements have
been used since 1969 and they work well.
6.16      Ginning and Export - Under current arrangements, CFDT collects
seed cotton from the markets, processes it and exports lint. CSPP markets
cotton seed.  CFDT receives a fixed fee of CFAF 18,000 for each ton of
lint processed and CFAF 3,000 in addition for each ton exported. It is
reimbursed for expenses incurred in purchasing seed cotton and exporting
lint according to a schedule (bareme, see Annex 18, Table 3) fixed by
CSPP in advance of the season. After the season, CSPP reimburses CFDT



- 22 -
for, or collects from CFDT any differences between the schedule price
and the average sale price. Thus all profits on exports go to CSPP (the
Government). The Government feels, however, that CFDT may be making
profits on its ginning because the fixed fee of CFAF 18,000 which
represents the average processing costs per ton of lint in all CFDT's
African ginneries, may be higher than actual costs experienced in CFDT's
Upper Volta ginneries, all of which are relatively new. CFDT and the Go-
vernment have now agreed that CSPP and CFDT should share in any profits
made in both ginning and marketing. Advantage vould be taken of the con-
struction of the new CSPP owned ginnery under the project to establish
new arrangements. Under these, CFDT and the Government vould enter into a
Contract of Association in Participation (the Participation), a form of
joint venture. The new agreement, which would replace the current agreement
signed in 1965, would be renevable every five years, and details are given
in Annex 16. Under the terms of the Participation CFDT would put at the
Participation's disposal all its industrial and commercial installations in
Upper Volta and CSPP would contribute the proposed new ginnery and any
other ginneries that the Government might subsequently establish. CFDT
would manage the Participation and be responsible to a committee comprising
three members appointed by the Government and three by CFDT, and CSPP
would have the right to check all costs incurred by the Participation.
Profits made by the Participation from all its activities, including pur-
chasing, processing and export, would be shared between the Government and
CFDT in the ratio 80:20. CFDT would be required to re-invest its 20% profit
share in Upper Volta, but would receive a fee equivalent to 2% of the CIF
value of lint exported, and proceeds of this fee would be repatriable. In
the event of losses being incurred by the Participation these would be
borne by CSPP since such losses would occur normally through CSPP setting
too high a producer price (see para 6.15). The terms of the new agreement
are similar to those in force in Cameroon, where CFDT's cotton development
program has reached a more advanced stage than elsewhere. The arrangements
work to the satisfaction of both the Cameroon Government and CFDT, and
CFDT favors introducing the same type of agreement into other countries be-
ginning with Upper Volta. The draft agreement has been examined by IDA and
is satisfactory provided minor modifications. A condition of effectiveness
of the proposed credit is the amendment of the agreement of Association in
Participation.

VII.  YIELDS AND PRODUCTION, MARKETING,
FARMERS' BENEFITS AND
GOVERNMENT REVENUES
A. Yields and Production
7.01      Cotton - The national average cotton yield increased from 170
kg/ha in the period 1962/63 - 1965/66 1/ to 426 kg/ha in 1968/69 2/. Average
yields in the project area, which has been, and continues to be, subject
to intensive extension activity, are much higher; thus, in 1968/69 farmers
in ORD Dedougou averaged 620 kg/ha. It is estimated that during the project
development period the average yield would increase by 110 kg/ha from a
base of 757 kg/ha 3/ in 1970/71, the year preceding the project, to 868 kg/ha.
This is believed to be a realistic estimate and is based on the yield ana-
lysis shown in Annex 6. Fertilizer trials carried out by IRCT and IRAT in
the project area have given yields exceeding 2,000 kg/ha; and IRCT con-
siders that yield projections used in this report for Stage 3 development
(where fertilizers are used) are overly conservative.
7.02      CFDT's experience in Upper Volta is that about three years of
extension activity are needed before farmers begin to adopt new techniques
to an appreciable extent but that thereafter, farmer acceptance, and thus
output, increases rapidly. Annual project area production is estimated to
increase from 33,360 tons of seed cotton in 1970/71 to 66,345 tons in
1975/76. Total seed cotton production induced by the project over the five
year development period is estimated at about 88,000 tons; of this, incre-
mental production from existing acreage is estimated at about 14,000 tons;
the remainder would be produced on the additional areas planted to cotton.
7.03      Other Crops - The average yield of other crops which would benefit
from the project (groundnuts, sesame, and small grains such as sorghum and
millet), largely from residual fertilizer effects, are given in Annex 6.
For the purpose of project calculations, it is assumed that production of
food crops on project farms would remain sufficient to meet the farm fa-
milies' needs, but that output of sesame, the principal alternative but
financially less attractive cash crop, produced in the project area would
decline from 9,100 tons in 1970 to 4,400 tons in 1975.
1/   Cotton is sown in June and harvested between November and January while
ginning starts in November and ends usually in April.
2/   The average 1968/69 yields in neighboring countries:  Mali, 567 kg/ha
(in 1969/70 680 kg/ha); Dahomey, 789 kg/ha, and Ivory Coast, 867 kg/ha.
Projections made for Mali by CFDT where ecological conditions are
comparable to those in Upper Volta, are: 900 kg/ha by 1972/73 and
1,000 kg/ha by 1974/75.
3/   This figure is based on the extrapolation of yield increases in recent
years, and takes into account the inclusion in the project area of some
of Upper Volta's best cotton growing areas.



- 24 -
B. Markets and Prices
7.04      Cotton - The local textile industry, Societe Voltaique des Textiles
(VOLTEX), uses between 900 and 1,000 tons lint annually, and remaining lint
production is exported mainly to Europe. All cotton seed is now exported,
largely to Japan, and this is expected to continue in the foreseeable future.
7.05      Expansion of cotton production in Upper Volta and other West and
Central African countries with similar programs should have only a minor
influence on world market supplies. In 1968/69 the ten countries in which
CFDT operates produced less than 1.6% of world production, and Upper Volta's
share was 0.14%. Doubling the output of the project area should cause no
marketing problems and would have no impact on world market prices. The
International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) accepts that a policy of
limiting export quotas of countries such as Upper Volta would seriously
hamper their economic development.
7.06      Export prices used in project projections are based on CIF Liver-
pool prices for US Middling 1". African 1" - 1" 1/32 is comparable to this
grade. See Annex 18, Table 7. The Bank's Economics Department projects a
15% price decline for this grade by 1975 and this is taken into account in
project calculations which assume a decline from 25.1/lb CIF Liverpool in
1970/71 to 22.5i/lb by 1974/75. While prices may stabilize after 1975 this
report assumes a further decline to 21.5j/lb by 1979/80. It is assumed that
prices for Upper Volta cotton would remain about CFAF 4/kg below comparable
CIF Liverpool prices for US Middling 1". However, as Upper Volta cotton
becomes better known, and as the proportion of higher priced 1" - 1" 1/16
staple in the national crop increases, this assumption may prove conserva-
tive.
7.07      It is assumed that in line with Bank forecasts, cotton seed prices
will decline from US$85/long ton CIF Osaka in 1970 to US$80 in 1976 and re-
main constant thereafter. Tle average CIF price obtained for Upper Volta
cotton seed in the period 1965-1969 was US$87.27/long ton.
7.08      Producer Price - In 1968 CSPP reduced prices to levels equivalent
to an average producer price of CFAF 30.72/kg; nevertheless, this price
necessitated CSPP support 1/ costing CFAF 116 million. Devaluation of the
CFAF in 1969 helped CSPP, and it would be possible to maintain current
producer price from accumulated reserves until 1976/77 despite anticipated
falls in world market prices. Estimates in Annex 17 show, however, that
CSPP would have to support prices again in 1974175 and that by 1980 without
a reduction in producer price such support could cost CFAF 336 million
1/   Support funds are provided by CSPP, and derive from a number of sources,
but with the envisaged increase in cotton production the ability of
CSPP to support seed cotton prices at past levels is highly uncertain.
Details of support arrangements are given in Annex 15.



- 25 -
annually. A reduction in producer prices is thus likely to be essential
by about 1974, but its timing would depend upon actual world market prices,
and the need to ensure that yields have increased enough to guarantee con-
tinued farmer's interest. Projections indicate that in 1973/74 it would be
necessary to reduce producer prices by about 5% for CSPP to earn a small
surplus on its cotton account and that progressive further reductions
would be needed until 1980 when prices should be about 85% of their present
level. Price reductions would come at the time of increased productivity,
and by 1974/75 net cash returns to cotton farmers would increase 46%
above average present levels if the current producer price is retained.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that
CSPP surpluses from cotton operations would be maintained in a separate
account to support cotton prices; and further that producer prices would
be reviewed annually and in consultation with IDA reduced, if and when
necessary, to maintain CSPP's cotton account on a sound financial basis.
7.09      Other Crops - Producer prices for other cash crope, mainly sesame
and groundnuts, are also fixed annually by CSPP. Currently these are be-
tween CFAF 24/kg and CFAF 28/kg for sesame depending on transport distance
and between CFAF 12/kg and CFAF 16/kg for unshelled groundnuts. These prices
are used in project projections, since it is not anticipated that world
supply and demand developments will affect these prices to any substantial
extent. Upper Volta produces about 75,000 tons of groundnuts but exporta
only 8,000 to 10,000 tons and this volume would decline as a result of the
project. In the case of sesame, Upper Volta exporte about 3,000 tons an-
nually, or about 2X of world exporte. The anticipated decline in production
of sesame by 1975 in the project area would more than offset these exports.
C. Farmers' Benefits
7.10      Farm budgets for typical farms at different stages of cotton pro-
duction intenaity and in different ecological zones are given in Annex 7.
Farmers' annual net cash incomes in various districts and stages of develop-
ment are shown ln the following table:

/1   Nouna and Toma have lower yields due to lower rainfall.
Reductions in producer prices for cotton of 5% and 10% respectively would
reduce the above returns up to 7%, and up to 14% respectively. In the
latter case net incomes in Stage 3 would still amount to about CFAF 30,000
in the North and CFAF 50,000 in the Center and South and would provide an
adequate incentive for the farmers to participate in the project. Total
annual net returns to farmers in the project area are estimated to increase
from CFAF 1,273 million in 1970 to about CFAF 1,887 million by 1975.
D.  Impact of Project on Government Revenues and Expenditures
7.11      Annex 17 contains estimates of Government revenues and expendi-
tures incurred in carrying out the project. Project farmers do not pay
income taxes, and consequently Government revenues accruing directly from
the project would consist of export taxes on cotton lint and seed. Ilese
would be inadequate to cover the costs of ORD extension services in the
project area, either in the project development period or thereafter, and
by 1980 and subsequent years Government deficits from providing such serv-
ices would amount to about CFAF 80 million annually (US$0.3 million). On
the other hand, taxes indirectly generated by the project, such as import
duties and taxes on ginning, and on imports used in the project as shown
in Annex 17, Table 3, are estimated to result in a revenue surplus. The
required annual review of producer prices described in para. 7.08 would
minimize Government support for producer prices through CSPP.

VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
3.01      Using projected yields, prices and costs and costing all farm
family labor at zero, 1/ and assuming a project life of 20 years, the
economic rate of return from investment in the cotton project, including
the tertiary road improvement program, is estimated at about 31% (see
Annex 18). While the risk of lower cotton export prices than those fore-
cast is considered low taking into account the decline foreseen in project
calculations and while yield forecasts are considered realistic, the sen-
sitivity of the rate of return to a lower value of production per unit
area has been tested. Thus, if yields or prices turned out to be 15%
lower than predicted (for example if the average yield of participants
were 740 kg/ha in 1975 - as against the estimate of 868 kg/ha and the
actual 1968 figure of 620 kg/ha) the economic rate of return would fall
to about 23%. On the cost side it is believed unlikely that development
and operating costs would rise beyond those forecast which contain appro-
priate contingencies. The return on the investment is safeguarded against
any significant increase in labor costs, since farm family labor is almost
exclusively involved. The rate of return is affected little by the dura-
tion of the project, and if, for example, cotton growing were discontinued
after 10 years the return would be 26%. This rate of return is particularly
satisfactory, and would not be so high if the project were to be carried out
in an area where cotton had not been grown previously or in an area where
there had been no prior intensive extension effort. Thus while project bene-
fits have been calculated on an incremental basis, the increments would not
be so high if a substantial proportion of project farmers had not become
proficient in cotton cultivation techniques through being subject to CFDT
managed extension programs.
8.02      The project would generate gross foreign exchange earnings of
about US$18 million during the five-year development period and thereafter
about US$7 million per year. Net foreign exchange earnings (gross earnings
less foreign exchange expenditures) in the same periods would be US$11.4
million and about US$4.4 million, respectively.
IX.  RECO«MENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations the following main assurances were obtained
from tle Government:
1/   Farm family labor is costed at zero since while the project will re-
quire more labor, this would be significant only at harvest time in
the dry season when there are no alternative employment opportunities,
and when farm families are usually underemployed.



- 28 -
(a) planning and design of the ginnery to be constructed
under the project would be the responsibility of CFDT
and IDA approval would be sought before letting con-
tracts for procurement and construction (paras 4.09
and 5.05);
(b) a program of tertiary road improvement would be agreed
annually with IDA and all equipment purchased for the
program would be used and retained in the project area;
and the project roads would be maintained adequately
after the project has been completed (para 4.10);
(c) the Government would increase the equity of BND, and the
terms and conditions of loans to the ORDs and CSPP would
be as described in para 5.03 (para 5.04);
(d)  sub-contracts between CFDT and other development agencies
should be entered into only with the approval of IDA (para
6.03);
(e)  funds required for ORD operations would be made available
by the Government to BND in block form quarterly and in
advance. BND would establish a project account on which
the Project Manager would be authorized to draw. Each
ORD would maintain its own accounts and the Project Man-
ager would keep project accounts (para 6.05);
(f) the Government and BND would apply agricultural lending
procedures as described in paras 4.18 through 4.22 and
they would not be modified without the consent of IDA
(para 6.09);
(g) the Government would appoint the ORD Inspector and during
the development period would have the BND posts of Deputy
Director, Agriculture Credit Division, and Chief Accountant
filled by persons whose qualifications and experience would
be acceptable to IDA (para 6.10);
(h)  during the project development period prior to the start
of each cotton season, Government and IDA would agree on
the replacement of expatriates by local personnel and on
the appointment of ORD Directors, Deputy Directors and
Accountants (para 6.14); and
(i) CSPP should maintain a separate cotton account to be used
to stabilize cotton prices only; producer prices should
be reviewed annually by the Government and IDA, and be re-
duced if and as necessary (para 7.08).



- 29 -
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness are:
(a) appointment of the Project Committee and the Project Manager
and signature of the services contract with CFDT (para 6.02);
(b) termination of the present administrative arrangements in the
7th Agricultural Region (Bobo-Dioulasso and Orodara) and
establishment of the ORD Bobo-Dioulasso under a director
provided by CFDT (para 6.03);
(c)  filling of the ORD posts of Director, Deputy Director, and
Accountant (para 6.14); and
(d) amendment satisfactory to IDA of the agreement of Association
in Participation between the Government and CFDT (para 6.16).
9.03      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$6.2 million on
standard terns.

WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND
BANQUE NATIONALE DE DEVELOPPEMENT (BND)
BACKGROUND
1.        Upper Volta, together with six other countries, is a member of
the West African Monetary Union, which became effective in its present form
in 1962. Member countries share a common currency, the CFAFranc (Franc de
la Communaute Financiere Africaine) and a common Central Bank, the Banque
Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO). Coumercial banking
services in Upper Volta are provided by the Banque Nationale de Developpe-
ment (BND), the Banque Nationale de Paris, and the Banque Internationale de
l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BIAO). Long term loans to the private sector are
mainly handled by BND.
2.        Before independence, the Caisse Centrale de Credit de la Haute
Volta (1949), and the Societes de Prevoyance, succeeded by the Societes
Mutuelles de Production, were responsible for agricultural credit. The
statutes of the Caisse Centrale de Credit were too rigid for it to perform
its intended role, the farmers being unable to meet the guarantees required.
Limited funds vere available and most lending was for social credit. Man-
agement vas poor and farmers were reluctant to participate. In 1957, the
Credit de la Haute Volta took over the claims and obligations of the Caisse
Centrale de Credit. It adopted an extremely cautious credit policy, con-
centrating principally on marketing loans. In 1961 the Government estab-
lished the Banque Nationale de Developeement (BND) to replace the former
colonial institutions. In 1965, a special department was set up vithin
BND for agricultural credit.
CONSTITUTION AND ORGANIZATION
Constitution and Objectives
3.        BND's constitution is similar to that of other development banks
in French speaking West Africa. Its statutes vere approved by Decree No.
82/PRES/ECNA of March 4, 1961, amended by Decree No. 103/PRES/ECNA of April
6, 1962. BND's objectives, which are defined by Public Law No. 6/61/ANL
of January 23, 1961, are to provide technical and financial assistance to
carry out all projects capable of furthering the economic and social devel-
opment of Upper Volta. Assistance is provided through participation in
enterprises and through supplying credits to:



ANNEX 2
Page 2
craftsmen, industry and commerce, and consumers for the
purchase of semi-durable goods (appliances, furniture and
vehicles);
housing;
public entities for investments; and
agriculture.
Administration and Management
4.        An Administrative Council, composed of 12 members, 8 from Govern-
ment Departments and 4 from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE), Fonds d'Aide et Cooperation (FAC) - the French technical assistance
agency - and BCEAO, manages BND. It is responaible for defining and imple-
menting policies and credit programs. The Board may delegate some of its
powers to a limited standing commit tee on which the shareholders are
represented in the same proportion as on the Board. The General Manager
is nominated by a three-fourths majority of the Board, and is appointed by
the Government.
Organization
5.        BND is responsible to the Minister of Planning and Public Works.
It is organized in three administrative divisions (Personnel and Material;
Accountancy and Mechanical Bookkeeping; Studies, Statistics and Audit) and
four operational divisions (Non-agricultural Credit; Agricultural Credit;
Debt Collection; Financial Operations). BND is also responsible for super-
vising the accounts of the Regional Development Offices (ORDs), which it
checks at regular intervals, and is assisting the ORDs in setting up a
standard accountancy system. The organization chart is attached. Since
1968 ORDs have been fully responsible for making and collecting short
term credits, and assumed also full responsibility for medium term credit
in 1970. One new post, that of Inspector of the ORDs' medium term loan
operations, would be required.
External Control
6.        External control is exercised by the Financial Controller of
the Ministry of Finance and the Inspector of the CCCE. These two auditors
are appointed by the Meeting of Shareholders. As agreed with the West
African Monetary Union, BCEAO receives monthly statements on BND's financial
and liquidity position in addition to annual reports and accounts. Present
control arrangements, both internal and external, are adequate.

Staf f
7.        Total BND staff numbers 60, including five expatriates.  No
special staff for evaluating technical and economic aspects of agricultural
credit applications is required, as the technical staff of the ORD is re-
sponsible for credit operations. BND personnel is well trained and quali-
fied for the tasks assigned to them. With the exception of the Inspector
of the ORDs, no additional staff would be required for BND's increased
activities, as the ORDs are responsible for credit administration.
Sources of Funds
8.        Condensed balance sheets covering the last three fiscal years
are shown in Table 1. The paid up capital of BND is CFAF 355 million
(US$1.28 million). The Government, which is required by BND's statutes
to hold 51% of its equity capital, subscribed CFAF 225 million (63.38%);
CCCE CFAF 100 million (28.17%) and BCEAO CFAF 30 million (8.45%). The
Government would authorize BND to retain, as equity capital, the amounts
of the IDA credit and FAC grant earmarked for the agricultural credit re-
volving fund. Consequently, BND's capital would increase to CFAF 708 mil-
lion (US$2.5 million) by the end of the project period (1975), of which the
Government's share would be CFAF 405 million and that of CCCE, the author-
ized agency of FAC, CFAF 273 million.
9.        Other resources consist of:
-    grants and guarantee funds from CCCE, FAC and Government
(CFAF 261.5 million);
-    reserves, provisions and profit (CFAF 212.5 million);
-    long term loans from CCCE for 10 year periods at an interest
rate of 3.5% (CFAF 457.1 million);
-    medium term loans from CCCE for 5 years also at 3.5%
(CFAF 162.8 million);
-    short term loans, deposits and funds (CFAF 537.7 million).
BND has rediscount facilities with BCEAO at 3.5%; up to 65% of the total
of medium term loans are rediscounted for 5 years and up to 90% of market-
ing loans for 1 year. BND's credit lines with CCCE have no ceiling.
Use of Funds
10.       An analysis of the loan portfolio is given in Table 2.  Lending
activities in 1968/69 were mainly in (i) agriculture (53%); (ii) commerce
(5%); (iii) housing (15%); (iv) cars and appliances (11%); and (v) industry
(16%). The percentages of the total of all loans made since BND's estab-
lishment are: (i) agriculture: 36%; (ii) commerce: 10%; (iii) housing; 27%;
(iv) cars and appliances: 12%; and (v) industry: 9%. The number and total
amount of all loans made since the start of operations are:

Number      CFAF m
Credit de la Haute Volta (1958-1960)         1,596         334
BND (1961-9/30/1969)                       27,568        5,366
Total                 29,164        5,700
More than 50% of the total number of loans is for semi-durable consumer goods
(appliances and vehicles). These loans, however, represent only 12% of total
lending operations. In addition to its lending operations, BND participates
in eight local industries in amounts ranging between CFAF 10,000 (US$36) to
CFAF 28 million (US$100,000). BND's share of the equity ranges between
0.1% and 35%; that of the Government between 18 and 53%. BND participations
amount to CFAF 74.7 million (US$269,000) in total.
11.       Marketing loans to CFDT for cotton purchases are shared equally
by BND and BIAO. BND alone makes marketing loans to ORDs or licensed buy-
ing agents for purchasing other crops. Marketing credits in 1969 amounted
to CFAF 598 million. The forecast requirement for 1970 is CFAF 927 million.
Seasonal lending for marketing would continue to be BND's main activity.
12.       Short term lending to farmers for seasonal inputs amounted to
CFAF 135 million or 44% of total short term lending operations in 1968/69
(CFAF 304 million); to date the total of short term loans made to agricul-
ture since BND's shart of operations is CFAF 929 million or 47% of total
short term lending. The forecast 1970 requirement for seasonal loans to
farmers is CFAF 170 million. Short term lending for inputs would continue
to be BND's next most important activity after agrieultural marketing loans.
Annex 9 shows that total purchases of inputs during the project development
period would amount to CFAF 1.15 billion. Seasonal loans for inputs are
mainlv made to cotton growers through the ORDs and have to be reimbursed
against crop deliveries to the ORDs.
13.       Medium term credit for farm implements amounted to CFAF 13 million
or 9% of total agricultural short and medium term loans in 1968/69 and to
about CFAF 214 million or 19% of total agricultural loans to date, exclu-
sive of marketing credits. The forecast 1970 requirement for equipment
loans in Upper Volta is CFAF 45 million. Annex 9 shows that total pur-
chases of implements under the project would amount to CFAF 111 million.
The ORDs are responsible for medium term credit.
14.       Long term credit, which is not given to agriculture, is mainly for
lhousing (CFAF 87 million in 1968/69 and CFAF 809 million to date), and
industry (CFAF 130 million in 1968/69 and CFAF 340 million to date).



ANNEX 2
Page 5
Forecast of Credit Requirements
15.       Forecasts of credit requirements are given in Table 3; they are
tentative because Upper Volta, due to limited financial resources has not
been able to prepare a meaningful medium term economic development program.
Operating Results
16.       Condensed profit and loss accounts for BND's last three fiscal
years are given in Table 4. In 1966/67 BND incurred a loss of CFAF 52.4
million, but following the revision of loan conditions and transfer to ORDs
of part of the responsibility for debt collection, BND's performance has
improved. For 1963/69 the profit is provisionally estimated at CFAF 53
million. BND receives technical and financial assistance from CCCE on a
year to year basis.
Repayment Record
17.       BND's performance in credit recovery has been satisfactory for all
lending operations outside agriculture. The poorer record in agriculture
was mainly due to loans being granted to subsistence farmers who were unable
to produce cash. Following the revision of BND's terms for agricultural
loans (see para 18), the situation has improved considerably. In particular,
the condition that farmers applying for loans should grow a minimum area of
cash crops, and the transfer of the responsibility for debt collection to
ORDs have reduced defaults to a minimum. Repayments of short term loans
through ORDs amount to nearly 100%. Following the assumption by ORDs of
responsibility for reimbursement of medium term loans, those repayments
have also been 100% in the ORD Dedougou which covers most of the project
area. Defaults before ORD Dedougou's involvement amounted to 20% and
to 15% after seizing equipment as soon as installments were overdue (see
Table 6). The repayment performance of various ORDs have been different
depending on the policy of the development agency in charge of agricultural
extension and production in a particular area. Table 5.C shows that in
1968 defaults ranged between 0 and 95%. At present the conditions of loan
approval, marketing and repayment are such that under the project defaults
should be minimal.
LENDING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Procedures
18.       Applications for short term loans are made through the extension
agent, village group, sub-sector and sector chiefs to the ORD which orders
the products required. Medium term loans are approved by the village



ANNEX 2
Page 6
group, sub-sector and sector chiefs, the regional loan committee (consist-
ing of administrative officials, selected individuals including the chairman
of the village group, and a representative of BND), and the ORD. The ORDs
are fully responsible for granting and recovering loans. All loans are
made in kind, except for marketing loans.
Eligibility
19.       Loans are not granted in areas lacking adequate agricultural
extension facilities.  A farmer is only eligible for medium term credit
if total amounts falling due each year do not exceed 30% of his net cash
income from his principal crop. Loans for fertilizers are only granted
to farmers who use pesticides, and for implements only to farmers who have
bought pesticides and fertilizer. Farmers must belong to a village group
and pay an initial fee of CFAF 200 for short term and CFAF 800 for medium
term credit facilities. There must be no defaults at village level; at
sector level short term credit defaults may not exceed 3% and medium term
defaults 10% of outstanding loans.
Term,s
20.       BND charges 4.5% interest on cotton marketing loans; 5.25% to
ORDs and 8% to private traders on marketing loans for other crops; 5.5%
on short and medium term loans to ORDs. The terms for onlending to farmers
are as follows
Short Term                 Medium Term
Period                  Up to 1 year               Up to 2 years below
CFAF 10,000 /1
Up to 3 years above
CFAF 10,000
Down Payment            None                        33% for 2 year loans
25% for 3 year loans
Interest                A fixed commission of 5% is charged which is
equivalent to slightly more than 8% on short-
term loans, 7.6% on medium-term loans for 2
years, and 8.2% on medium-term loans for 3
years, when account is taken of repayment
periods and mandatory down-payment.
Repayment               6-8 months                  21 months for 2 year loans
33 months for 3 year loans
/1   Medium term loans for carts are only for two years.



ANNEX 2
Page 7
Security
21.       Short and medium term loans are secured by the proceeds of crops
marketed through the ORD and a lien is put on equipment financed by medium
term loans. In addition, other members of the village group guarantee
loans in the event of default. The land tenure system does not allow
mortgages but the Governnent has given claims on outstanding agricultural
loans the same legal status as taxes. In 1966 Government established a
Special Fund for Agricultural Financing to guarantee farmers' loan obliga-
tions to BND, up to 40% of total obligations, but this fund is not opera-
tional since Governnent granted funds only in the first two years.

ANNEX 4
UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
COTTON GINNERIES
Existing Plants
1.        Presently, cotton is processed at four ginneries with a total
capacity of 60,000 tons l/ Two ginneries are located at Bobo-Dioulasso and
serve the project area. The ginnery at Koudougou is about 125 km distant
from the project area and the one at Ouagadougou about 225 km away. All
ginneries have standardized equipment (Lummus) and are owned by CFDT. Ex-
pansion of facilities has always kept pace with increases in cotton produc-
tion, because CFDT planning for new facilities starts when the latest expan-
sion is still under construction. To cope with incremental cotton produc-
tion from areas outside the project a new 16,000 tons capacity ginnery
would be established in Ouagadougou by 1972.
New Plant for Project Area
2.        Cotton production generated by the project would exceed available
ginning capacity by 1972. Hence, the project would provide for the con-
struction of a 25,000 tons capacity ginnery. Projected cotton production
during the 1970/71 to 1977/78 period would be as follows:
1/   Ouagadougou: 7,000 tons; Koudougou: 14,000 tons; Bobo-Dioulasso
I: 14,000 tons; Bobo-Dioulasso II: 25,000 tons.

4.        Preferably the new plant should have equipment similar to
machinery used at existing ginneries. Upper Volta has up to now benefited
from standardized equipment which permits keeping of limited stocks of
spare parts and simplifying training and transfers of technical personnel.
5.        CFDT's stocks of spare parts for their four plants are estimated
to value about CFAF 31 million and annual expenditures for replenishing
stocks average about 6 million. A large part of stored spare parts are
not subject to annual use but are kept for emergency cases which could
occur during the ginning campaign and provoke plant closure during crucial
times. Use of standardized equipment would, therefore, not require invest-
ment in additional spare-part stocks.
6.        Criteria for determining the site of the new ginnery would have to
take into consideration:
(i) distance to the railhead because exports would be
shipped via rail;
(ii) availability of manpower;
(iii) water and electricity supplies; and
(iv) communications with the project area.
Considering these criteria, Hounde, 27 km from the Bereba railway station
which has cotton storage facilities, and located at the main road Ouagadougou
- Bobo Dioulasso in the center of the most intensive cotton production area
seems to be an acceptable site.  However, Hounde is presently without elec-
tricity and construction of an electric power station would be required.
This station would consist of three 310/KVA generators (two for regular
operation and one spare) and one 50/KVA generator for the off season.
7.        The plant would be equipped with three gins with 128 saws
each and an hourly saw output of 9 kg. Total capacity would be 25,000 tons
seed cotton which could be ginned during a 150-day campaign with two 9-hour
shifts per day. Extension of the ginning campaign beyond the anticipated
period would result in lower quality fiber.
8.        The new plant would be constructed in 1972 and be completed not
later than January/February 1973. Although the plant would not operate
at full capacity during the first two years, no savings would materialize
fromn phasin- installation of gins. Cost of one gin represents only 8.6%
of machiinery costs and 2% of total costs.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
9.        A slight surplus of seed cotton expected at the end of the project
period in 1974/75 does not justify construction of a second new plant. This
surplus could be processed by increasing daily operating hours from 18 to 21
at one of the Bobo Dioulasso ginneries or by moving it to Koudougou which
would cede part of its production to Ougadougou II, expected to be operational
by 1972/73. The projected 1975 cotton production to be ginned in 1976 would
nevertheless exceed ginning capacity of all plants by about 15,000 t. The
CCCE/FAC/CFDT consortium, however, agreed to finance a new ginnery at this
time, or whenever the need arises.
10.       The Government would be the owner of the proposed new ginnery.
ILt would induce the authorities to become more involved in cotton develop-
ment and permit the Government to better understand and control the ginning
industry. Management would be supplied by CFDT under the Association in
Participation (see Annex 16).



ANNEX 5
UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
IMPROVEMENT OF TERTIARY ROADS
Introduction
1.        The Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles
(CFDT) guarantees cotton collection even from remote areas, but the poor
state of most tertiary roads, which connect cotton growing areas with mar-
kets and stocking sites, results in high transport costs. A program is
recommended to reduce these costs through improving the most intensively
used roads.
Description
2.        The program consists of the improvement of 820 km of selected
tertiary roads. It would require the purchase and operation of a mechanized
unit (see Annex 10, Table 6). This unit would be based in Bobo Dioulasso,
where CFDT repair shops are located.
3.        A highway technician, under the supervision of the Project Manager
would be responsible for the planning and execution of improvement works.
These would entail (1) grading of roads, once or twice just before and
after the rainy season, and (2) improving sections by regraveling, building
culverts and fords and executing other auxiliary works.
Costs Estimates and Financing
4.        The estimated costs of the program are detailed in Annex 10,
Table 6 and summarized below. Estimates include an annual price escala-
tion of 5% from 1970.

The proposed IDA credit would finance the C.I.F. costs of equipment
purchases, US$211,000 equivalent.
Economic Justification
5.        The Black Volta area has a dense network of tertiary roads.  Ac-
cording to CFDT the entire length of the tertiary roads is over 2,500 km,
of which the 820 km shown in Table 1 are the most used. The appraisal mis-
sion estimates that cotton production in the project area would increase by
about 15% per year from about 35,000 tons in 1970/71 to about 84,000 tons
by 1977/78.
6.        The tertiary road program would permit lowering of cotton transport
costs by improving the most used tertiary roads which link cotton fields to
village markets and stocking sites. At present only 5-ton trucks can operate
on tertiary roads. If these roads were improved, a 5-ton truck plus trailer
(9-ton pay load) could travel on them. The unit savings would therefore
be substantial -- about CFAF 8.4 per ton.km.
7.        Main benefits of improving the tertiary road network would be de-
rived from the cotton tonnage to be hauled. Hlowever, additional benefits
deriving from transport cost savings on other products and commodities as



ANNEX 5
Page 3
well as passenger traffic should also be taken into account. These sav-
ings are estimnated at 50 percent of the savings on cotton traffic.
3.        Annual operating costs of the unit are based on 150 working days
per year and on actual figures provided by PWD. They include maintenance
and repairs of equipment, fuel and lubricants and salaries of operators and
drivers, together with the costs of one highway technician and seasonal
labor.
9.        The economic life of the road equipment is assumed to be three
years for trucks and pickups and eight years for graders. The salvage
value is taken into account in the rate of return calculation, which
is based on the life of the graders and on present unit costs and prices.
Price escalation is not taken into account because it is assumed that sav-
ings would increase at the same rate.
10.       Under these assumptions, the economic rate of return for the
tertiary road program over eight years, the life of the graders, is 10
percent (see Table 2).

ANNEX 6
UPPER VOLTA
WIEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
CROPPING PATTERN, INPUTS, YIELDS, PRODUCTION AND PRICES
Cropping Pattern and Crop Rotation
1.        The main crops grown in the project area would continue to be
cotton, sesame, groundnuts, sorghum and millet. Data on labor requirements,
timing of sowing, manuring, spraying and harvesting and production cycle,
are given in Table 1. Annex 7 shows the areas of the various crops per farm
in different project zones.
2.        Cropping patterns and crop rotation vary according to different
ecological conditions and tribal zones in the project area and would, on a
particular farm, change while the farmer moves through the four development
stages (see para 4.14). In general, the following factors have to be con-
sidered:
(i) size of holding and number of family workers;
(ii) self-sufficiency in food crops;
(iii) elimination of bottlenecks in land preparation, weeding
and harvesting;
(iv) cotton should never be the first crop in the rotation
after land clearing because of depressed yields;
(v)  groundnuts should never come at the end of the rotation
because the residual effect of nitrogen would be lost;
(vi)  cereals should follow cotton to benefit from the residual
effect of fertilizers applied to cotton;
(vii)  after five years of cultivation, three years of fallow
should follow. During the fallow period one or more
hectares of a legume (Stylosanthes in zones with more
than 1,000 mm rainfall) or another fodder crop (Braccharia
in zones with less than 1,000 mm rainfall) could be grown
to improve the soil and to supply cattle food; and
(viii) the intensity of fertilizer use and the availability of
animal drawn implements.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
3.        A general crop rotation for a farm in Stage 3 (use of fertilizers)
would be: 3 years fallow, followed by 5 years of growing in succession:
sesame, beans or pulses; cotton; cereals; cotton, groundnuts, beans or pulses;
and cereals. A simplified standard crop rotation for a Stage 3 farm in the
Bobo-Dedougou-Solenzo area is given in Table 2.
Inputs
4.        Pesticides - Farmers in Stage 2 (use of pesticides) would control
pests with an average of three sprays using hand operated knapsack sprayers.
Currently a DDT-Endrin emulsion is used consisting of 450 gr DDT and 120
gr Endrin per liter; applied at a rate of 2-1/2/ha each spray; and costing
about CFAF 3,550/ha. Both DDT and Endrin are "hard" insecticides and ac-
cumulate in body tissues; also Endrin has a relatively high mammalian
toxicity. On the other hand, they are cheap and within the present purchas-
ing capacity of Upper Volta farmers. Less persistent and dangerous insecti-
cides could be used but only at the expense of lower farm incomes and the
strong possibility of a loss of interest in cotton growing. During the
project period a gradual change would be made to an Endosulfan-Methylpara-
thion mixture, a safer and relatively cheap combination. Research would
continue to seek improved and economic methods of pest control. In addition,
the project would aim at extensive use of Thioral for seed dressing (38 gr
Thioral/ha for sorghum and millet; 100 gr/ha for maize; 200 gr/ha for ground-
nuts). CFDT would, as now, disinfect cotton seeds at the ginnery before
delivering them to project farmers. The cost of Thioral is CFAF 500/kg.
Furthermore, protection of food stocks (cereals, beans and pulses) against
predators through the use of Gammagrain (l kg/ton cereals costing CFAF 120)
would be propagated.
5.        Fertilizers - Project farmers in Stage 3 (use of fertilizers)
would use a standard fertilizer treatment for cotton of a single annual
application of 100 kg 20-37-7 NPS compound fertilizer per ha costing about
CFAF 4,200/ha.  Research has shown that it may be advantageous to apply,
in addition, 50 kg urea/ha at flowering time. The cost is about CFAF 1,350/
ha and would result in a yield increase of 200 kg seed cotton/ha valued at
CFAF 6,000. However, large scale testing is required before general or
regional recommendation in this respect can be issued.  Fertilizers for
crops other than cotton are not generally used. Sesame is not manured at
all and research has to be continued to find an economic fertilizer recom-
mendation. Some farmers apply 75 kg Superphosphate (17% P 20 and 8% S)
per ha to groundnuts at the first weeding and 75 kg NPS 20-37-7 to sorghum
and millet also at the first weeding. Since introducing general use of
fertilizer for crops other than cotton may take some time, no costs for
such fertilizers are included in the project costs.

6.        Varieties - Cotton - varieties to replace Allen 333 in 1970 are
444--2 in the North and BJA in the South and Centre of the project area.
Both varieties have a staple length (1"-l"1/16) and a lint outturn (38%)
suiperior to Allen 333 (1l"-l"l/32 and 36% lint to seed cotton). Groundnuts
- varieties used are Niangoloko 1040 in the South and Saria 90 in the North.
Experiments with the introduction of the higher yielding variety 28-206 are
being carried out. Sesame - a higher yielding Indian variety, S-42, is
being tried out.
Yields and Production
7.        The yield projections used in the project calculation are listed
in Table 3. For most crops low increases are projected; cotton and sesame
yields are assumed to increase substantially because present yields are
well below their potential averages. Actual cotton production figures
for 1964 through 1969 and project projections for 1971 through 1975 are
given in Table 4.
Prices
8.        The minimum producer prices set by the Government for 1968/69
and 1969/70 are:
Sorghum and millet                   CFAF 12/kg
Maize                                CFAF 13/kg

as follows:

estimated 1969 prices are CFAF 30.72/kg.



ANNEX 6

9.        It is assumed that under the project only very small and decreas-
ing quantities of groundnuts and sesame would be marketed and that most of
these would be delivered to Bobo, the main marketing center for these crops.
Consequently, in the project calculation prices assumed are CFAF 16/kg for
groundnuts and CFAF 28/kg for sesame, except for the northern areas (Nouna,
Toma) which would deliver their produce to Dedougou. Prices used for these
areas are CFAF 12/kg for groundnuts and CFAF 24/kg for sesame.

1/  Original estimate:  34,h40 t including Tougan (1,080 t).  When a few months
after the appraisal mission, data on the estimated 1969/70 production became
availables CFDT revised its estimate for the 1970/71 production to 24s500 t
(including Tougan).  The appraisal, however, is based on the original esti-
mate of 34p440 t which is the result of an assumed almost linear progression.
Since no change of the 1971/72 and later production estimates are expected,
the use of the new 1970/71 estimate as a basis for the calculation of the project
induced incremental production would ixsult in an excessive economic rate of
return.

ANNEX 8
UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
COTTON SEED PRODUCTION
1.        In Upper Volta as in many other French speaking countries, the
Institut de Recherches pour le Coton et les Textiles (IRCT) is responsible
for breeding and first stage multiplication of improved cotton varieties.
Presently the varieties propagated are 444-2 1/ and BJA 2/ (1-1 1/16", 38%
ginning percentage) and for the first time in 1970/71 all cotton growers
will be supplied with these new varieties. It takes about five years to
multiply a new variety to supply all cotton producers. IRCT is continuing
its research efforts into new varieties with superior qualities, however,
introduction of these would require at least five years according to mul-
tiplication phases outlined below:
Cotton Seed Multiplication

Second group selected farmers                        8,000 ha
2,400t seeds
Common farmers                                              60,000 ha
18,000t seeds
Required for all farmers                                   3,200t seeds  80,000 ha
2.        To guarantee high standards and purity of seeds IRCT together with
CFDT control selected farmers who produce seeds. All cotton growers are
thereby in a position to obtain certified seed annually. If a better
variety should become available the same procedures would be followed and
after the above mentioned five year period production would be entirely
based on this new variety. Farmers participating in the seed propagation
program do not receive bonus prices and use of certified and/or improved
seed varieties would not entail increased costs to the average cotton
producers.
1/   Variety for the North propagated at the Tankoulounga farm in the
Kongoussi district.
2/   Variety for the South and Center of West Volta propagated at the
Boni Farm.

UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
COMPAGNIE FRANCAISE POUR LE DEVELOPPEnENT DES FIBRES TEXTILES (CFDT)
Organization
1.        CFDT was established in 1949 to provide technical assistance to
France's overseas territories (and subsequently other countries) for the
development of fiber crops, in particular, cotton. CFDT is a non-profit
statutory body (Societe d'Economie M4ixte) with a capital of FF200,000
(US$36,000), mainly financed by the French Government. Its Board of
Directors consists of representatives of the French ministries concerned
with financial and technical assistance, private commercial and industrial
groups, Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Econonique (CCCE) and Institut de
Recherches du Coton et des Textiles Exotiques (IRCT). Headquarters are
at Paris and comprise four main divisions: Agriculture; Industry and
Equipment; Commerce; and Finance and Accountancy.
2.        CFDT has a regional office in Bobo-Dioulasso (Upper Volta),
which supervises CFDT's activities in Ivory Coast, Mali, Upper Volta and
Niger.
3.        The advantages of CFDT's central headquarters being in Paris
are appreciable to recipient countries. The quality of services provided
are far greater than any single recipient country could afford on the
basis of its own cotton production. There are further advantages in
CFDT's headquarters being in Paris: CFDT is able to obtain favorable
prices for the supply of production requisites and equipment by bulking
the orders of the producing countries that it assists as well as favorable
insurance and transport rates for the whole of CFDT's activities; and
centralizing final sales from its Paris headquarters facilitates the timely
delivery to cotton buyers of supplies in the quantities and qualities
desired.
Provision of Technical Assistance
4.        Technical assistance provided takes usually the following forms,
or a combination of them:
(i) Crop production - CFDT organizes extension services to teach
farmers to use improved cotton cultivation methods. Fre-
quently these methods are based on research results obtained
by the Institut des Recherches du Coton et des Textiles
Exotiques (IRCT);



ANNEX 12
Page 2
(ii) Ginning and marketing - In countries which have no ginneries
but lack marketing experience, CFDT constructs its own
ginneries and organizes the marketing, export and final
sale of cotton;
(iii) Management - In countries which have national ginneries but
lack competent technical staff, CFDT enters into agreements
for the management of such ginneries;
(iv) Consultancy - CFDT carries out feasibility studies, and
prepares cotton development plans and programs.
5.        CFDT operates in a number of countries, for example:
(i)  Crop production - 14 countries in Africa, 2 in the Mediter-
ranean area and 6 in Asia;
(ii)  Ginning and marketing - 9 countries in Africa; and
(iii) Management - 4 countries in Africa.
Financial Arrangements for Technical Assistance Services
6.        For the four forms of technical assistance (para 4) CFDT is
remunerated as follows:
(i)  Crop production - The costs charged by CFDT for providing
extension services in African countries are generally
similar. The Government agrees to reimburse CFDT for costs
of expatriate and local personnel employed directly by
CFDT, and costs of CFDT's operation. In addition, CFDT
receives annually 15% of total personnel costs to cover
overheads of Paris headquarters and regional offices.
The following table shows the method of reimbursement in some
West African countries:

(ii) Ginning and marketing (where CFDT owns and operates the
ginneries)
a.   Lint
In most countries CFDT charges CFAF 18,000 per ton of lint
ginned, and additionally receives CFAF 3,100 per ton of lint
produced, and is reimbursed for expenses incurred in purchasing
and exporting (see Annex 16, para 4). However, a new system
will be introduced for Upper Volta whereby, as explained in
Annex 16, all ginning and marketing costs will be clharged to
the Association in Participation, while CFDT will receive a
total remuneration of 2% of the CIF value and 20% of net pro-
fits which will be reinvested in Upper Volta.
b.   Cotton seed
Up to now CFDT has received a lump sum of CFAF 3,000 per
ton of cotton seed exported. The new proposal for Upper Volta
is a commission of CFAF 1,700 per ton purchased and 10% parti-
cipation in the profits made by the Price Stabilization Fund
(CSPP) on exports.
(iii) Itanagement. In countries where part of the ginneries belong
to the Government and part to CFDT, CFDT manages all fac-
tories and is remunerated in the way explained above. The
only case, in which CFDT manages a national company is the
Central African Republic. Actual personnel costs are re-
imbursed by the Government. Moreover, CFDT receives 1% of
the sales value of lint and seed, of which CFDT has to pass
on 0.5% commission to the importers in France.
(iv) Consultancy. The arrangements for studies, usually engineer-
ing studies for ginneries, vary from case to case.
7.        Details on the existing and proposed system of remuneration for
Upper Volta are given in Annex 16.

ANNEX 15
UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
CAISSE DE STABILISATION DES PRIX DES PRODUITS (CSPP)
Organization and Objective
1.        CSPP was established in 1961 1/ and came into operation in 1964. 2/
It is responsible to the Ministry of Finance and Commerce and the Director
of Commerce is Director of CSPP. Its objective is to stabilize the prices
of Upper Volta's principal export crops: cotton, sesame, sheanuts and
groundnuts.
Operations
2.        At the beginning of each crop season, the Government fixes a
minimum producer price for each export crop. Producer prices for ground-
nuts, sheanuts, and sesame differ according to whether delivered to
Ouagadougou or Bobo-Dioulasso, while the price for cotton differs according
to quality and not to location of delivery. Minimum producer prices are
supported by CSPP through a scheme (bareme) under which actual export
prices are compared with a predetermined "statistical" price for each
commodity; differences within a certain range are either reimbursed or
collected by CSPP. Fluctuations beyond this range result in a profit or
loss to the exporter. The "statistical" price is determined after taking
into consideration the minimum producer price and other charges incurred
by traders and exporters such as transportation and handling, as well as
a profit margin.
Financial Resources
3.        Up to 1967/68 CSPP's main resources were its share of the coun-
try's import and export taxes, but during the last two years most of its
funds have come from reimbursements by exporters and profits on cotton
1/   Law No. 28/61/AN, July 24, 1961.
2/   Laws No. 41 and 42/63/AN, December 4, 1963; and Decrees 667/PRES/LAN,
December 30, 1963; and 081/PRES/CIM/DCI of February 4, 1964.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
seed exports.  Since January, 1969, the Government has reduced its contrib-
ution from tax receipts to 3.5% of various import and export taxes i/ with
a ceiling of CFAF 30 million. In Table 1 the income from taxes exceeds
CFAF 30 million, due apparently to the time it takes to enforce the ceiling
and to the difference in Government's financial year (calendar year) and
CSFP's financial year (September 1 to August 31).  Another resource of
CSPP, which is sonie'&iliat out of line witlh the official legislation, is thie
levy on groundnut oil sales (CFAF 2,360/ton). This levy was established
in the law of July, 1961, creating CSPP, but the law and decrees ruling
CSPP's initial operations introduced the Temporary Support Tax to provide
funds for CSPP's operations and excluded the levy on groundnut oil. Nlone-
theless, CSPP continues to receive this levy, but CITEC, the oil manufac-
turer, has taken steps to be exempted from the levy.
Financial Results
4.        Table 1 shows CSPP's income and expenditure statements for the
f ive years 1965/66 through 1969/70. Producer prices for each of four
export commodities have remained stable between 1964/65 and 1967/68 in
spite of fluctuations in world market prices. This, however, has entailed
thie pavment of producer price support by CSPP on groundnuts and cotton
exports which amounted to about CFAF 130 million for the season 1967/68.
In 1968/69 producer prices for groundnuts were reduced by about 4% and
for cotton by about 6% and support payments are expected to decline. As
a result of the price policy being followed in recent years, CSPP is in
a satisfactory financial position. Its assets increased from CFAF 180
million at August 31, 1968, to CFAF 349 million at August 31, 1969.
The balance between revenues accruing to CSPP from agricultural
exports and payments made to support the producer price of export crops
is showen below:
1/   In 1967 (Ordonnance No. 6659 of December 30, 1966) CSPP received 1.5%
on the value of imports, and, in addition, 1% on the value of live-
stock exports. In 1968 (Ordonnance No. 67/61/PRES of December 2, 1967)
CSSP received 13% of certain import and export taxes (a 10% Temporary
Development Tax, a 3% Compensatory Turnover Tax, and a 1.5% Temporary
Support Tax on imports; a 5.4% Forfeiture Tax and a 1.5% Temporary
Support Tax on exports). From January 1, 1969 (Ordonnance No.
68/049/PRES) CSPP should receive 3.5% of these taxes with a ceiling
of CFAF 30 million.                         1

CSPP's Export of Cotton Seeds
5.        While cotton lint is exported by CFDT and groundnuts, sesame and
sheanuts by private exporters, cotton seed is the only commodity marketed
directly by CSPP. From 1970/71 CFDT would sell cotton seeds to CSPP at
CFAF 8,448/t F.0.R. Abidjan including CFAF 1,700/t remuneration for CFDT. 1/
CSPP tenders to exporters the seed in the condition as delivered by CFDT,
i.e. F.O.R. Abidjan. The cost between F.O.R. Abidjan and C.I.F. Osaka
(the main destination) are estimated at about CFAF 8,835/t. Consequently,
the cost C.I.F. Osaka is CFAF 17,283/t. Under the new Association in
Participation Agreement (see Annex 16) between CFDT and the Government,
CFDT would receive 10% of the profit made by CSPP on its seed exports,
which, depending on the world market prices, would range between CFAF 3,200
and 8,600/t, as shown below:
1/   Currently CFDT's remuneration amounts to CFAF 3,000/t and, con-
sequently, CFDT's sale price to CSPP is CFAF 9,748/t F.O.R. Abidjan.

ANNEX 16
UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
EXISTING AID PROPOSED ARRANGEM4ENTS BETIEEN GOVERNMENT AND COMPAGNIE
FRANCAISE POUR LE DEVELOPPEOENT DES FIBRES TEXTILES (CFDT)
Background
1.        CFDT owns all existing cotton ginneries in Upper Volta and under
an agreement with the Government, purcîiases seed cotton from producers, gins
it and exports and sells resulting lint in world markets. CSPP markets
the cotton seed. The present arrangements are governed by an agreement
signed in June, 1965, wlhich expires in 1975 and which replaced an earlier
agreement signed in 1960. The Government and CFDT have signed a new.agreement
- "Association en Participation" - which would be acceptable to IDA if
modifted in some respects (para 6). The new agreement would apply through-
out the project period subject to such amendments as may be agreed from
time to time with IDA.
Arrangements Under the Existing 1965/66 - 1975/76 Agreement
2.        Under this, as under previous agreements, CFDT is responsible
for the development of cotton production in Upper Volta through organizing
extension service, cotton seed production and distribution, and ginning and
marketing.
3.        Prior to each cotton season, CFDT prepares a production program
by extension districts (cercles) for consideration by the Minister of
Agriculture, and subsequently CFDT implements the approved program. Under
the agreement it is mandatory for CFDT to buy all cotton produced by
farmers, and CFDT is obliged to construct such new ginneries as required.
4.        The Minister of Commerce sets annual producer prices on the basis
of anticipated FOB prices (see Annex 18, Table 3). If the FOB price
obtained is lower than estimates, CFDT is reimbursed for its losses by
CSPP. Conversely, if FOB prices are higher than estimated, CFDT makes
an appropriate payment to CSPP.
1970 "Association en Participation" Agreement
5.        The provisions of the 1970 agreement and the comparable provisions
in the 1965 agreement are summarized below:



ANNEX 16
Page 2
Objective
Article 1.  CFDT is reponsible under Government control for

Article 9.  CFDT is licensed to purchase and gin cotton in
Upper Volta.
1965 Agreement (Art. 2):  Same.
Article 10. CFDT is obliged to buy all cotton delivered by
farmers at markets scheduled by the Government or
delivered by groups of producers to ginneries or
at other locations, provided the producer meets
quality standards set by the Minister of Agricul-
ture. The producer prices will be set annually by
the Minister of Finance and Commerce.
1965 Agreement (Art. 6):  No mention is made
of direct delivery to ginneries or other
locations and the Minister of National Economy
sets quality standards. Price set after con-
sultation with the Fonds Inter-Etats de Soutien
et de Developpement du Coton, on the basis of
its guaranteed FOB price for lint.
Accounts and Audit
Article 11. CFDT is responsible for the Association's accounts
which have to be approved by the Minister of Finance
and Commerce, who appoints a controller.
Article 12. The Association's income will be proceeds from:
(i) Lint sold by CFDT to the local textile industry;
(ii) Lint exported by CFDT;
(iii)  Cotton seed sold to CSPP:  ex-factory for local
supply; and ex-stock or free on rail or truck
Abidjan for export (CSPP may request CFDT to sell
seed for CSPP's account).
Article 13. The Association's expenditure will comprise:
(i) That part of agricultural extension costs not
covered by other sources;
(ii)  All CFDT's recurrent costs for purchasing, ginning
and marketing, excluding investments in gins and

Article 14. CFDT's remuneration will consist of:
(i) 2% of CIF value of lint;
(ii)  5% of sales price of by-products;
(iii) CFAF 1,700/ton cotton seed; and
(iv)  10% of profits made by CSPP on seed sales.
1965 Agreement (Art. 7): Under the 1965 agreement,
the Fonds Inter-Etats would reimburse CFDT for, or
collect from CFDT any differences between the gua-
ranteed price and the average sales price. After the
establishment of CSPP, CFDT's remuneration was based
on CSPP's price schedule (bareme, see Annex 18,
Table 3), as follows:
- CFAF 18,000/ton lint for ginning;
- Costs of pruchasing seed cotton, transportation,
and exporting lint;
- CFAF 3,100/ton lint for overhead costs;
- CFAF 3,000/ton seed sold by CSPP.
CFDT's agricultural extension services were financed
by the Government under various agreements with FAC
and CFDT received for overhead costs 15% of tlue
salaries of its expatriate and local extension per-
sonnel.
Sharing Profits
Article 15. Profits will be distributed as follows:  70% to CSPP,
20,% to CFDT and 10% to ORDs, proportionally to their
cotton production.

ten years beginning with 1965/66.
Recommendations
6.        Although the Association en Participation agreement has been
signed by the Government and CFDT, and will be effective from 1970/71, it
is still subject to amendments.  During talks with CFDT in May 1970, IDA
has proposed the following amendments which would be discussed further
during negotiations:
(i) A list of CFDT's assets and their value should be attached
to the agreement and the value of both parties' assets
should be shown on the Association's annual balance sheets
(Articles 4, 5 and 7);
(ii) The Comite Paritaire, having only a consultative nature,
should be described as a liaison or coordination committee
and its terms of reference should be spelled out (Article
8);
(iii) Price-setting for: a) lint to be delivered to the local
industry; and b) cotton seed to be sold to CSPP should be
spelled out (Article 12);
(iv) The Association's contribution to the expenditure for
agricultural extension should not be assessed at the
beginning of each cotton season, but rather at the end,
taking into account the Association's financial results,
and should enter into next yearls accounts (Article 13);



ANNEX 16
Page 6
(v)  Article 14 mentions a remuneration to CFDT consisting of a
fixed fee for cotton seed per ton for overhead costs and
10% of CSPP's profits on seed exports, and Article 18
stipulates that CFDT has to reinvest profits in Upper
Volta. It is recommended to split up into two separate
paragraphs the part of CFDT's remuneration that would be
transferable to Paris and the profits which have to be
reinvested in Upper Volta. In addition, it would be use-
ful to specify whether CSPP would settle CFDT's remunera-
tion and profit sharing directly, or wlhether such settlement
would enter into the Association's accounts; and
(vi) A clause on settlement of dispute should be incorporated
in the agreement.

ANNEX 18
UPPER VOLTA
WEST VOLTA COTTON PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN CALCULATION
1.        The economic rate return on the project is given in Table 1.
Calculations are mainly based on CFDT's breakdown of various costs for
1968/69 but allow for the 1969 devaluation of the CFAFranc and include
10% contingencies on assets, but exclude taxes. The following assumptions
have been used:
ORD Expenditures
2.        The ORD expenditures exclude those for the Road Improvement Prog-
ram. A 5% annual increase of salaries and operation costs is assumed.
Basic data are given in Annex 10, Tables 2, 3 and 4. Direct ORD taxes
deducted from expenditures comprise taxes on import of materials (13% on
construction, 30% on equipment; 25-36% on vehicles) and on ORD operations
(21% on truck operations; 25% on operation of other vehicles; and 10% on
rents, utilities, building maintenance and other miscellaneous expenses).
A breakdown is given in Annex 17, Table 3C. It is assumed that after the
5-year project development period only part of the ORD expenditure is
attributable to the project (80% in 1976, 60% in 1977; 40% in 1978; and
30% in 1979 and subsequent years), because ORDts extension activity would
increasingly concentrate on farmers not participating in thie project.
Extension costs would decline, moreover, because Voltaie staff trained
during the development period would take over management of the ORDs. After
the development period, project headquarters would be disbanded.
IRCT Expenditures
3.        These expenditures include all salaries and operating costs of
IRCT activity in tl-he two project ORDs and tlhe costs of three years (1971-
1973) research on a virus disease. (The above costs are excluded from
project financing. The Government and France share equally IRCT's costs,
and the Goverument expects financing of the virus research from UIITDP). A
5% annual increase of salaries and operating costs is assumed.
Feeder Roads Expenditures
4.        Thle breakdown of the costs of the feeder roads improvement program
is given in Annex 10, Table 6. A 5% annual increase of salaries and opera-
tion costs is assumed.



ANNEX 18
Page 2
Ginnery
5.        See Annex 10, Table 5 for the breakdown.  The ginnery would be
constructed in 1972 and purchases and replacements of vehicles are included.
Prices are assumed to increase by 5% per annum. Maintenance and replace-
ment of ginning equipment are included in the ginning costs.
Farmers' Incremental Net Benefits
6.        The economic rate of return calculation is based on the net return
to farmers from their assumed cropping pattern (see Annex 7).  Although
cotton is the major item in the farm budgets, some additional revenue from
sesame sales is included, because crops following cotton in the crop rotation
benefit from fertilizers applied to cotton. Benefits are calculated for 1971,
1973 and 1975 and interpolated for 1972 and 1974.
(a) Farmers' cost of production
On-farm investments consist only of sprayers (9,120) and animal
drawn implements (1,355 multipurpose cultivators and 1,095 carts). Seasonal
costs assumed for cotton are: CFAF 4,200/ha for 100 kg of a compound fer-
tilizer and CFAF 3,550/ha for three pesticide treatments. It is assumed
that other crops receive minor purchased inputs, see Annex 7. No increase
of production costs have been assumed.
(b) Labor costs
No economic cost is attributed to farm labor in view of the
high level of underemployment in Upper Volta; and the fact that on average
the labor requirements of project farms would be met by family labor.
(c) Project cotton production
Project cotton production is assumed to increase more slowly during
the years 1971-1973 than in the period 1974-1975; this is because experience
shows that it takes about three years to obtain full response from the
average farmers. For the rate of return calculation, project production
is assumed to be constant in 1976 and subsequent years. Account is taken
of incremental production only; incremental exports would be generated from
1972 onward on the basis that cotton ginned in 1971 was planted in 1970,
and that 1971 agricultural extension activity will first show its effect
on export sales in 1972.
(d) Yields
Total annual project yields have been developed from estimates
of annually varying numbers of participants farming at five different
levels of development. Average annual project cotton yields are assumed



ANNEX 18
Page 3
to increase from 757 kg/ha in 1970 to 820 kg/ha in 1973; and to 868 kg/ha
in 1975.  It is assumed that food crops are grown only for farm family
consumption. The only crop other than cotton with a possible surplus for
export is sesame.  Total sesame production by project farmers is estimated
to decrease from 9,100 tons in 1970 to about 4,400 tons in 1975. Small
quantities of groundnuts might be marketed locally, principally for
domestic consumption.  The estimated yields of crops in a typical farm
rotation in the five different stages of development are given in Annex 6.
(f) Producer Prices
Producer prices assumed are:
Seed cotton: CFAF 30.72/kg (68% lst quality at CFAF 32/kg
and 32% 2nd and 3rd qualities at CFAF 28/kg).
Sesame      :  CFAF 28/kg except for Nouna and Toma (CFAF 24/kg).
Groundnuts : CFAF 16/1kg unshelled except for Nouna and
Toma (CFAF 12/kg).
Surplus (Deficit) on Ginning and Export of Incremental Output
(a) Ginning Costs
The basic assumption for marketing, ginning and export costs are
given in Tables 3 and 4, and the calculation of these costs per ton lint
by years in Table 5.
(b)   xort Prices
Export prices are those projected by the Bank's Economics Depart-
ment. For US M 1" cotton a 1971 price of USe 25.1/lb CIF Liverpool is
assumed, declining to USe 22.5/lb in 1975, and to USe 21.5/lb in 1980 and
thereafter. Upper Volta cotton is assumed to sell at CFAF 4/kg (USe 0.65/
lb) less than US M 1" throughout the project life. Export prices for seed
are assumed to decline from US$85 in 1971 to US$80 by 1976 (see Table 7).
(c) Surplus (Deficit) on Ginning
The incremental surplus (deficit) on ginning and export of lint
and cotton seed is based on the incremental output as a percentage of
total project output (Table 2).
ORD Commission
From 1969/1970 the ORDs receive CFAF 100 per ton seed cotton
marketed through their services.



ANNEX 18
Page 4
Project Life
The life of the project is assumed to be 20 years which is the
estimated life of the principal investment, the new ginnery. The return
has also been tested for sensitivity with a 10-year project life.
Economic Rate of Return
The economic rate of return for a 20-year project life is 31%;
for a 10-year life 26%. With 15% lower cotton yields, this would be 23%
and 16%.

4/ IIn general, considerable time elapses between CFDT's selling and buyers' pay-
ments. For instance, it is estimated that in 1970 only 25% of amounts due wlll
be received before June 30, which date is the deadline for CFDT's seasonal
loans.
