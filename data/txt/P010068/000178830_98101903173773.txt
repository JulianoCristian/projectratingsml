INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMNTENIDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE WEST PAKISTAN WATER AND POWER DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY
POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $23 million
to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to assist in financing the West Pakistan
Water and Power Development Authority's (WAPDA) transmission and distribu-
tion program and consultant services.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        WAPDA comprises two wings, one concerned with water projects and
the other with power. The Bank Group has been closely associated with the
water wing since 1960 in connection with the implementation of the Indus
Basin and Tarbela Projects. WAPDA's water wing has been the executing
agency for both these projects, while the Bank Group has acted as admin-
istrator of the two funds from which these works have been financed. In
addition, the Bank Group has made three loans and credits to these two
funds (Loan No. 266-PAK of 1960 for US $90 million and Credit No. 60-PAK
of 1964 for US $58.5 million for the Indus Basin Project, and Loan No. 548-PAK
of 1968 for US $25 million for the Tarbela Project). However, the proposed
credit would be the Bank Group's first lending to the power wing of WAPDA.
3.        The WAPDA power transmission and distribution project was appraised
by a mission which visited Pakistan in November and December 1969. Negotiation
were held in Washington May 7 to 19, 1970. The Borrower was represented by
Mr. A.R. Bashir, Economic Minister of the Embassy of Pakistan, and WAPDA by
Mr. I.A. Khan, Chairman, Mr. I.A.S. Bokhari, Managing Director Power Wing,
and Messrs. Saddiqui and Hassan of WAPDA.
4.        The Association has made thirty-six development credits to Pakistan
totalling US $453.2 million, net of cancellations. Eleven credits are fully
disbursed. The Bank has made thirty-one loans in Pakistan totalling US $633.4
million, net of cancellations, of which eighteen are fully disbursed. The
following is a surmary statement of Bank loaxns and IDA credits in Pakis-tan as
of June 30, 1970:

5.        In my report on the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Project
(dated June 3, 1970; circulated to the Executive Directors as R70-104),
I referred to the slow rate of disbursement of some of the Bank Group's
loans and credits in Pakistan. As stated in that report, physical implemer-
tation of most projects is now making adequate progress; where major problems
exist, close contact with the project authorities is being maintained.
6.        IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling about US $21.6
million, net of cancellations. The value of outstanding commitments, net of
repayments, cancellations and sales of loans, is about US $16.3 million. IFC
is presently considering applications for investments in a large engineering
company and in a fertilizer company.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.        Borrower:           Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Amount:             Equivalent in various currencies of
US $23 million.
Purpose:            To assist in the financing of WAPDA's
power transmission and distribution program,
and of consultant services in certain man-
agement fields.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A report entitled "Appraisal of WAPDA Power Project, Water and
Power Development Authority, West Pakistan" (No. PU-36a), dated July 29,
1970, is attached.
9.        The project would comprise (i) the expansion of substations, in-
cluding additions to transformer capacity, switchgear, and voltage control
equipment, (ii) the increase in transmission capacity in Upper Sind through
the addition of a second circuit to the 132 Kv line from Dharki to Rohri and
(iii) the rehabilitation of ex,isting substation transformers. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US $40 million which would represent approxi-
mately 15 percent of WAPDA's investment requirements over the next five years
for secondary transmission and distribution.
10.       The proposed credit would finance primarily the foreign cost of
imported equipment and engineering services for the project amounting to
US $22.6 million or 57 percent of the total project cost. Local manufacturers
would be eligible to bid on contracts for low voltage switchgear and would be
granted a margin of preference of 15 percent. To the extent that they are
successful, up to US $800,000 out of the US $22.6 million would be paid to
meet local expenditures. Procurement would be through international competi-
tive bidding except in respect of contracts for less than US $10,000. The
Government of Pakistan has given an assurance that financing for the secondary
transmission program, and the local currency requirements of the project it-
self would be made available as required. The balance of the proposed credit,
US $400,000, would be allocated to finance the foreign exchange cost of con-
sultants to assist WAPDA in improving its management and accounting services.
11.       The Government of Pakistan would relend the proceeds of this credit
to WAPDA at 4 percent, which is the rate set by the Government for re-lending
foreign loans for power projects obtained on interest terms of less than 4
percent. The purpose of this concessional rate is to enable WAPDA to retain
most of its internally generated cash for financing capital expenditures.  In
the case of other agencies, such as Telegraph and Telephones and Karachi Port
Trust, the Government has set higher rates as these agencies are already able
to finance their capital expenditures from their own internally generated re-
sources.
12.       The power wing of WAPDA would be required under the Project Agree-
ment (Section 4.02) to earn a rate of return on net fixed assets of at least
8 percent in FY 1973 and thereafter. In addition, WAPDA has given an assurance
that it will work towards (i) achieving a rate of return of 10 percent, (ii)
making a minimum contribution from internal cash generation of 30 percent to
capital expenditures, and (iii) limiting its debt so that net internal cash
generation amounts to at least 1.5 times debt service. The means for and the
timing of achieving these goals will be determined in consultation with the
Association.
13.       This credit comes up for consideration at a time of constitutional
change in Pakistan. The former Government of West Pakistan was dissolved
on June 30, 1970, and has been replaced by four provincial governments.
WAPDA has been retained as a regional organization under the Office of the



President to whom the powers of the Government of West Pakistan have been
transferred. The Government and WAPDA have agreed to consult with the
Association on any further proposals which may affect the project or the
cperation of the power wing.
14.       Improvement in the organization of WAPDA's power wing has been
under consideration for some time. In 1969, two reports were prepared -
the first by a team from the American Public Power Association financed
by USAID and the second by Lord Hinton, working as a consultant to the
Bank Group. The recommendations in these reports have been thoroughly
discussed, and WAPDA will require additional services from foreign con-
sultants for improvement of management.
15.       Prior to the beginning of the Third Five Year Plan (1965/66-69/70),
power sales had been increasing at about 20 percent per annum. Despite
some slowing down in industrial activity over the last five years, power
sales have continued to increase at an average rate of 13.5 percent per
annum. This rate of increase would probably have been higher were it not
for a significant amount of load shedding resulting from bottlenecks in
the transmission and distribution system. The objective of this project
is to assist WAPDA in eliminating these bottlenecks.
16.       In the Fourth Five Year Plan (1970/71-74/75), priority has been
given to allocation for additional secondary transmission and distribution,
which will receive 48 percent of the resources earmarked for power in West
Pakistan. The benefits of the project are difficult to quantify but the
completion of WAPDA's secondary transmission and diptribution program, of
which this project would account for 15 percent, would ensure more effective
utilization of investment in generating capacity and primary transmission,
should reduce or eliminate industrial load-shedding, and should alleviate
the need for restrictions on new industrial connections.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between WAPDA
and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Credit Agreement and the draft
Project Agreement follow the usual pattern for credits of this type.
18.       A condition of effectiveness would be that arrangements acceptable
to the Association shall have been made for the exercise of the powers in
respect of WAPDA's power wing which were previously vested in the Province
of West Pakistan. With the transfer of these powers on July 1, 1970 to
the Office of the President, this condition has been substantially fulfilled.



- 6 -
In view of further constitutional changes which are expected, Section 5.02
(a) of the Credit Agreement has been drafted to permit the Association to
take remedies if any material change in the organization of WAPDA were made
so as to have an adverse effect upon the project or on the operation of the
power wing of WAPDA. A further condition for effectiveness would be that the
engineering consultants to supervise the project should be engaged under con-
tracts or letters of intent approved by the Association.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
19.       An economic report (SA-15a), dated July 17, 1970, and distributed
to the Executive Directors July 28, 1970 (R70-150) covers recent economic
developments in Pakistan.
20.       This report comments that while Pakistan achieved a rapid rate
of growth during the early 1960's, the economy encountered increasing dif-
ficulties over the Third Five Year Plan period (1965 - 1970). The report
concludes that there is considerable scope for improved management of the
country's resources and that Pakistan should be able to economize in the
use of its scarce capital through improvements in public investment plan-
ning and implementation. The authorities realize this and are actively
considering a number of measures that would help in improving economic
performance. Also, forceful action has to be taken with respect to the
mobilization of domestic resources. In the Third Plan period, the mar-
ginal saving rate was only 6.6 percent, which has led to a deterioration
in overall saving performance of the economv. and Government revenue now
accounts for only 9 percent of GNP. If larger investment programs are to
be appropriately financed, then fiscal reforms will be essential. Further-
more, public corporations, such as WAPDA's power wing, must be operated on
a more commercial basis.
21.       Any forecast at the present time regarding Pakistan's balance of
payments is risky, particularly because of uncertainties regarding the
prospects for attracting foreign assistance in amounts and on terms ap-
propriate to Pakistan's economic situation. In addition, present uncertain-
ties with respect to Government policies needed for a vigorous promotion of
exports cloud the outlook for export development; this presents a serious
problem, since the rate of export growth has been declining recently and
service on existing external debt is absorbing some 18 percent of Pakistan's
foreign exchange earnings. Under these circumstances, the Government realizes
that it should observe caution in contracting additional external debt on
conventional terms.
22.       The economic prospects of Pakistan justify continued assistance on
concessional terms such as those provided by the Association. The project it-
self will assist in improving not only the utilization of existing investments
but also management.

PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
24.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
