Some\n            lessons learned included: adopting a holistic approach and\n            addressing the most relevant development priorities improves\n            project impact. Early success builds on social capital and\n            brings more support. If agricultural credit needs to be\n            developed, interventions must follow the basic financial\n            system rules for being effective and sustainable. Effective\n            agricultural advisory systems are necessary catalysts in the\n            process of improving small farm productivity and\n            development. Funding of advisory services should be provided\n            based on approved annual work plans.
