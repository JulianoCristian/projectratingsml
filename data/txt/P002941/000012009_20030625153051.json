Lessons are as follows. An explicit\n            separation between institutional capacity building and\n            substantial field investment, provides opportunities to\n            reduce risks in the follow-on investments. First, it permits\n            the policy framework to be placed on a sound footing.\n            Second, it permits the identification, and correction of\n            existing institutional weaknesses. Third, where weaknesses\n            can not be corrected in certain institutions, it provides an\n            opportunity to exclude those institutions from subsequent\n            investments. This latter lesson was ably demonstrated in\n            this project whereby, the most successful institutions\n            received proportionately larger follow-on investment\n            support, as well as greater independence in managing their\n            own project. The decentralization of the decision-making\n            process from headquarters to the field, empowered the\n            previously disenfranchised field-based staff, and allowed\n            some autonomy for each protected area in terms of the\n            development of management plans, the disbursement of funds\n            against annual operating plans, and the evaluation of the\n            revenue-generating potential of each protected area. The\n            phased capacity building of the financial management system\n            allowed careful control over the financial management\n            system, while vastly improving financial reporting from the\n            field. Adaptive management can be learned, and can provide\n            an effective means for mitigating risks: the professional\n            approach to problem-solving and risk mitigation under this\n            operation, helped overcome many challenges. Finally,\n            effective donor coordination is itself an effective risk\n            mitigation strategy. The focus of the European Union, and\n            others on tourism permitted a more effective focus on\n            specific objectives relating to institutional capacity, and\n            protecting the critical habitats during the transition period."}, "docdt": "2003-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
