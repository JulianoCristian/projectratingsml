April 1977 to May 1978
In April 1977, the Government instituted a dual exchange rate system.
Under this system, a new "special" exchange rate of US$1.000 - J$1.250 was
established for all transactions except essential imports and transactions of
the Government and bauxite sector, which remained at the old ("basic") exchange
rate of US$1.000 - J$0.909. Subsequent adjustments were made in the "basic"
and "special" rates and by May 1978, the rates were:
Basic                           Special
US$1.000  - J$1.050             US$1.000  = J$1.350
J$1.000   - US$0.952            J$1.000   - US$0.740
May 1978 to March 1979
On May 10, 1978, the exchange rate was unified at the new rate of
US$1.000 - J$1.550. The Government started a system of monthly devaluations
which would total 15% by May, 1979. The following were the exchange values
in effect on April 27, 1979.

FORESTRY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          Government of Jamaica.
Beneficiaries:    The Forest Industries Development Company, Ltd. (FIDCO)
and the Forestry Department (FD) of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
Amount:            US$12 million.
Terms:             Payable in 17 years, including four years of grace
at 7.9% interest.
Relending Terms:  $10.8 million of loan funds would be reloaned by the
Government to FIDCO at an interest rate of 10% per annum
and with the same amortization and grace period as the
Bank loan. The sub-loan would be denominated in US dollars
and the Government would bear the cross currency risk.
The remaining $1.2 million of loan funds would be made
available to the Forestry Department for training and
research.
Project
Description:    The project is a step in making Jamaica self sufficient in
wood and wood products. It aims to establish a commercially
viable pine plantation and processing industry. It will
provide for the transfer and acquisition of about 20,000 ha
of land for pine plantations and for new plantation, re-
planting and plantation maintenance within that area. The
project provides for the construction of a new sawmill, the
rehabilitation of an existing sawmill, for the establish-
ment of forest roads, the development of road building,
logging and log transport operations and the institutional
strengthening of FIDCO and the Forestry Department. The
project would provide the country with increased sawnwood
production and roundwood availability. The project would
provide employment of about 50 man-years per annum for
unskilled road building, harvesting and sawmill labor and
about 4,500 man-years of unskilled labor for forestry estaL-
lishment during the project period. High levels of employ-
ment for forestry establishment will continue beyond the
project period as new forests are established. Cofinancing
would be provided by the Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC) and the United Kingdom's Overseas Development Ministries
(ODM). The major project risk is converting a Government
department into an efficient commercial undertaking at a
time when managerial talent is in short supply. The inclusion
of training and institutional support in the project reduces
the risk to a tolerable level.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR A
FORESTRY PROJECT
1.        I stibmit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Jamaica for the equivalent of US$12.0 million to help finance a
first forestry project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including
four years of grace, with interest at 7.9% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY I/
Introduction
2.        An Economic Memorandum was prepared and distributed to the Executive
Directors in May 1978. An Economic Report entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Jamaica" is being distributed to the Executive Directors in
May 1979.
Background to the Economic Crisis
3.        Jamaica's real GDP per capita has declined in every year since 1972,
the cumulative decline being about 20% through 1978. This downward spiral
appears particularly striking when one notes that the country is well endowed
with natural resources, has well educated and skilled manpower, enjoys the
advantage of proximity to the lucrative North American market and possesses a
developed financial system. To some extent, however, its advantages are also
its disadvantages. The openness of the economy makes it highly susceptible
to exogenous factors such as international price and demand changes. Its
labor and capital have proved internationally mobile, with every domestic
economic crisis being accompanied by a massive outflow of capital and an
exodus of labor. Finally, its proximity to the United States and Canada has
resulted in some emulation of the consumption patterns and levels of its more
affluent northern neighbors.
4.        The Government which came to power in 1972 inherited an economy
which had experienced rapid growth but which suffered from some serious struc-
tural defects. These included (i) a policy bias against the agricultural
sector, the traditional source of Jamaica's employment opportunities; (ii) an
industrial sector which had grown under excessive protection and had become
inefficient, highly import-dependent and capital intensive; (iii) increased
pressure on urban centers due to migration from the rural areas; and (iv) a
widening of income inequality. The development strategy of the new Government
in terms of economic diversification, an expanded public sector role, employ-
ment promotion and redistribution of income created an atmosphere of uncer-
tainty with the immediate result of reduced investment activity by the private
sector. The situation was further aggravated by the increase in petroleum and
other commodity prices, the world recession of 1974-75, the drying up of
foreign commercial bank lending, labor problems in some of the key sectors and
1/   This part is substantially identical to the corresponding section in
the President's Report for a proposed Second Program Loan.

political violence. In response to the ensuing balance of payments and fiscal
problems, there was a massive outflow of capital in 1976 (estimated at over
US$150 million or 5% of GDP). This has been accompanied by the migration of
skilled manpower, a phenomenon which initially was one of the main results of
the poor growth performance but now is one of its main causes. Table 1
illustrates some key aspects of this growth experience.
The Government's Response to the Crisis
5.         Since early 1977, the Government has been making concerted efforts
to alleviate the country's severe economic problems. The measures have
included a new tax effort, a wages policy for both the private and public
sectors, tightening of import restrictions and exchange rate adjustments.
In July 1977, the Government adopted a comprehensive program which became
the basis for an agreement with the IMF on a one-year standby arrangement.
Under this arrangement, Jamaica drew the first tranche of US$22 million, but
by early 1978, it became apparent that the Government would not be able to
meet the targets of the standby arrangement. Instead of seeking to renego-
tiate the arrangement, the IMF and Government negotiated a three-year
Extended Fund Facility arrangement in May 1978, which permitted a longer
period for economic adjustment and provided a higher level (US$240 million
for a three-year period through June 1981) of financial assistance from
the IMF. The main focus of the program is to channel the maximum amount
of resources toward investment and growth. To this end, domestic consumption
is expected to decline from the 1977 level of about 88% of GDP to about
83% of GDP by 1980. The key elements of the program for the first year of
the Facility arrangement were the following:
(i) Exchange rate policy: On May 10, 1978, the Government ended
the dual exchange rate system, in force for over a year, and
moved to a unified rate of US$1.00 = J$1.55. This implied an
effective weighted average devaluation of 25%. In addition,
the Government agreed to a program of small monthly devaluations,
which would total 15% by May 1979. Beyond that, it agreed
to frequent moves of the exchange rate in order to maintain the
competitiveness of Jamaican exports.
(ii) Incomes policy: Wage increases in any wage contract expiring
after May 1, 1978, have been limited to maximum nominal increases
of 15% per year for the two-year period. This limit applies to
the value of all concepts of pay: straight time pay and overtime
rates, plus the money value of all fringe benefits and allowances.
The wage guideline has been applied to the public as well as
private sector.
(iii)  Fiscal policy:  The overall deficit of the Central Government was
to be reduced to 12.5% of GDP in 1978/79 from about 16% of GDP in
1977/78 through expenditure cuts and a new tax package.

(iv) Production policies: The Government has reaffirmed its commit-
ment to a mixed economy. Public enterprises are expected to
operate on a cost recovery basis. Although price controls are
to be maintained for most basic necessities, they have either
been lifted or significantly liberalized for all other items.
6.        In addition to the foregoing, the program for the first year con-
tained (i) ceilings on net credit to the public sector from the banking
system; (ii) limits on the domestic assets of the Bank of Jamaica; (iii) limits
on the authorization of new foreign indebtedness by the public sector;
(iv) targets for increases in international reserves; and (v) provisions for
orderly management of payment arrears.
7.        Quarterly program tests have generally been met and through
April 30, 1979, five drawings, totalling about US$90 million, had been made
under the Extended Fund Facility. The exchange rate policy has been imple-
mented as planned, the rate being US$1.00 = J$1.766 on April 27, and one
further small move is expected to bring it to the originally agreed level.
Regarding the incomes policy, available data suggest that the 15% guidelire
was substantially adhered to. Even when one includes the somewhat larger
wage increases negotiated prior to the effectiveness of the 15% guideline,
wages in the unionized sector increased, on the average, by less than 20%.
In respect to fiscal policy, however, the current account deficit was higher
(2.6% of GDP) than the progammed level (0.5% of GDP), although the overall
financing deficit was on target, owing to the slower implementation of projects.
8.        At the end of April, agreement was reached with the IMF on the
targets and policies for the second year of the program. The Government and
the IMF are agreed that the exchange rate and wage policies pursued over the
past year have restored Jamaica's export competitiveness, and, accordingly,
the mini-devaluations will be suspended as of May 1979.  Emphasis will there-
after be placed on preserving Jamaica's competitiveness through (i) the reduc-
tion of the ceiling on wage increases from 15% of last year to 10% this year;
(ii) a more active monetary policy in which interest rates will be allowed
to increase.
9.        Over the last year, the Government has shown considerable resolve
in adopting the measures required to cope with the serious economic situation.
Politically, this has not been easy. Consumer prices increased by about 50%
during 1978 at a time when the Government was generally enforcing the guideline
regarding 15% nominal wage increases. The removal of subsidies on many items,
the adjustments in the tariffs of many services, and the additional burden of
the new tax package have combined to cause a considerable decline in the real
income of the population. Although public dissatisfaction with economic
conditions has generally been restrained, some civil disorders took place in
January 1979 in connection with a gasoline price increase and a one-day general
strike occurred thereafter in mid-February.
External Financing Requirements
10.       Since 1977, and concurrently with IMF negotiations, the Government
has continued discussions with bilateral and multilateral sources as well as
with foreign commercial banks for a package of extraordinary external financing.

The financing plan was based on a detailed analysis of the size of the external
resource gap, and the Bank has played an active role in the determination and
mobilization of the required resources not only through its first program loan,
but also through the Bank-sponsored Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic
Development. Commitments of US$53.6 million in the form of program-type
assistance were made to Jamaica in June 1978 under the Group, and by the end
of March 1979, about US$37 million had been drawn down. Details on the
sources and uses of the external financing are provided in Tables 2 and 3.
11.       The proposed Bank Second Program Loan is an integral part of the
financing package (see Table 3). To ensure that the negative real growth of
output of the last several years is reversed, a minimum level of merchandise
imports (c.i.f.) of US$1,000 million would be required, compared to US$872
million in 1978. Owing to the foreign exchange constraints of the last few
years, the level of capital and intermediate goods imports of agriculture and
industry (excluding the bauxite/alumina sector) were reduced from US$585
million in 1975 to US$450 million in 1976 and US$305 million in 1977. In
1978, thanks to the package of special external financing of which the Bank's
program loan was a part, these imports increased to US$510 million, but even
then the 1978 levels of such imports was about 30% below that of 1975 in real
terms. Although in absolute terms, the proposed Bank Second Program Loan
represents a relatively small part of Jamaica's import requirements for 1979,
the proposed program loan would account for a significant percentage of the
funds required for imports by Jamaica's exporters of non-traditional manufac-
tured goods. To the extent that the proposed revolving fund could turn over
up to 1.3 times a year, the foreign exchange availability stimulated by the
loan during its first year of operation could be up to US$40 million. Given
the present low capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector, and given
that in real terms the foreign exchange availability to the sector is consid-
erably lower than in 1975, the proposed Second Program Loan plays a crucial
role in the Government's strategy for export promotion.
Impact of Government's Policies on the Economic Situation
12.       The key macroeconomic indicators suggest that the balance of
payments and fiscal situations have generally improved during 1977 and 1978
compared to 1975 and 1976, reflecting both improved international demand for
Jamaica's exports and the effects of the policy measures which have been
introduced over the last two years to deal with the crisis.
13.       Balance of Payments.  Buoyed by strong demand in the industrial
economies, the production of bauxite increased from 10.1 million long tons in
1976 to 11.3 million long tons in 1977 and to 11.8 million long tons in 1978.
In value terms, the exports of the bauxite/alumina sector increased by about
27% between 1976 and 1978. Sugar and banana exports increased marginally in
value terms due mainly to slightly better prices. Non-traditional exports and
tourism, on the other hand, have benefitted considerably from the exchange
rate adjustments. While merchandise exports increased by 22% in current terms
between 1976 and 1978, merchandise imports were maintained at below their 1976
level through a rigorous system of import licensing. The result has been that,
despite the higher net factor service payments, the current account deficit
has been substantially lower during 1977 and 1978 than during 1975 and 1976
(see Table 4). This has enabled Jamaica not only to reduce its commercial

arrears substantially, but also to increase marginally its gross official
reserves over the 1976 level. While the balance of payments situation still
remains difficult, the major trade-related distortions have been substantially
reduced.
14.       Public Finances.  Helped by the exchange rate adjustments, the
Central Government budgetary accounts registered substantial improvements
during 1977/78 and 1978/79. In reflection of the improved aluminum market
and as a consequence of the new tax package, current revenue increased by
about 57% in nominal terms between 1976/77 and 1978/79. By contrast, current
expenditure over the same period increased by 47% due to careful monitoring
of the expenditures of the ministries and departments by the Ministry of
Finance. In addition, capital expenditure has been lower during the last
two fiscal years due to slow implementation of projects. As a result, the
overall financing deficit decreased from 18.4% of GDP in 1976/77 to about
16% in 1977/78 and to about 12% in 1978/79 (see Table 5). This is still
an excessively large deficit but is expected to decrease appreciably as the
Government continues its adherence to its stabilization program.
15.       Output and Employment.  The above accomplishments in the fiscal and
balance of payments areas have been at a considerable cost in terms of output,
employment, and prices. The lower level of imports has led to shortages of raw
materials and intermediate goods which have, in turn, led to the closure or
reduced activity of many distributing and manufacturing firms. There is a
large underutilization of capacity in the productive sectors, in part because
of external conditions and in part because of the restriction on imports and
domestic demand. On the basis of provisional data, real GDP stagnated in 1978,
following declines of 6.7% and 4.0%, respectively, during 1976 and 1977.
Unemployment increased further to about 26% by the end of 1978, after remain-
ing stable at the high level of about 24% over the past two years. Finally,
as a direct consequence of the economic package, consumer prices (on an end-
of-period basis) increased by about 50%, implying a decline in real wages
of over 30%.
Growth and Balance of Payments Prospects
16.       Output.  The level of economic activity in Jamaica continues to be
severely restricted by the country's limited import capacity and scarcity of
skilled manpower. The speed with which recovery can be accomplished conse-
quently will depend heavily upon the growth of export earnings, the ability
of the public sector to mobilize external financing-on appropriate terms, the
trends in private capital inflows, and the capacity of the Government to
ameliorate the problems arising from shortages of skilled manpower. However,
given the prospects of a tight balance of payments during the first half of
1979, GDP is expected to grow in real terms by no more than 2.5% during the
year. Growth prospects beyond 1979 appear somewhat brighter as the economy
gradually overcomes the current short-term constraints. GDP growth rate, in
real terms, is projected at 3.5% for 1980 and 4% beyond 1980.
17.       Balance of Payments.  Assuming no recurrence of the civil unrest
that occurred in early January, and given normal local weather conditions for
agriculture, the exports of goods and nonfactor services of Jamaica should

increase during 1979 to a level of about US$1,115 million, a nominal in-
crease of 11% above the 1978 level of about US$1,006 million. Total bauxite
production is projected to increase to 12.6 million tons, about 7% above the
1978 level of 11.8 million tons. The production of sugar is projected to
increase to 350,000 tons, 16% above the 1978 level but still lower than the
1972 level of 373,000 tons and substantially lower than the 500,000 tons in
1965. Slight improvement is also expected in banana production and exports.
The area which is expected to benefit most from the Government's new emphasis
on export promotion is non-traditional exports. The proposed changes in the
incentive structure to favor exporting, together with more favorable macro-
economic policies, are expected to result in a nominal increase of about 25%
in the exports of non-traditional exports (mainly manufactured goods but also
including some agricultural goods and petroleum by-products). Provided that
there are no further disruptions, tourist arrivals should increase by 12-13%
during 1979.
18.       Imports of goods and nonfactor services are projected at US$1,152
million, about 14% above the 1978 level. On this basis, the current account
deficit in 1979 is projected at US$135 million (about 4.5% of GDP) compared
to US$142 million (5.3% of GDP) in 1978.
19.       Over the five-year period, 1979-83, the current account deficit is
projected to average about US$85 million annually. In addition to this
deficit, amortization payments on existing and new debt to be contracted are
expected to average US$146 million. Thus, the annual external capital require-
ments to cover both current deficits and requisite amortization payments are
estimated to average US$231 million.
20.       It is projected that gross disbursements of medium- and long-term
loans and credits would provide, on an average, about US$255 million. Com-
plemented by potential net disbursements from the IMF, averaging about US$65
million annually, this would be sufficient to cover the above indicated
capital requirements and also provide for strengthening of international
reserves 1/ and for a small outflow on account of direct private investment
due to amortization of bauxite/alumina investments.
21.       Creditworthiness.  Jamaica's public external debt has grown rapidly
in recent years. At the end of 1973, external public debt outstanding and
disbursed was US$309 million, or about 16% of GDP. By the end of 1978 it had
risen to about US$1,005 million,or about 38% of estimated GDP. Particularly
because of the shorter maturities of much of the recent borrowing, the growth
in debt service has been more rapid than the growth of debt. Service payments
on this public debt are estimated at about 17% of exports (including nonfactor
services) in 1978, compared to 6% in 1973. The interest payments in 1978 alone
amounted to about 2.4% of GDP and to about 8% of central government current
revenues.
22.       Debt and debt service, in relation to GDP and exports, are now above
the levels that are desirable for a small open economy that is not highly
diversified. The role of external borrowing will necessarily be limited by
the need to improve tnese relationships and thus give the Jamaican authorities
greater freedom of action in their economic management. The most desirable
1/   Net foreign reserves are expected to increase by US$67 million in 1979.

way of reducing the debt service ratio and to increase GDP and exports and to
borrow on more favorable terms rather than to reduce the net inflow of capital
from abroad. The projected debt burden is shown in Table 6. Interest as a
percent of GDP is projected to fall slowly from 2.4% in 1978 to 1.8% by 1985.
This slow improvement is reflective of the present debt structure of Jamaica,
with the service payments to foreign commercial banks expected to account for
70% of the total debt service payments in 1979. A gradual improvement in debt
structure is foreseen in line with the Government's limits, under the economic
program, on the authorization of new foreign indebtedness of shorter
maturities by the public sector and this improvement is expected to offset
the increase in the average effective interest rate (as new loans at around
8.5% replace older loans contracted at lower nominal interest rates). The
debt service ratio and the ratio of debt outstanding and disbursed is pro-
jected to decline gradually over the next several years, due in large part to
good prospects for exports, especially of bauxite/alumina. On this basis,
provided Jamaica successfully carries out its economic stabilization program
and pursues its new export-oriented strategy, it should be able to manage its
external indebtedness and be considered creditworthy for continued external
assistance.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA
23.       To date the Bank has made 19 loans in Jamaica totalling $227.4 mil-
lion after cancellations. Of this amount, $101.5 million (45%) has been for
infrastructure investments in transportation, electric power, water supply and
sewerage; the remainder has gone into agriculture and agroindustry (19%); pro-
gram lending (13%), education (10%), sites and services (7%), population and
nutrition (4%), and small scale enterprises (3%). There have been two IFC
investments in Jamaica; a loan in 1961 to a pre-mix concrete company and an
equity/loan investment in 1968 in a hotel project. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of March 31, 1979 and notes
on the execution of projects in Jamaica.
24.       Bank lending in Jamaica has covered a wide range of sectors and
development problems. Initially, the Bank lending program emphasized infra-
structure investment. Although financing for this purpose has continued,
the emphasis of the lending program in the early and middle 1970s moved to
the social sectors, with projects in education, population and nutrition,
housing and employment for the urban poor and rural development. In response
to changing economic forces, a further shift in Bank lending has taken place
in Jamaica in the late 1970s. The priority needs of this most recent period
have been the country's critical short- to medium-term balance of payments and
production requirements. Thus, the FY78 lending program contained a $30 mil-
lion program loan and an $18 million loan for the rehabilitation of sugar
factories. The proposed forestry project and second program loan are directed
at similar needs. Although the Bank lending program has experienced shifts in
emphasis and priorities based on changing economic conditions, the longer-term
objectives of balanced economic development have not been overlooked. Accord-
ingly, while some of the loans now under consideration are directed at promo-
ting exports and the development of efficient import substitution activities,
other development objectives are being addressed to the extent possible. Bank
lending aims to support programs to increase employment, to achieve a wider
distribution of the benefits of economic growth, and to preserve and improve
essential infrastructure. It is also an important objective of Bank lending



- 15 -
to strengthen the public sector institutions associated with Bank-financed
projects by supporting policies to improve the quality of their management,
operating procedures and finances.
25.       Coordination with other external lenders and assistance agencies
has been given particular attention in formulating the Bank's lending strategy.
The Bank has taken a lead role in an international aid effort for the Caribbean
called the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development. Its first
meeting was held in Washington in June 1978 and a second meeting is scheduled
for June 1979. The Group has brought together the donor agencies and countries
for the Caribbean and the recipient countries. Within the framework of the
Group, individual country subgroup meetings, similar to Bank consultative group
meetings, have been held. The subgroup meeting for Jamaica has provided an
opportunity to present a country project list and to coordinate assistance
efforts. As a result of the Caribbean Group and subgroup meetings, and of
related donor activities, Jamaica has received commitments, exclusive of Bank
and IMF assistance, for additional balance of payments and project local cost
financing of $53.6 million in FY79 from several bilateral and multilateral
donors. Local cost financing provided in this manner financed the local cost
requirements of several Bank assisted projects in FY79. The Caribbean Group
also provided a basis for co-financing foreign exchange costs with the OPEC
Special Fund in the Bank assisted Second Power Project. The Bank has also
worked closely with the UNDP in developing a small UNDP financed technical
assistance project to improve the execution of development projects, in which
the Bank would be the executing agency. In addition to the close relationship
established with the IMF and the UNDP in dealing with Jamaican problems, the
Bank has worked intimately with other sponsoring agencies of the Caribbean
Group--the Inter-American Development Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank,
as well as with bilateral aid agencies in the United States, Canada and the
United Kingdom.
26.       Project implementation difficulties have been endemic to Bank and
other internationally financed projects. These difficulties have had three
principal causes: (i) shortages of key personnel; (ii) inadequacies in the
systems of management used in planning and controlling projects; and (iii)
organizational and structural problems in the public sector. The difficult
economic condition of the last several years have affected and intensified
the problem in all three areas. The Government, the Bank and the other inter-
national agencies are taking steps to deal with it in existing projects and
the design of new projects, but it is too early to assess the impact of these
steps.
27.       In July 1978 the Bank provided a $7 million loan for a Small Scale
Enterprise project which is assisting emerging enterpreneurs and small business-
men. The project is expected to have significant employment and social bene-
fits. The proposed Forestry Project Loan, a Second Program Loan and a Highway
Maintenance Loan are scheduled to be presented to the Board near in time to
one another. An Education Project dealing with vocational education and teacher
training has also been recently approved. Looking further ahead, projects
have been identified for assisting export industries and to support the
Government's efforts in the agricultural sector. It is expected that the



- 16 -
precedent established for close coordination with other external aid donors
will continue and exert a strong influence on the future character of Bank
lending to Jamaica. The Bank's share of external public debt outstanding and
disbursed was about 8% in 1977 and its share of external public debt service
was about 5% in that year. It is estimated that in 1978 Bank share of external
public debt outstanding increased to about 11%, while its share of external
public debt service remained about the same.
PART III - SECTOR AND SUBSECTOR
A. The Agricultural Sector
28.       The overall performance of the agricultural sector has not been
commensurate with its physical potential. Over the last decade, production
has remained stagnant, resulting in a decline in agricultural output and food
production per capita. This has been particularly evident for export crops,
which have been decreasing at an annual rate of 5% in constant prices. Al-
though food-crop production has increased in the last few years, it has not
kept pace with domestic demand. Nevertheless, agriculture is still a major
source of income and employment in Jamaica. It currently contributes approxi-
mately 8% to GDP, over 30% to national employment and about 13% to export
earnings. However, socio-economic problems abound in rural areas, where
about 60% (1.2 million) of the population still lives. About 80% of the rural
population have incomes less than a third of the national average (relative
poverty), and at least a third earns less than the income considered necessary
to provide minimum caloric requirements (absolute poverty).
29.       Recognizing the vital role of agriculture, the Government formulated
an Emergency Production Plan in April 1977 which called for immediate increases
in food production and for a long-term agricultural strategy to be completed
by the end of 1977. Its present intentions are embodied in the Five-year
Development Plan 1978-82, which calls for an annual growth rate of 7 to 8% and
an annual increase in employment of 6% in the sector. The Plan's principal
objectives are to: maximize production of food and agricultural raw material;
reduce reliance on imports, optomize utilization of agricultural land; improve
the standard of living of the rural population by increasing both farm incomes
and rural amenities; provide more employment opportunities; ensure that inputs
and markets are available to farmers; and protect farmers from praedial
larceny. The Plan proposes to accomplish this by: continuing the system of
guaranteed prices for urgently-required products; accelerating distribution of
land to small farmers; implementing new or improved drainage or irrigation to
about 20,000 ha (50,000 acres); implementing a soil conservation program;
strengthening research and extension services; improving the marketing and
distribution of domestic food crops; and inreasing the flow of agricultural
credit. While the Plan includes targets for each of 24 products or subsectors,
including forestry, it does not present specific measures needed to achieve
the targets. Because of the severe financial and management constraints
facing Jamaica now, substantial amounts of external technical and financial
assistance will be necessary if Jamaica is to achieve the Plan's objectives.



- 17 -
30.       The Bank has made four previous loans to the sector:  two for
agricultural credit ($9.2 million); one for rural development ($15 million);
and one for sugar industry rehabilitation ($18 million). The First Agricul-
tural Credit Loan has been completely disbursed and an Operations Evaluation
Department audit (Report No. 189B) of the loan was distributed to the Executive
Directors on Febiuary 10, 1978. The audit report concluded that although the
short- and medium-term results of the project may have fallen short of expecta-
tions, the longer term goals of developing Jamaican agriculture through better
credit services were achieved. The Second Agricultural Credit Loan is almost
completely committed. Institutional difficulties have been experienced by
the Jamaica Development Bank, the institution responsible for extending
agricultural credits and the subloan repayment record has not been satis-
factory. The 1977 rural development project loan has gotten off to a slow
start and project disbursements have been lagging. The most recent loan,
the 1978 Sugar Rehabilitation Project has had a promising beginning, with
project execution on schedule and operations proceeding with reasonable
efficiency. The Bank's experience with lending in the sector has been mixed
and indicates that the proposed loan will require close supervision.
B. The Forestry Subsector
31.       Background.  A total of about 267,000 ha (659,000 acres) or about
24% of Jamaica's land area is classified as forest lands. Of this, about
77,000 ha (190,000 acres) are considered well-stocked natural forest, of
which about 60,000 ha (148,000 acres) are government-owned forest reserves;
and 17,000 ha (42,000 acres) are privately owned. The remaining area classi-
fied as forest land--190,000 (469,000 acres) is ruinate (scrub forest) with
little present potential for exploitation, fuelwood being the only use in the
foreseable future. Much of the now well-stocked forest reserves--about 40,000
ha (89,000 acres)--is in very steep terrain and is not readily accessible.
32.       With the exception of the Blue Mountain area in the eastern
portion of the country (see map), most of the soils in Jamaica are derived
from limestone. While they may be suited to selected hardwood species,
their commercial potential remains to be demonstrated. Only in the Blue
Mountain area, with shale- and conglomerate-derived soils and moderate-to-
high rainfall (from 60 to over 160 inches p.a.), are conditions suitable
for pine cultivation, which is the initial focus of commercial forestry
because of its relatively short maturity cycle and the ready local market
for pine products as sawnwood and as raw material for paper production.
33.       Small-scale planting of pines began in the early 1950s.  Planting
accelerated throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, when the first large-scale
plantations were established in the Mount Airy area with the assistance
of USAID. Under the USAID project about 3,000 ha (7,500 acres) of Caribbean
pine plantations were established in the three-year period 1974-77. By 1977
about 10,000 ha (24,750 acres) of plantations had been established.
34.       Economic and social importance.  A steadily rising import bill
represents one of the major constraints on Jamaica's development. Imports
of forest products in 1975 totalled about 503,000 m3 roundwood equivalent



- 18 -
worth about US$67 million. Because of foreign-exchange restrictions,
importation of forest products declined in 1976 and 1977 to still-high levels
of about US$50 million p.a., which represented about 6% of total merchandise
imports for those years.
35.       Government policy.  Until recently, forestry development has not
been a high-priority development area, with the result that demand for forest
products has had to be met increasingly by importation.  In addition, the
important role of forest areas in protecting watersheds, thereby preventing
soil erosion and ensuring a sustained flow of water for downstream uses--
agricultural, industrial and domestic--has not been sufficiently taken into
account.
36.       The report on the forestry sub-sector in the 1973 Cabinet-approved
policy paper which addressed the problems of the agricultural sector in
general recommended a series of programs, including a forestry development
project to meet the nation's need for coniferous sawnwood involving the
acquisition of at least 25,000 ha (60,000 acres), forest establishment
of up to 2,000 ha (5,000 acres) p.a., harvesting and training of personnel,
which led to the USAID-funded 1974-77 project and to the proposed project.
37.       At this stage in Jamaica's development, high priority is being
given to reducing the country's reliance on imports, increasing rural
employment opportunities and generally improving rural amenities and social
infrastructures. Because of its potential for foreign-exchange savings
through import substitution and its capacity for employment creation,
particularly in the rural sector, the development of forestry and forest
industries could play an important role in this strategy. A second,
although less immediate, concern is the need for appropriate land conserv-
ation practices in Jamaica. The high priority of forestry development is
reflected in the government's five-year development plan 1978-82, which
calls for the establishment of 2,000 ha (5,000 acres) p.a., mostly in
industrial plantations, and development of downstream industrial potential
and which also mentions the forest's role in watershed protection/soil
conservation.
38.       Subsector structure.  Responsibility for the development, manage-
ment and protection of Jamaica's forest resource lies with the Ministry of
Agriculture. Execution of these activities has until recently been the
responsibility of the Forest Department (FD), one of the six departments
in the Ministry. FD's major activities have been: establishment and
maintenance of industrial plantations; logging operations; and beginning
in 1976, producing pine sawnwood at the Twickenham Park Sawmill, which was
installed under UNDP auspices as a training and demonstration project.
39.       Private-sector participation in forestry is negligible, and in
forest industries, significant but declining. Except for Twickenham Park,
all Jamaican sawmills are private, but the number and production of the
70 small sawmills are not expected to increase.



- 19 -
40.       Realizing that a commercial-forestry subsector would need to run
efficiently if it was to achieve its goals, the government established the
Forest Industries Development Company Ltd. (FIDCO) in August 1978 to have
responsibility for operating all forest and forest-industry activities
designated as commercial, including establishment and maintenance of plan-
tations, logging, transport and processing of harvested timber.
41.       The main emphasis for forest development at this time is on commer-
cial forestry, principally for economic reasons, but also because of personnel
limitations. However, the government is mindful that the noncommercial activ-
ities of forest development must not be neglected, and programs are being
planned to improve conservation practices, watershed management and the
recreational use of forests.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
42.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report - Jamaica Forestry
Project" (No. 2384-JM, dated April 27, 1979) is being distributed separately.
Annex III contains a timetable of key events in processing the project and
a description of the special conditions of the proposed loan. Negotiations
for the proposed loan took place in Washington in April 1979. The Jamaican
delegation was led by Mr. Ainsley Elliott, Deputy Financial Secretary, Ministry
of Finance and Planning and the FIDCO delegation by their Managing Director,
Mr. Keats Hall.
A.   Project Origin, Goals and Objectives
43.       As a result of FD's accomplishments in establishing pine planta-
tions and operating its sawmill at Twickenham Park, the government in early
1977 requested UNDP and later the Bank to investigate the possibility of
improving forestry development and finance areas which appeared promising.
As a result of several UNDP/FAO/IBRD missions, an FAO/CP mission in April/
May 1978 assisted the government in preparation of a project which includes:
expansion of industrial pine plantations and roading/harvesting/log trans-
port capability; renovation of the Twickenham Park sawmill and installation
of a new sawmill; and technical assistance.
44.       As the results of the project preparation showed higher financing
requirements, particularly with respect to local-currency needs, than had
previously been expected or than the Bank and government could provide,
the government invited the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) to
participate in project financing in July. The draft FAO/CP preparation
report was published in August and formed the basis for the joint CDC/Bank
field appraisal, which took place in September/October 1978. As a result
of initiatives by FD and the UNDP resident advisor, the government in August
requested assistance fromm the UK Overseas Development Ministry (ODM) in
financing the services of forestry officers whom it would second or recruit.
The areas of concentration of the three external financing agencies thus
evolved as follows: ODM would finance technical assistance related to



- 20 -
forestry development; CDC would finance most of the local-currency require-
ments of the industrial plantation; and the Bank would assist in financing
a small portion of the forestry development and most of the related activ-
ities--roading, harvesting, sawmills, institution-building, and studies of
future projects--which have a relatively high foreign-exchange content.
45.       Jamaica's ultimate goal is to achieve a high degree of self-
sufficiency in wood and wood products, particularly softwood. This would
be accomplished by maximizing afforestation of Caribbean pines in areas suit-
able to their cultivation.
46.       The principal purpose of the pine-plantation program is to trans-
form the forestry-related activities in Jamaica, heretofore established as
demonstration, training or pilot schemes, into a commercial undertaking. The
program, of which the project is an integral part, would be the country's
first cohesive step toward its ultimate goal of self-sufficiency in wood-
related products. While the program is concerned with long-term development
of pine plantations and establishment of downstream activities over a 25-year
period, the project focuses on the initial steps, particularly bringing
forestry and related industrial activities to economic efficiency.
47.       Although the project would not include direct investments in other
forestry activities, its research and inventory components and a study of
the energy potential of forest development would assist the government in
defining the future role of the country's forests. Moreover, the training
component of the project is intended to enable the development of sufficient
quantities of trained manpower to manage the country's forest resources--
both commercial plantations and noncommercial forest reserves--optimally.
B.   Project Description
48.       The project would be the second phase of a forestry development
program. It would include: the transfer to FIDCO's use of about 6,000 ha
of public land and acquisition of about 14,000 ha (gross area) of privately-
owned land for plantation development; establishment and maintenance of about
9,250 ha of new pine plantations and replanting with pine of about 690 ha to
be harvested during the project period (net areas); maintenance of about
7,200 ha of already-established pine plantations; improvement of the
Twickenham Park sawmill to increase its output from 2,500 m3 of sawnwood p.a.
to 12,500 m3; construction of a new pine sawmill of evenutal output capacity
17,500 m3 of sawnwood p.a.; establishment of logging and timber transport
units associated with the two sawmills and of a maintenance workshop for the
equipment used in forest establishment, logging, transport and sawmilling
operations; infrastructure improvements, consisting mainly of forest roads,
institutional strengthening, including research and training of Jamaica
personnel in FIDCO and FD and the engagement of internationally-recruited
expert personnel to provide initial managerial support to FIDCO; and technical
assistance, including a forest inventory, engineering assistance for the
present project and studies for future developments, including potential
utilization of fuelwood in rural areas.

C.   Costs and Financing
49.        The project's estimated cost is US$31.7 million with a US$12.2
million foreign component. A summary of project costs is contained in the
Loan and ProjecL Summary. The proposed Bank loan would finance the total
(mostly local) cost of the plantation nursery and maintenance activities plus
the foreign-exchange cost of materials and equipment for the plantation,
roading/harvesting/ transport, workshop and sawmill components and of institu-
tion strengthening/ technical assistance not provided by other financing
agencies.  The proposed CDC loan would finance the remaining forestry-estab-
lishment costs and the services of a financial controller for FIDCO. A grant
from ODM would finance the services of five full-time forestry experts to be
seconded by the UK Forestry Commission. Net internal cash generation of FIDCO
plus contributions to its equity from the government of at least US$4 million
equivalent would cover the remaining local costs.
50.       The proposed US$12 million Bank loan would be made to the govern-
ment at the current Bank interest rate and a 17-year term, including four
years of grace. The government would relend the portion of the loan relat-
ing to FIDCO components (US$10.8 million) to FIDCO via a subloan which would
be denominated in US currency, bear an interest rate of 10% p.a. and have
the same amortization and grace terms as the Bank loan. The remaining US$1.2
million of loan funds would be made available to the Forestry Department for
training and research. A condition of loan effectiveness would be that the
Government and FIDCO had executed a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to
the Bank (Section 6.01, Loan Agreement). The CDC loan (about US$11.5 million
equivalent, expressed in sterling) would be made directly to FIDCO, bear
6.75% p.a. interest, have a term of 25 years including six of grace and
provide for FIDCO's assumption of the foreign exchange risk. A further
condition of loan effectiveness would be that CDC and FIDCO had concluded
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank regarding the CDC loan (Section 6.01,
Loan Agreement). The ODM financing would be a grant to the Jamaican govern-
ment. For project execution to begin in a reasonable period of time, FIDCO
has begun preparatory work: a thorough reconnaissance of the project area;
engagement of internationally-recruited managers, and consulting engineers;
purchase of vehicles, spare parts and communication equipment; maintenance of
already-established plantations; and production of seedlings. Up to US$550,000
of loan funds may be used to finance retroactively such activities (para. 4,
Schedule 1 of Loan Agreement).
D.   Procurement and Disbursement
51.       Because of the urgency of acquiring the film for aerial photography,
communication equipment, and the vehicles for internationally-recruited staff
and land-acquisition team, FIDCO has acquired these items through prudent
"local shopping." Spare parts are to be acquired from manufacturers of the
original equipment; the Landsat survey, from the US Government, and the seed,
from Honduras; the respective sources are the only practical ones. All other
contracts for tools, materials, equipment and vehicles (including initial spare
parts) to be financed by the proposed Bank loan would be contracted following



- 22 -
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's guide-
lines for procurement. Jamaican manufacturers of equipment and material
would be entitled to preferences of 15% or the applicable tariff, whichever
is lower. Local manufacturers may be in a position to win contracts for
miscellaneous tools and small items of equipment used in plantation estab-
lishment with a total estimated cost of about US$0.5 million. Assurances
would be sought from the Government that import licenses for all imported
items to be financed by the proposed loan would be granted promptly (Section
3.02, Loan Agreement).
52.       All forest establishment, including the nursery and forest main-
tenance operations to be financed by the proposed loan, and certain operations
in road-building (clearing, stabilization and grading) would be done by force
account. The other road-building operations (sub-grading, rock, work, culverts,
bridges, retaining walls, surfacing and construction of log landings) and con-
struction of workshop and sawmill buildings would be done by local contractors
engaged through local contracting procedures acceptable to the Bank.
53.       Disbursements from the loan account would be made for:  100% of the
nursery and maintenance operation; 40% of the cost of road-building and the
construction of the sawmill and workshop buildings, representing the foreign
costs of these activities; 90% of the ex-factory costs of tools, material,
equipment and vehicles in cases where Jamaican manufacturers win contracts or
100% of foreign expenditures for tools, material, equipment and vehicles and
installation/erection supervision for imported goods; 100% of foreign expendi-
tures or 90% of total expenditures for internationally-recruited management
or consultant services (the latter percentage to be applied to services of
Jamaican individuals); and 100% of the foreign costs of the research and
training program. The estimated disbursement schedule is contained in the
Loan and Project Summary.
E. Project Implementation
54.       FD would be responsible for project activities which are related
to both industrial-plantation development and noncommercial forestry, viz,
research, inventory and training. A forestry development committee composed
of representatives of FD and FIDCO, would be established inter-alia to over-
see the carrying out of such activities. Responsibility for execution of
the rest of the project would lie with FIDCO.
55.       FIDCO organization and management, established in August 1978, has
a twelve-person board of directors. Its managing director and his deputy, who
previously directed FD, are fully capable of leading the newly-established
corporation.
56.       Beyond that, however, FIDCO requires considerable institutional
strengthening. While the training program would be designed to accomplish
this over the long run, engagement of qualified internationally-recruited
managers/advisers is required. In total, the services of ten such manager/
advisers for three to five years each are required. The ODM grant would
finance five; the CDC loan, one; and the Bank loan, four (planning engineer,



- 23 -
logging superintendent, workshop manager, sawmill manager). With the assist-
ance of these internationally-recruited manager/advisors, the company would
be capable of carrying out the project successfully. Assurances would be
obtained that the Government would issue work permits promptly for all
internationally-recruited personnel (Section 3.02, Loan Agreement).
57.       While a large number of internationally-recruited personnel is
necessary for the initial stages of project execution, the continued employ-
ment of most of them after an initial three- to five-year period would be
highly undesirable from a national development viewpoint. Consequently
FIDCO has nominated staff members to understudy internationally-recruited
manager/advisers or has begun to recruit Jamaican nationals for the under-
study positions which it cannot fill from its own staff. The Government
has authorized the transfer of the personnel needed for operations to FIDCO's
responsibility. They remain on the Government payroll; a condition of loan
effectiveness would be that they had been placed on FIDCO's payroll (Section
6.01, Loan Agreement). Assurances would be obtained that the Government
would provide for the accumulated pension rights of the transferred employees
(Section 3.06, Loan Agreement).
58.       Land Acquisition.  While FIDCO should have a two-year "land bank"
available for industrial plantations, it now has only an initial 2000-ha
block dedicated to its use by the government, and it does not have a definite
plan for land acquisition and forestry development. Agreement would be ob-
tained from the Government that all Crown lands in the project area (estimated
to be about 5,000 ha - 14,000 acres - including the 2,900 ha already assigned)
would be dedicated to FIDCO's exclusive use (Section 3.03, Loan Agreement).
A condition of loan effectiveness would be that FIDCO had obtained a long-
term leasehold interest in lands assigned to it (Section 6.01, Loan Agreement).
While FIDCO has begun making a plan of its land-acquisition, roadbuilding
and forest-establishment activities, completion of the plan must await the
internationally-recruited planning engineer's assumption of duties. A condi-
tion of disbursement for industrial plantations and roads would be the
presentation of a satisfactory plan to the Bank (Schedule 1, Loan Agreement).
59.       Even with the above actions, a major project risk would be that
land acquisition will fall behind schedule. Annual disbursements from the
proposed loan for industrial plantations, and road would be conditioned on
the cumulative land-acquisition targets for the end of the previous year
having been met (Schedule 1, Loan Agreement).
60.       Training Program.  Preparation of a training program (which would
include courses and on-the-job training by international experts in Jamaica
and professional and technical training for Jamaicans at institutions out-
side the country) would be the responsibility of the ODM-financed training
officers and their FD/FIDCO counterparts. Disbursements from the loan
account for this component would be conditioned to receipt of a satisfactory
training program (Schedule 1, Loan Agreement).
61.       Plan of Action.  The Government and FIDCO have recognized the need
to establish a plan of action for carrying out the project and have agreed
that presentation of such a plan would be a condition of loan effectiveness



- 24 -
(Section 6.01, Loan Agreement). Under the plan of action, they would con-
firm various arrangements that have been or will be made to ensure more
efficient performance in all aspects of FIDCO's operations.
F.   Production and Marketing
62.       FIDCO's annual production goals are summarized below:
Total
1979  1980  1981  1982  1983  1984  1979-1984
Sawlogs                  5.2   7.0  19.5  26.0  26.0  35.1    118.8
Smallwood                6.9   8.0  15.4  19.4  21.9  28.0         99.6
Sawnwood
Twickenham PaK         2.5   3.4   9.4  12.5  12.5  12.5        52.8
Buff Bay--    -   -                                     4.4      4.4
Total               2.5   3.4   9.4  12.5  12.5  16.9        57.2
63.       When both sawmills attain full output levels, combined sawnwood
output will be 25,000 m3 p.a., less than one quarter of Jamaica's sawnwood
consumption in 1975 and about 13% of consumption projected for 1990. Output
of privately-owned existing sawmills is not expected to exceed substantially
the levels attained in recent years, i.e., 23,000 m3 p.a. and it is there-
fore expected that all sawnwood production from the project sawmills can be
easily absorbed by the country.
64.       Rough estimates of annual fencepost demand in Jamaica have arrived
at a need of about 300,000 units p.a. Smallwood available from thinning
and clear-cutting operations would be roughly equal to these demands in the
first two years of the project execution period. Beginning in 1981 small-
wood would become available for other uses as would be established by a
market study. If FIDCO is unable to develop commercial outlets for small-
wood, its overall profitability will be negatively affected. Hence, FIDCO
would adopt the marketing orientatLon of a private-sector company, initially
by concluding a market study and then by establishing a marketing organiza-
tion to systematize its marketing effort.
G.   Financial Analysis
65.       Prior to the establishment of FIDCO, FD operated under conventional
governmental accounts. There was no breakdown of costs by purpose, and revenues
were not recorded at all. While this accounting may have been acceptable for
governmental purposes, it is not at all satisfactory for a commercial enter-
prise. To enable its management to control operations FIDCO would set up a
system of accounts which enable meaningful analysis of cost and revenue data
and would classify all financial data according to that system of accounts by
the end of 1979.



- 25  -
66.       While FIDCO was established in 1978, the Government did not complete
transfers of property, plant equipment, standing timber and land rights to
it until 1979. With these transfers completed, the company is now preparing
a fneaningful balance sheet.  FIDCO would furnish !-he Bank no later than
September 30, 1979 its audited balance sheet as of June 30, 1979 (Section
4.02, Project Agreement).
67.       A key value in any forest-company balance sheet is the value of
standing timber. To ensure that its financial statements reflect the com-
pany's real worth, revaluation of all assets, particularly standing timber,
should be done periodically. Assurances would be obtained from FIDCO (Section
3.05, Project Agreement) that it would revalue its assets according to the
following criteria:
(a) standing timber - annually, based on computed growth charac-
teristics and current world market prices for sawnwood and
other end-products expected to be derived from the standing
timber with a forest inventory no less frequently than every
five years to reassess the growth characteristic assumptions
used in the revaluation;
(b) other assets - at the end of any future fiscal year during
which general price levels as measured by an indicator
satisfactory to the Bank had increased 25% or more from
levels existing at the most recent previous revaluation
date.
68.       Further assurances would be sought from FIDCO that its financial
statements would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
and that such statements, along with auditors' reports, would be sent to
the Bank within four months of the end of FIDCO's fiscal year (Section 4.02,
Project Agreement).
69.       Forecast Financial Data.  FIDCO's summary sources and requirements
of funds for the project-execution period are shown below.
US$
Requirements of funds:
The project                                          25.3
Other financing requirements                          4.1
Total requiremnents                              29.4
Sources of funds:
Net internal cash generation                          3.0
Borrowings                                           22.4
Equity investment                                     4.0
Total sources                                    29.4



- 26 -
The above forecast, which shows that FIDCO will be able to provide only 10% of
its financing requirements from net internal cash generation, and other fore-
casted financial indicators for the project execution period are typical of a
forestry enterprise in its early stages, when the bulk of assets do not pro-
vide revenues.
70.       To ensure that local funding required to complete the project is
forthcoming, assurances would be obtained that the Government would provide
as an equity investment in FIDCO the funds (US$4 million equivalent) which
FIDCO needs through 1984, but cannot meet from its net internal cash genera-
tions (Section 3.01, Loan Agreement).
71.       While the above commitment would enable FIDCO to meet its total
financial requirements through the project execution period, the company's
internal cash generation would not be sufficient to meet its debt service
on both project loans from 1985 until at least 1989, when the Buff Bay saw-
mill would go into full operation. Assurances have been received from the
Government that it would provide sufficient funds as equity investments in
FIDCO to enable the company to meet the debt-service requirements of both
project loans from 1985 through 1998 (Section 3.01, Loan Agreement). While
"topping-up" cash infusions of this nature are not now foreseen to be
necessary after 1989, these assurances ensure that FIDCO will be in a
position to meet its obligations until 1999, when trees planted under the
program would be harvested.
72.       Even with these contributions, FIDCO's projected debt/equity ratio
at the end of the project period is as high (2:1) as it is prudent it should
be for an enterprise with a large proportion of illiquid assets. Assurances
would therefore be sought from FIDCO that it would not issue long-term debt
without Bank agreement if its debt/equity ratio exceeds 2:1 (Section 4.03,
Project Agreement).
73.       Assurances would be obtained from the Government that it would:
establish and maintain accounts to record the cost of project components for
which it is responsible; have such accounts audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank; and send them along with the auditor's report to the
Bank within four months of the end of its fiscal year (Section 3.04, Loan
Agreement).
H.   Economic Analysis
74.       The increased sawmill capacity provided by the project is expected to
result in a net foreign-exchange benefit of about J$6 million p.a., represent-
ing 85% of the incremental sawnwood value. In addition, the roundwood value
of the pine trees planted under the project would be more than J$100 million
at maturity. The project would provide employment of about 50 man-years p.a.
for unskilled road, harvest and sawmill labor. The project would also provide
employment of 4,500 man-years for unskilled labor for forestry establishment
during the project execution period. It is anticipated that a high level of
employment for forestry establishment will continue beyond the project period
as new forests are planted.



- 27 -
75.       The principal quantifiable benefits of the project are:  increased
sawnwood production from the rehabilitated Twickenham Park sawmill and the
new sawmill at Buff Bay; increased roundwood availability from investments
in roads and harvest/transport equipment; and mature trees from the industrial
plantation component. Using only the measurable benefits directly attribut-
able to the project, the economic rate of return of the project would be 17%.
Under a "worst-case" assumption--the economic rate of return would be 9%.
I.   Proiect Risks
76.       The project's main execution risk is that FIDCO will not be able
to acquire sufficient amounts of contiguous land quickly enough to plant and
log efficiently. Even if the industrial-plantation area is limited to little
besides Crown lands, however, sufficient roundwood supplies would be avail-
able to supply the two project sawmills on a continuous basis.
77.       The project's major operational risk is directly linked to its
fundamental institution-building purpose--the conversion of a governmental
department into a relatively efficient commercial undertaking at a time when
managerial talent is in extremely short supply. Without proper management,
productivity of the forest resource and efficient utilization of manpower
could easily decrease to levels where the project would be economically
marginal. The project design, particularly the inclusion of substantial
institution-strengthening, has taken this risk into account and has reduced
it to an acceptable level.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
78.       The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Bank and FIDCO and the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement
are being distributed separately. Special conditions of the loan are listed
in Annex III, Section III. Special conditions of effectiveness are: (a) execu-
tion by the Government and FIDCO of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement;
(b) conclusion by CDC and FIDCO of arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on
the CDC loan; (c) obtaining by FIDCO of a leasehold interest of at least 49
years in lands assigned to it; (d) placement on FIDCO's payroll of the personnel
necessary for commercial-forestry and forestry-industry operations; and (e)
confirmation by the Government and FIDCO that they would carry out the project
in accordance with the Plan of Action, including acceptance of the operational
and financial parameters as targets for monitoring project execution. Special
conditions of disbursement are: (a) a plan for land acquisition, road building
and forest establishment would be a condition of disbursement for industrial
plantations and roads; (b) annual disbursements for industrial plantations and
roads would be conditioned on the cumulative land acquisition targets for the
end of the previous year having been met; and (c) disburs'inents for training
would be conditioned to receipt of a satisfactory training program.



- 28 -
79.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
80.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   Projects in Execution
Ln. No. 727   Second Education Project; US$13.5 million of March 25, 1971;
Effective Date: July 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Project implementation is about three years behind appraisal
schedule due to a change in government, high turnover in project unit staff
and a lack of project implementation machinery. However, project implemen-
tation now seems satisfactory.
Ln. No. 899   Road Improvement and Maintenance Project; US$9.3 million of
June 1, 1973; Effective Date: August 31, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Increased costs have made it necessary to reduce by almost
50% the number of miles which were to be resurfaced. The loan has succeeded
in resurfacing 220 miles of road and resealing an additional 240 miles of
road, while making a substantial contribution toward improving the quality of
maintenance work and preserving the road network.
Ln. No. 1003 Sites and Services Project; US$15.0 million of June 13, 1974;
Effective Date: September 9, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Delays in the project have been caused by initial start-up
problems, political violence and ineffective management controls. The project
is about 18 months behind schedule and costs are running 50% more than anti-
cipated. The Government has adopted measures suggested by the Bank to improve
management systems and controls.

Ln. No. 1004 Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$5.5 million of
June 13, 1974; Effective Date: October 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The difficult general economic situation and unfavorable weather
conditions have had a negative impact on the Borrower (the Jamaica Development
Bank) and the project. As a result, arrears on principal and interest payments
have risen to unacceptable levels. The Jamaica Development Bank has initiated
an in-depth review of its loan portfolio, including the reappraisal and
rescheduling of loans and the strengthening of collection activities.
Ln. No. 1032 Third Highway Project; US$13.5 million of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: September 27, 1974; Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Construction has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions,
redesign of some sections, unsuccessful tenders and labor problems. Addi-
tional delays have been experienced because of the departure of qualified
personnel from the Ministry of Works and because of the lack of equipment and
equipment failures. Project implementation has been improving and the project
is now scheduled to be completed by mid-1980.
Ln. No. 1043  Airport Development Project; US$12.5 million of October 2, 1974;
Effective Date: March 14, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
All major contracts have now been awarded, but earlier delays
encountered during the design and award phase, mean that the project completion
date will slip from 12 to 18 months, and the project cost will probably exceed
appraisal estimates by about 10%. Though execution of work in progress has
been slower than expected, the Government's tight fiscal situation makes the
revised construction schedule more acceptable. The Airports Authority's
aggressive management has improved this institution's financial position in
spite of reduced traffic and high inflation. Nonetheless, the Authority will
be unable to supply its contribution to the project financing plan. The
shortfall will be made up by the Government with help from the Venezuelan
Investment Fund.
Ln. No. 1146 Kingston Sewerage and Water Supply Project; US$15 million of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: June 24, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
After some initial delays in establishing the project unit,
project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Construction has begun
on all of the subcomponents of the water supply construction program and been
completed on one of them.
Ln. No. 1284 Second Population Project; US$6.8 million of June 17, 1976;
Effective Date: August 30, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Civil works and procurement are on schedule and project costs are
within appraisal estimates. The project is proceeding satisfactorily.

Ln. No. 1464 Rural Development Project; US$15 million of June 29, 1977
Effective Date: October 14, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
After initial delays due to administrative problems, implemen-
tation has improved and fieldwork in all project components has been initiated.
Preparatory selection work of prospective settlers is progressing satisfac-
torily, but the physical settling of selected farmers has been constrained
by the lack of land survey services. Delays in implementation have caused
cost overruns in some project components.
Ln. No. 1516 Second Power Project; US$20 million of March 6, 1978;
Effective Date: June 1, 1978; Closing Date: September 30, 1982.
Delays of about 4 to 6 months have been experienced in the
initial steps of project execution, as well as with the selection of key
personnel. A slow-down in economic activity and a devaluation of the Jamaican
dollar have strained the borrower's finances. The Government has granted an
increase in tariffs to help ease the situation. The Project description has
been amended to incorporate the project component for rehabilitating existing
generating units and for purchase of spare parts. The new component will be
financed by a $3.3 million loan to Jamaica from the OPEC Special Fund made
under a loan agreement dated December 19, 1978. The Bank will act as the
administrator of the OPEC Special Fund loan.
Ln. No. 1517 Sugar Rehabilitation Project; US$18 million of March 6, 1978;
Effective Date: June 1, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project is proceeding on schedule.
Ln. No. 1609 Small Scale Enterprise Development Project; US$7 million of
August 2, 1978; Effective Date: December 29, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Implementation is proceeding as scheduled. The program has
received substantial support from the commercial banking system and other
financial intermediaries. The work on the proposed manufacturing sector
survey has been initiated. The commitment under Sub-Program I (modern small
scale enterprises - $4.5 million) will start by July 1979. The commitment
under Sub-Program II (very small scale enterprises - about $2.0 million) has
been delayed due to the organization problem faced by the Small Enterprises
Development Corporation (SEDCO), the implementing agency. However, appropriate
actions are being taken to strengthen SEDCO.
