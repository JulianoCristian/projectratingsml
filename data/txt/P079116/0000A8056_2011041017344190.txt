                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the Project is to create ecological and commercially sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in Montenegro coastal
                         municipalities, needed to maintain a clean, environmentally attractive coastal area. This will be achieved through: (i) developing the sector's institutional, policy
                         and regulatory framework; (ii) rehabilitating two current municipal disposal sites, that operate without sanitary conditions, to function as properly designed
                         regional sanitary landfills; (iii) closing current disposal sites in an environmentally acceptable manner; (iv) provision of modern collection equipment; (v)
                         initiating a pilot recycling campaign; and (vi) strengthening multi-municipal joint companies (MJC) that will be created to operate the two regional solid waste
                         disposal systems.

                         The IBRD loan (additional financing in the amount of Euro 4.5 million) to support design and construction of the landfill for the coastal areas of Bar and Ulcinj and needed equipment
                         for its operation, became effective on March 22, 2011. The project closing date was also extended to June 30, 2012. The contract for final design and construction of the landfill was

                         signed on December 24, 2011, immediately after the signing of the Loan Agreement which was held the previous day, and implementation was able to commence immediately since
                         the IDA funds were available. Construction of the landfill is expected to be completed by March 2012. So far implementation progress for the contract, which is in the final design
                         phase, is satisfactory. Implementation will however need to be monitored closely to avert any delays, particularly linked to obtaining required licenses prior to the construction phase.
                         The Implementation Progress (IP) rating has thus been maintained at Moderately Satisfactory (MS). Once implementation of the contract advances to the construction phase, the
                         rating will be further upgraded to Satisfactory. The project development objective is likely to be met and the rating remains Satisfactory. The results indicators remain the same as the
                         previous ISR since the new landfill has not been completed yet.
