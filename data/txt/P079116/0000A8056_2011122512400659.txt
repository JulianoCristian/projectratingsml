                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the Project is to create ecological and commercially sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in Montenegro coastal
                         municipalities, needed to maintain a clean, environmentally attractive coastal area. This will be achieved through: (i) developing the sector's institutional, policy
                         and regulatory framework; (ii) rehabilitating two current municipal disposal sites, that operate without sanitary conditions, to function as properly designed
                         regional sanitary landfills; (iii) closing current disposal sites in an environmentally acceptable manner; (iv) provision of modern collection equipment; (v)
                         initiating a pilot recycling campaign; and (vi) strengthening multi-municipal joint companies (MJC) that will be created to operate the two regional solid waste
                         disposal systems.

                         There has been substantial progress since the June 2011 implementation review. Implementation of key contracts, including the contract for construction works for the main landfill,
                         which had experienced initial delays, and procurement of equipment required for operating it, are advancing and are expected to be completed by the closing date in June 2012. The
                         Government has decided to utilize available funds remaining under the project for purchase of much needed waste collection (trucks) and storage equipment mainly for the
                         Municipality of Ulcinj.

Public Disclosure Copy




                         The Government has decided to finance critical waste collection and disposal equipment for coastal municipalities that need it most, especially Ulcinj, using available remaining funds
                         under the project in order to achieve the intended objective of improving waste collection and disposal at the coast. The Goods contracts for this equipment are the only contracts now
                         pending under the project.

                         There are no other major decisions concerning the project at this time.
