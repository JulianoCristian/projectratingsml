                         The main objective of the Project is to create ecological and commercially sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in Montenegro coastal
                         munici                                   palities, needed to maintain a clean, environmentally attractive coastal area. T                               his will be
                         achieved through: (i) developing the sector's institutional, policy                                  and regulatory framework; (ii) rehabilitating two current
                         municipal disposal si                                   tes, that operate without sanitary conditions, to function as properly designed
                         regional sanitary landfills; (iii) closing current disposal sites in an environ                                mentally acceptable manner; (iv) provision of modern
                         collection equipment; (v) initiating a pilot recycling campaign; and (vi) strengthening multi-municipal joint companies (MJC) that will be created to operate the
                         two regional solid waste disposal systems.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the project initially made steady progress towards its objective with respect to the Kotor, Budva and Tivat municipalities, in terms of improvements in the management of solid

                         wastes and reduction in environmental degradation through provision of waste collection trucks, equipment and containers, recycling equipment, construction of a landfill, and
                         establishment of a multi-municipal landfill management company that is working closely with the communal waste collection companies. Inspite of the landfill closing after four years,
                         the waste management system established is operating effectively, although wastes have to be transferred temporarily to a landfill in Podgorica. Implementation progress for the Bar
                         and Ulcinj municipalities has been slower due to delays in agreeing on acceptable siting, and later due to a financing gap for the regional sanitary landfill for those municipalities.
                         Government requested additional financing from the Bank to cover this gap, but it has not yet been approved.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. The Government of Montenegro and the Bank have not yet concluded negotiations for additional financing requested by the former to support completion of the new regional

                         sanitary landfill for Bar and Ulcinj. If concluded successfully and on time, the additional financing request would be presented to the Bank's Board for approval on December14, 2010.
                         If approved by the Board, the project would be restructured and the project closing date would be extended to June30, 2012 to allow for completion of the landfill.

                         2. If the above mentioned deadline is not met however, there will not be sufficient time to complete necessary processing requirements for the additional financing and the project will
                         be closed as currently scheduled for December 31, 2010.
