                         Implementation Status Overview
                           On December 20, 2010 the Bank approved additional financing in the amount of Euro 4.5 million to support completion of the regional sanitary landfill for Bar and Ulcinj. In addition
                         the project was restructured to extend the closing date to June 30, 2012 to allow for completion of outstanding activities. The loan agreement between the Bank and the Government
                         of Montenegro was signed on December 23, 2010. On December 24, 2010 the contract for final design and construction (Design and Build) of the landfill was signed. The

                         construction of the landfill is expected to be completed by March 2012. Now that the previously pending issue regarding the financing gap for the landfill has been resolved
                         implementation progress is likely to proceed steadily over the coming months and disbursements are expected to pick up. The Implementation Progress rating has therefore been

                         upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory. Once implementation of the contract advances further and the landfill construction phase commences the rating will be further upgraded to
                         Satisfactory. The project development objective is likely to be met and the rating has been upgraded from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory.

                         Since this ISR update is not based on an implementation review mission, the results indicators have not been updated since the last mission in October 2010.
