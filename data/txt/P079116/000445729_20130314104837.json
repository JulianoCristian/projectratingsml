Some lessons learned includes: an\n            effective combination of government commitment, investments,\n            and public participation can achieve real improvements in\n            solid waste services. A related lesson is that this same\n            combination can catalyze fundamental reforms in the solid\n            waste sector, but these changes take time to be effective\n            and cannot be expected to happen overnight. Financial\n            sustainability in solid waste management is incomplete if\n            cost recovery from primary waste generators is not\n            addressed. Local opposition to siting landfills can be a\n            serious stumbling block to project implementation, resulting\n            in lengthy delays and potential project failure. Since\n            landfill projects are inherently risky from a non-technical\n            standpoint, a multi-municipality and multi-site approach can\n            help mitigate these non-technical risks."}, "docdt": "2013-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
