         sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in\n            Montenegro coastal municipalities, needed to maintain a\n            clean, environmentally attractive coastal area. The\n            Government additionally requested that the project be\n            restructured to drop outstanding activities under project\n            component two (environmental rehabilitation) in order to\n            fully leverage available bank resources for the sanitary\n            landfill. The dropped activities will comprise the closing\n            of two remaining uncontrolled and unsanitary waste disposal\n            sites in Bar and Ulcinj, which will now be financed through\n            a recently approved European Investment Bank (EIB) funded\n            solid waste management program being implemented in\n            parallel. World Bank funding for the dropped activities will\n            be reallocated to component one to complete the landfill.\n            This change entails a restructuring of the original credit.\n            The additional financing will finance the design and\n            construction of a regional sanitary landfill to serve the\n            municipalities of Bar and Ulcinj and the provision of\n            equipment for the operation of the regional sanitary landfill."}, "docdt": "2010-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
