The project has\n            made progress towards meeting its development objectives and\n            is likely to achieve them if implementation is completed as\n            planned, however overall implementation has been slower than\n            originally envisaged. Initially the project made steady\n            progress with respect to activities in the northern coastal\n            Municipalities of Kotor, Budva and Tivat, resulting in\n            improved solid waste disposal and environmental conditions\n            in this area. The extension has been requested by the\n            Government of Montenegro by a letter dated July 30, 2010, in\n            order to allow for conclusion of the negotiations between\n            the Bank and the Government for the additional financing\n            (AF) and for its presentation to the Bank's Board of\n            Directors for approval. This will be the third extension of\n            the project closing date. Although the project paper for the\n            AF an extension of the closing date to June 30, 2012, the\n            three month extension is intended as an interim measure to\n            allow for the negotiations to be concluded and the AF to be\n            presented to the Board, and once it is approved the\n            intention is that the closing date will be further extended\n            to June 30, 2012 as part of the restructuring linked to the AF."}, "docdt": "2010-08-09T00:00:00Z"}
