7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The main objective of the Project is to create ecological and commercially sustainable solid waste 
collection and disposal services in Montenegro coastal municipalities, needed to maintain a clean, 
environmentally attractive coastal area. This will be achieved through: (i) developing the sector's 
institutional, policy and regulatory framework;  (ii) rehabilitating two current municipal disposal sites, that 
operate without sanitary conditions, to function as properly designed regional sanitary landfills;  (iii) 
closing current disposal sites in an environmentally acceptable manner;  (iv) provision of modern collection 
equipment;  (v) initiating a pilot recycling campaign;  and (vi) strengthening multi-municipal joint 
companies (MJC) that will be created to operate the two regional solid waste disposal systems.
