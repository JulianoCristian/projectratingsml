                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the Project is to create ecological and commercially sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in Montenegro coastal municipalities,
                         needed to maintain a clean, environmentally attractive coastal area. This will be achieved through: (i) developing the sector's institutional, policy and regulatory
                         framework; (ii) rehabilitating two current municipal disposal sites, that operate without sanitary conditions, to function as properly designed regional sanitary landfills;
                         (iii) closing current disposal sites in an environmentally acceptable manner; (iv) provision of modern collection equipment; (v) initiating a pilot recycling campaign; and
                         (vi) strengthening multi-municipal joint companies (MJC) that will be created to operate the two regional solid waste disposal systems.
