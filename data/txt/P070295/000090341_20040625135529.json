project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The main lesson of this project is that the\n            Bank can play a productive role in providing support in\n            urgent operations dealing with post-conflict situations,\n            provided there is a pragmatic approach to the issues at\n            hand. The success of the Kosovo Urgent Road Project can be\n            explained by: (i) the simplicity of the project, which\n            focused on the indispensable capacity needed in the public\n            and private sectors to keep the operability of the road\n            network; and (ii) the willingness of the Bank to adapt the\n            requirements of project preparation to the urgency of the\n            project, accepting the trade-offs between short lead-times\n            and limited data gathering and background studies. This was\n            done with the knowledge that the recommended actions would\n            not be substantially changed if there would have been time\n            for extensive preparation. The project highlights the\n            importance of the long term efforts necessary to achieve\n            lasting improvements in institutional performance, the more\n            so when those improvements are not limited to technical\n            know-how but involve a profound revision of cultural mores."}, "docdt": "2004-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
