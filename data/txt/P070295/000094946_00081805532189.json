The three main\n            components will: 1) provide funding for road maintenance, on\n            those sections of the main network not requiring\n            rehabilitation, but in need of maintenance to remain\n            serviceable. Maintenance works will cover approximately\n            1,500 km of the main network, and will include treatment of\n            potholes, surface dressing, cleaning of drainage systems,\n            and road signaling, to restore traffic safety; 2) perform\n            road rehabilitation activities, on approximately 150 km of\n            the main network, and will include restoration of\n            culverts/drainage systems, overlays. Only a selective\n            emergency reconstruction will be performed, on those\n            sections almost destructed, given the scarce availability of\n            funds. Overlay works will be performed on a high priority\n            stretch of the Pristina-Gnjilane road; and, 3) support the\n            re-establishment of a core road management capacity in\n            Kosovo, providing technical assistance to the Directorate of\n            Roads, in road maintenance, capacity building, and project implementation."}, "docdt": "2000-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
