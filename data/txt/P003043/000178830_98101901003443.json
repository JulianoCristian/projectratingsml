Rehabilitation Project seeks to rehabilitate the deep-water\n            port at Matadi and the river port at Kinshasa, and includes:\n            civil works for the reconstruction or construction of quays\n            and related facilities and service systems; procurement of\n            cargo handling and fire-fighting equipment, and replacement\n            of ONATRA's main computer; and the provision of\n            consulting services for supervision of civil works,\n            technical assistance, training and studies. The main benefit\n            of the project will be to arrest the deterioration of the\n            facilities and improve the productivity of the two ports\n            which handle the bulk of Zaire's international trade\n            and, in the case of Kinshasa, a major portion on national\n            trade as well."}, "docdt": "1983-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
