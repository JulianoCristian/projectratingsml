                       Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Zaire                            --  Onatra
       Modernization Project (Credit 1180-ZR) and Matadi-Kinshasa Ports Rehabilitation
       Project (Credit 1335-ZR), prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The Borrower
       did not submit Part 11.

                       Credit 1180 (SDR 22.6 million, approved March 10, 1982) was closed
       on March 31, 1990 (four years behind schedule), and SDR 2.35 million were
       cancelled. Credit 1335 (SDR 23.1 million, approved April 18, 1983) was closed
       on December 31, 1990 (three years behind schedule), and was fully disbursed.

                       The two projects continued earlier efforts to prevent further
       deterioration of the capacity and efficiency of the "Voie Nationale", a
       combination of rail (1575 km), river (800 Ian) and rail (365 km) transport between
       mineral-producing Shaba Province and the port of Matadi. Accordingly, the two
       projects were rehabilitation and maintenance operations'primarily and had some
       training and technical assistance components.

                       The PCR, a model of thoroughness and candor, suggests that both
       projects were conceived on the basis of two assumptions. First, that operation
       of the "Voie Nationale" could be made more efficient by ONATRA (a parastatal with
       a troubled history).           Second, that socioeconomic conditions would improve and
       generate traffic volumes sufficient to justify investments undertaken under the
       two projects. Events proved that both assumptions were unfounded. As time went
       on, the socioeconomic fabric unravelled, and the executing agency suffered from
       decreasing autonomy, instability of management, and lack of any commercial
       spirit. Thus, investments have beenmade but financial performance has been poor
       and net results negative.               Both projects are rated as unsatisfactory, the
       sustainability of their benefits as unlikely, and their institutional impact as
       negligible.

                       No audit is planned.




                                                                                                                 I

                                  EVALUATION SUMMARY



1.      The objectives (para 3.01 and 3.02) of the ONATRA Modernization Project were to
prevent further deteriorationof the capability and operational efficiency of ONATRA's river and
rail transport.  The objectives of the Matadi-Kinshasa Ports Rehabilitation Project were to
rehabilitate and modernize structures which had suffered from inadequate maintenance and had
to adjust to container traffic. Both projects continued earlier efforts to upgrade transport services
on the Voie Nutionole, the main transport axis of the auntry and the only evacuation route for
mineral exports entirely within the country.


                                 2. Implementation Experience

2.      The physical implementationof the projects was satisfactory, despite delays due to slow
decisions on procurement and some design problems, especially with respect to civil works and
computer equipment (paras 5.03 and 5.04).          Apart from the delays, there were no major
procurement problems. While the cost of the ONATRA Modernization project was 5% over
estimates, the cost of the Poa project was 28% below. There were some modifications to the
original projects (para 5.10) but they may be considered routine for this type of project.


                                            3. Results

3.      The trafficprojections, to which the projectswere geared, did not materialize, mainly due
to the deteriorating economic situation in Zaire, and to the diversion of traffic to more efficient
operatorsthan ONATRA (para 6.03). While there were some improvementsin productivity, the
objectives set were not reached (paras 6.04 to 6.06). Management performance was good at the
beginning of project execution (1981-1985), deteriorated in 1985-1986 following the departure
of an able expatriate General Manager and rapid Zairianization, then improved again with the
appointmentof a new Zairian General Manager in 1987. However, staff motivationdeteriorated
and Sovernment interference became pervasive (paras. 6.07 and 6.08). Still, there were some
improvements in internal control at ONATRA, and a sigdcant reduction of overstaffing (16%
decline).

4.      The projects yielded ecommic rates of return of about 6 and 13% respectively, against
appraisal estimates of 34 and 29% (paras 6.10 and 6.11)- Because of high inflation, delayed
adjustments of tariffs, inad4uate productivity and insufficient traffic, the financial performance
has been poor and net rsults negative. The large accumulations of cash forecasted at appraisal
did not materialize @aras6.12 to 6.15).

5.      The physical elements of the project are sustainable. To remain sustainable, there must
be continuousefforts to improvemanagement and major organizaticnalchanges in the executing
agency, which is too large and whose missions are too diverse for it to be able to perform
properly (paras 7.01 and 7.02, and 9.03).

6.      Operating the Voie Nan'onuZe, a high cost 2800 km multi-modal chain of transport, is a
major task which can be efficientand profitableonly in a good economic environment. Thedeep
deteriorationof economic conditionsin Zaire over the past two years raises seriousdoubts about
the economic viability of exporting minerals from Shaba to the sea via this route in the future as
well as the economicjustification for investment in the route in the past.


                                 5. Conclusions and Lessons

7.       The projects rested on two basic assumptions: i) the Voie N&onale would be given
priority in the system of transport in Zaire; and ii) ONATRA would remain a multipurpose
parastatal agency, under close Government control, performing on for", account missions as
diverse as operating a railway and a river fleet, handling cargo at ports, managing a shipyard,
etc. However, the agency's mediocre performance d e r eatlier projects could have been taken
more seriously into account in the design of the two projects under review. The assumptions
upon which the credits were granted (autonomy of executing agency, stability of management,
commercial approach, etc) became increasingly irrelevant as project execution proceeded, and
it seemed that each supervision mission had to renegotiate, starting from afait accoqli of the
borrower. New attempts at transportproject lending in Zaire should onlybe considered after the
Government adopts a revised overall transport strategy for the country, in particular, allowing
ONATRA's activities to be laid out by several private-sector entities who can enjoy the required
management autonomy. The poor operational and linancial results obtained after so much effort
and investment calls for a stricter approach.       Channeling resources into an unfriendly
environment provides only the illusion of development, while preserving uneconomical and
unmanageable systems.

8.      These projects included, as is increasingly witnessed in transport projects, major items
related to information management systems and to computerization. But these items were not
seriously appraised before lending and caused delays and conflict during execution (para 9.04).

9.      Project documentation needs to be improved. Part III of the PCR provides an excellent
format which should be followedfrom the startof the project and updated after each supervision
mission. There is a special need to regularly update all project costs, whether they are financed
by the Bank Group or from other sources, includingthe executingagency. A better filing system
for project correspondence and documents is also needed (para 12.01).

A.      Sectoral Context

2.01    Zaire is the third largestcountry (2.4 millionsq. km) in Africa with a populationof about
35 million people. The largest part of the mining industry (copper, zinc, cobalt) is located in the
Shaba region, 2800 km from Matadi, Zaire's main port on the Atlantic Ocean, which can be
reached by oceangoing vessels. The main link of transportation between the Shaba and the port
of Matadi is the Voie NufionuZe (VN). The VN is a chain of rail transport (1575 km) from Tenke
in Shaba to llebo on the Kasai river (a tributary to the Zaire river), then of river transport (800
km)from llebo to Kinshasa, and finallyof rail to Matadi (365km)(hlap PBRD 16564R2). There
is no passable domesticroad alternative. The VN is the onlyevacuationroute for mineral exports
entirely within the country. Other routes includethe Lobito railway via Angola, which has been
closed to traffic since 1976, and routes via Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa.                 The
Government has always considered the rehabilitation and maintenance of the Voie Nutionale a
national priority because i) it is free of possible restrictionsor interruptions caused by capacity
constraints on the foreign routes or by external actions, such as the closure of the Angola route
in 1976; ii) it is an essential link to preserve national unity; and iii) it is less costly in direct
foreign exchange than the foreign routes. In that respect, however, the difference is highly
dependent on the availability of foreign exchange in Zaire.         IDA has supported the above
government policy since independence in 1960, and participated in the rehabilitation and
extension of the transport system with two IDA creditsfor railways and rivers projects, followed
by the two projects reviewed herein (see Part III, Table 1). Financing was provided for
rehabilitation of track, procurement of wagons, locomotives and workshop equipment for the
Matadi-Kinshasa railway, river craft, cargo handling equipment, improvement of navigation on
rivers, and the provision of technical assistance and training.

2.02    General Transporton the VN has been dominatedby two large state-owned companies,
the Office National des Transport (ONATRA) and the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Zairois (SNCZ). ONATRA operates a river transport fleet,three seaports includingMatadi, the
river ports includingKinshasa, shipyards inKinshasaand Boma, and theMatadi-Kinshasarailway
(CFMK). The SNCZ ownsthe ONATRA operated railway line. In 1979, the Railway I Project
(Credit 902-ZR) was launched, and dealt with the rehabilitationof SNCZ and with the railway
line from Shaba to Ilebo; it was followed by Railways I1 (Credit 1475-ZR) in 1984, with a
similar scope 1'.  IDA therefore dealt in parallel with ONATRA and SNCZ, at both ends of the
VN, and the operationsherein reviewed are part of a long series of successive projects, which
have been extended under the First Transport RehabilitationProject (Cr 2027-ZR approved in
1989). Though SNCZ owns the line leased to ONATRA, it has not been involved in the
ONATRA Modernization and Ports Rehabilitation Projects.

2.03    ONATRA Established as a parastatal company in 1971, ONATRA took over most of
the responsibilities of its preceding organization dating back to 19353. As a utility parastatal,
ONATRA is, by law, required to be financiallyself-sufficient, without making profits. When the
Modernization Project was approved in 1981, ONATRA was one of the largest organizations in
Zaire, with about 20,000 staff (down from 27,000in 1975). Many of the management, technical
and finance positions, including that of Chairman of the Board of Directors and President
(President Ddegue General, PDG) were filled by expatriates (300 in 1970), mainly Belgian.
ONATRA's financesand accountingwere poor until 1977. A rehabilitationplan initiatedin 1977
with the appointment of a competent and energetic expatriate, rescued ONATRA from an
impendingfinancial disaster. ONATRAthen had surpluses from 1977to 1979,but depreciation
policies were modified in 1980 (assets now valued at replacement cost), which made deficits
apparent thereafter. Productivity (cargo handling, equipment availability, etc) was uneven,
largely due to over-aged equipment.

C.      Linkaees between Proiects', Sector and Macro Policv Obiectiveq

2.04    The ONATRA Modernization Project was prepared from 1977to 1981in a deteriorating
economic climate. The Zairian economy has been in a downswing since 1975, following heavy
borrowingfor projectswith longgestationperiods anduncertaineconomicbenefits, and following
the fall in the international prices of copper, the most important source of export earnings.
Improving transport conditions on the VN was seen as a crucial element in making copper from
Shaba more competitive on foreign markets. However, IDA and the Government differed on
sector policies. IDA insisted on improving the capacity and efficiency of all transport links
within the VN. It was concerned by ONATRA's continued poor management, despitesubstantial
external assistance, while the Government was more concerned with the promotion of a number
of large projects, such as a deep sea port at Banana, the mouth of the Zaire river, an electrified

rail linkbetween Banana and Matadi (100 km),the electrification of the Matadi-Kinshasarailway
line, and construction of the Kinshasa-llebo railway line (650 h).     These projects would have
completed the rail link from Shaba to the sea along the VN, but they had no economic
justification. They were beyond the realm of possibility in the existing economic climate and
given the financial strain of the early 1980s. As will be seen below, this had an impact on
project preparation (para 4.01) and on project execution, since the dialogue on these issues and
the review of successive technical and economic studies absorbed an inordinateamount of staff
time.

2.05     Other linkages existed within the sector. One was the linkage between ONATRA and
RVF, the agency responsible for the maintenance of navigation services on the river network.
The failure of the latter to maintain navigational aids on the river system had adverse effects on
ONATRA's river transport operations. The Mayumbe railway line, a 40 km narrow gauge line
between Boma and Tschela, operated by ONATRA, also became an issue. Its traffic had
declined ftom 200,000 t to some 20,000 t in two decades. The construction of a road parallel
to the railway made the line obsoleteand costly to operate and called for its closure. The above
linkages were reflected in credit conditionality. The reorganidon of RVF, the appointment of
senior managers at the organization's helm, acceptable to the Association and the closure of the
Mayumbe line, were stipulatedin the CreditAgreement forthe ONATRA ModernizationProject.


2.06     By the time of preparation of the Matadi-Kinshasa Ports Rehabilitation Project (1981-
1983), Zaire's economic situation had further deteriorated. However, a Public Investment
Program (PIP) was in place and ensured that projects proposed for financing were in accordance
with the macro objectives of economic rehabilitation. The vast projects mentioned above were
no longer an issue. The planning unit in the Ministry of Transport (Groupe d'Etudes, Economie
et Planification (GEEP)), established with IDA'S support, was now responsiblefor planning and
policy analysis in the transport sector. The Government wanted to ensure that transport
deficiencies would not hamper economic recovery. IDA supported that aim, but again insisted
that new investment in the sector focus on increasing output by optimizing the use of existing
resources and by r&abilitating facilities.


                             3. Project Objectives and Description




3.01     (a) The main objectiveof the ONATRA ModernizationProject was to prevent further
deteriorationof the capability and operational efficiency of ONATRAby i) replacing a substantial
part of ONATRA's old, badly deterioratedand obsoleteriver equipment; ii) continuingaprogram
of railway rehabilitation initiated under Cr 571-ZR; iii) increasing railway rolling stock for
handling log and container trafFic that were growing quite rapidly; iv) improving operations at
the river-rail transhipment point of Ilebo, a bottleneck in the transport chain on the VN; and v)
strengthening ONATRA through training and technical assistance.

         (b) The main objective of the Matadi-Kiashasa Ports Rehabilitation Project was to
complement past Government efforts to upgrade transport services on the VN, by                  i)
rehabilitating ports infrastructures that had not been properly maintained for many years and
which needed to be modernized to accommodate increasing container traffic; ii) addressing

ONATRA's technical assistance and training needs; and iii) providing studies on infrastructure
operations by other agencies and on the future development of transport by the private sector.

3.02    Project objectivesreflectedIDA and Government concernsthat the effortof rehabilitation
would extend all alongthe VN: SNCZ in Shaba and between Shaba and Ilebo (railways projects
in execution or planned) on one side, ONATRA lx4wee.nIlebo and the sea (theprojects reviewed
here) on the other.       The earlier (1975) Rail/River Transport Project (Cr 571-ZR) for
rehabilitation of the river and Kinshasa-Matadi railway included an understanding that the
southernnetworkof SNCZ (Shaba to Ilebo) would operate efficiently and move the Shabatraffic
satisfactorily to the river. The objectives were formulated in terms of physical execution and of
productivity. Financial indicators,were to measure the success or failure of the projects at end
of execution.

e)      Technical assistance: high level technical assistance management and finance.



3.04    The project was part of ONATRA's 5-year rolling plan and included the following
components, for a total of US$90 million:

a)      Matadi: i) reconstructionof 400 m and rehabilitationof 500m of quays; ii)rehabilitation
        of water and electricity distribution systems; iii) resurfacing and track relaying; iv)

        stock;

b)      Kinshasa: i) repairs to 300 m of quay; ii) construction of tug berths and of 200 m of
        container quays (300 m optional according to bids received); iii) track laying and
        relaying; iv) rehabilitationof utilities; v) procurement of one container gantry crane, one
        log handling crane and different rolling stock and cargo handling equipment;

        In addition, the project included consulting services to the Government to carry out
studies on RVM and RVF operationsand on the growth of the private sector in transport.


                               4. Project Design and Oqgmhtioo



                                 . .
4.01    The ONATRA M o d e m o n Prow was originallydeveloped by ONATRA in the late
1970s. A major feature of the proposed project was the development of a container capability.
The government entrusted early studiesto an ageaq called Organismionpow I 'Equipententde
Banana-Kinshasa(OEBK),with theobjectiveof developing an all-raillinkfrom Shabato Banana
(para 2.04). This encouraged ONATRA to prepare an ambitious development program and
delayed project preparation by consultants. ONATRA's five-year plan, to be inserted into the
national plan, was not supported by an adequate economic analysis. It assumed, optimistically,
that plans and programs in other sectors (especially the mining sector) would be developed
without any changes or delays. IDA'S approachwas more cautious. Rather than counting on a
massive increase in ONATRA's traffic, it designed theproject as follows: i) only first priorities
should be project items ii) investments should reflect reliable statistics of the traffic, transport
markets and ONATRA's market share; and iii) capacity increases should be obtained through
improvement in operatingefficiency rather thanthroughadditionaiinvestments. As a result, most
project items were centered around replacement and modernization. At preappraisal (September
1980), US$125 million in investments were identified, to be financedby IDA and cofinanciers.
This amount was reduced to US$75 million at appraisal, of which US26 million was to be
financed by IDA.

4.02    The economic evaluation was based on a traffic growth of 5 to 6%from 1980to 1990.
There were signsthat the several-year declinein economicconditions in Zaire had been reversed
and it was considered that the insufficient transport capacity was a major constraint to traffic
growth on the VN. ONATRA was seen to be in a strongposition vis a vis private road and river
transport, where only minor operators provided competitive services. Mineral traffic was
projected to grow from 250,000t in 1980to a plateau of 350,000 in 1985(50%of traffic). The
assumptions were as follows: i) the Lobito route would reopen in 1985 and absorb sizeable
tonnages, to the detriment of the South Africa route, without an impact on the VN; ii) log traffic
(40,000 t in 1980) would reach 150,000 t in 1990; and iii) container traffic (160,000t in 1979)
would reach 500,000 t between 1984and 1990. Economic benefits would derive from i) faster
trains and less derailments; ii) developmentof rail transport for logs, at lower cost than by road;
iii) higher productivity and lower costs of new pusher tugs; iv) continuing operations of the
shipyard; and v) higher productivity of trained staff. The economic return was computed only
on those physical items which lent themselves to such a computation (8096 of project costs). It
was estimated at 34% (18% for railways track, 29% for wagons, 40%for tugs and barges).

4.03    Thefinanciale v a l mrecordedthepositiveresultsof ONATRA's financialmanagement
in the recent past: assets had been revalued, thus broadening the equitybase; operatingexpenses
had been kept to a minimum; there had been an attrition of excess staff; procedures for tariff

adjustments had been simplified; and cash management and receivables policies had markedly
improved. The accumulationof substantial cash balances (an equivalent of US218 miilion for
the period of 1981-1985) in local currency was projected, with favorable financial ratios for the
entireproject period. Theappraisal report, however, included qualificationsregarding i)the rates
of inflation (8% annually) and the devaluation of the zaire; ii) continued availability of foreign
exchange to ONATRA; and iii) tariff adjustments. These were fundamental variables. The
tentative financial rate of return for the project was 30%. ONATRA's rate of return on fixed
assets would be about 4% by the end of the project.

4.04    Basically, theproject was designed in a traditionalmanner, using optimistic assumptions.
Neither the existence, nor the structure, nor the role of ONATRA were questioned. Basic
Government assumptions regarding the distributionof traffic between routes were accepted. It
was assumed that ONATRA's management, which had markedly improved after a long period
of crisis, following the appointment of an expatriate chief executive and with the support of a
large number of expatriates, would continue its good performance. ONATRA's operational
performance was known to have been poor, but it was considered that sizeablenew investments
would be a sufficientconditionfor improvement. Thisview, however, is not fully supportedby
an ex post review of project correspondenceduring project preparation: the systematicpilferage
of cargo in ports and en route on the river which some documents mention, as well as the poor
motivationof ONATRA's staff reported by users, for example, had little to do with shortageof
equipment in the agency.

4.05    The following issues regarding project design were raised at different stages of report
writing and especially during the Yellow Cover stage (August 1981):

        (a)      Planning The Government investment plan included the electrification of the
Matadi-Kinshasa railway line, at an estimated cost of US$ 50 million equivalent. It was
commented in the Bank, that absence of objection could be construed as implicit support to a
questionableinvestment. The line was eventuaily not electrified and the issuebecame moot. A
clause on exchange of views between IDA and ONATRA on studies (to be satisfactory to IDA)
for proposed investments and on financingplans for such investmentswas inserted in the Project
Agreement .

         (b)     Voie Nationale A systematicuse of the VN was not necessarily in Zaire's best
interest. A more detailed OriginIDestinationtraffic matrix shouldhave been prepared to identify
the least cost route. The extra cost of any Governmentaldecisionto move traffic other than by
such a route should have been assessed (para. 6.02).

         (c)                                       ONATRA's traffic had declined steadily from
1974to 1980: a 28% decrease for the CFMK Railway; 34% for river transport; 20% for port
traffic at Matadi; 16% for port traffic in Kinshasa, and a 64%decline in rail passengers. In
1974, ONATRA's total traffic had been 4.5 million tons (2.5 for river transport and 2.0 for
railways), it was reduced to a mere 2.0 million tons by 1982. Yet, the project was based on
projections of strong annual growth ram, taking into account expected increases in mineral
production and Governmentcommitment to the VN. Similar arguments, it was noted, had been
used to justify the 1974forecasts for the appraisal of the RailiRiver project (Cr 571-ZR).

         (d)     Finan= Doubts were raised aboutthe probability of the Governmentapproving
tariffs which would result in massive cash m u l a t i o n for ONATRA.

                    . .
4.06     The m-Km&jwPorts R                              v origmated in part from a study of the
VN completed in 1972, followed by detailed engineering comple4ed in 1981.2' The study
recommeoded rehabilitationand redevelopment of the Matadi and Kinshasa ports, which were
part of ONATRA's new 20-year plan (1980-1990) seteinglong-term goals and strategies, and in
its five-year operational rolling plan (1980-85). The project was essentially designed to
rehabilitate infrastructurethat had not been maintained at acceptable standards for many years,
and to accommodate the rapidly increasing amount of container traffic, which was making old
facilitiesobsolete. At appraisal (March 1982), costswere estimated at USS90 millionequivalent,
of which 25 million were to be financed by IDA.

4.07     Project design stressed the importance of sound management at ONATRA. After the
decision meeting (May 1982), IDA informed the Government of its concern regarding
ONATRA's senior management, its autonomy as a parastatal, as well as the inadequate copper
transport tariffs applicable to GECAMINES, which is 100%Government owned.

4.08     Theproject appraisalreportwas issued 17monthsafterONATRATsRehabilitationProject
Appraisal report. This second project also depended on optimistic traffic projections of 5% to
6 2 annually, increaseduse of the VN for trade to and from Shaba, and an increase in container
traffic from 14%of total traffic in 1980to 40%in 1990 (18,000 containers). This high growth
rate was considered reasonable even though the economy was expected to remain stagnant and
previous trafficprojections had not materialized. Increases in railway traffic had been 6%less
than projected and port traffic had stagnated. The long term decline in the rate of growth of
ONATRATstraffic was in fact continuing. However, the new project was expected to reverse
this trend. The projectdesign (and project correspondenceduringthe appraisal stage),however,
reflected IDA'S concern about the deteriorationof the situation in Zaire. They also reflected an
increased knowledge of ONATRA's problems. These problems were identified as: i) low
efficiency, poor commercial policy, inadequate reliability of services and safety of wgo; ii)
increasing competition by better equipped and better organized private river carriers; and iii)
ONATRA's subsidizing of the copper trade (30% of its traffic and 10% of its revenue) by
transporting it at rates 75% below cost; this forced the agency to increase its tariffs on other
commodities and reduced its competitiveness.

4.9      The latter point is especially important.    The appraisal report for the ONATIL4
Rehabilitation Project had mentioned earlier that copper tariffs on the VN were set by direct
negotiations with GECAMINES "taking into consideration tariffs charged on alternative
internationaltransport routes" (Report 3313-ZR at 5.04, p. 43). 'Ihe report still considered the
VN the most economical route open to Zaire importlexport traffic. But the need to subsidize
GECAMINES for as much as 75% of the transport cost (not includingsubsidizationby SNCZ
at the other end of the system) should have raised serious doubts on this point.         As for
GECAMINES, the report considered that it was up to ONATRA to reduce its costs so that its

tariffs could be both competitiveandprofitable. During the internalreview process the need for
a more comprehensiveanalysis of alternativeroutes for Zaire's rnin~alexports and for greater
details on the assumptionsand reasons behind the forecast of greater VN traffic was mentioned
again.

4.10     The economic rate of return was computed only on those physical elements which lent
themselves to such a computation (85% of total cost). It was estimated at 50% for Matadi and
25% for Kinshasa, with a minimum of 16%and 30%respectively in a minimum case scenario.
The financial rate of return on the project was 22% and ONATRA's return on fixed assets was
estimated to be 0.4% at the end of project execution.

4.11     Conclusionon ~roiectdesign In retrospect, the design of both projects was based on
unrealistic assumptions. IDA should have questioned the validity of two basic government
proposals, namely that the VN should be given priority and that ONATRA should be maintained
in its present form as a large parastatal operating different transport modes 4/.                                                  Also, the
ONATRA Modernization Project (1180-ZR) did not include the procurement of diesel
locomotives, which were rapidly missed.                            The procurement of two such locomotives was
introduced at a later stage, to be financed by IDA from savings on other items. This, in turn,
was canceled when a bilateral donor financed seven new locomotives. This issue was not
consideredatthebeginningbecauseONATRAand theGovernmenthad planned the electrification
of the CFMK, which would have made the diesel locomotivesobsolete. When this electrification
did not take place, the shortageof locomotives became acute.

4.12     As will be seen, the perfonnance of both projects was affected by overall negative
developments in the Zairian economy and by inadequateproject design. In particular, two main
assumptions are surprising. First, traffic projections should have been more conservative,
especially for the second project, given past perfonnance in the sector. Second, the discrepancy
between the high financial rates of return for the project and the low overall rate of return on
fixed assets should have indicated that a large part of ONATRA's assets were not producing
revenue. This last point seems not to have been noted by the projects' reviewers Sl and should

A.       Credit Effectiveness ONATRA M o h u a t m
                               -                       . .

5.01     The Credit was negotiatedin July 1981and approved in October 1981. Negotiations for
Credit 1180-ZR were delayed by the need to arrange for cofinancing. The final financing plan
for a total of USS56 million equivalent of foreign exchange was: IDA USS26 million; African
Development Bank (AfDB), USS12 million; Coisse Centrrrle de Gw~rationEconomique
(France) (CCCE), USS10 million; Kreditanstalt fiir W i d e a u 0, The       USS8 million.
Credit was signed on March 10, 1982, nine months after Board approval because of a shortage
of IDA funds. It became effective on June 6, 1982. One condition of credit effectiveness was
that the loan agreements with the other cofinanciersbe signed. In fact, someof these agreements
became effective more than two years after the IDA credit. ONATRA's senior management,
excellent at that time, deployed great effort to speed up effectiveness. They started early on
procurement, which permitted them to start bidding immediately after effectiveness.

5.02     Credit 1335-ZRwas negotiatedin February, approved by theBoard in March and signed
in April 1983. Conditionsfor negotiationsreflectedIDA'S increased concerns with the transport
situation in Zaire, mainly: i) regulations should be changed so as to ensure adequate autonomy
for ONATRA, regarding procurement, payments, control of its assets, etc; ii) government
agencies shouldpay their arrearsto ONATRA; and iii) RVF, whose poor performance hampered
ONATRA's operations should be reorganized. The adjustment of mineral transport tariffs to
cover at least variable costs of suchtransport was a major condition for Board presentation. The
credit became effective five months after signature, which did not delay project execution, since
procurement started early. The final financing plan for a total of USS52 million equivalent of
foreign exchange was: IDA USS25 million; AtDB USSlS million; and CCCE USS12 million.


C.       Implementation Schedule

5.03     Project implementation of the ONATRA Modernization Proia was to take three and a
half years and was to be completed by mid-1985. It reached 80% completion by March 1987,
and was substantially completed by mid-1989, four years behind schedule (three years when
taking into account its belated start (para 5.01)).       Project implementation of the
Rehabilitation Proiect was to take three years and the project to be completed by mid-1986. It
started on time but was not completed before the end of 1990, four and a half years behind
schedule. The start of civil works was delayed by the slow decisionprocess for contract award.
The draft terms of reference for the shipyard study were issued 18months after credit signature
(October 1985). Altogether, all physical elementsof both projects, studiesand trainingprograms
were satisfactorilyimplemented. Main causes of delayed e x d o n were:

         (a)     the tense relations between ONATRA's expatriate General Manager and
         the Minister of Transport,which culminatedin the abruptdismissal of the former
         inFebruary 1985,sixmonths after atwo-year renewal of his contract. Decisions
         on procurement were delayed by the establishment of new procedures for
        contract awards at the ministerial level, and by the creation of the Socit?tt?
        Nationale de Trading (SONATRAD), a new parastatal responsible for
        procurement of large items for public enterprises. The execution of some items

        of the projects (e.g. procurement of spare parts financed from savings on Cr.
        1180-ZR and whose financing was transferred to Cr. 1335-ZR, etc) was also
        delayed.

        (b)      errors in specifications concerning civil works carried out by the
        borrower itself;

        (c)      various delays in execution, mainly (i) delays in relocating a ferry
        terminal at Kinshasa to permit the execution of civil works; (ii) delays in
        completing track works because of shortage of locomotives for relaying and for
        hauling ballast trains; (iii) delays in starting training, whose detailed appraisal
        took place in fact after project start; (iv) delays in the choice of computer
        equipment and in recruitment of technical assistants; (v) delays of executionon
        port works in Kinshasa by a civil works contractor ,who finally sold part of its
        contract to another contractor; and (vi) procurementdelays by one cofinancier;
        and

        (d)      the inability of the local industry to deliver some items, which had to be
        ordered from abroad.


D.      Procurement

5.04    Until early 1985, procurement was handled well.              80% of credit 1180-ZR was
committed by the end of 1984, one year aftet effectiveness. After 1985 the approval of any
contract for foreign procurement took 5 to 12 months. This was due to changes in government
procedures, whereby most proposals for award were being reviewed at the ministerial level. The
compulsory recourse to SONATRADadded to the delays.

5.05    In ONATRA, the quality of procurement work was good until 1985, and uneven later,
as reflected in project correspondence. In 1985, a contractorpresented a claim for an additional
payment of US$2.2 million equivalentfor the constructionof a quay wall in Kinshasa port. The
contract stipulated a split of 70% foreign currency and 30% local currency payments. The
contractor's real needs turned out to be 40%foreigncurrency and 60%local currency, because
of gallopinglocal inflation. ONATRA accepted the claim, but IDA rejected it as it had no legal
basis. In any case, the claim was for additional local currency expendituresand IDA could not
disburse against it since it flnanced only foreign currency components. While the claim was
rejected in August 1986, the contractor continued its protests until April 1990. A second
acceptanceby ONATRA, withoutprior consultationwith IDA, of a dubious claim from another
contractor for the equivalentof US$500,000, was submitted to IDA ahortly after the rejection of
the first claim. The claim, again, proved unjustified given the perfectly clear terms of the
contract and bid documents. This raised serious doubts in the Region as to the real motives
behind ONATRA's apparent complacency to contractors, and these doubts were mentioned
verbally to the Government in 1987. The same year, a new PDG was appointed in ONATRA;
and there was no longer any problem of this type.

5.06    On IDA'S side, there were delays in answering procurement correspondence (1986).
Following the reallocation of savings from Credit 1180-ZR (para 5.07) for the procurement of
urgently needed spare parts, the limit set at US$500,0 for procurement of brand mark spare
parts was increased to US$2.5 million. Except for the delays mentioned above, there were no

major procurement problems. However, procurementdelays were usually underestimated at the
appraisal stage and not all of these delays should be attributed to slow procedures by the
borrower. Delivery of spare parts from Europe, for example, proved quite lengthy.



5.07     Total cost of the ONATRA Modernization Project was US$83.4 million equivalent,
nearly equal to the appraisal estimates of US$84 million. The foreign exchange cost was
USS57.9 million, also close to the appraisal estimltePof USS56 million. This includes additional
items financed from the unallocated category of the IDA Credit (paras 5.07 and 5.08). The
actual cost of the original project was US$52.7 million, or about 90%of estimates. Total cost
of the Port. RehabilitationProject was about US$58.2 million or 64.6% of original estimates.
The local currency cost (US$11.4 million equivalent)was much lower than estimated at appraisal
(US$38 million). However, the precision of these costs is relative. Local costs, in particular,
have not been monitored in detail during supervision and the final computation is based on the
original estimates of the share of local costs in the total costs. Detailed project costs are given
in Tables A of Section5, Part III. Tables B in the same Section reveals the financing plan.



5.08     From the start, disbursementson Credit 1180-ZR were slower than expected. At mid
execution, the disbursement lag was 18%in relation to appraisal estimates and 32% in relation
to the country profile. For Credit 1335-ZR, the figures were 25% and 4196 respectively.
Adherence to profile would have provided a better estimate than the one based on the tentative
project executiontimetable. Tables 3A and 3Bof Section5, PartIIIgivedetailsof disbursements
on both credits.

G.       Loan Allocation

5.09     The original and revised allocationsare shown in Table B, Section5, Part III. In 1986,
SDR 4.73 millionwere reallocated from the Unallocated Category to Category 2 (Equipment) of
Credit 1180-ZR to finance spare parts and other equipment urgently needed. Savings from
Category 1 (barges) were reallocatedto Category 3 (Consultants).

5.10     All elements of the ONATRA Modernization Project were implemented. The project's
description was modified in June 1987to incorporate (i) studies for improving the organization
and management of ONATRA's operationsdepartment8and establishingtheir investmentneeds;
(ii) tariff studies; and (iii) improvement and expansion studies for Matadi and Kinshasa port..,
Thereallocationof funds for spareparts (para 5.07) did notcausea changein project description.
The Ports Rehabilitation Project was modified as follows: i) additional civil works (300 m of
quays built in Kinshasa (para 3.04), drainage, contains crane tracks, extensionof paved areas
in Kinshasaport) led to reallocation of proceeds; ii) cancellationof the procurement of a main
frame computer, pending the elaborationof a management Mmmtion system, and replacement
with micro computers; and iii) transfer of the procurement of new cargo handling equipment to
the Transport RehabilitationProject (Cr 2027-ZR), with rephament by spares urgemly needed
for cargo handling equipment in service. All these modifications are routine for these types of
projects.

6.01     The success of the projects was dependent on a number of basic assumptions including,
(a) traffic increases of 5 to 6% annually; (b) improvements in operational productivity; (c)
stabilityand autonomy of management; and (d) financial surplusesand tariff increases as needed.
These assumptionsgenerally did not materialize, which had a negative impact on project results.




6.02     Appraisal assumptions about traffic proved optimistic from the start of the ONATRA
Rehabilitation Project. Railway traffic was 433 million tonskm in 1984 (835% of projections),
343 in 1989 and 386 in 1990 (47% of projections&.                  River freight traffic declined from
738,000tons in 1984to 639,000 in 1989and 545,000 in 1990;the gap with the appraisal forecast
widened progressively to negative 38%in 1985and to negative68%in 1990. Trafficprojections
formulated in the Appraisal Report for the Ports Rehabilitation Project also proved optimistic.
In 1990, Port traffic at Matadi and Kinshasa was 63%and 47% below projections, respectively..
Container traffic was projected to be 48% of cargo traffic in Matadi and 26% in Kinshasa (40%
altogether). The a      d figures were 28% and 12.5% respectivelyl! (25% altogether). Reasons
for theseresultswere i)thedeterioratingeconomicsituation,which severelycut imports, together
with social unrest and strikes; ii) GECAMINES' inadequate produdion levels and the capacity
constraints on the SNCZ line between Shaba and Ilebo, which reduced mineral traffic on the VN
(241,000 t offered for transport in 1990versus a projection of 400,000 t); iii) shortages, poor
conditions (e.g. the stealing of railway car doors, which placed many cars out of service) along
with obsolete equipment and a shortage of fuel and lubricating oil; iv) inadequate operating
performance; and v) a slower rate of containerization than expected.

6.03     ONATRA is increasingly unable to compete with privateriver operatorson the Zaire and
Kasai rivers: in 1989, its share of river traffic was 64%compared to 80% in 1980. But 66%of
its traffic was minerals from GECAMINES; while 62% of general cargo traffic was carried by
private carriers, even though they were not properly set up for container traffic. ONATRA's
poor serviceapparently has been the main cause for its decline. For similarreasons, it was also
unable to compete with private truckers between Matadi and Kinshasa. This was compounded
by the widespread pradice of destuffmg import containers at Matadi, rather than sending them
by rail to Kinshasa, since in Matadi, importers and road carriers enjoy more liberal customs
clearancethan in Kinshasa. Thediscrepancybetween port and rail traffic illustratesthe railway's
weak competitive position: in 1980, the CFMK traffic was 11096 of port traffic at Matadi,
indicating that the railway carried most of the importlexporttraffic, plus some local traffic. In
1990, it was only 60%.

6.04    Railwav uroductivity in 1983 was in line with credit covenants. ONATRA's staff
improved their performance under solid management and shouldbe given credit for their results.
However, overall productivity in 1985 was lower, especially with regard to locomotive
availability. In 1988, the last year for which productivity objectiveswere covenanted under the
Modernization Project, none had been reached: locomotive availability was 58% (75%
covenanted), locomotive utilization was 8.600 Wyear (145,000 covenanted), and wagon turn-
round was 14days (8 covenanted).

6.05    River Tran~pon-~roductivitywas defined in terms of the availabilityof transport tugs and
the number of tripslyear. In 1990the availability of tugs reached 76%of its objectivewhile the
number of trips reached 70%. Objectives regarding stops en route and time in upstream
terminals were not reached, reflectingpoor organization and management, and a deterioration in
crew discipline. However, there were signs of improvement in productivity in 1990: tons loaded
by bargelshift increased from 63 in 1984 to 80 in 1990 and mineral products unloaded by
bargelshift from 108to 153 over the same period. The same was true of logs loaded, which
increased from 61 t by bargelshift in 1986to 228 in 1990.

6.06    Productivity indicators at         indicate average peaformance. By end 1986, actual
performancewas well over objectivesat Matadi, except for containers (65%).Results in Kinshasa
were mixed. The operational indicators used during execution (tonnage per shifthatch) are
different from those covenanted (tonnage per shiplday) and the figures cannot be reconciled.
Based on the indicators used at present, productivity increased steadily between 1984and 1988
and may be 60 to 70%of that covenanted. Some of the new indicatorsmay give positive signals
but when put into perspective (using net working time rather than gross servicetime of ships in
port) they reflect the minimum acceptable levels. Productivity of general cargo by hatch shift
increased from 86to 109t between 1984and 1990, logs from 506to 628t and cerealsfrom 1655
to 1828. Container productivity was 28 boxes per shift in 1984, 25 in 1989 and was reported
as being 47 in 1990. Availability of cargo handling equipment was low at 35% at end of project
execution.



6.07     Results have been mixed. Stability in management and autonomy were not maintained:
from 1982to 1991, ONATRA had four general managers. It was covenanted under Credit 1180-
ZR that the 1978 statutes applicable to ONATRA, which provided the agency with increased
control over its operations and finance, would not be amended so as to affect materially and
adversely ONATRA's operations or financial condition during the period of project execution.
The interpretation given by the Minist8re des lhspon et Co-ns                      (MTPC) to these
statutes, starting in late 1982, reduced the autonomy of the agency. MTPC increased its control
over decisions, especially those regarding contracts and senior staff appointments. MTPC's
decisionsgavepriorityto the Government's latestpolitical orientationsand to its supervisoryrole
rather than to quick project execution and adherence to credit conditionality. Priority was
assigned to the replacement of expatriates by nationals, which added to destabilization before
things finally settled. Efforts to improve staff discipline and ethics, in particular with the
appointment in 1987 of a new general manager, had limited success. However, ONATRA
created the necessary framework for reinforcing its internal control capacity during the period
of project executionby establishingnew In-         Control and Internal Audit Units, a Directorate
of Planning and Investments, and a Directorate of Interface fof coordinating ports, river and
railwaysoperations. Staff was reduced from 19,800 in 1982to 16,000in 1989(27,000 in 1975),
resulting, despitethe decline in traffic, in an increase in productivity per staff member from 473

to 698 tomes. There were also improvements in personnel management with the appointment
of a Director of Human Resources. Altogether, the projects seem to have ensured ONATRA's
survival and the execution of at least part of its basic functions (especially rail transport from
Kinshasa to the sea and port operations at Matadi and Kinshasa). They have helped the
Zairianbion of middle and senior managemem with the replawment of technical assistants. At
the end of the second project execution, however, there were still signs that ONATRA had
problems of internal management to resolve, as reflected in its poor competitive position.
Financial management was especially inadequate, as was staff discipline, and corruption was
rampant.     Structural reforms at ONATRA, which were to be addressed through the First
Transport Rehabilitation Project (Cr 2027-ZR), were musiwy (para. 8.05).

6.08     ONATRA improved minimnlly its pertbrmance in marketing and commercial relations
with users. They needed to attract more trafficthrough marketingmeasures, specialrates, block
trains, contracts, improved control of the safety of cargo, a.A lot of lucrative traffic went by
road, despitehigher tariffs. In addition, ONATRA's rules and practice regarding its liability as
a common carrier were inadequate (limitations of liability, cumbersome procedures, late
settlement of claims and payments in a depreciated currency, etc). In a country where the
insurancesystem does not work well, this is a strong disincentivefor potential clients.

6.09     Training has been a positive aspect of both projects. 2,540 staff were trained, of which
135 were managers and 646 were supervisorsfor a total of 33,000 hours of training (of which
17,000were on the job). The results of training have been substantial in some areas, such as
maintenance of port equipment (due especially to an exceptionally good trainer). However,
management of the training function and of the personnel function in general, remain fragile.
Seniority, rather than competence, has remained a major criterion for promotion.


D.       Economic ResulQ

6.10     Th                                     yielded a rate of rebun of some 6%,against 34%
estimated at appraisal. The rates of return for the track renewal, rail wagons and tug boats and
barges are 3.5%, 4.0% and 6.0% respectively. The recalculation was done followingthe same
methodologyemployedduring appraisal. However, it wasdoneusing poor data. Improved data,
particularly the rate of disbursements by other financiers (including ONATRA) economic costs
of rail transport and river transport, etc, are badly neededfor an accurate recomputation.
                    . .                     .. .
6.11     The &&&&-Km&ia Ports                                produced a rate of return of 13.O% .
However, once again the computationwas done using the same methods used during appraisal,
taking into account the actual and forecast traffic, and project@ some improvements in traffic
after 1995. The improvements at the port of Matadi yielded a rate of return of 242, a high
figure despite the decline in traffic, however modest compared to appraisal estimates.
Improvementsat Kinshasasecureda 7%rateof return andthe two items together, which amount
to 90%of projectcosts, yielded a return of almost 13%. The return is contingent, however, on
the recovery of the Zairian economy and on the useof the Kinshascl port as a public port open
to all river operators. Detaileddatawas also missing forthiirecalculation, especiallywithregard
to benefits.

6.12     D u r q the execution of both projects, ONATRA's financial performance was
permanently influenced by Zaire's high inflation rate. Tnflntinn ad devaluation, stagnation or
decline of traffic and inadequate tariffs rapidly made the initial financial projections more and
more irrelevant. Finances in 1983were goodand, duringthe first two years of project execution
(1984 and 1989, ONATRA had a net surplus (operating ratio 89 ad 92%). This was largely
due to the capitalization of the long term exchange losses, only the short term losses being
charged to the fiscal year, which was changed from 1986on. As of 1986, the net results have
been negative (see Tables 6, 10 and 11, Part        m).    The teas0119 for the deterioration of the
financialsituation are numerous:

         i)       ONATRA spends too much for its revenue; despite massive staff
         a&trition, its productivity remains too low to finance a vast agency with many
         ancillary activities;

         ii)      ONATRA has too many deficit producing activities; revenue from
         profitable activities (stevedoring, rail freight traffic) are no longer sufficient to
         compensate for losses on money losing activities (river transport, rail passenger
         traffic, shipyards);

         iii)     while ONATRA has an obligationto transport, as a common carrier, its
         clients have no obligation to use its d u x ; ONATRA, for example,
         overinvested in the prospect of a huge tonnage of mineral products, which
         GECANllNES has been unable to deliver but the losses have been absorbed by
         ONATRA;

         iv)      tariff increases are granted too late in a period of high inflation: they
         were increased in September 1983, April 1984 and April 1985; they were
         blocked between 1985and 1987and again in 1988; in 1989only, three increases
         of 7596, 112% and 21% respectively were granted; and

         v)       the company's culture is not orientedtowards profitability: (by statutes,
         ONATRA is still not supposed to make profits, but simply to provide a service
         when requested).

At project completion, ONATRA was too large, in all respects, for the traffic it handled. To
balance its accounts, itneeded massive compressionof its fixed costs, ratherthan tariff increases.
Its tariffs were hardly competitive . As a carrier, it was increasingly less attractive to potential
users. Significantly, in 1990, ONATRA ruled out tariff increases for fear of losing more traffic.

6.13      The receivables were always high. There were 3.7 months of billing by August 1984,
3 and 4 months in 1988and 1989and 6 by the end 1990. Receivables from Government entities,
despite a special covenant on the matter have reached 17.5 months of billing at times.

6.14      Compared to appraisal estimates and to covenants, ONATRA's financial position was
as follows. The agency was not ableto cover its operatingexpenses, from 1986to 1988. It met
them in 1989and 1990. Net results (after finance charges) have been negativesince 1986. They
would have been positive in 1989and 1990if there had been no major foreign exchange losses.
The returnon fixedassetshas been negative since 1986, by 4 to 7%.It was minus 42% in 1990,

again due to foreign exchange losses. The ratio of workmg capital declined from 2.2 in 1985
to 1.1 in 1990. The liquidityratio, which was covenantedto be no less than 1.5 and 1.7 in 1989
and 1990, went from 1.2 to 0.8 over the sameperiod. Only the ddtlequity ratio was satisfactory
in 1990, at 0.43.

6.15     Even when its financial management appeared to be satisfactory(up to 1986)ONATRA
overspent. Operatingexpenses always increased faster than operatingrevenues and, in years of
reasonable inflation, also increased faster than inflation&I. IDA'S supervisionmissions insisted
mainly on (i) the need to reduce expenses and to reinforce inte,rnai control against waste and
possible misuse of resources (e.g. gasolineconsumption); (ii) staff attrition by early retirement;
(iii) scrapping and sale of obsolete equipment; (iv) improved management of real estate; (v)
decentralizationof managementresponsibilitiesinONATRA; and (vi)appointmentof acompetent
Director of Finance as the basis for a financial rehabilitationplan.

6.16      Accounts wereaudited each year, but auditedaccounts were at times produced late. The
auditors issued qualified opinions on ONATRA's accounts, specially in 1989.




7.01     The hardware elements of the projects are sustainable if they are operated properly,
maintained adequately, if equipment and spares are not stolen and if traffic develops. The Port
of Kinshasa is now being opened a9 a public port to traffic other than ONATRA's. This should
increase its profitability and ensure an adequate return over its economic life. It should also
eliminate the economic waste caused by over-investment in too many under-used private port
facilities. In retrospect, because traffic has dropped, the projects' investment was excessive. If
properly maintained and also if traffic picks up, the modernization of the wharves at Matadi is
sustainable, especially since the development of a deep sea port at Banana is no longer
considered. The modernization of the railway track is also sustainable. A major problem,
mentioned above (paras 4.09 and 6.03) is that ONATRA runs all the risks of investments for
exportsbased on projections made by GECAMINES which is, in tum, not bound by any of them.
In 1989, GECAh4INES shipped 52% of its exports through the VN. The percentage was in
keeping with estimates, but the tonnage was only one half of what had been projected.

7.02     Themany weaknessesin ONATRA's management make the sustainabilityof theprojects'
software elements doubtful. Training did not solvethe mainissue affecting the performance of
ONATRA's s W . lack of motivation. Elements such as the improvement of the store and
informationmanagement systemscanbe sustainableonlythrough continuousefforts at all levels.
Significantly, in late 1989, when both projects were near completion, there was a risk that the
storesmanagement system put in place by a consultant, would not be sustainablebecause the staff
trained accordingly had not been assigned where they belonged.

7.03    The continuouspoor performanceof the Voie Nationale, when seen in the light of these
two projects, of the two SNCZ railways projects reviewed in earlier project completionreports,
and also in light of the present performance of the RVF and of RVM in the implementationof
the NavigationalImprovement Project (Cr 1761-ZR)raises seriousdoubtsaboutthe sustainability
of any project related to it. After some 20 years of involvementby donors, the results are still
far below expectations for a level of costs which is hgh, altbough no exact figures have ever
been compiled. The combinationof transportmodes (rail, river, rail andports) with multipleoff
and on loading at transit points is a nightmare for any operatoel. Long term planning of
transport in Zaire ought to consider other alternatives. The concerns expressed during the
internal review process (para 4.05) were fullyjustified.


                                     8. Participant Perfornwce

A.      IDA'S Performance

8.01    IDA devoted substantial efforts to preparing and appraising both projects and to finding
cofinanciersfor the firstproject. It developed a reasonable conditionality. While a lot of work
was done on economic and financial analyses, supervision was uneven during the early years.
There was no supervisionmission between May 1985 and March 1986and information in the
early supervisionreports is patchy, at times. There were considerableimprovements, however,
from 1986onward. Thehelp providedby the staff of the Information,Technology and Facilities
Department, with regard to computeridon, is worthy of mention, yet its costs were not fully
recorded. The project correspondence reflects that IDA staffs lack of familiarizationwith the
computerization item in the project led to delays in decision making. At no point during
supervisionwere the costs of the projects updated.

8.02    Until mid-1986, IDA seems to have been occasionally lenient in its relations with the
Government. During negotiations of credit 1335-ZR, IDA insisted on celerity in procurement
procedures. A sideletter included a commitment to hateffectwith special regard to delays for
ministerial approval of contractawards. Before effectiveness, IDA wrote to the Governmentto
request the issuanceof formal instructionsto that effect. IDA's request went unanswered and,
before the credit was effective, restrictiveprocedures for procurement were established at the
MTPC. IDA's reaction to the abrupt dismissal of ONATRA's General Manager in February
1985, without consultation, is also significant. The issuewas adequately reviewed internallybut
the final telex to the Governmentwas such an expunged version of the originaldraft that it could
have raised doubts about the importance IDA gave to the covenants and to the basic project
design. Lastly, IDA did not react to the borrower's lack of responseto its correspondence(see
para 9.01), which was a violation of the standard clause on exchanges of views. IDA's low
profile probably did not help: not enforcing covenants is more harmful than no covenant at all.
Especially when there were exampleswherefirmnesspayed off: when theIDA objected strongly
to the boycon of South Afiican firms in the procurement process, the Borrower backed down.
Aftermid-1986, IDA's attitudewas h e x , especially when O N A W s supportof contractor's
requests for loose interpretationof contract conditions(para 5.05) raised suspicionsof collusion.

'The impact of IDA'S verbal representations on this point is not known, but they were followed
by the appointment of a new General Manager at ONATRA.

8.03     As noted in paragraph 5.06, IDA was frequentlyslow in replying to correspondenceand
project files reflect the justified impatience of the borrower and/or executing agency.




8.04     As illustrated in paragraph 8.02 above, the Borrower, while interested in the project
which provided an opportunity to reequip a major parastatai, did not feel stronglycommitted to
covenants in credit agreements. Each successiveMinister seemed to have his own policy agenda
which was implemented without considerationfor credit covenants on tariffs, procurement, staff
attrition, etc, and without prior consultation with IDA. This placed the supervisionmissions in
front offaits accomplis and forced them to more or less renegotiate informally what had already
been agreed upon. Letters written by IDA to the Government afier supervision were left
unanswered.      Some of these letters included reminders of commitments under the credit
agreements, such as the delay in closing the Mayumbe Railway, on which the borrower was in
default. There are no traces eitherof Government's readions to aidememoires fromsupervision
missions. As a result, while IDA was committedby its writtencorrespondence, the Government
kept its options open.

8.05     ONATRA's performancehasbeenreviewed aboveunder projectimplementation,finance,
etc. ONATRA's task is extremely difficult, as it operates, exclusively, the complex and largely
uneconomic system of the VN (see para 7.03). None of the more successful private operators
has a similar obligation: they select their routes, freight and modes freely, and they usually
operate in only one mode. Some of the weaknesses of the parastatals operating the VN are
directly related to the weaknesses of the VN itself. ONATRA showed diligence in replying to
correspondence. Reporting improved over recent years, and, in the last years of implementation
of the Matadi-Kinshasa Ports Rehabilitation Project, when it was overlapping with the First
Transport Rehabilitation Project (Cr 2027-ZR), reporting has improved markedly. There were
no formalized and comprehensive progress reports wing a preagreed format decided upon at
negotiations, but a fairly large number of different operational and financial reports, which
reflected similar information, were generally abundant.

8.06     It is cause for concern that ONATRA's performance deterioratedmarkedly after a rapid
Zairianization of its management staff and of the General Manager's position. Since there are,
in Zaire, efficient and well-run enterprises entirely under the control of nationals, and since
Zairianization is both inescapableand necessary, one must look for a type of organization which
permits Zairianizationand preserves efficiency. Thebasicpremise that ONATRAshouldremain
a unified multipurposeparastatal, whatever itsjustification from a policy of national unity, does
not stand the test of experience. The diversityof its missions, the allocation of its resources in
many differentplaces, the distancesover which itoperates, makes it impossibleto manage except
with: i) the completeautonomy of aprivate company, reporting onlyto shareholdersonce a year,
in the form of profits or losses; ii) excellent staff, easily recruited and dismissed on the basis of
performance and of the economic needs of the entity; iii) contradud and financial freedom,
especially with regard to foreign exchange, contracts with users, tariffs and liability; and iv) a
stable and safe economic environment generating adequate flows of traffic. None of these
conditionswas met in Zaire. To make it fully efficient, ONATRA should be broken down into
specialized, fully autonomous and profit making companies. This was proposed, and rejected,

in 1970 (see para 4.11 and footnote 4), and again recommended by IDA at the end of project
execution, but not implemented, except in the divestihue of shipyards lo/.

8.07    The insertion, in projects, of items not familiar to IDA staff - computerization being an
example here deserves special attention. These items are rarely appraised in depth before
               -
project implementation, which resulted, inthis case, in delays, hesitations and sometension with
the borrower at a later stage of project execution.



8.08    The matter has been substantiallyreviewed in the abovesections. Project relations were
altogether good, with nuances regarding technical assistanceby expatriates and the reservations
that LDA had over the direct and strong personal interest in procurement expressed by one of
ONATRA's General Managers (para 8.02).

D.      Consultinr Services and Technical AssiPtPnce

8.09    Technical assistancewas an issue. Project ides reflect the Government's policy of rapid
attritionof expatriatestaff. Tley also reflect someteasion and un~a~ineas   in that respect, which
was compounded by the ups and downs of relations W e e nZaire and the country-of-originof
most nationalsservingin ONATRA. On the one side, the objediveof trainingwas officiallyand
firmlyto ensurethe replacement of expatriatesas soon as possible, rather than the upgrading of
the levelof professional capacity of nationals. On the other side, not all expatriateswere equally
competent, and some, who had been present for many years, had archaic work methods. The
objectiveof Zairianizationwas easily met. It didnot, however, generatethe expectedresultsand
the followvp project (First Transport Rehabilitation   -Credit  2027-ZR) included a substantial
technical assistance component for a new recovery for ONATRA.

8.10    Consultants apparently performed well on training. Training on maintenance of port
equipment was especially successful.

8.11    Except for the two financial claim on civil works (para 5.05) ,which were rejected,
there were no major problems with contractors.



8.12    The Projects' documentation was genetally availablebut could have been more candid.
With regard to the Ports RehabilitationProject, however, neither the Staff Appraisal Report nor
the Project files included the comprehensive analysis of the altmmive routes for ONATRA's
mineral exports requested during the internal review. The appraisal report itself was succinct.
It lacked the Annex on "Selected Documents and Data Available in Project Files" and none of
these documents could be traced, which was especially embarrassing for an accurate
recomputation of the economic rate of return, as the detailed methodology employed during
appraisal was not known. Supervisionreports for the ModernizationProject (Cr 1180-ZR) are
few until 1986. TheInitial SupervisionSummary (Form 590) for Cr 1180-ZR,which was to be
issued in October 1981after Board approval (see OD 13.05 at 59), cannot be traced. The first
summary was in fact issued on May 18, 1984, and this was also the date of the first substantial

SupervisionReport, two years after effectiveness. Still, it ismt a proper document for follow-up
and for post evaluation. A weakness of Supervision Reports is their lack of updated project
costs. Also, productivity indicators have been changed en route, which makes it difficult to
compare actual to planned performance. Thetables in Part IIIof the standardproject completion
report providean excellent format for recording and up-dating basic information concerning the
project. They should be drawnup at the start of project executionand be updated continuously.

8.13    Correspondence files are an importantpart of project documentation. While there is no
doubt that these files are well kept by competent stoff in the Regional Information Center, the
basic system on which they rest is that of a chromlogical file mixing documents of different
origin and nature: reports, memoranda, correspondence to and from the borrower and the
executing agencies, procurement documentation, letters from contractors or consultants, etc.
There is no uniform systemof loggingin and stamping, no logical distributionof correspondence
according to any key (such as origin or destination, agency, etc). This is obsolete, discouraging
and the cause of wasted time and energy. Neither the logical sequence of procurement during
project execution nor the timelinessof IDA'S reaction can be easily followedthrough the existing
filing system. In addition, when a project involves different agencies with different problems,
management, functions,etc, as was the case here (RW,       ONATRA,RVM, the GEEPhave little
in common except that they are all transport entities), all their correspondence is all mixed
together and it is impossibleto follow separately their respective performances under the project.
As it stands, the system is not particularly useful. This is probably the main reason for the
accumulation of private files in staff offices (with associated xeroxing costs), because staff are
convincedthat the filing system is not adjusted to their need for an operational, easy-to-use and
ewnomical management tool.
