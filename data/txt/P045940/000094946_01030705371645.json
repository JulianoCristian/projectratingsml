Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are considered satisfactory\n            overall. Lessons learned included the following: Successful\n            implementation of the project can be attributed to the fact\n            that the Bank and USAID/PADCO (Planning and Development\n            Collaborative International) teams worked closely with the\n            Ministry on almost all aspects of implementation of the\n            housing subsidy program. Although computerization of\n            administratiive systems have been introduced as\n            free-standing Bank projects, procurement of computers\n            without appropriate software and adequate capacity building\n            would not have accomplished any of the project objectives.\n            Training staff in the use of computer technologies and in\n            the management of information exchange was crucial for the\n            project's success. Staffing limitations of the Housing\n            and Municipal Services Allowance Program (HMSAP) at national\n            and regional levels and financing restrictions imposed on\n            the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP) have not\n            allowed them to fully develop information management\n            activities that monitor and evaluate programs. For more\n            comprehensive projects related to automation of\n            administrative systems, the establishment of a formal\n            project implementation unit is advisable."}, "docdt": "2000-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
