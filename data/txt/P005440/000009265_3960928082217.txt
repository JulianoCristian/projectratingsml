MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$104 MIL'.ION
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A HEALTH SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Kingdom of Morocco for US$104.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would support the rehabilitation of essential
basic healch services and ongoing MOH efforts to test and implement various
improvements in service quality and efficiency. The loan would have a term of
20 years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest
rate.
2.          Background.  The Moroccan government is continuing its economic
adjustment program with a renewed emphasis on social sector interventions
intended to mitigate its impact on low income groups and expand the access of
the population, and in particular the poor, to health and other social
services. The Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL, Ln. 3001 - MOR) is monitoring
the completion of investments in the health sector, for which execution rates
have now accelerated after a steady decline in budgetary outlays caused by
protracted fiscal austerity during the earlier part of the decade.
3.          Health conditions in Morocco have improved significantly during
the past twenty years. However life expectancy is still 15 years lower than
in the industrialized countries, infant mortality is ten times higher, and
maternal mortality is estimated to be almost 40 times higher. The population
growth rate remains high because the death rate has declined more rapidly than
the birth rate, and as a result, the population will double in 29 years if
fertility is not reduced further. Women and children suffer the most serious
consequences of high fertility and inadequate health care. Infar.ts under one
year of age account for 51% of all deaths and half of these occur during the
first 28 days of life, mostly of causes preventable at very low cost. Only
25% of deliveries are attended by trained medical personnel. Tuberculosis and
other communicable diseases, respiratory infections, and accidents of all
kinds are other major causes of morbidity and mortality. The impact of these
health problems on national development is substantial and can be measured in
economic terms by the loss of productivity of a physically debilitated labor
force and by private and public sector outlays for expensive curative care for
health conditions which could be prevented at a fraction of the cost.
4.          Although 80% of Morocco's population has no alternative to public
health services, per capita budgetary outlays for public health have declined
by over 50% in real terms during this decade, which has seriously compromised
the ability of the Government to meet the health needs of the population.
Consequently, the credibility of the public health services has diminished
significantly. The legitimate operational requirements of tertiary care
hospitals compete with the expansion of high priority cost-effective
preventive health programs which reach only half the population despite
recently developed sound operational strategies. Continued erosion of pasc
investments in the sector and of community confidence and willingness to



support local health services will make the vicious circle even more difficult
to break.
5.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project would contribute to
the GO1 objective of expanding social sector programs and intensifyii.g its
efforts to target these programs to poor and underserved areas. It would
constitute the initial phase of a long term effort to reestablish sustainable
public health programs nationwide and, using existing infrastructure, build on
the pilot-scale effort financed by the Health Development Project
(Ln. 2572 MOR dated May 15, 1985) which has helped institute sound standards
and flexible institutional arrangements for the delivery of primary health
care health services. It would also provide support for upgrading the quality
of selecced diagnostic and emergency services. While the proposed investments
are expected to play a crucial catalytic role in GOM efforts to ensure the
continuation of essential basic health services, they would also permit MOH to
move ahead with the design of a package of administrative and policy reforms
which encourage further improvements in quality and efficiency, increase cost
recovery for curative care, mobilize additional resources in support of the
sector, and streamline arrangements for the use of social security aud health
insurance. It would complement concessional Lunding provided by USAID, UNFPA,
and UNICEF which is not available in the amount required to undertake a major
rehabilitation of the health services. A Bank-sponsored breakthrough ensuring
adequate financing for essential public investments was initiated under the
SAL (Ln. 3001 MOR dated November 8, 1988) and needs the reinforcement of the
proposed project to enhance the effectiveness of MOH utilization of its
investment resources and ensure continued improvements in the quality and
coverage of services.
6.          Proiect Descriptio.  The Government strategy for the health
sector, which the project would support, would reinforce: (a) basic health
services in maternal-child health, family planning, and nutrition, including
an initiative to increase attended deliveries to 60Z of births; control of
communicable and non-communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, and malaria;
school health programs; environmental health programs; and support activities
including information systems improvements and training programs; (b)
referral, emergercy and diagnostic services provided at regional and
provincial hospitals and building and biomedical equipment maintenance
capabilities; (c) administration and management of services provided by the
MOH in order to increase efficiency, and facilitate the implementation of
administrative reforms designed to decentralize the management of health
services; and (d) sector and policy reforms which address longer term issues
related to the evolution and structure of the public and private sector health
services delivery systems, financing mechanisms, and the mobilization of
resources in support of the sector. The project would include: (i)
rehabilitation of about 150 urban and rural dispensaries and health centers,
17 rural hospitals and the emergency and diagnostic services in about 20
provincial hospitals; (ii) vehicles, furniture, medical equipment and supplies
to support primary care programs and emergency medical services in these
facilities; (iii) rehabilitation and equipment of five regional medical
equipment maintenance centers; (iv) training and technical assistance in
support of the related health services and the MOH program of administrativc
and sector reforms.



7.          Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project including
contingencies, taxes and duties, is estimated at US$171.3 million with a
foreign exchange cost of US$96.0 million. The Bank loan of US$104.0 million
would cover about 80% of project costs net of taxes and duties, including 100%
of foreign exchange cost and some local costs. The GOM would finance local
costs totaling US$67.3 million and including US$41.0 million in taxes and
duties. Retroactive financing of up to US$4.8 million (nearly 5% of the loan
amount) is proposed to cover payments after January 1, 1990, for eligible
expenditures, for which draft tender documents have been reviewed by the Bank.
A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C and 1, respectively.  The staff
appraisal report No. 8108-MOR, dated January 3, 1990, is being distributed
separately.
8.          Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government agreed to
carry out the sector and policy reform component of the project in accordance
with an implementation program which is acceptable to the Bank. The program
includes the following: (a) authorization of hospitals renovated under the
project to retain fees collected for services rendered; (b) development and
introduction of an improved fee collection system by June 30, 1992;
(c) completion of a study of the provision of health care by the private
sector by December 31, 1991 and discussion of its results with the Bank in
order to formulate a medium-term program to promote development of private
sector health services consistent with GOM health sector policies; and
(d) completion by December 31, 1991, of a study to identify and recommend a
strategy to rationalize public and private sector health insurance systems
over the medium term.  Government also provided assurances that (a) a Project
Coordinating Committee would be raintained throughout the project
implementation period; and (b) the MOH would maintain a project monitoring
unit during the entire project implementation period.
9.          Benefits.  In the short and medium term, the proposed project
would raise the credibility of the public health system by reinforcing the
essential primary, diagnostic and emergency health services of the MOH in a
time of fiscal stringency. The project would contribute to MOH goals to
reduce infant and maternal morbidity and mortality, improve the nutrition
status of vulnerable population groups, control preventable diseases, and
reinforce MOH ability to respond to the growing number of accidents which
require emergency medical care. The project's support of a&ciinistrative
reforms is expected to contribute to improved planning, personnel and
financial management, and increased productivity in the use of sector
resources. In the medium to long term, improvements in the MOH maintenance
and repair capabilities are expected to safeguard investments in
infrastructure and equipment, and sector reforms are expected to facilitate
the development of a financially and economically sustainable health system
which can achieve broader nationwide coverage. The policy and sector reform
programs are expected to identify the means to increase individual, public,
community, and private sector expenditures on health care within a sustainable
(approximately 4% in real terms) increase in the MOH operating budget.

10.         Rlsks.  The principal risks relate to GOH ability to provide
adequate financial resources for the health sector on a sustained basis
pending the successful outcome of long term efforts to mobilize additional
resources, and the implementation capacity of the HOH. The project represents
a special effort to redirect additional resources to the sector and is
therefore expected to receive the necessary allocatlons even in difficult
budgetary conditions. Continuous monitoring of expenditures will be conducted
in the context of the Bank's annual review of public investments. The
experience gained in the first Bank-financed project is expected to reduce
initial delays in project start-up. Equipment lists have been prepared,
reviewed and approved by the Bank, as have standard bid documents related to
the procurement of works and goods. Ongoing efforts to strengthen the
management capabilities of the MOH and the decentralization of administrative
functions to the provincial and facility level are expected to improve sector
performance and thus contribute to an increased project implementation
capacity.
11.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
