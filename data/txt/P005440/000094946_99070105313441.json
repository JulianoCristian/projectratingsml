Project objectives aimed at reinforcing\n            basic health services, and, strengthening emergency and\n            referral services, were not fully implemented. However,\n            activities such as health financing, and, management\n            autonomy for larger number of hospitals, though achieved\n            only towards the end of the project, predict a positive\n            long-term impact on sector development. Regardless of the\n            negative outcome, the project did play an important role as\n            a catalyst in the overall sector development, and\n            contributed to launching sector reforms. The lessons learned\n            show that a gradual approach is key to the reform process,\n            and successful realistic projects, attain limited numbers of\n            priority activities. The provision of adequate support to\n            priority public health programs is essential, allowing\n            governments to allocate further public resources to these\n            programs. The integration of investment projects within a\n            well structured development strategy, allows clear targets\n            to achieve essential health services. It is also emphasized,\n            that the involvement of stakeholders, in project\n            implementation, further ensures consensus, and coordination\n            on health financing strategies. Finally, it is suggested\n            that monitoring and evaluation indicators, at an early\n            start, are relevant, as is the continuity of Bank's supervision."}, "docdt": "1999-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
