                    Amendment to Schedule 4 to the Loan
                    Agreement
Excellency:
           Please refer to the Loan Agreement (the "Loan Agreement")
entered into by and between the Kingdom of Morocco (the "Borrower")
and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the
"Bank"), dated June 15, 1990, in respect of the above-referenced
Project.
           I am pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to
amend the Loan Agreement to provide for an increased aggregate
ceiling for the procurement of goods through prudent shopping
procedures. Therefore, Part C.2 (c) of Schedule 4 to the Loan
Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:
     "(c) Good estimated to cost less than the equivalent of S100,000
per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the equivalent of
S5,000,000, may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison
of price quotations solicited from at least three suppliers eligible under the
Guidelines, in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank."
       Kindly confirm your agreement, as the duly authorized
representative of the Borrower, to the foregoing amendment by
signing and duly dating the corresponding form of confirmation set
forth below, and returning this amendment letter to us at your
earliest convenience. A signed duplicate original of this
amendment letter is enclosed herewith for your records. This
amendment letter shall become effective, as of the date first
above-written, once it has been fully executed by both parties
thereto.
                         Very truly yours,
                         INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
