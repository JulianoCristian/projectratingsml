                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project objective is to assist Burkina Faso to improve the competitiveness of its economy through privatization and utility reform, investment climate improvement
                         and private sector institutional development, and mitigation of constraints to small and medium enterprise development. To achieve these objectives, the project will
                         provide support to: (i) roll back government involvement in the market's domain through privatization and actions to foster competition; (ii) carry out utility reform,
                         particularly the telecommunications and energy sectors; and (iii) promote the development of a strong and competitive private sector by improving the business
                         environment and reducing systemic risk through the provision of effective business development services (BDS), and of microfinance services to micro, small and
                         medium enterprises (SMEs). Importantly, the proposed project is designed to assist the Government in implementing its Poverty Reduction Strategy. That strategy
                         targets long-term private sector development objectives, including the lowering of input costs, the increasing of factor productivity, the encouraging of private initiative
                         and the supporting of income generating and job creating activities through SME development.

                         The PDO under this additional financing was revised and is now to contribute to private sector development in Burkina by creating conditions for improved competitiveness, enterprise
                         development and investment promotion.
                         It is expected that this PDO will be achieved through two main components: i) Enterprise development, investment promotion and investment climate activities; ii) Access to financial
                         services.

                         In addition to the activities to be financed under the Additional financing, ongoing activities for which funding is available under the original credit will continue during the extension
                         period ( those activities include the following activities: Technical assistance to SONABEL; support to the ministry of Mining; support to the telecommunication sector regulatory body;
                         support to the CPI.)

                         A mission was undertaken from May 27th to 31st. Aide-memoire and Management letter will be attached once completed and comments received from government counterparts.

                         PDO will be downgraded to moderately satisfactory, to reflect realism and delays in some activities.
                         Project implementation remains moderately satisfactory,although implementation pace accelerated since December 2012 mission. This momentum needs to be kept in order to
                         achieve expected results by the closing date. 85% of original project project resources are disbursed and almost all remaining amounts committed. For the additional financing,
                         disbursement rate improved from 14% in december 2012 to 36% in end-may, 2013 (an additional amount of USD 1,457 425 is being processed for payments, another US 792000
                         will be submitted for withdrawal) . Regular disbursement and follow-up meetings will continue to be held with the PIU. The project independent assessment and matching grant
                         evaluation are underway, with TORs approved and procurement process ongoing. Projected disbursements for the project from november 2012 to end june 2013 was realized at
                         69.1%.
                         Remaining funds committed in the project are above 80%. The team discussed detailed activities, implementation, disbursement and procurement issues and preparatory activities
