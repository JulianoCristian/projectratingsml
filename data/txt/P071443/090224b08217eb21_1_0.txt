                         USD 20 million and extended the project closing date to December 31, 2013. This additional financing became effective on June 17, 2011.

                         RELEVANCE: The Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) was approved on March 03, 2003, with the objective of assisting Burkina Faso to improve the
                         competitiveness of its economy through privatization and utility reform, investment climate improvement and private sector institutional development, and mitigation of constraints to
                         small and medium enterprise development. The objectives remained highly relevant throughout the original project implementation , and the project has at some point been able to
                         adapt to the demands of the economy, especially regarding the privatization and utility reform agenda.

                         In May 2008, at the request of the Government, the Project was restructured (level two) and project closing date extended by a year from June 30, 2008 to December 31, 2010. The
                         project restructuring enabled the scaling up of the enterprise development component after having demonstrated success in the one stop shop for business creation , the investment
                         climate reforms and the provision of effective business development services (BDS), and of microfinance services to micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Further, it enabled
                         the government to attract a strategic international private operator for the public telecommunication entity. There were new activities that were introduced to improve the capacity of
                         the Ministry of Mining to deal with the mining firms in terms of regulations, implementation of the mining code, compliance with the Extractive Industries Initiative as well as build
                         capacity within the Ministry. The project was rated satisfactory for its overall implementation and development objective, satisfactory for the Public Enterprise Component and highly
                         satisfactory for its Enterprise Development Component.

                         In March, 2010, the Government requested another extension for additional financing and a restructuring of the project. The Second restructuring (Level one) made available an
                         additional financing (Grant H6370) of USD 20 million and extended the project closing date to December 31, 2013. The project development objective was adjusted to keep its
                         relevance with the changing country context and new sector policies as well as institutional and capacity issues. The objective became “to contribute to private sector development in
                         Burkina Faso by creating conditions for improved competitiveness, enterprise development and investment promotion.”

                          This additional financing allowed the authorities to scale up enterprises development activities supported by the original project, support investment and export promotion and
                         strengthen investment climate activities. It also helped the Government to start the implementation of the newly approved financial sector strategy developed by the Government with
                         an access to financial services component. The restructuring of Part 1 of the original Project allowed to reflect a change of Government policy on privatization, especially regarding
                         the energy sector institutional reform by supporting the Government to develop a capacity building program for Société Nationale d’Electricité du Burkina (SONABEL) to improve its
                         management and service delivery (after reformulation of this activity).

                         Competitiveness and Enterprise Development continue to be of pivotal importance as expressed in the Government's Strategy for Faster Growth and Sustainable Development for
                         2011-2015, known as SCADD. The relevance of the project is further demonstrated by the Government's request for further assistance with the aim of building on the reforms initiated
                         in the financial sector under this operation and the shifting of remaining funds to another operation in support of the private sector.

                          EFFICACY: Although the ICR will provide a full evaluation of the project, available evidence indicate that the project progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives
                         (PDO) remained moderately satisfactory as measured by (i) the number of jobs created by enterprises supported by the project from 2296 at AF inception to 16438 at present (target
                         exceeded) and number of enterprises registered with assistance from the project in the one stop shop from 15 000 to 28 516 (target exceeded); (ii) the credit to private sector as a

                         percentage of GDP from 16% to 22% target exceeded) in component 2).The PDO level indicator that did not fare well is the one related to number of international firms attracted by
                         the Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) which may not be achieved due to delays in creating and formalizing the agency. However, the project contributed to establishing the agency
                         with technical assistance for the institution's statutes and institutional arrangements as well as capacity building for key staff recruited. The project also supported four annual
                         sessions for CPI (CPI members include 10 local investors, 10 international resident investors and 10 international non resident investors). The last session was held November
                         7-8,2013. An Investment law was drafted by CPI with support from the project and approved in May 2013. An Investment tracking system was created by CPI with the statistic
                         institute and support from the project .

                         The indicators that were not achieved are those related to decrease in total tax (all taxes paid by an enterprise as % of the profit) and those related to investment code revamping.
                         However studies underway will provide action plans and a roadmap to implement and achieve the overall objective of improving the business environment after the project closed.

                         enterprise development component, there has been a reduction in time and cost to create an enterprise not only in the capital city but also the reduction in costs of transportation due

                         to the one stop shop presence in 8 regional offices. The centralization of the regional registries of commerce through the centralized computerized system (the national RCCM)
                         involved a reduction in costs to archiving and gains in lost licenses reproduction.
                         Sustainability: After project closing , the “Maison de l’Entreprise” will continue to provide business development services and counseling as well as maintain the one stop shops as
                         85% of it its operating costs are currently covered by its fees activities and its members ‘contribution. Activities undertaken for investment promotion will continue through budgetary
                         resources and capacity building activities for the energy company will be implemented through the company’s own resources due to an increased accounts receivables recovery rate
                         (98.5%).

                         DISBURSEMENT: Overall the project was characterized with slow disbursement. the overall disbursement rate (for both the original project and additional financing) is about 80%.
                         Disbursement improved after the restructuring.

                         PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT:
                         The project implementation unit (PIU, -- MEBF, Maison de l’Entreprise du Burkina --) has been exerting all the efforts for the successful implementation of the planned procurement
                         activities. The PIU has intensified monitoring of implementation progress of all agreed priority actions and will continue monitoring the finalization and completion of all activities. The
                         Findings of the last Post Procurement Review (PPR) report shows that there were no procedural gaps associated with procurement and the remedial actions of the findings of the
                         former PPR were adequately implemented. The rating of procurement performance was however rated as Moderately Satisfactory (MS) due to delays in procuring contracts in the
                         past and the number of contracts under implementation.
