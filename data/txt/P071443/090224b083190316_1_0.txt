 Burkina Faso: Overcoming the Odds


Overview
Burkina Faso’s political stability over the past 15 years, together with a country-led transition to
a more open, market-driven economic model, has provided the foundation for growth and
poverty reduction. Since 1994, the International Development Association (IDA), the World
Bank’s fund for the world’s poorest countries, has supported sustained policy reform in
Burkina’s transition towards a market economy through financial assistance and strategic
advice.

Burkina remains one of the poorest countries in
the world, with per capita income around
US$460. Along with education and health
challenges, and, in the wake of recent and
ongoing climatic and financial crises, Burkina
Faso will need to address a key set of
constraints and vulnerabilities in order to sustain
the steady economic and social gains made to
date. The annual growth rate contracted from
+5.2 percent in 2008 to +3.2 percent in 2009 as
a result of a combination of climatic shocks, the
energy crisis, fluctuating commodity prices and         MORE
global financial crisis. This decline resulted in an
                                                         Growing through cotton exports (slideshow)
increase in vulnerability among the poor.

Approach
Burkina Faso’s development strategy is detailed in its new            More Results
Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable
Development, adopted in December 2010, whose four pillars


                                                                     1.9%
are: (i) Development of accelerated growth pole pillars; (ii)
Consolidation of human capital and safety net promotion; (iii)
Governance reinforcement and; (iv) the problematic of
including cross cutting issues into development politics and         Rate of HIV infection, down from
programs.                                                            7% in 1997


The strategy seeks to consolidate the multitude of national
and sectoral strategies. On the economic front, the main
emerging challenges are: (i) rural development; (ii) private
sector development; (iii) financial sector development; (iv)
                                                                   85.9%
infrastructure upgrading and development; and (v) economic         Rise of Gross Enrollment Rate
                                                                   (GER) in primary education (up
governance. At the social level, the main challenges focus         from 60% in 2010)
on: (i) the demographic transition; (ii) education system
performance; (iii) access to electricity, water and sanitation
services; (iv) employment creation; (v) social protection; (vi)
promotion of human rights and of cultural and moral values;       MORE INFORMATION
(vii) gender equality; and (viii) reinforcement of political,       Country Website
administrative and local governance. New themes, such as
                                                                    Country Brief
environmental protection regulation and government
intervention in certain areas (oil price, food crisis) are also     Country Assistance Strategy
covered in the SCADD.                                               Data and Statistics

IDA’s action in Burkina Faso is guided by the 2010 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) which is aligned with the priorities
of the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Over
the past 10 years, covering fiscal years 2000-2010, IDA has
committed US$1.5 billion to finance investment projects and budget support operations linked to
the country’s development priorities

Results
Consistent with the World Bank’s Assistance Strategy for Burkina Faso, IDA has worked to
achieve tangible results in multiple sectors, promoting growth through economic transformation,
minimizing economic vulnerability and improving social service delivery.
Private Development

       Support of a reform in the telecom sector which lead to an increased teledensity
       (number of telephone lines per 100 inhabitants) from 1.5 in 2003 to 31 in 2010

       Creation of 6,670 formal new jobs as of June 30, 2010 and a total of 16,085 enterprises
       registered.

       Support of business environment reforms, which led to reducing the time required to
       create an enterprise to 3 days (from 45 in 2004) and the number of days to obtain a
       construction permit to 30 days (from 260 in 2006).

Health:

       Decrease in child mortality (from 219 to 104 per 1,000 between 1999 and 2009).

       With support from debt relief and poverty reduction credits, child vaccination became
       free in 2002, as did prenatal care in 2003.

       Decrease of HIV rates in urban areas from a peak of over 7 percent in 1997 to about
       1.9 percent today.

Water:

       70 million USD IDA contributions to the Ouagadougou Water Project allowed an
       increase in access to piped water in urban areas covered by ONEA, the public water
       utility, from 57 percent in 2001 to an estimated 73 percent in 2008.

       In Ouagadougou, the number of people with direct access to piped water through
       household connection has more than tripled in six years from 300,000 in 2001 to
       1,040,000 people in 2007.

       Water service, which was chronically intermittent in 2001, is now supplied 24/7 94
      percent of the population of Ouagadougou.

Roads:

      IDA is part of a consortium of donors that is assisting the government in rehabilitating
      and maintaining essential transport infrastructure. IDA financing has rehabilitated more
      than 1,100 kilometers of rural roads, connecting agricultural production zones to markets

Mining:

      Technical and financial support over the past 10 years to eliminate the state monopoly
      on mining, opening it up to competition and facilitating private mining exploration and
      investment in gold, manganese, phosphates, and zinc.

      US$700 million increase in investments in the sector between 2006 and 2009, with
      additional investments in the order of US$250 million over the next two years.

Education:

      Rise of Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) in primary education from 60 percent in 2006 to
      85.9 percent in 2010

      Increased completion rate from 40 percent to 45.9 percent in the same period.


Partners
Since 2000, IDA has helped forge a new aid compact based on poverty reduction strategies,
debt relief, better-harmonized aid and government leadership. Ten donors are signatories of a
general framework for budget support. The PRSC series is firmly embedded in this process
and the Bank has participated in 2009/2010 as leader of the troika of donors in charge of
coordinating the joint performance assessment framework.

Toward the Future
With the objective of expanding the impact of the first and second phase of the project, the
Additional Financing Credit-1 of US$20 million is closing in October 2010. The results of the
project are tangible and people recollect how their lives changed before and after the IDA effort
got underway. The achievements made were not only recognized by those living in Taiz but
also by those who know people before the initiative. If there is a project that all people have
the same voice about it, it is the Taiz Municipal Development and Flood Protection Project
