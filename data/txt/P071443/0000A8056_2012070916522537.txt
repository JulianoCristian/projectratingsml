                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project objective is to assist Burkina Faso to improve the competitiveness of its economy through privatization and utility reform, investment climate improvement
                         and private sector institutional development, and mitigation of constraints to small and medium enterprise development. To achieve these objectives, the project will
                         provide support to: (i) roll back government involvement in the market's domain through privatization and actions to foster competition; (ii) carry out utility reform,
                         particularly the telecommunications and energy sectors; and (iii) promote the development of a strong and competitive private sector by improving the business
                         environment and reducing systemic risk through the provision of effective business development services (BDS), and of microfinance services to micro, small and
                         medium enterprises (SMEs). Importantly, the proposed project is designed to assist the Government in implementing its Poverty Reduction Strategy. That strategy
                         targets long-term private sector development objectives, including the lowering of input costs, the increasing of factor productivity, the encouraging of private initiative
                         and the supporting of income generating and job creating activities through SME development.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         An Additional Financing (AF) of USD 20 million dollars was approved in December 2010 and declared effective in june 2011. It was agreed that this additional financing would pursue
                         incomplete activities of the first project and include a new component that would embrace access to financial services issues.

                         The current project development objective is to contribute to private sector development in Burkina Faso by creating conditions for improved competitiveness, enterprise development
                         and investment promotion.
                         It has the following components: i) Enterprise Development, Investment Promotion and Investment Climate Activities; ii) Access to Financial Services; project management and
                         activities of the original restructured project.

                         A mission was undertaken from June 11 to June 14th on the AF. The aide-memoire will be attached to this ISR once finalized, after receiving government’s comments.
                         Project implementation has started slowly but as of june 2012 mission is satisfactory. However, implementation pace needs to be accelerated in order to achieve expected results by

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The PDO under this additional financing was revised and is now to contribute to private sector development in Burkina by creating conditions for improved competitiveness, enterprise
                         development and investment promotion.
                         It is expected that this PDO will be achieved through two main components: i) Enterprise development, investment promotion and investment climate activities; ii) Access to financial
                         services.
                         In addition to the activities to be financed under the Additional financing, ongoing activities for which funding is available under the original credit will continue during the extension
                         period ( those activities include the following activities: Technical assistance to SONABEL; support to the ministry of Mining; support to the telecommunication sector regulatory body;
                         support to the CPI.)

                         To date,project implementation is satisfactory but needs to be accelerated in order to achieve expected results by the closing date. It was agreed that activities that are in the pipeline
                         would be accelerated to increase disbursements. Bank team is working closely with the MEBF to move forward with project implementation especially with regard to investment
                         promotion activities and access to financial services.
