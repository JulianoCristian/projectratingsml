Dear Mr. Joranson,
Re:
BOLIVIA - Second Administration Agreement
First Amendment (TF24847)
(Education Reform Prp-ject Cr. 2650-BW
We refer to the Second Administration Agreement (the Agreement) dated July 
13, 1994 between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden (Sweden) and the 
International Development Association for the administration of certain funds to be 
made available by Sweden in respect of the Education Reform Project in Bolivia.
The Closing Date of the Swedish Grant Agreement dated July 28, 1994 between 
the Republic of Bolivia and the Association as administrator of grant funds 
provided by Sweden is June 30, 1995. The Association has agreed to extend such 
Closing Date to October 31, 1995 because of delays of project implementation and 
disbursement, largely caused by the Bolivian teachers' strike. Therefore, we 
propose to replace the date "June 30, 1995" referred to in Section 5.01 of the 
Administration Agreement, by the date "October 31, 1995". This amendment will 
enable the Administration Agreement to remain valid until October 31, 1995.
This amendment letter shall be executed in two counterparts, each of which 
shall be an original, and shall become effective as of the date of 
countersignature. Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by 
signing and dating the two counterparts of this amendment letter. Upon your 
confirmation, please return one fully executed original to us.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
