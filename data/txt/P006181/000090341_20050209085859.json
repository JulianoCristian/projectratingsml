The lessons learned\n            indicate that when disseminating a new strategy for\n            innovation, choice is an important instrument. Relations\n            with teacher unions are fundamental in education reform.\n            Bringing parents into the schools with some kind of decision\n            making power was fundamental for Bolivia's educational\n            achievements. Not having a Project Implementation Unit was a\n            correct decision. While the Project was implemented with\n            excellent development results despite the operational\n            problems in procurement and financial management, there is\n            no doubt that the lack of a competent team in these areas\n            within the Ministry was a major obstacle. The presence and\n            continuity of high-quality technical teams was fundamental.\n            An adequate education information system is fundamental. The\n            Education Quality Measurement and Evaluation system\n            (SIMECAL) is a high quality assessment system, but its\n            impact have been modest due to its awkward institutional\n            placement. The SIMECAL was neither created entirely outside\n            the Ministry so as to ensure total impartiality nor within\n            the Ministry decision structure so as to provide guidance\n            for educational policy decisions."}, "docdt": "2005-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
