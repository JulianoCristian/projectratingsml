The\n            physical works include provision of serviced plots for\n            residential, commercial, and small-scale business uses,\n            improved public utilities and infrastructure and social\n            facilities.  Improvements will also be made in environmental\n            health and urban service delivery.  The project will provide\n            credit for building materials, loans for site and service\n            and upgrading beneficiaries, and workshop and working\n            capital loans for businesses locating on small business\n            plots.
