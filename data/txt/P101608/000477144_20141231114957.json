Both the Bank and the Borrower\n            received a satisfactory performance rating. Components were\n            not revised during the project life, and there were no other\n            significant changes in design, scope and scale, and\n            implementation arrangements. The following lessons can help\n            inform future programs that build veterinary and human\n            public health systems for prevention and control of\n            diseases: (1) An emergency is an opportunity to reduce risks\n            over the medium term. This will help prevent future costly\n            emergencies. (2) One Health approaches are effective in\n            disease control and prevention. (3) One Health approaches\n            are feasible when there is good leadership. (4) Behavior\n            change takes time and resources. (5) Upstream attention to\n            environmental impacts helps prevent problems. (6) Transition\n            from emergency response to systemic improvements is\n            important. (7) Successful market upgrades. (8) M&E\n            indicators. Final outcome indicators (such as disease\n            prevalence and the case fatality ratio) are by themselves\n            not sufficient to evaluate progress and thus may be\n            misleading. They need to be complemented by measures of\n            system performance for functions that are required for\n            disease control and prevention. (9) Technical definitions\n            are critical for M&E. (10) Use of consultants. External\n            expertise was essential for the highly technical task of\n            improving laboratories and their management. (11)\n            Decentralized implementation. This was both necessary\n            (because disease control and prevention activities occur in\n            numerous districts and villages) and challenging (because\n            local capacity was uneven and alignment with national\n            policies and programs was required). (12) Engaging\n            stakeholders beyond Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). (13) Training\n            health workers on communications, especially risk\n            communications. This helped extend messages to communities\n            and improved infection control in health care facilities.\n            (14) Rule to balance expenditures on training and equipment\n            in health care centers. (15) Quality of supervision and\n            implementation support. Substantial implementation support\n            was instrumental to the success of this technically complex,\n            emergency, and multisectoral operation."}, "docdt": "2014-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
