Project Development Objectives
Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's development objective is to increase the effectiveness of Government services in reducing the health risk to poultry and humans from avian influenza in
eleven high priority provinces and thus contribute to addressing HPAI at the national level by controlling the disease at source in domestic poultry, by early detection
and response to poultry and human cases, and by preparing for the medical consequences of a human pandemic.

O    Implementation Status Overview
-Q This ISR was created after the last Nov-Dec, 2011 mission. The assessments and ratings were based on the recent review of the progress reports up to the end of November, 2011
..   which were prepared by the Project Coordination Units of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and Ministry of Health (MARD-PCU and MOH-PCU) and a series of follow-up
technical meetings. This ISR captures the progress regarding the closing of the parent VAHIP and the launching of the VAHIP AF.

VAHIP: The project has achieved its development objectives in increasing the effectiveness of Government services in reducing heath risks to poultry and humans from avian
influenza in eleven high priority provinces and thus contribute to addressing HPAI at the national level by controlling the disease at source in domestic poultry, by early detection and
response to poultry and human cases, and preparing for the medical consequences of a human pandemic. This project objective is still highly relevant and consistent with the
Government's newly launched Integrated National Operational Program on Avian Influenza, Pandemic Preparedness and Emerging Infectious Diseases 2011-2015 (AIPED - blue
C   book). It still remains to be the VAHIP Additional Financing (AF)'s development objective.
3 In general, the two PCUs and 11 Provincial Project Management Units (PPMUs) made all efforts to complete the activities under the approved workplans for the last 6 months of the
cn  project. They also prepared themselves for the closing of project by December 31, 2011. While most of the planned activities have been implemented, some have been cancelled due
0
-6  to the administrative procedures (delayed approvals, bidding processes) and unavailability of qualified consultants.
As the closing dates passed now with the satisfactory implementation of the planned activities, the major milestone that must be kept in mind now is the end of grace period for
disbursements on April 30, 2012. It means that all implementing agencies must finalize all financial documents and submit the last withdrawal applications before this deadline.
According to progress reports submitted by PCUs, as of mid December, 2011, USD31,417,378.9 (87%) of the project fund has been disbursed and USD 35,084,551.6 (97%) will be
spent by the closing date.
VAHIP AF: The VAHIP AF will be implemented by MOH and MARD with the shift to MOH as coordinating agency. The project budget is US$25 million, covering the same 3
components as VAHIP, namely, A) - HPAI Control and Eradication in the Agricultural Sector; (B) - Influenza Prevention and Pandemic Preparedness in the Health Sector; and (C) -
Integration and OPI Coordination, Results Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), and Project Management. It is co-financed by the World Bank (US$10 million via the IDA Credit), the
AHIF (US$13 million via the Avian and Human Influenza Facility - AHIF), and the Government of Vietnam (US$2 million of counterpart funds).
The Financing Agreement for IDA credit and Grant Agreement for AHIF Grant were signed by the Government of Vietnam and the World Bank on October 21, 2011. There was only
one effectiveness condition for this project - the adoption of the revised Project Implementation Manual (PIM) by MOH-PCU and MARD-PCU. The project has been declared effective
on January 18, 2012.
As of February 1, 2012, all the CPUs and PPMUs were established. Further strengthening of the PPMUs, especially in the 3 provinces - Ha Tinh, Thanh Hoa and Tay Ninh that
involved in the human health activities for the first time needs to be implemented with the recruitment with additional contracted staff and/or consultants. MOH-PCU needs to provide
intensive technical support to the 3 PPMUs to ensure they can catch up with other 8 provinces for the implementation of human health activities.
The workplan and procurement plan for 2012 by PCUs and by provinces have to be ready by mid February for WB's review, NOL, by concerned ministries and by Provincial Peoples'
Committees by end February, 2012.
