                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is to increase the effectiveness of Government services in reducing the health risk to poultry and humans from avian influenza in
                         eleven high priority provinces and thus contribute to addressing HPAI at the national level by controlling the disease at source in domestic poultry, by early detection
                         and response to poultry and human cases, and by preparing for the medical consequences of a human pandemic.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of December 2013, the progress towards achieving the project development objectives (PDO) is moderately satisfactory. The key indicators to measure project results show
                         achievements in 2013: increased percentage of suspected cases in poultry reported and fully investigated to 96% in 2013, the number of days for reporting and returning results to
                         affected commune were reduced from 8.7 days in 2006 to 2.7 days (slightly increased from 2.34 days from the last reported period due to some outbreaks were occurred in remote
                         districts and took more time for transportation of sample and return of results) in animal health sector and from 10 days to 4 days in human health sector against the target of 4 days

                         for both sectors. The human fatality rate was 50% which is higher than target of 35%. However it has to be noted that the number of human infected cases was reduced remarkably
                         from hundred cased in mid 2000s to one or two cased in each outbreak location in the last few years and with very high fatal rate from 50% to 100%. Given the low number of cases
                         reported, it is expected that the human fatality rate could vary significantly even with 1 death.

                         The implementation progress is assessed as moderately satisfactory. Many key project contributions have been delivered, achieved or exceeded the targets, such as 8 laboratories
                         accredited for ISO 17025 standards for IA testing, training of the health staff in 57 district preventive medicine centers, commune health center and village health workers in the 11
                         project provinces, execution of 40 cross-sectoral simulations exercises, 99% of the district hospitals with pandemic preparedness plans. As a result, the capacity for control and
                         preparedness for Avian and Human Influenza and other newly zoonotic diseases was strengthened, the coordination and information sharing was enhanced, especially among
                         human and animal health sectors. Savings made it possible to provide additional investments to 6 more district preventive medicine centers, and additional civil work to build the
                         vehicle cleaning facility in Ha Vy market. By December 31, 2013 actual disbursement was about 76% of the total budget (USD 17.5 million out of USD 23 million), increased from
                         20% from May 2013. All of the AHI grant of USD 13 million which was closed on December 31, 2013 was disbursed. However, the remainder of the IDA credit was about USD 6
                         million as of end of 2013. There were also delays in recruitment of consultants, auditor and environment safeguards.
