                         The project's development objective is to increase the effectiveness of Government services in reducing the health risk to poultry and humans from avian influenza in
                         eleven high priority provinces and thus contribute to addressing HPAI at the national level by controlling the disease at source in domestic poultry, by early detection
                         and response to poultry and human cases, and by preparing for the medical consequences of a human pandemic.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of October 2013, the progress towards achieving the project development objectives (PDO) is satisfactory. The key indicators to measure project results show clear achievements:
                         84% of the poultry outbreaks were fully investigated in the first quarter of 2013 (with the other outbreaks being close in proximity and time), the number of days for reporting and
                         returning results to affected commune were reduced from 8.7 days in 2006 to 2.34 days in 2013 in animal health sector and from 10 days to 4 days in human health sector. The
                         human fatality rate was 50%, but this was due to very low case rate of 2 infected individuals.

                         The implementation progress is assessed as moderately satisfactory. Many key project contributions have been delivered such as 6 laboratories accredited for ISO 17025 standards
                         for IA testing, training of the staff in 51 district preventive medicine centers in the 11 project provinces, execution of 35 cross-sectoral simulations exercises, 96% of the district
                         hospitals with pandemic preparedness plans, and bio-safety improvement in Ha Vy market. There are concerns, however. According to the 2013 workplan, all the medical and

                         laboratory equipment should have been delivered at the district hospitals and preventive centers. Additionally, the markets and slaughterhouse should have been upgrade by June
                         2013. There have been delays of about 3 to 6 months. This leads to lag in disbursement. The Additional Financing for the Project in the amount of US$13 million Avian and Human
                         Influenza Facility (AHI) Grant and US$10 million IDA Credit is approximately 59% disbursed and additionally 8% committed but not yet disbursed. The AHI Grant, closing on
                         December 31, 2013 is 75.5% disbursed and the IDA Credit, closing on June 30, 2014, is 33% disbursed. The main risks for fully satisfactory implementation progress and full
                         disbursement are the completion of major additional procurement of equipment for district hospitals and preventive medicine centers, the timely mobilization of international and
                         national consultants for updating the surveillance software, assessment and development of supporting district preventive medicine system, development of risk communication
                         toolkit and training material.
