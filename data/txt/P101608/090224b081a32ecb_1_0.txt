                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is to increase the effectiveness of Government services in reducing the health risk to poultry and humans from avian influenza in
                         eleven high priority provinces and thus contribute to addressing HPAI at the national level by controlling the disease at source in domestic poultry, by early detection
                         and response to poultry and human cases, and by preparing for the medical consequences of a human pandemic.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The progress towards achieving the project development objective is determined to be satisfactory as the objective remains highly relevant and indicators measuring the results have
                         been or are on track to be achieved. Key results include (i) reducing the number of days for confirming new outbreaks to the affected communes from the laboratory from 8.7 days in
                         2006 to 2.66 days in 2012; and (iii) investigating, in both the field and laboratory, nearly 300 suspected HPAI cases between January 1, 2011 and September 30, 2012 in the eleven
                         project provinces. In particular, during this review period, the cross-sector coordination mechanism was established in most of eleven provinces for enhanced surveillance, simulation

                         support of the "One Health" approach.

                         The progress of project implementation is determined to be moderately satisfactory. Half of the contracts for goods have been awarded; the bid evaluation for another three major

                         procurement packages have been completed, but contracts have not yet been signed. The training of health staff is on going and a series of communication activities have been
                         conducted in both health facilities and communities. However, many other activities have been delayed and the delay in replenishment process has led to the lower than planned
                         disbursement. To completely and effectively utilize the IDA Credit and Trust Fund grant by the project closing date is a significant challenge. The reasons for the delays were
                         discussed and solutions were agreed to move the project implementation forward, including speeding up of current project activities, forecasting possible savings from procurement
                         and planning for the use of such savings, quickening the approval process and flexibly responding to implementation during 2013. It is targeted that all the major technical activities
                         will be completed before end of 2013.
