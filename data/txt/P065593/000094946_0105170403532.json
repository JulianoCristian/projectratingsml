Action Project aims to\n            strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE)\n            to manage the education system more effectively through\n            improving policy-making, planning, and budgeting at central\n            and district levels. The project consists of two main\n            components. The first component, which is made up of two\n            sub-components, is to strengthen the capacity of MOE. 1) The\n            first sub-component will support the preparation and\n            evaluation of Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPB) to\n            operationalize the priorities of the Five-Year Plan. The\n            second sub-component will cover the costs associated with\n            improved management of financial and procurement systems to\n            implement Trust Fund Credit-funded activities, and the\n            hiring of external expertise to support and mentor MOE\n            staff. 2) The second main component, Targeted Interventions,\n            will support the implementation of activities in the\n            Five-Year Plan and AWPB. The subcomponents under this\n            component include the extension of a program for school\n            improvement, the development of professional standards for\n            headteachers, supporting the MOE to develop and pilot the\n            curriculum and materials for secondary vocational stream,\n            and establishing pilot units for vocational secondary\n            classrooms and workshops attached to existing general\n            secondary schools."}, "docdt": "2001-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
