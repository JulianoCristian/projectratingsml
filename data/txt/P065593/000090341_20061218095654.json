Lessons learned from the\n            project: Projects aiming to improve planning and public\n            financial management have a better chance of succeeding if\n            they are part of a broad policy dialogue with central\n            ministries, have enough resources to support and monitor the\n            proposed actions, and are supported by sufficient donor\n            cofinancing resources. Arrangements for progress monitoring\n            against project logical framework and key performance\n            indicators must be in place and maintained throughout the\n            duration of the project. Flexibility in project design and\n            implementation are key factors for projects implemented in\n            countries in conflict or volatile political contexts.
