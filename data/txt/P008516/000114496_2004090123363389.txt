                 - Amendment to Dutch Grant Agreement (TF020809)
         Please refer to the Dutch Grant Agreement dated
   December 19, 1995 (the Grant Agreement) between Kyrgyz
   Republic  (the Recipient) and the International
   Development Association as Administrator of grant funds
   provided by the Minister for Development Cooperation of
   the Netherlands (the Association) for the above-
   referenced project, and to the previous discussion
   between us on the subject of amending the Grant
   Agreement in order to reflect the correct amount of the
   Grant.
         I am pleased to inform you that the Association
   hereby agrees to amend the Grant Agreement as follows:
   1.    Section 2.01, as amended, shall read as follows:
         "The Administrator  agrees to make available to the
         Recipient, on the terms and conditions set forth
         or referred to in this Agreement, a Grant in an
         amount of  five million United States dollars
         (US$5,000,000), not to exceed, however, a
         corresponding amount of eight million two hundred
         and fifty thousand Netherlands Guilders (NLG
         8,250,000)."
   2.    In the Schedule, the amount of the Grant allocated
   shall be expressed in US dollars instead of Netherlands
   Guilders, and the figure for imports and the total shall
   be indicated as amounting to US$5,000,000 instead of NLG
   8,250,000.
           Kindly confirm your agreement, on behalf of the
   Recipient, to the foregoing amendment by signing and
   dating the form of confirmation set forth on the
   enclosed duplicate original of this letter and returning
   it to us.
