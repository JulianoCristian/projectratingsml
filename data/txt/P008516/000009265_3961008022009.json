markets\n            as the basis for sound agrarian reform; 2) demonopolizing\n            and privatizing the large state-owned conglomerates that\n            dominate agricultural marketing and processing; and 3)\n            eliminating remaining price and trade distortions, as well\n            as local governments' interference in commercial\n            decisions.  The credit will be quick-disbursing and will\n            provide balance of payments support linked to Board\n            presentation and second tranche conditions.
