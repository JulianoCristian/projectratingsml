                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PDO is to reduce the risk of nutrition insecurity of vulnerable populations, in particular children under five in poor rural and urban areas by scaling up the
                         Government Nutrition Enhancement Program and providing cash transfers to vulnerable mothers of children under five.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing strongly and is on full course to meet its development objectives. All indicators but one have surpassed the end of project target. The implementation of
                         the project is very decentralized and follows a strong results-based management design with the involvement of a broad range of actors and stakeholders. Currently, 50% of children
                         under five in rural areas are reached by the community nutrition component (already above the end of project target of 45%) and almost 23,000 women have received allocations

                         under the cash transfer component. This number is below target due to a delay in setting up the Trust Fund. The Government of Senegal is submitting a request for an extension of
                         the project until August 31, 2012 and reallocation of proceeds of the IDA credit.

                         In the last Implementation Status and Results (ISR) report, concern was voiced regarding the financial sustainability of the program. This aspect received a boost by the increased

                         budget line for the program by approximately $0.5 million plus commitment from the Government to increase the budget line further by more than $1.0 million annually until 2016. By
                         then, the Government would be contributing approximately $7.8 million per year.

                         A partnership of development agencies supports the program and conducts twice yearly joint mission in support of program implementation since 2007. Co-financing by
                         development partners is approximately 4% of expenses. In addition, the Cellule de Lutte contre la Malnutrition (CLM) and USAID are in a process to enhance coordination between
                         the Nutrition Enhancement Program and the USAID-funded Feed the Future project. In December 2010, the partners set up a donor group for nutrition to coordinate their
                         programmatic support efforts more efficiently. Senegal joined the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement in April 2011 and participated at the UN General Assembly in New York City
                         on September 20 and 21, 2011. Senegal's status as a reference country for nutrition policy and program implementation has been further illustrated by an exchange visit by a Malawi
                         delegation with the objective to learn from the Senegal experience.
