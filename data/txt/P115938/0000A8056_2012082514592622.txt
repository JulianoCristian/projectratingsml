                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PDO is to reduce the risk of nutrition insecurity of vulnerable populations, in particular children under five in poor rural and urban areas by scaling up the
                         Government Nutrition Enhancement Program and providing cash transfers to vulnerable mothers of children under five.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The pilot social cash transfer program initially suffered some major administrative and logistical challenges, but the project has managed to overcome all of these in a way that the
                         number of project beneficiaries of the cash transfer program has more than doubled from 23,000 in June 2011 to over 55,000 in June 2012.

                         As for the intermediary indicators, the story looks strong as well with five indicators out of seven having surpassed the end-of-project target. One intermediate indicator, the

                         production of iodized salt varies by year. Last year's production surpassed the project target, but this year's production falls below target. The second intermediate indicator has
                         practically met the target with survey results from last year and this year hovering around the end-of-project target.
