The\n            reallocation of the credit proceeds is needed to enhance\n            project effectiveness by ensuring the funding for the\n            program's central component on sub-grants for community\n            nutrition sub-projects. The reallocation aims to strengthen\n            the support to the cash transfer program and maintain the\n            coverage and strengthen the intensity of the community-based\n            activities, particularly in light of the negative impact of\n            the external economic shocks on poverty and nutrition.  The\n            reallocation is made possible because of economies made on\n            the categories of drugs and pharmaceutical supplies,\n            consulting services, training, audits and operating costs\n            over the course of the project implementation, mainly as the\n            result of new support from other donor sources and and/or\n            increased Government contributions.  No changes are being\n            made to the development objectives, outcomes, design, or\n            scope of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
