                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PDO is to reduce the risk of nutrition insecurity of vulnerable populations, in particular children under five in poor rural and urban areas by scaling up the
                         Government Nutrition Enhancement Program and providing cash transfers to vulnerable mothers of children under five.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to perform well with 87% of funds disbursed and four out of five Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators (including one core indicator) having
                         surpassed the end-of-project target and one on course to surpass the end-of-project target. The number of project beneficiaries of the cash transfer program has dramatically
                         increased since the last ISR, more than doubling from 23,000 in June 2012 to over 49,000 less than a year later. That means that the target of 50,000 is basically met. However,

                         there are a few more rounds of cash transfer to be completed so the total number may well surpass the 50,000.

                         As for the intermediary indicators, the story looks strong as well with five indicators out of seven having surpassed the end-of-project target. One intermediate indicator, the
                         production of iodized salt varies by year. Last year's production surpassed the project target, but this year's production falls below target. That leaves one intermediate indicator on
