      NUTRITION/CASH TRANSFER PROJECT SENEGAL,TF094372-Republic of Senegal - Rapid\n            Response Child Focused Social Cash Transfer", "versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Rapid Response\n            Child-focused Social Cash Transfer and Nutrition Security\n            Project for Senegal were as follows: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: nutrition\n            indicators can improve even in the Senegal context of weak\n            and uneven economic growth. The institutional set-up in the\n            Prime Minister's office greatly enhanced coordination\n            of the policy dialogue between multiple stakeholders and\n            sectors. Effective communication for behavioral change and\n            counseling require precise messages on the promoted\n            behaviors; built on positive examples that appear easy to\n            take on; and includes a description of how the promoted\n            behavior should be accomplished. Community-based nutrition\n            is an essential platform for service delivery of other\n            social and health related packages. A de-sectoralized\n            approach to community mobilization for health and nutrition\n            has shown to produce more innovative, adaptable and\n            inclusive forms of community mobilization including pregnant\n            women solidarity clubs, grandmother forums, and religious\n            women circles in areas with large and strong brotherhoods.\n            Effective strategies to combat the multiple causes of\n            malnutrition require flexibility in the approaches to\n            address them. Cash transfers design should be responding to\n            the underlying conditions of the country context.\n            Community-based targeting is an efficient and effective way\n            of reaching the vulnerable population in rural areas. Local\n            Government participation in and verification of the\n            targeting mechanism enhanced the institutional legitimacy of\n            the cash transfer scheme. Reliability of data on the impact\n            of cash transfers is strengthened by building the scheme on\n            the existing community nutrition program and its\n            well-functioning project monitoring system. Conducting a\n            pilot scheme on cash transfers has allowed testing and\n            adjusting approaches in the design and execution that can be\n            applied to the scaling up of safety net operations. The\n            expansion of community nutrition to include safety nets can\n            strengthen the analysis and understanding of social\n            development of all stakeholders involved."}, "docdt": "2013-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
