                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PDO is to reduce the risk of nutrition insecurity of vulnerable populations, in particular children under five in poor rural and urban areas by scaling up the
                         Government Nutrition Enhancement Program and providing cash transfers to vulnerable mothers of children under five.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing strongly and is likely to meet its development objectives. Most indicators are on track or have surpassed the end of project target. The implementation of
                         the project is very decentralized and follows a strong results-based management design with the involvement of a broad range of actors and stakeholders. Currently, 48% of children
                         under five in rural areas are reached by the community nutrition component (already above the end of project target of 45%) and almost 20,000 women have received allocations

                         A major concern remains the financial sustainability of the program. This requires commitment from partners and Government alike. As for the partners, a partnership of development
                         agencies supports the program and conducts twice yearly joint mission in support of program implementation since 2007. Moreover, in December 2010, the partners set up a donor
                         group for nutrition to coordinate their programmatic support efforts more efficiently. As for the Government, it will need to commit to an increase in the budget allocation for the
                         program. The Cellule de Lutte Contre la Malnutrition (CLM) with support from the partners will develop advocacy material to start lobbying in anticipation of the next budget
                         preparation in June 2011.
