Government's decision-making process\n            for public procureement and documentation flow, foster\n            private sector development, and strengthen civil society\n            through introducing innovative models of Information and\n            Communication Technologies (ICT) solutions. There are three\n            project components. The E-Government component provides for\n            development and introduction of the public E-Procurement and\n            E-Documentation flow models aimed at increasing efficiency\n            and transparency of the Government actions. amendments\n            required to facilitate introduction of the Internet-based\n            transactions in the procurement cycle, and carrying out a\n            pilot testing in one of the Borrower's state agencies\n            with larger volume of the procurement transactions.\n            Fine-tuning of the developed model will be based on the\n            feedbacks and recommendations from public agencies and\n            vendors to assure its replicability. The E-Documentation\n            flow subcomponent will develop the most appropriate model\n            for documentation flow to increase efficiency of the\n            decision-making processes (preparation, appraisal, approval,\n            implementation, supervision and completion phases) of the\n            document flow for issuing and monitoring the resolutions and\n            orders of the Borrower's Cabinet of Ministers, extended\n            pilot testing thereof, and introduction of a workflow\n            information system to allow the secure processing and\n            exchange of e-documents. The second component, the\n            E-Business Environment component, will assess the main\n            bottlenecks in current legislation that hamper e-business\n            growth. Legislative, normative and regulatory environment\n            adequate to accelerate enabling on-line transactions will be\n            developed. It will also provide framework for their\n            introduction and secure a favorable e-business regulatory\n            environment for the other Parts of the Project, thereby\n            complementing them. The third component, the Public-Private\n            E-Dialogue component, will provide for on-line tools for an\n            exchange of ideas between public authorities and\n            representatives of private sector and civil society at the\n            national and regional levels. Introduction of these tools\n            would i) improve public sector transparency, and ii)\n            strengthen the role and involvement of civil society in the\n            governance process."}, "docdt": "2003-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
