The project was initiated in late 2001 and\n            approved by the Board on May 6, 2003. The loan and project\n            agreements were signed on October 1, 2003, and became\n            effective on July 26, 2004. Long delays in signing and\n            ratification of the Loan and critical interruptions in the\n            procurement process in late 2004/early 2005 were mostly\n            related to political reasons and not to the loan itself. In\n            the hindsight, these delays led to losing momentum in\n            project implementation. Some of the lessons learned from the\n            project are: 1) support of key high-ranking officials may be\n            enough for project approval but is insufficient for\n            implementation and the sustainability of outcomes,\n            particular in countries with institutional challenges, such\n            as Ukraine; 2) a fully functioning and staffed PIU and\n            remunerated for their services is essential for effective\n            and efficient project implementation. The Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) was not fully staffed and in some\n            cases the salaries of the staff were not paid for over a\n            year, although allocations were made under the Loan for\n            these payments; and 3) the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)\n            states that the first year's procurement documents were\n            ready, but it took almost till March 2005 till the first\n            Terms of Reference (TORs) were prepared and ready for\n            tender. The TORs for the first year's procurement\n            activities should have been prepared and agreed prior to\n            Board approval. In addition, the Bank should have ensured\n            that the agreed procurement methods are the most appropriate\n            for the type of procurement envisaged under the project."}, "docdt": "2006-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
