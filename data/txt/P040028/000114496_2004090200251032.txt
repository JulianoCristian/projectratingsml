Re:
Federal Railways Restructuring and Privatization Project (Loan No. 
4046-BR)
Dear Mr. Resende:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated September 17, 1996 between the 
Federative Republic of Brazil and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank) and to the Project Agreement of the same date between the Bank 
and Rede Ferroviaria Federal S.A. for the above project.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees with the proposed 
restructuring of the project which the recent Bank mission discussed with you and 
representatives of the Ministry of Transport and SEAIN, including: the cancellation or 
the reduction of the scope of several project components as recorded in the November 
1998 mission aide-memoire, the description of the project set forth in Schedule 2 to 
the Loan Agreement remaining unchanged; and the increase of the disbursement 
percentage for Category (1) Separation Grants from 50% to 80% of amounts paid by 
RFFSA. 
As a consequence of this restructuring and other savings made, an amount of 
US$50 million equivalent of the loan will not be required to finance project 
expenditures. Therefore, pursuant to Section 6.03 (b) of the General Conditions, the 
amount of US$50 million equivalent from the loan is hereby canceled as of the date of 
this letter, and the commitment charges on such amount cease to accrue from the date 
of this letter.
Therefore we propose to amend the table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 
to the Loan Agreement as shown on the attachment.  Schedule 3, the Amortizatio 
Schedule, is being revised by the Bank as a result of the cancellation, and the 
revised figures will be sent to you shortly.
If you agree with the foregoing, please sign one of the two originals of this 
letter in the space provided below, and return it to us. This amendment shall enter 
into effect on the date of receipt by the Bank of one original of this letter signed 
by the Borrower’s authorized representative.
Sincerely,
/s/ Gobind T. Nankani
    Director,
    Country Management Unit Brazil
