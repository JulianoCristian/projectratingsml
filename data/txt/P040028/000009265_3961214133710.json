in Brazil's main corridors by restructuring\n            and privatizing the federal railways. Specific objectives\n            are to: 1) improve performance by restructuring and\n            concessioning Rede Ferroviara Federal S.A.'s (RFFSA)\n            operations to private operators, and by restructuring its\n            finances to settle debts and labor liabilities; 2) increase\n            productivity through staff retrenchment and emergency\n            rehabilitation of critical assets in order to make the\n            proposed concessions viable, while minimizing the social\n            cost of staff retrenchment; and 3) enhance competition\n            through regulatory reform, with a view to increase the\n            railways market share and reduce freight transport rates.\n            The project will consist of the following six components: 1)\n            operations restructuring and concessioning component; 2)\n            staff retrenchment program; 3) emergency rehabilitation\n            program; 4) environmental management component; 5)\n            regulatory reform component; and 6) financial restructuring\n            and settlement component."}, "docdt": "1996-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
