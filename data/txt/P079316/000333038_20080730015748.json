the First Development Policy\n            Loan Project for Ukraine were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the cross-sectoral nature of development\n            policy lending remains adequate for a country still facing\n            broad reform challenges. The cross-sectoral design has the\n            advantage of: (i) reflecting the broad nature of\n            Ukraine's reform challenges and the correspondingly\n            broad ranging government reform programs, (ii) allowing for\n            support to be adapted flexibly to changing political\n            priorities within this broad agenda, and (iii) providing an\n            instrument from inter-agency coordination on the side of the\n            authorities and inter-sectoral coordination on the side of\n            the Bank. Monitoring and evaluation indicators should be\n            well defined in terms of availability of data and relatively\n            easy methodology, clear for both sides. In some cases,\n            especially in the areas of trade diversification, corporate\n            governance and parts of the energy sector, the suggested\n            indicators turned out to be too complex for the borrower to\n            calculate them. In some cases the methodology, which the\n            borrower used, was not clear to the Bank. As a result, the\n            calculated indicator was meaningless, and monitoring\n            hampered. Future operations should aim to have a more\n            limited number of outcome targets, drawing on publicly\n            available information and mutually understood methodologies."}, "docdt": "2008-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
