Ukraine\n            - \"Action Plan for Meeting the People\". The\n            project design focuses on the institutional and policy\n            changes necessary to implement the reforms, within the\n            context of Ukraine's European Union (EU) integration\n            efforts, and, is a valuable tool in the process of\n            implementing the Ukraine-EU Action Plan. The DPL program,\n            supported by the project, seeks to integrate government, and\n            donor activities under three broad themes to improve public\n            governance: a) investment climate, b) public administration\n            and public finance management, and, c) social inclusion. It\n            builds on a number of accomplishments supported under the\n            Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL-2), being concluded\n            in parallel with this loan. However, there are political and\n            economic risks, which the DPL's design will seek to\n            mitigate. Engagement will improve the Bank's capacity\n            to help the authorities make appropriate policy decisions.\n            Furthermore, the content of the program creates the basis\n            for sustained, and diversified growth over the medium term.\n            More broadly-based and socially inclusive growth should help\n            dampen the political costs of reform, while reducing social\n            and regional imbalances."}, "docdt": "2005-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
