                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term development objective of the Land Administration Project is to improve the security of land tenure and thereby: (i) develop and establish a
                         national policy, legal, institutional and technical framework to support a systematic property rights administration that is efficient, reliable and equitable; (ii)
                         develop, implement and validate a systematic methodology, which would accelerate and improve the processing of requests for new titles and title reviews in
                         three departments so that it could be subsequently applied nationwide; eliminate backlog of title requests; (iii) achieve substantial progress in the recognition
                         and definition of Indigenous Peoples land rights and demarcate 15 territories and community lands; (iv) achieve substantial progress in the definition and
                         demarcation of existing and proposed protected areas and critical habitats.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is advancing well due to strong Government commitment, strong inter-institutional coordination, and an emphasis on municipal level implementation.
                         Currently, 72 percent of total funds under the project's Additional Financing have been disbursed, and there have been significant achievements in piloting the integrated Cadastral
                         and Registry Information System (SIICAR), as well as in regularization activities.
