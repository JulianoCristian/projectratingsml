F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
PRODEP was designed as a major pilot effort, with two PDOs: (a) to develop the legal,
institutional, technical and participatory framework for the administration of property rights in the
Republic of Nicaragua's territory; and (b) to demonstrate the feasibility of a systematic land rights
regularization program.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
There were no changes to the original PDOs throughout the life of the Project.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Country and Sector Background. Securing property rights and modernizing
land administration is central to Nicaragua’s social and economic development. The
country – one of the poorest in Latin America – experienced years of contradictory legal
and administrative decisions affecting land, which contributed to land tenure insecurity
and undermined the population’s confidence in state institutions. At appraisal, poverty
was overwhelmingly rural and the country was emerging from a post-conflict situation. It
was estimated then that over one third of the rural land was held without a clear title. The
share of land with no or improper documents was critically high among small and poor
producers. Land conflicts due to overlapping claims were numerous. Long-term
insecurity of tenure posed particular challenges to agricultural growth, natural resource
preservation, and social fairness and cohesion. The land claims of indigenous peoples,
some of the most disadvantaged and poorest rural groups, remained mostly unaddressed.
There was also an urgent need to promote gender equity in land ownership because past
agrarian reform programs and inheritance laws had favored males.

2.     To address the above challenges, Nicaragua needed to develop a suitable land
administration framework. This effort demanded legal and institutional changes,
organizational capacity building and modernization of land records. The legal framework
was inconsistent and limited, while the institutional framework needed leadership and
consolidation; for example, an institutional assessment identified 25 institutions that over
time dealt with land allocation and rights. The procedures for land regularization were
cumbersome and centralized, and the land agencies lacked capacity to handle the volume
of pending cases, let alone to engage in a systematic, nation-wide program. Cadastral and
property registry information was outdated or missing in many places, while the existing
cadastral and property registry records were not systematically linked.

3.      Government Strategy. The Government of Nicaragua’s (GoN) interim 1999
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) placed strong emphasis on the development
of rural areas because of their higher incidence of poverty and high growth potential.
Moreover, the Strategy recognized the importance of small towns for the dynamism of
the rural economy. In this context, the Strategy recognized the importance of
strengthening land tenure security as a necessary element to complement other efforts
such as investing in rural infrastructure, implementing demand-driven programs for small
and medium-sized producers, and promoting advanced technologies. In order to address
land tenure insecurity, the Strategy gave priority to legal and institutional reforms, to
improving cadastre and property registry systems, and to the land regularization process.

4.     The GoN had gained relevant experience through the Bank-financed Agricultural
Technology and Land Management Project (ATLMP, P007780, effective 1993-2000),
which included, inter alia, a land titling component, a small cadastre pilot activity, and
improvements in property registry. Aware of the magnitude of the challenge, and



                                             1
consistent with the I-PRSP, the GoN requested Bank support for a pilot project to build
the foundation for launching a long-term national program. Although the proposed scope
was mainly rural, the Government also intended to benefit smaller urban and peri-urban
settlements within the Project area. To make the effort more comprehensive, the GoN
would also request financing from the Nordic Development Fund (NDF).4

5.      Rationale for Bank Involvement. Reflecting Nicaragua’s priorities, the 1999-
2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) had rural development at the center of its
poverty alleviation objectives. In this respect, the Land Administration Project
(PRODEP) was expected to contribute to rural development by helping to remove some
of the impediments to the functioning of land markets and to investments in and
diversification of the rural economy. The Bank was in a unique position to support
Nicaragua’s efforts given its extensive experience in land policy reform and land
administration. In particular, for more than 15 years, its global scope had permitted the
Bank to develop a typology of effective models for cadastre and property registry
systems as well as for land regularization. In Central America, the Bank was supporting
pioneering land projects in Panama, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, in addition to
supporting a growing global portfolio of projects with land-related components. The
Bank had also initiated its partnership for land reform with the GoN through the ATLMP.

6.      Considering the objective of consolidating the pilot effort and IDA resource
constraints, the GoN requested an Additional Financing (AF) Credit in 2009. This AF
was consistent with the 2008-2012 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which
recognized the progress made by Nicaragua in land administration and the importance of
continued Bank support in this area. The AF ensured continuity of the Bank-Government
partnership while a new land operation was prepared. Currently, the Bank is the only
agency supporting land efforts in the country through the Second Land Administration
Project or PRODEP II (P121152, US$40 million).5

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      PRODEP was designed as a major pilot effort, with two PDOs: (a) to develop the
legal, institutional, technical and participatory framework for the administration of
property rights in the Republic of Nicaragua’s territory; and (b) to demonstrate the
feasibility of a systematic land rights regularization program.6




4
  The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) provided a Credit of EUR5.5 million (implemented between 2003 and 2010)
supporting institutional strengthening and urban cadastral surveying in four large urban areas within the Project area,
namely, Chinandega, El Viejo, Estelí and Somoto. These activities complemented well the Bank-financed project.
5
  PRODEP II was approved in March 2013 and is under implementation. Of the US$40 million IDA Credit, US$32
million were allocated for land administration components.
6
  The ICR uses the PDOs stated in the original Development Credit Agreement (DCA), which were reconfirmed in the
Additional Financing Paper and corresponding Financing Agreement. In the PAD (p. 3), the PDO is defined in a
similar way as: “to develop the legal, institutional, and technical framework for the administration of property rights,
and to demonstrate the feasibility of a systematic land rights regularization program.” Throughout the PAD, however,
the PDO is stated in different ways.


                                                           2
8.     According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), key indicators7 were:
 Existence of a lively, broadly attended national debate on the country’s land policy.
 Key legal and procedural reforms have been approved, that permit the carrying out of
   a massive regularization program.
 The Organization Development Plan has been implemented. Longer-term institutional
   reforms are underway.
 A less costly and more effective systematic approach is in place to regularize land
   rights and clear the backlog of titles and legal services provision. Procedural manual
   for the Systematic Legal Cadastre countrywide is finalized.
 Transaction time and cost at the Property Intendancy (IP), the Nicaraguan Institute for
   Territorial Studies (INETER), and the Public Registry of Real Estate and Commercial
   Property (RPPIM) have decreased by at least 30 percent.
 Indigenous Peoples’ land rights are enforced in the selected areas, providing them
   with greater access to land administration services and land tenure security.
 Rate of land degradation in the Project area decreases by 20 percent.
 Potential negative environmental effects from land regularization are less than the
   benefits in the project area.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.      There were no changes to the original PDOs throughout the life of the Project.
Since Project activities were scaled up, key indicators were clarified and adjusted under
the AF building on a first revision of key indicators carried out after the 2006 Mid-Term
Review (MTR). This review had made recommendations to clarify and simplify the
results matrix, including key indicators since their list was considered to be too long and
difficult to monitor. Among other things, certain indicators that measured results for
which direct attribution from project activities was difficult to establish or required
additional interventions beyond the Project scope were eliminated or replaced, including
for instance, the indicator related to land degradation.8

10.     Revised key indicators, as described in Annex 7 of the AF Paper, were:
 Key legal and procedural reforms have been approved, that allow carrying out a
    Comprehensive National Regularization program; land administration system is
    strengthened by the end of the Project. 9
 A less costly, more effective and systematic approach is in place to regularize land
    rights and clear the backlog of titles and legal services provision.




7
  The original key indicators described in the main text of the PAD (see pages 3-4) are not always consistent with the
key indicators described in the results matrix in Annex 1. Based on recommended practice, this ICR lists the key
indicators described in Annex 1.
8
  As corroborated by environmental assessments carried out for Project preparation, land deforestation corresponds to
an indirect, induced effect related to peoples’ behavior influenced by wider social, economic and cultural factors.
9
  As detailed in the datasheet, this indicator was measured through two sub-indicators: (i) reduction in time to
regularize a property; and (ii) percentage of area with irregular status which is given legal certainty.

   At least 70% of beneficiaries receiving new rural titles fall under the category of
    “very small producer” (as defined by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,
    MAGFOR). [New indicator under the AF]
   At least 40% of new titles are provided directly to women and /or jointly with their
    spouse/partner. [New indicator under the AF]
   Transaction time and costs at the IP, Property Intendancy, INETER and the RPPIM
    have decreased.10
   Land taxation rates updated in 33 municipalities in the pilot area through the use of
    cadastral survey information in the Municipal Cadastre System (SISCAT). [New
    indicator under the AF]
   All protected areas under the Project are included in INETER’s geographical database.
   Indigenous Peoples land rights are enforced in 15 territories and are respected by
    government authorities at the national, regional, and municipal levels, providing them
    with greater access to land administration services and land tenure security.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The Project’s primary target group was poor rural households with insecure land
tenure, mainly in the reform sector.11 These beneficiaries live in municipalities of the
target departments of Estelí, Madriz, Chinandega, and under the AF, León.12 The Project
also included beneficiaries in the urban areas of smaller cities in these departments, as
well as in peri-urban areas of municipalities such as León, Managua, Rivas and Granada,
given that many of these areas were considered important for the overall regional
economy. Reflecting its additional focus on indigenous territories, the Project also
included the Caribbean region, which is the poorest area in the country and the one with
most of the indigenous population. Seeking to complete the cadastre in some key
municipalities, and consistent with the urban focus of NDF-financed cadastral activities,
additional urban and peri-urban areas were considered under the AF.

12.      Overall, the Project's direct beneficiaries included: (a) rural and urban households
in participating municipalities who would benefit from systematic cadastral surveying,
titling, and regularization services, as well as individuals who would benefit from
demand-based regularization; (b) women in participating municipalities, who would
benefit from titling and regularization services by promoting issuance of titles jointly to
couples and to female-headed households; (c) indigenous communities living in the
territories of the Caribbean Region that would benefit from demarcation and titling, and
potentially other communities living in some of the participating municipalities in the
Pacific and Central regions; (d) authorities and technical staff of participating
municipalities, who would benefit from technical assistance, cadastral information, and
improved coordination with land administration agencies; and (e) land administration


10
   As detailed in the datasheet, this indicator was measured through two sub-indicators: (i) reduction in time to register
a transaction; and (ii) financial sustainability of property registries in the Project area.
11
   The “reform sector” corresponds to Agrarian Reform beneficiaries from the 1980s and the 1990s (PAD p.6).
12
   These departments were selected on the basis of criteria such as levels of poverty, tenure insecurity and land
conflicts.


                                                            4
agencies, which would benefit from an improved governance structure and capacity
development. More generally, the Project would benefit the country’s population through
the development of the legal and institutional framework for property rights,
mainstreaming of methodologies and increased capacity for cadastre and regularization.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

13.     The Project had six original components:
A. Policy and Legal Reforms (US$0.57 million or 1.5 percent of total project cost). This
    component aimed to strengthen the country’s land policy and legal frameworks
    through, inter alia, the development of a national land policy framework, and the
    development of key laws related to indigenous peoples’ land rights in the Caribbean
    region, the modernization of cadastre and property registry systems, and to the
    enabling of their technological integration.
B. Institutional Strengthening and Decentralization (US$13.77 million or 35.6 percent
    of total project cost). This component would help improve national institutional
    capacity through activities such as: (i) establishing the National Directorate of Land
    and Agrarian Reform; (ii) implementing a new organizational model for cadastre and
    regularization; (iii) increasing efficiency in land administration services; and (iv)
    promoting coordination between land sector institutions.
C. Titling and regularization services (US$16.61 million or 43 percent of total project
    cost) to develop and implement a land regularization methodology that would serve
    as a foundation for a long-term, comprehensive program. This component would also
    support processing of land claims and conflict resolution.
D. Demarcation and Consolidation of Protected Areas (US$2.40 million or 6.2 percent
    of total project cost) to physically demarcate selected protected areas, formulate
    management plans in a participatory manner, and implement a social and
    environmental communication program in and around these areas.
E. Demarcation of Indigenous Peoples’ Lands (US$2.61 million or 6.8 percent of total
    project cost). This component would support the strengthening of indigenous peoples’
    land rights in the Caribbean region through demarcation and titling of selected
    indigenous territories, including within the Bosawas Reserve, and the development of
    a limited number of territorial management plans.
F. Information Systems (US$2.70 million or 7.0 percent of total project costs) to develop
    an efficient technological framework (i) to help modernize cadastre and registry
    services and land titling and regularization procedures (including through the piloting
    of an Integrated Cadastre-Registry Information System or SIICAR), and (ii) to ensure
    adequate Project management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

1.6 Revised Components

14.     While the six components were maintained throughout Project implementation,
the 2010 AF introduced changes to scale up activities in four of them. The original
project components (A) and (E) did not receive additional resources under the AF since
their activities had been satisfactorily completed under the original Credit. The changes
are as follows:



                                            5
A. Policy and Legal Reforms (US$0.57 million or 1.2 percent of total project cost). No
   changes.
B. Institutional Strengthening and Decentralization (US$3.56 million under the AF, for
   a total of US$17.33 million or 35.6% of total project cost). The main changes under
   this component aimed to support: (i) the organizational development plan under the
   IP; (ii) the strengthening of the Project Coordination Unit (SE-PRODEP or PCU);
   and (c) the provision of technical assistance and equipment for land titling to peri-
   urban areas in the cities of Granada, Managua, León and Rivas.
C. Titling and regularization services (US$5.29 million under the AF, for a total of
   US$21.90 or 45% of total project cost). Main modifications to this component
   included: (i) supporting field supervision and quality control and the social
   communication campaign; and (ii) broadening the support for demand-based land
   claims from marginal peri-urban settlers to urban and peri-urban ones.
D. Demarcation and Consolidation of Protected Areas (US$0.25 million under the AF,
   for a total of US$2.65 or 5.4% of total project cost). The key adjustments to this
   component included the demarcation of two additional protected areas, and carrying
   out of a social and environmental communication campaign in communities located
   near these protected areas.
E. Demarcation of Indigenous Lands (US$2.61 million or 5.3% of total project cost). No
   changes.
F. Information Systems (US$0.90 million under the AF, for a total of US$3.60 or 7.4%
   of total project cost). This component was mainly adjusted by including a more
   detailed description of M&E activities, and by transferring the financing of project
   audits to sub-component B.3 (Support to Project Management).

1.7 Other significant changes

15.      2007 Project Restructuring. Based on the 2006 MTR’s findings and agreements,
a first Project restructuring was approved in January 2007 that included: (a) an extension
of the Closing Date to December 31, 2008; (b) a revision of the implementation
arrangements that replaced the original Project Technical and Administrative Unit
(UTAP) with an Executive Secretariat; (c) a reallocation of expenditure categories; (d) an
increase to 100 percent financing of eligible expenditures; (e) an update to the then new
2004 Bank’s Procurement Guidelines; and (f) an incorporation of new procurement
methods. Due to a governmental transition, signing by GoN of the respective legal
amendment would take place five months later.

16.     2008 Project Restructuring. In December 2007, seeking to strengthen leadership
in the land sector and to improve project performance, the new government proposed to
change the implementation arrangements, including transferring the Project from the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) to the Attorney General’s Office (PGR)
and restructuring the Project Inter-Institutional Committee (CIP). In parallel, the GoN
implemented an action plan for institutional strengthening of the IP. The Project
restructuring, which also included an extension of the Credit closing date to October 31,
2009, was approved by the Bank in February 2008 and countersigned by the GoN a
month later.



                                            6
17.    2010 Additional Financing. To scale up Project activities, an AF Credit of SDR
6.3 million (US$10 million equivalent) was approved on February 16, 2010, which
increased the total financing amount to SDR 32.6 million (US$42.6 million equivalent).
Since it had successfully completed its activities, MAGFOR was not included as a co-
executing agency under the AF and its responsibility for M&E was transferred to PGR.
The closing date of the original Credit was extended to July 2010.

18.     Change in Project area under the Additional Financing. The AF included the
original municipalities in Chinandega, Estelí and Madriz, as well as municipalities in an
additional department, León. The inclusion of the new municipalities in León allowed for
the completion of cadastral surveying for the whole department.

19.    Extension of Closing Dates. The Project officially ended in April 2013 after four
closing date extensions of the original Credit, and the expected implementation period of
the AF. The closing date extensions of the original Credit included: (a) with the January
2007 restructuring from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 to allow for additional
time required to achieve PDOs and targets; (b) with the February 2008 restructuring, to
October 31, 2009 to provide additional time for the completion of key activities; (c) with
the approval of a six-month extension in May 2009 to April 30, 2010 to allow for the
preparation of the AF; and (d) with the approval of the AF, to July 2010 to ensure
continuity with the AF and the adequate closing of credit accounts.

20.     Reallocation of funds across expenditure categories. The 2007 restructuring
reallocated credit proceeds from categories that had savings in order to support the
demarcation and titling of indigenous peoples’ lands, which required additional funding.

21.     Funds cancellation. Funds were cancelled under the original Credit and AF due
to Project efficiencies and savings related to fluctuations of the SDR exchange rate.
Specifically, SDR 820,855.23 (US$1,241,559.95 equivalent) was canceled at the closing
of the original Credit, and SDR 20,807.51 (US$ 13,492.07 equivalent) at the closing of
the AF.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.     Soundness of Background Analysis. Project design was based on a thorough
analysis, including a growing body of knowledge on land administration and
regularization. Moreover, the ATLMP provided valuable insights, reinforced by lessons
learned from projects financed by the Bank and other development partners. Project
design also benefited from a Bank-funded comprehensive land tenure diagnostic study
and from specific institutional, economic and gender analyses. These studies provided a
solid basis to define the PDOs, components and activities, and to select the Project area.
AF design took advantage of knowledge already generated by the Project and new
operational and technical lessons.



                                            7
23.     Assessment of Project Design. Considering the many legal and institutional
constraints and the challenging land tenure issues faced by Nicaragua, the Project was
designed as a five-year pilot effort. This decision reflected the well founded conclusion
that before a large, countrywide program could be undertaken, the country needed, in the
long term, to develop its capacity, strengthen its land agencies, eliminate bureaucratic
bottlenecks and legal uncertainties, and switch to a modern system and technologically-
advanced process within a clearer and consolidated legal and institutional framework. It
seems, however, that despite such an in-depth understanding of the country context and
needs, the final design of PRODEP as a “pilot project” may have been somewhat
ambitious. In particular, it was expected that several key laws would be prepared and
passed during the first half of the Project implementation period.

24.     Project design was strengthened by focusing on socially defined rights to land that
are not always formally defined. This was applied not only through the focus on the land
rights of indigenous communities but more broadly through: (a) the mainstreaming of
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms; (b) assistance to agrarian reform sector
beneficiaries in putting together evidence of their property claims; and (c) strengthening
of the role of Regional Councils 13 and other key agencies such as the National
Commission for Demarcation and Titling of Indigenous Territories (CONADETI).

25.     At the design stage, the Project anticipated the need for an innovative M&E
approach given the political and social sensitivity of land issues and the potential impact
of proposed legal and institutional changes. However, details of the system and capacity
building for its implementation were not sufficiently considered. Likewise, more
attention should have been paid to baseline data generation.

26.     Risk Assessment. Overall Project Risk was assessed as Moderate at appraisal.
This rating, in retrospect, seems to have underestimated the challenges of the project
related to its innovative nature and institutional weaknesses. Most of the identified risks
materialized during Project implementation, while in several cases the proposed
mitigation measures were not effective. One of these risks, rated as moderate – the
possibility of coordination problems between co-executing agencies under a
decentralized implementation framework – materialized early on. The proposed
mitigation measure of establishing a high level Project Inter-Institutional Committee
(CIP) proved ineffective initially, although a solution was identified once the CIP was
restructured under new implementation arrangements. An additional, difficult to mitigate
risk that especially affected capacity building was staff turnover in some co-executing
agencies and municipalities caused by government changes after electoral cycles.

27.     The risk that the approval of a key law such as the Public Registry Law would not
be achieved before the MTR was also underestimated as Moderate, and no concrete
mitigation measures were identified. This issue, which was critical for property registry

     Regional Councils are elected bodies composed of representatives in the two autonomous regions in the Caribbean.


                                                            8
modernization, including the implementation of SIICAR, remained unresolved until the
National Assembly finally approved the law in 2009.

28.    On the other hand, the high risk associated with the political sensitivity of
recognition of indigenous peoples’ land rights was correctly flagged at appraisal as
Substantial. Mitigation measures were sensible and comprised reliance on progress that
could be achieved outside of the enactment of such law, such as conflict resolution and
boundary demarcation. The additional social and reputational risks identified under the
AF, related to unresolved tenure issues in municipalities with indigenous communities in
the Pacific and Central regions, did not materialize thanks to GoN’s commitment to
recognizing indigenous peoples’ land rights and close supervision.

2.2 Implementation

29.     Implementation was satisfactory for most of the Project’s life, underpinned by
strong Government commitment. Given the Project’s innovative nature and the difficult
challenges faced by Nicaragua, implementation had been conceived at appraisal as
having two distinct phases. The first half of implementation would focus on preparation
and field activities in one of the target departments, while the second half, following the
MTR, would expand field activities to the rest of the Project area. In this context, the
MTR was critical. As some of the issues mentioned below emerged, PRODEP became an
actual problem project during 2005, when the second phase of project implementation
was expected to start. After corroborating implementation improvements, the 2006 MTR
concluded that the project could achieve its PDOs. PRODEP would again become a
problem project in 2007, but after 2008 it remained in satisfactory status until the end of
implementation.

30.    Several factors helped implementation positively:

31.    Continuous Government-Bank partnership and strong Government commitment.
The Government and the Bank built a solid partnership on land administration
modernization, which has ensured continuous technical and financial support and close
collaboration. In parallel, throughout Project implementation the GoN demonstrated its
commitment to PDO achievement. The early enactment of Law 445 (Law for Collective
Land Rights of Indigenous Peoples) sent an important signal of the intention to recognize
indigenous peoples’ land rights. And after 2007 in particular, a renewed commitment
from GoN expedited project implementation.

32.     Changes in implementation arrangements. The appointment of the PGR as
Implementing Agency and the restructuring of the CIP fostered a closer inter-institutional
collaboration, especially between the judicial branch (property registry) and the executive
(cadastre, regularization), strengthened co-executing agencies’ institutional capacities and
improved implementation. In addition, the IP was transferred from MHCP to PGR as a
decentralized unit, which contributed to institutional consolidation. These changes,
backed by strong government commitment, contributed to smooth project implementation.




                                             9
33.     Multi-agency support. The GoN expanded its efforts with support from other
development partners such as the NDF and the US-Millennium Challenge Corporation
(MCC). NDF provided a credit of EUR5.5 million to support institutional strengthening
and urban cadastral and regularization activities outside the scope of the Project. In
addition, MCC financed the successful piloting of a new methodology for cadastral
surveying and regularization that would be applied under the AF and eventually scaled up
under PRODEP II. Moreover, MCC transferred to PGR about US$2.6 million in
equipment and vehicles that supported the implementation of this methodology at the
time of the AF, and also funded the studies and assessments needed to prepare the AF.

34.   Several factors – some outside and some within the control of government
and implementing agencies – adversely affected the Project:

35.      Electoral cycles. Project implementation spanned two national as well as regional
and municipal elections, although the disruptions were not as severe as they could have
been. Several factors contributed to project continuity after the 2007 national elections:
(i) institutional and operational support of the Project’s CIP; (ii) withdrawal of potential
legal reforms that could have obstructed PDO achievement, such as Law 512 (creation of
a new property institute); and (iii) maintenance of most of the core Project staff. Still, the
Project did experience some delays on account of negotiations in the National Assembly
as well as some disruption after municipal elections in November 2007. In particular,
there were three Project Coordinators in 12 months in 2007.

36.      Complexity of indigenous peoples’ land titling. Progress on the recognition of
indigenous peoples’ land rights was a concern for much of the Project life. Two years
into the Project, institutional responsibilities for and communication with the Bank on the
component were still not well defined although the pertinent law had been passed in 2003.
Once implementation began, demarcation and titling processes advanced slowly because
of inter-territorial conflicts, remoteness of the sites, and the need to ensure adequate
consultations. An emblematic example is the Awas Tingni territory, which had been the
subject of an Inter-American Human Rights Court ruling in favor of the Mayagna
communities living in this territory. In addition, registration of the titles for the first five
territories (located in Bosawas) experienced delays because the titles needed to be
annulled and reissued to minimize the prospect of future legal challenges. Finally,
unresolved tenure issues also posed challenges during the regularization process in
municipalities with indigenous communities in the Pacific and Central Regions. Although
the Government demonstrated its commitment and cadastral process advanced in some of
these municipalities, the legal framework was not always conducive to dealing with
issues of indigenous land rights in these regions. Careful Bank supervision of social
issues supported Government efforts in addressing the concerns of communities and
helped to facilitate their participation.

37.     Delays in regularization and titling of individual properties. The Cadastre Law’s
approval was expected at appraisal by November 2003, but it took place only in 2005.
Additionally, weak institutional and contract management capacity at the beginning of
Project implementation, and the slow learning curve of country conditions by some of the



                                              10
firms, resulted in problems with large international contracts related to cadastral
surveying. Achievement of targets accelerated thanks to a “demand-based titling
strategy” with strong municipal focus, improved contract management and technical
capacity, better performance of co-executing agencies, and the adoption of a new
cadastral survey methodology. Together with the additional implementation period, these
improvements helped increase the number of titled properties to more than two and a half
times the original target.

38.     Delays in registration of individual properties. As regularization and issuing of
new tittles accelerated, and the volume of new titles increased due to GoN’s broader
efforts, the RPPIM faced capacity constraints for registration. The RPPIM has pro-
actively dealt with this issue, and implemented an Action Plan under the Project since
2011. This plan, which included the recruitment of additional personnel and training, has
led to accelerated improvements in registration rates. For instance, between January and
July 2013 RPPIM received 17,723 titles and registered 10,402, achieving a much
improved rate of 58 percent.

39.     Delays in developing and testing SIICAR and initial technical issues in its
implementation. Development and implementation of SIICAR, which was to be carried
out first in Chinandega, suffered delays due to contract management issues and the need
to make system adjustments. Initial implementation, as in many cases where new
technological platforms are developed in an evolving legal and procedural environment,
presented new challenges that required stabilization before a decision was made on how
and when to continue SIICAR’s expansion to other areas.

40.    Ensuring active participation of municipalities. Project design included working
closely with municipalities to facilitate regularization and to ensure maintenance of
cadastral information. Although initially their participation in the Project was marginal,
municipalities have been effectively supported by the Nicaraguan Institute of Municipal
Development (INIFOM) and gradually made key partners of IP and INETER.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

41.     M&E design. The original Project Results Matrix (detailed in Annex 1 of the
PAD) had shortcomings, especially if assessed on the basis of current M&E practice.
Some of the PDO outcome indicators were unrealistic, especially its expected time for
achievement. Establishment of baselines, in particular, could have been costly and time
consuming. Nonetheless, development of a practical methodology and baseline survey to
measure some of the key potential economic, environmental, social, and gender impacts
identified in the PAD should have been attempted at the time of the original design.

42.     Building on the MTR revision to M&E design, the AF supported the
implementation of the Monitoring and Impact Evaluation System (SMEI) including: (a)
maintaining a specialized unit to ensure adequate attention to M&E; (b) carrying out of
validation and consultation workshops with Project beneficiaries; (c) conducting relevant
studies as agreed in the M&E Strategy included in the Operational Manual, such as



                                           11
evaluation of the efficiency of the property registry and regularization services and a
study for the updating of relevant baseline information; and (d) carrying out of the Project
impact evaluation during the last year of implementation.

43.     Implementation and Use. Appropriate data for PDO indicators were not always
systematically collected, especially in the initial implementation phase. The Project’s
M&E Unit (SMEI) was transferred from MAGFOR to PGR in 2009. Thanks to the
GoN’s concerted effort and enhanced inter-institutional coordination, overall M&E
improved under the AF, and monitoring reports were used more appropriately for project
management. Specific technical missions with the support of the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) were conducted in April and June 2012 to support
the GoN in the final project evaluation. For this evaluation, in addition to measurement of
Project indicators, the GoN commissioned a household-level impact evaluation, cost
effectiveness assessments of the RPPIM and IP operations, and an ex-post economic and
financial analysis. Initial results of these studies supported the preparation of PRODEP II,
and the final evaluation report provided valuable information for this ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

44.     Safeguard Compliance. The Project was classified as Category B, and triggered
the following policies: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Natural Habitats
(OP/BP 4.10), Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10), Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP
4.12),14 Forests (OP/BP 4.36), and Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.01).15

45.     Environmental safeguards. Overall, environmental safeguard compliance is
satisfactory. As corroborated during supervision missions and assessments carried out for
the preparation of the 2010 AF and the 2013 PRODEP II, the Project did not have any
major or irreversible negative environmental impacts. Moreover, no field evidence was
found of any indirect environmental impacts such as increased deforestation because of
land regularization. Positively, at the end of the Project, all major Protected Areas (PAs)
in the target departments had been physically demarcated and certain areas of ecological
importance identified, while awareness of environmental issues increased among people
living within and around these areas. This, in turn, has allowed stakeholders, who are
critical for conservation and development of PAs, to know these areas’ precise
boundaries and to respect or implement better the rules and activities identified in the
respective protected area’s management plan. Targets for the preparation of management
plans for the PAs and implementation of some of these plans were surpassed. Although
monitoring of potential environmental impacts was not always even across project
components, this does not seem to have resulted in any major safeguard issues.


14
   This policy was triggered in relation to the demarcation of protected areas, which could potentially lead to
restrictions of people’s access to natural resources. The systematic cadastral and regularization activities fell under the
exception set forth in footnote 8 of OP4.12, specifically the second part stating, “the policy does not apply to disputes
between private parties in land titling projects.”
15
   The same policies applied throughout Project implementation, but at the time of the original Credit’s approval the
following older versions of policies applied: Cultural Property (OPN 11.03) and Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20). These
policies were updated under the 2010 Additional Financing.


                                                           12
46.     Social Safeguards. Social safeguard compliance is also considered generally
satisfactory. Based on supervision missions, the assessments mentioned above, and an
analysis of the consultation process within the framework of OP4.10 carried out by the
Bank in 2012, it can be concluded that: (i) indigenous peoples were adequately consulted
throughout project implementation; (ii) their broad support for relevant project activities
was ensured; and (iii) relevant project activities considered indigenous peoples’ social
organization and culture. As detailed in Section 3, remarkable progress was made in the
recognition of indigenous peoples’ land rights in the Caribbean Region. In addition, the
Project also benefited 20,250 indigenous peoples of two indigenous communities of the
Pacific and Central Regions through cadastral surveying, despite several major
challenges. These challenges included limitations in the legal framework, as well as
historical factors influencing the socio-political situation of indigenous communities
living in these regions. 16 At the end of the Project there were three indigenous
communities in target municipalities in the Pacific and Central Regions where project
activities could not be implemented. However, the GoN has demonstrated its
commitment to respecting their land rights and has continued consultations with them. If
an agreement is reached, cadastral and regularization activities for these communities
would be financed under PRODEP II.

47.      Field evidence corroborated that demarcation of protected areas did not result in
restrictions to access to natural resources for persons living in the buffer zones or nearby
the PAs. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) promoted co-
management of protected areas and the involvement of communities living within the
PA’s buffer zones in the preparation and implementation of management plans to ensure
environmental sustainability and accessibility to people living in nearby areas. Safeguard
compliance and overall social and environmental sustainability was facilitated by the
implementation of a Communication Strategy, which was strengthened under the AF.

48.     Fiduciary Compliance. No major fiduciary issues requiring Government or Bank
attention emerged throughout Project implementation, as corroborated by audit reports
and procurement post-reviews.

49.     Financial Management. At Project closing the overall Financial Management was
rated as Satisfactory due to stable Project management overtime based on adequate
experience in financial management (including accounting records, interim financial
reports or IFRs, and external audits). In addition, the PCU was proactive in addressing
minor shortcomings in the supervision of external audits.

50.   Procurement. Procurement performance at project closing was rated Satisfactory.
The Procurement Unit at the PCU was assessed as having adequate capacity to comply


16
  In contrast to the Caribbean region, the legal framework in the Pacific and Central regions is not as conducive to
recognizing indigenous territorial rights. Moreover, indigenous peoples in these regions are more difficult to
differentiate from other ethnic groups due to the disintegration of their cultural patterns and insertion within the
Spanish culture and political institutions of the Nation/State structure.


                                                        13
with Bank’s procurement standards and procedures. Overall, close supervision, adoption
of the Electronic Procurement Management System (SEPA), and periodic fiduciary
training for government and project staff generated good results.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51.     Within the framework of a 15-year National Land Program, a second operation
(PRODEP II, US$$40 million) was approved in March 2013. The new project continues
to support transparency and efficiency in the land administration sector, with similar
components to PRODEP while expanding its activities to other municipalities. PRODEP
II is supporting the further consolidation of the policy and institutional framework, and
strengthening of key land agencies; advancing the integration of the cadastral and
property registry information; land regularization; strengthening of indigenous peoples’
land rights; and demarcation of protected areas.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

52.    The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) remain highly relevant and are
consistent with the 2008 National Plan for Human Development (NPHD) and the current
World Bank’s CPS (FY2013-2017). The 2008 NPHD identified land as a factor of
economic, social and cultural cohesion, and described the regularization of land tenure,
cadastre, land titling and territorial development as fundamental aspects in achieving
enhancements in agricultural production and development in general. The CPS reiterates
the importance of land issues for Nicaragua, and included a second land operation
(PRODEP II), which is already under implementation.

53.     Project design was consistent with the PDOs and remains relevant to ongoing
and planned efforts to continue strengthening property rights. The Project was flexible,
allowing for adjustments to reflect emerging good practices regarding institutional
strengthening, implementation responsibilities and modalities, the engagement of local
governments and communities, and different methodological approaches. The original
focus on protecting the property rights of indigenous populations and on demarcating
protected areas remains highly relevant and positively contributes to the positioning of
the country in contemporary regional and global policy debates on these topics, including
social accountability, disaster risk mitigation and climate change.

54.     Project implementation supported the evolution of the legal and institutional
framework for regularization and cadastre services, through the development and
implementation of an extensive pilot program, and modernization of cadastre and
property registry services including the development of SIICAR. Implementation of these
activities remained highly relevant at project closing because of the growing significance
of well-defined property rights for both households in terms of security of occupation and
production and for municipalities faced with growing demands related to land use
planning, service provision and property taxation. The changes introduced through the



                                           14
2007 and 2008 restructurings maintained the relevance of implementation arrangements,
which have been continued under PRODEP II.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

55.       As described below, the Project achieved its two PDOs:

Develop the legal, institutional, technical and participatory framework for the
administration of property rights (achieved)

56.     With Project support, a more solid and clearer land administration framework has
been established in Nicaragua. The country’s policy and legal framework has been
positively transformed, key land agencies’ capacity strengthened, and their services
decentralized within pilot areas. Regarding the policy framework, PRODEP supported
the preparation and implementation of a National Land Policy Framework and a
Protected Area Land Policy. Moreover, as substantiated by a 2012 assessment, the key
legal and procedural changes achieved under the Project have established the conditions
to implement adequately a countrywide land regularization program. In particular, the
2005 Cadastre Law has facilitated the modernization of cadastral processes and
information, and the 2009 Public Registry Law has furthered the modernization of the
RPPIM and the systematic integration of cadastral and registry information. This law had
a major institutional impact by finally bringing together under a national system all the 17
regional property registries of the country. Importantly, the law also mandated the
establishment of the Special Commission of Property Registries 17 to set policy and
national procedures and standards, and the National Directorate of Property Registries18
for administrative and operational purposes.

57.      The historical importance and social impact of the 2003 Law for Collective Land
Rights of Indigenous Peoples cannot be overemphasized. Thanks to the approval and
implementation of this law, supported by the Project, poor and marginalized indigenous
communities in the Caribbean Region have received collective titles to 15 of their
ancestral territories, comprising over 22,000 square kilometers – or close to 19 percent of
the national territory. Legal recognition, at the same time, strengthened the recognition by
central, regional and local authorities of the traditional forms of governance of these
territories. The experience and capacity created through the Project has provided the basis
for the Government’s continued effort to recognize the land rights of the rest of
indigenous communities in the Caribbean Region.19

58.    Institutional consolidation is evident, inter alia, in the integration of the IP (the
land regularization agency) under the PGR, and the clear mandate given to PGR to
coordinate the land agenda in the country. Implementation of SIICAR has fostered a


17
   Four Supreme Court judges, including the President of the Court, integrate the National Commission.
18
   Previously, each property registrar applied procedures discretionally, and was managed directly by an individual
Supreme Court judge.
19
   Currently, the GoN has titled 21 indigenous territories in the Caribbean Region. With this effort, only one territory
(currently being titled) and two complementary areas (included under PRODEP II) are pending.


                                                          15
closer partnership between the Supreme Court (CSJ) – which is responsible for the
property registries – and executive branch agencies in charge of the national cadastre
(INETER) and regularization (IP). Institutional capacity, at the same time, was improved
with the satisfactory implementation of organizational development plans and the
preparation of manuals and guides. Technical capacity has also improved, reaching a
point at the time of the AF where it was possible for the relevant agencies to implement
directly the activities that at the beginning of the Project had to be contracted out to
international firms. This capacity has been gradually institutionalized as close to 700
people that have worked and gained experience under the Project and other externally
financed initiatives have been made staff of the key land agencies.

59.     Decentralization of services has advanced, and INETER and IP currently have
regional offices within the Project area. Furthermore, municipalities now have a clearer
role in the land administration framework. The SISCAT was upgraded and is being
linked to INETER’s database in selected places, and local capacity for land
administration improved, although not evenly across all local governments. Central land
agencies partnered effectively with local governments to improve the results of
regularization efforts. Challenges remain regarding the effective incorporation of
municipalities into the national cadastre system, but a select number of municipalities
have received the information generated by the Project and are using the information to
improve tax revenues, territorial planning, and to advance in the integration of the
graphic information in SISCAT.

60.     The above results have improved the efficiency of the land agencies. As
corroborated by an independent assessment, for instance, on average, the time taken to
conduct a land transaction within the pilot areas has been cut by more than half.
Correspondingly, the number of trips to conduct a transaction has also been reduced, with
time and monetary savings for users of the land administration system. SIICAR is now
fully operational in Chinandega, and after some delays, its implementation is advancing
in other target departments. As SIICAR is further consolidated, efficiency results and
confidence in the system are likely to improve.

Demonstrate the feasibility of a systematic land rights regularization program
(achieved)

61.     The systematic land rights regularization methodology developed and tested
under the Project has provided the country with the foundation to launch a long-term
national program. The GoN has already outlined its vision for and is implementing a 15-
year National Land Program with an overarching goal of continuing to promote land
governance while advancing cadastral and regularization processes and improving land
administration services. The Project’s regularization methodology has incorporated
current technologies and global good practices, and by responding to Nicaragua’s needs
and challenges, it has simultaneously increased national capacity and institutional
ownership of project results. This methodology has been mainstreamed by land agencies
and has already been scaled up in other areas of the country beyond the pilot departments,
and is being applied under PRODEP II.



                                           16
62.     Implementation of this methodology has benefited over 61,690 rural and urban,
mostly poor households with titles to their land. Importantly, 85 percent of rural
beneficiaries receiving new titles are categorized as “small and very small producers” and
approximately 60 percent of new titles were provided directly to women and/or jointly
with their spouse/partner. In terms of physical targets, the methodology specifically
resulted in 32,677 regularized properties, and 222,134 parcels were surveyed for a total
area of 10.503.09 km2, which represent a 107 percent and 95 percent increase in the
number of parcels and the area respectively. Total surveyed area corresponds to almost
20 percent of the country’s land area. Targets were exceeded regarding demarcation of
protected areas, with 14 areas demarcated and 10 Management Plans prepared under the
Project (original targets were 11 and 7, respectively). Management of protected areas
seems to have improved as a result.

63.     The database and mapping migration to the National Cadastre Database (BND)
under INETER was completed in 30 municipalities, allowing the update of the data
collected in the area back in the seventies, which in turn strengthened municipal finance
by expanding the potential Property Income Tax (IBI) taxable base and local land and
development planning. Given improved efficiencies the Public Registry is financially
sustainable.

64.     Finally, the methodology also allowed improving capacity for alternative conflict
resolution, which is critical as part of any land rights regularization program. DIRAC,
also under the CSJ, stands out in the region regarding its methods and procedures for land
conflict mediation. At Project closing the number of land conflicts mediated by DIRAC
totaled 1,622. Over time, the process of alternative conflict mediation has proven to be a
vital and effective tool contributing to a culture of peace and negotiation in the country.

3.3 Efficiency

65.     An ex-post economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic efficiency
of the Project through a cost-benefit analysis, using actual project outputs and costs. The
analysis also compared the economic feasibility indicators (i.e. Net Present Value and
Economic IRR) to those obtained at appraisal.

66.     The analysis applied the same methodology and assumptions used for the ex-ante
analysis with some minor exceptions that are explained in Annex 3. Costs included direct
expenditures in the regularization process and development of technological platforms
and administration/coordination expenses. The economic benefits accounted for in the
analysis are the expected increases in property values derived from a sense of enhanced
security of tenure owing to land regularization and titling.

67.    At appraisal, the discounted net benefits of the Project were estimated at US$7.4
million with an Economic Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 19 and 21 percent for the
Original Credit and Additional Financing (AF), respectively. At completion, the
discounted net benefits were estimated at US$17.4 million, and the Economic IRR at 23.6



                                            17
percent (Table 1). It is evident that ex-post discounted net economic benefits are
significantly higher, more than double, than those estimated at appraisal. The difference
is largely explained by the higher than anticipated number of urban properties regularized
and titled as a result of project activities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

68.     As detailed above, the Project remains highly relevant, while its PDOs were
achieved and most of its performance indicators were met or exceeded, which likely
improved the economic situation of poor households. Building on Project results, the
country has already launched a national land program. Although several targets were not
fully achieved in the expected timeframe under the original Credit, results within the AF
period were achieved six months before the expected three-year period. Targets that were
not fully achieved were in most cases substantially achieved, and this shortfall was more
than compensated by surpassed targets on indicators of equal or greater relative weight.
The net economic benefits were significantly higher than those expected at appraisal. The
legal and institutional framework is clearer and more consolidated, and SIICAR is fully
operational even though its expansion was more limited than originally planned. For
these reasons, the Project is rated as satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

69.     Poverty Impacts and Social Development. The Project was expected to increase
access to secure land tenure for the rural poor, considered as a starting point for the
accumulation of assets and opportunities for accessing credit markets. Moreover, Project
design acknowledged that land titling on its own was not sufficient for poverty reduction,
and that broader land tenure regularization would most likely lead to positive impacts on
land-related investments, land values, and land use. The four departments within the
Project intervention area were identified as the ones with higher indices of poverty and



20
  For presentation purposes, gross and net benefits, and costs of AF ex-ante analysis have been discounted to year 0 of
PRODEP with a 12 percent discount rate.


                                                         18
extreme poverty. According to M&E workshops held in 2012, Project beneficiaries (land
title recipients) have experienced an increase in the value of their land assets, enhanced
livelihoods, better access to credit, and regularized their water and electricity services.
Significantly, having a title has allowed them to benefit from other Government programs
that require legal documents confirming property ownership. Critically, the project has
also contributed to social peace and cohesion.

70.    Gender Aspects. The Project’s Gender Strategy aimed to reduce the gender gap
in access to land nationwide, and particularly in the four Project departments. Of the rural
and urban beneficiaries with land titles, 51 percent are women. Apart from benefiting
from land titles, 787 women participated in more than 100 workshops on environmental
management in the Project’s 14 protected areas. In the 15 indigenous territories, more
than 50 percent of PRODEP beneficiaries were women. Moreover, in ten of the 33
municipalities within the Project area, the heads of SISCAT are women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

71.    As noted in Section 3.2, the Project has significantly strengthened the institutional
framework for land administration and improved inter-institutional coordination. As
evidenced by several Project indicators (Annex 2), the overall impacts of the institutional
changes are already visible in the improved efficiency and increasing equity of the land
administration services. Also, there is better collaboration between central and local
government institutions.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

72.      In 2012, a household socio-economic survey to evaluate the impacts of the
regularization and titling activities was conducted. The survey methodology and results
are detailed in Annex 5. In summary, Project beneficiaries were generally satisfied with
the cadastral and regularization services. Additionally, investment in home construction
and improvement was greater in the titled Project areas than in the control group,
consistent with the theory of the positive effects of land tenure regularization. Project and
non-project rural households were not found to differ substantially in their propensity to
undertake commercial activities on their plots and such parity was also observed in
perceived security of tenancy and access to credit, when non-Project households were
compared only with rural households who had experienced both cadastral surveying and
titling. As expected, at the end of the Project, rural Project beneficiary households are
more progressive in having women as property titleholders than non-Project beneficiaries.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

73.     Risk to development outcome is rated as moderate considering that the GoN has a
clear vision and is implementing a long-term land program. As part of this program, the
GoN continues to invest, including through the Bank-financed PRODEP II, in the
consolidation of the policy and institutional framework, and in the modernization and



                                            19
integration of cadastral and property registry information. There are several factors
contributing to the overall sustainability of project outcomes: (i) SIICAR is already
operational with developed platforms, operational and technical manuals, and
institutional support, and an upgraded version is being developed and expanded to
additional departments beyond Chinandega; (ii) increased focus on the participation and
future role of municipalities in the maintenance of the national cadastre system; (iii)
increased national capacity for land administration including the hiring of close to 700
persons who had been trained and worked on the Project as consultants or technicians;
and (iv) stronger inter-institutional coordination and collaboration. There are nevertheless
several potential internal and external risks:

74.    Internal risks. Potential internal risks include degradation, vulnerability, and
underutilization of the cadastral information. Although it is unlikely that the information
will become obsolete in the short term, cadastral information can be at risk of becoming
outdated if it is not regularly maintained. In this respect, municipalities are the weakest
link in the land administration system and technical capacity and interest in cadastre
remains limited across several municipalities. Moreover, it is critical that the RPPIM
offices receive adequate resources to sustain the impact of system modernization.
Encouragingly, there is a strong emphasis going forward in capacity development and
increased participation of municipalities in the establishment and maintenance of the
cadastral information.

75.     External risks. Information recorded in SIICAR could be at risk of becoming
outdated if users fail to record new transactions in the RPPIM. In fact, a critical element
for the sustainability of Project results is ensuring that a culture of registration takes hold,
particularly in rural areas. Accessible registry offices, affordable registry transaction fees
and reliable systems are key elements in building this culture. This risk is likely to be
reduced when people further internalize the benefits of registering their transactions.
PRODEP II includes information campaigns and will continue to make land
administration services more accessible.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.      This rating is based on the close collaboration between the Bank and GoN during
Project preparation, the relevance of the Project to both the GoN and the Bank, flexibility
of Project design, and inclusion of innovative elements that enhanced Project impact in a
context of institutional evolution. The Project design reflected a pioneering effort at the
time and responded adequately to country needs. Being one of the first generation of land
administration projects in the region, and embracing a comprehensive set of legal and
institutional reforms requiring broad-based support from small producers, indigenous
communities and stakeholders in the PA system, PRODEP represented a ‘high-risk - high
reward’ undertaking given the prevailing uncertainties at the time.


                                              20
77.     Despite the satisfactory sector analysis and project design, there were
shortcomings in the risk assessment, the Project results framework and the M&E system.
As noted earlier, some risks were underestimated and consequently the design lacked
adequate mitigation measures when they materialized, affecting project implementation.
The Project results framework had ambitious targets for PDO outcome indicators that
needed to be reassessed. The M&E system lacked a proper methodology to measure PDO
indicators and other impacts, which posed challenges for Project evaluation. In brief, the
high relevance and satisfactory elements of design provided a relatively good framework,
but the shortcomings had an effect on implementation. As a result, Bank performance in
ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

78.     The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) rated initial supervision as moderately
satisfactory. The ICR rating recognizes that in general, supervision missions were timely,
appropriately resourced, and solution-oriented. There was a MTR that resulted in
effective decisions and agreements (through a major Project restructuring), and critical
issues affecting implementation were adequately handled by, among other things,
bringing in additional international expertise with Trust Fund resources and close
collaboration with specialized agencies such as FAO. Social safeguards were well
supervised particularly given the level of complexity and risks associated with indigenous
peoples’ land rights. The successful Project restructurings attest to the timeliness and
responsiveness of Bank supervision. As agreed, the Bank also helped to supervise the
NDF-funded project, thus further promoting coordination. In addition the Bank supported
the supervision of the MCC-financed land project through a fee-based service agreement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     While Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately
satisfactory, quality of supervision is rated satisfactory. Thus, overall Bank performance
is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

80.     Government performance is rated satisfactory considering its sustained
commitment to PDO achievement, including especially the concerted effort to
consolidate the legal and institutional framework for land titling in the country while
strengthening key agencies and local governments. Given the innovative nature of the
Project, coordination issues were bound to arise. Nevertheless, the priority given to the
Project by successive Governments that consistently provided an enabling environment
for Project implementation facilitated resolution to critical constraints, and the


                                           21
achievement of the necessary legal reforms. Although the Project at times experienced
delays due to government changes after electoral cycles, adjustments made thereafter
boosted implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

81.    The overall satisfactory rating considers the different performance levels of the
two agencies that were responsible for project implementation, namely, MHCP and PGR.
The change from MHCP to PGR took place after a project restructuring to strengthen the
leadership of the land sector and address implementation problems. The specific
performances of each implementation agency are discussed below.

82.     MHCP performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. After an initial good
implementation pace, MHCP performance faced shortcomings, including: (a) inadequate
attention to implementation issues that led to a general state of non-compliance with
various commitments reflected in the Credit Development Agreement, and to delays of
some key activities; and (b) weak leadership in promoting inter-institutional coordination.
Additionally, MHCP did not commission an independent MTR evaluation as originally
agreed. However, the Ministry carried out an action plan that improved implementation
significantly during 2005.

83.     PGR performance is rated as highly satisfactory. The change of implementation
agency, supported by the strong mandate given by GoN, brought leadership and a
renewed commitment to Project implementation. As a result, inter-institutional
coordination improved, outstanding contract management issues were resolved, and
partnership with co-executing agencies was strengthened, gradually leading to better
implementation capacity and achievement of key targets. Consequently, by the second
half of 2008 PRODEP was out of “problem project” status. In addition, the efficiencies
realized under the new implementation arrangements led to a successful completion of
Project activities six months prior to the closing date.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

84.   Government performance and outcome of PDO are rated in the satisfactory range,
and the Implementing Agency performance is rated as satisfactory. Thus, overall
Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

85.    The sustainability of outcomes of land administration interventions requires
building broad social and political commitment, as well as maintaining and
mainstreaming key competencies across electoral cycles. Taken together, the GoN’s
two-decade commitment to the land administration agenda, supported by the Bank
through ATLMP, PRODEP and PRODEP II, stands out in Latin America, as well as



                                            22
other regions of the world, including Africa. PRODEP alone spanned three national
administrations, as well as municipal and regional elections. It maintained its focus on the
original PDOs and geographic targets partly because the underlying justifications were
sound and shared across the political spectrum and because the Project was flexible
particularly in implementation responsibilities and modalities. In addition, a specific
agency with strong leadership and a clear mandate for land policy and administration in
the country was given overall implementation responsibility. A substantial number of
consultants and technicians were formally incorporated in the land agencies, thereby
enhancing the sustainability of the improved institutional capacity.

86.      The complexity of recognizing indigenous people’s land rights requires
attention to historical and social particularities and intensive social supervision. In
the case of Nicaragua a specific legal framework was developed for titling indigenous
territories in the Caribbean Region. However, a different set of legal provisions is
required for titling indigenous territories in the Pacific and Central regions. At the
operational level, demarcation and titling processes also need to be tailored to the specific
conditions of the target community. Under the Project, intensive supervision of the social
dimensions was carried out to address issues such as: unclear territorial boundaries,
relationship among neighboring communities, and communication of Project objectives
and methodologies. This included significant attention to representativeness, social
accountability, conflict resolution, and legitimacy of consultation mechanisms, using
existing traditional structures and organizations.

87.     Improving a land administration system involves gradual changes in the
legal and institutional frameworks. Laws that seek to reform this system set out to
change societal behaviors and long established procedures and norms. Each individual
law also has a set of corresponding regulations and institutional arrangements that take
time to develop. In Nicaragua, the expectation that the full package of reform laws would
have been passed at the beginning of the Project, proved to be unrealistic, and in fact
spanned a period of six years with institutional capacity and associated information
systems continuing to be developed after this period. Additionally, as in similar projects
in Guatemala and Panama, there were time lags between the completion of cadastral
surveying and eventual titling and registration. Future projects should consider longer
terms for achieving land administration reforms as well as mechanisms to better monitor
the evolution of the legal and institutional framework and its implications for PDO
achievement.

88.     A strong focus on municipalities is critical to the sustainability of investments
on cadastre and registry modernization in Nicaragua. Given the entrenched and
pervasive commitments to decentralization in much of Latin America, it is particularly
important to integrate land administration within the long-term vision of municipalities
and to make them active partners in the implementation of the national cadastral system.
In Nicaragua, municipalities also represent a relatively accessible tier of government,
which may enhance the chances of regular updating of information when transactions
occur. The original Project design envisioned a limited role of the municipalities as users
of the information, but as the Project evolved the need for them to perform an enhanced



                                             23
role became clearer. Such a role is incorporated in PRODEP II and is being incentivized
by stronger communication of the linkages between land information and municipal
priorities, such as urban planning, revenue generation, and disaster risk mitigation.

89.     Alternative conflict resolution (ACR) mechanisms can effectively facilitate
cadastral and regularization processes. As demonstrated by PRODEP’s experience,
key elements of this process should include capacity development for conflict mediation,
community outreach, and close inter-institutional coordination. The success of the
cadastral surveying and regularization interventions of the Project are in part attributable
to the responsiveness of the methodologies that relied upon ACR mechanisms in the
field, which are well aligned with socially defined rights, as commonly encountered in
regularization programs.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

90.    The GoN confirmed its agreement with the ICR conclusions and ratings. 21 It also
noted that successful Project implementation has provided conditions for further progress
in land administration and management in Nicaragua. In addition, GoN suggested to
emphasize the following issues: (i) the need to strengthen Project M&E through system-
generated reports and early warning notifications in order to support decision making; (ii)
the additional impact from the demarcation of protected areas on local communities
regarding tourism development, including employment generation; (iii) the positive
impact generated by the direct implementation of cadastral surveying by national
agencies; and (iv) the high levels of satisfaction reported by beneficiaries with respect to
the cadastral, titling and registry services provided by the Government under the Project.

(b) Other partners and stakeholders

91.      Nordic Development Fund. According to NDF, the Project was able to achieve
most of its objectives despite several delays related to the management and
implementation of multiple contracts, as well as inter-institutional coordination. It was
difficult for NDF to assess the cost-efficiency of the Project given that many of the
activities broke new ground and thereby were not directly comparable with similar efforts.
However, NDF considered that the Project contributed to the establishment of more
efficient land registration and administration processes in Nicaragua. The fact that
municipal revenue from property taxation has increased, and that an increasing number of
land conflicts is being resolved, indicated a higher efficiency in the new system. The
institutional strengthening and the technical assistance provided by the Project allowed
the Nicaraguan institutions to be more involved and gain more ownership of the process.
The Project results are significant, and the development and piloting of SIICAR will
create a lasting impact.

With Project support, a more solid and clearer land administration framework has been
established in Nicaragua. The country’s policy and legal framework has been positively
transformed, key land agencies’ capacity strengthened, and their services decentralized
within pilot areas. Regarding the policy framework, PRODEP supported the preparation
and implementation of a National Land Policy Framework and a Protected Area Land
Policy. Moreover, as substantiated by a 2012 assessment, the key legal and procedural
changes achieved under the Project have established the conditions to implement
adequately a countrywide land regularization program. In particular, the 2005 Cadastre
Law has facilitated the modernization of cadastral processes and information, and the
2009 Public Registry Law has furthered the modernization of the RPPIM and the
systematic integration of cadastral and registry information. This law had a major
institutional impact by finally bringing together under a national system all the 17
regional property registries of the country. Importantly, the law also mandated the
establishment of the Special Commission of Property Registries to set policy and national
procedures and standards, and at the administrative and operational level, a National
Directorate of Property Registries.

The historical importance and social impact of the 2003 Law for Collective Land Rights
of Indigenous Peoples cannot be overemphasized. Thanks to the approval and
implementation of this law, supported by the Project, poor and marginalized indigenous
communities in the Caribbean Region have received collective titles to 15 of their
ancestral territories, comprising over 22,000 square kilometers – or close to 19 percent of
the national territory. Legal recognition, at the same time, strengthened the recognition by
central, regional and local authorities of the traditional forms of governance of these
territories. The experience and capacity created through the project has provided the basis
for the Government’s continued effort to recognize the land rights of the rest of
indigenous communities in the Caribbean Region.

The systematic land rights regularization methodology developed and tested under the
Project has provided the country with the foundation to launch a long-term national
program. In fact, the Government has already outlined its vision for the next 15 years,
with an overarching goal of continuing to promote land governance while advancing
cadastral and regularization processes and improving land administration services. The
Project’s regularization methodology has incorporated current technologies and global
good practices, and by responding to Nicaragua’s needs and challenges, it has
simultaneously increased national capacity and institutional ownership of project results.
This methodology has been mainstreamed by land agencies and has already been applied
in areas of the country beyond the pilot departments. The results of the implementation of
the different components of the project are reflected in the project development objective
indicators showed in Table 1 below.

Component A. Policy and Land Reforms

This component aimed to support the strengthening of the policy and legal frameworks
for land administration in the country. Under this component, key legal and procedural
reforms were approved that permit the carrying out of a national regularization program.
Relevant outputs include: (i) the policy and legal framework for land administration has
been strengthened through the preparation of a National Land Policy Framework; (ii) the
Law for Collective Land Rights of Indigenous Peoples in the Caribbean (2003) allowed


                                                       28
the demarcation, titling and registry of 15 indigenous territories in RAAN and RAAS,
achieving 100% of the project target; and (iii) the creation, approval and implementation
of the National Land Policy Framework (Marco General de Política de Tierras),
Cadastre Law (2005), Protected Areas Policy, and the Public Registry Law (2009).
Approval of the latter law formalizes major administrative and technological changes that
will facilitate modernization of property registration, including the implementation of
SIICAR.

In general this component had a satisfactory implementation and was not included in the
additional financing since its proposed activities were completed under the original
Credit. Despite the satisfactory achievement of the objective, the approval of some of the
policies was delayed mainly as a result of necessary negotiations in the National
Assembly.

Component B. Institutional Strengthening and Decentralization

This component aimed to improve institutional capacity for (a) ensuring adequate Project
implementation; (b) increasing efficiency in land administration services, including
through a new organizational model and methodology for cadastral surveying and
regularization; and (c) promoting coordination between key land sector institutions. This
component included the following subcomponents: B.1 – Decentralization and
Strengthening for the Administration of Property Rights; B.2– Municipal Capacity
Development; and B.3 – Support to Project Management.

- B.1 Decentralization and Strengthening for the Administration of Property Rights
This subcomponent strengthened institutional capacities of the IP, INETER, Registry and
DIRAC regarding actual legislation of land administration and the improvement of
institutional coordination within the IP and cadastre and registry. Support was given to:
the Property Intendancy (IP) for the provision of legal adjudication, titling and other
regularization services at the central and departmental level; the Nicaragua Institute for
Territorial Studies (INETER) for carrying out cadastral analysis and the issuing of
documents required for regularization activities under the Project at the central and
departmental levels; the Registry with the implementation of dissemination activities of
the Registry Law and modernization of the departmental offices; and the Directorate for
Alternative Conflict Resolution (DIRAC) for implementing alternative or extra-judicial
methods for resolution of disputes that emerge during the cadastral surveying process.

Support was also given to strengthen the capacity for Project implementation of the co-
executing agencies and Technical Operational Units (UTOs). The establishment of UTO
in the departments of Chinandega, Estelí Madriz and León streamlined the
implementation of the project by facilitating operational and institutional coordination at
a local level. Table 2 shows the results of the indicators related with this component.
Organizational development plans with new internal organization and processes, for each
institution, were designed, approved and implemented, simplifying, in this way, land
administration services and reducing transaction costs.

- B.2 Municipal Capacity Development
Activities under this subcomponent included the provision of technical assistance,
equipment and software to selected municipalities mainly to: (a) enable them to
participate in Project activities; (b) train them in the use of SIICAR and help them
integrate the municipal cadastre systems (SISCAT) with SIICAR; and (c) improve their
capacity for cadastral and regularization activities. As a result, technical and financial
assistance was given to 33 municipalities in four departments (Chinandega, Estelí,
Madriz and León) to ensure their participation in the land regularization process.

- B.3 – Support to Project Management
The PCU (SE-PRODEP) received Project management support in: (a) financial
management, Project audits, and procurement; (b) overall coordination of co-executing
agencies, including the Project Inter-Institutional Committee (CIP) and its Operational
Technical Committee (CTO); (c) training on fiduciary, operational and safeguard aspects
of the Project; and (d) oversight of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E),
communication and gender strategies and the application of safeguards requirements of
the Project.

Component C. Titling and Regularization Services

This component focused on the consolidation of a methodology to clarify rights and to
carry out a land regularization process that served as a foundation to develop a long-term,
comprehensive Property Regularization Program. Accordingly, the component included
the following sub-components: C.1 – Systematic Regularization Services taking place in
4 pilot areas; C.2 – Titling and Review of Titles of the Reformed Sector, and C.3.
Conflict Mediation.

- C.1 Systematic Regularization Services
Sub component C1 supported a mass regularization process initially in some
municipalities of Chinandega, Estelí and Madriz; the additional financing approved in
2010 expanded the Project area to include the department of León. Activities funded
under this component included: technical and legal support for systematic regularization
services in selected municipalities, preparation of cadastral databases, definition of urban
boundaries, cadastral surveying, implementation of a social communication campaign,
verification and validation of property rights, conflict resolution, public disclosure of
results (exposiciones públicas), field supervision and quality control, and titling,
regularization and registration of rural and urban parcels.

Under this subcomponent a systematic land rights regularization program was developed
tested, and consolidated in the pilot departments. Cadastral surveying was carried out by
INETER and IP/PGR under the new organizational model developed and successfully
validated in the municipality of Nagarote (León) with support from MCC and in direct
collaboration with the Millennium Challenge Account-Nicaragua. By providing greater
institutional ownership, control and coordination, and streamlining of technical processes,
this experience helped to reduce processing times. Titling, for instance, now occurs
almost simultaneously with the cadastral surveying process, as parcels with technical and
legal conditions that allow for early titling are identified. Early demands for titling of
properties in the selected municipalities that are not yet being surveyed also receive
attention. In this way, the target of 12,000 regularized parcels to be titled under the
Project was surpassed, achieving a result of 32,677 parcels titled in the pilot departments
alone (Table 3). This value corresponds, at the same time, to the total of the parcels
regularized in the same area. From this total, 20,197 were rural titles and 12,480 were
urban. The total number of parcels surveyed was 222,134 in 10,503 km2, which
represents a 441 percent increase in the number of surveyed parcels before the project.
The Project also produced 117 urban maps with a scale 1:1,000.

- C.2 Titling and Review of Titles of the Reformed Sector
Under subcomponent C.2 the Project supported demand based titling of the reformed
sector. As such, the Project supported titling requests of beneficiaries of Nicaragua’s
agrarian land reform; ex-combatants; and marginal urban and peri-urban settlers. This
subcomponent also covered expropriation-based indemnification claims, including the
provision of technical assistance to beneficiaries and agencies to simplify land-related
procedures, legal services, topographic services, and registration of parcels. The Project



                                            31
showed positive results especially in the number of pending urban titles and the agrarian
titles reviewed. These activities surpassed the target values as shown in the Table 3.

- C.3. Conflict Mediation
This subcomponent supported alternative conflict resolution activities. A training
program in mediation, negotiation, collaboration and co-management of conflicts was
designed and implemented giving special attention to community leaders and field
mediators. Twenty training events were developed in which a total of 598 persons were
trained (242 mediators and 337 public officials from IP, Register, MAGFOR, INIFOM,
PGR, MARENA, National Police and Judges). At the end of the project, from a total of
2667 cases, 1,622 boundary conflicts were subject to mediation. In spite of the success of
the mediation process, there is still the need for judicial intervention in order to modify
the measurements of parcels in the Registro Único de Propiedad.

Component D. Demarcation and Consolidation of Protected Areas

This component aimed originally to physically demarcate and consolidate 11 selected
protected areas in the Project area. Under the AF, demarcation of two other areas
(Complejo Volcánico Telica-Rota and Tepesomoto Pataste) was included (one in
Chinandega and one in León). The component also aimed at implementing an
environmental communication program in and around the selected protected areas.
Accordingly, the component includes 2 subcomponents: D.1 – Demarcation of Protected
Areas; and D.2 – Social Communication and Environmental Education. The project also
aimed at analyzing property problems in the 14 protected areas by revising the existing


                                             32
PA policy. Ten major workshops in the pilot departments were carried out and at the end
of this process a document “Land Policy of the National Protected Areas System”
(Política de Tierras del Sistema Nacional de Áreas Protegidas) was approved by
MARENA.

- D.1 Demarcation of Protected Areas
Activities in this subcomponent included: (a) preparatory work, obtaining preliminary
information and consultation with beneficiaries; (b) field socio-economic and tenure data
collection, and ecological assessments; (c) determination of the precise boundaries to be
demarcated; and (d) physical demarcation, geo-referencing and registration in the
Cadastre and Registry.

Targets were exceeded regarding demarcation of protected areas; 12 PAs were
demarcated, exceeding the original target of 11, additionally, certain areas of ecological
importance were also identified. Demarcation in one of the original PAs, Tepesomoto
Pataste, was postponed, but two other PAs, the Cañón de Somoto National Monument
and the Memorial Park for Hurricane Mitch Victims, were demarcated in its place. Under
the AF, two PAs more were demarcated. The Project also supported the preparation and
implementation of 8 management plans (exceeding the original target of 7). Thirty
activities for fire control and prevention were developed and training was given on this
topic to local volunteers in the PAs. A monitoring and evaluation system for forest fires
was also designed. Although the implementation of this subcomponent was successful,
some delays occurred due to difficulties in stakeholder participation and in reaching
agreements related to the management plans.

Regarding the identification of ecologically important areas, the project supported
scientific studies in the pilot departments. This activity produced 7 studies that were
publicly distributed, leading to three areas being declared as Ecological Municipal Parks:
(a) Cerro San Rafael, in San Juan de Cinco Pino; (b) Cerro San Ignacio, in San Pedro de
Potrero Grande; and (c) Cerro La Chocolata, in Santo Tomás del Norte.

- D.2 Social Communication and Environmental Education
This subcomponent supported a social and environmental communication campaign in
the protected areas and the surrounding areas, including the dissemination of information
on each protected area, environmental laws and regulations, direct and indirect benefits of
natural resources conservation activities, and recommended land management practices.
The process included the participation of landowners, community members, government
and non-governmental institutions that are present in the protected areas and buffer zones.
Sixty environmental education events were developed to present information about the
management plans of the protected areas, delimitation activities and environmental
legislation. A total of 1,574 people (33 percent of whom were women) participated in
these activities. Several documents with information about environmental resources,
existing flora and fauna and the importance of their protection were distributed in local
communities.

Component E. Demarcation of Indigenous Lands



                                           33
The goal of this component was to promote the strengthening of indigenous peoples’ land
rights in the Caribbean region of the country through demarcation and titling of selected
indigenous territories. Three key elements were supported: (i) a dialogue about
indigenous land law, at national and regional level in order to reach an agreement for
enactment of legislation to regulate the titling, demarcation and access to natural
resources; (ii) participatory field demarcation and conflict resolution on the ground; and,
(iii) implementation of the indigenous peoples strategy and the Indigenous Peoples
Process Framework and support to territorial management and small sub-projects.

At the end of the original Credit, the component’s target was achieved. Specifically, 15
indigenous territories were demarcated and titled in the Caribbean, representing historical
progress in the recognition of indigenous peoples’ land rights in Nicaragua and Latin
America in general. This outcome has benefitted more than 120 indigenous communities.
Since its activities had been successfully completed under the original Credit, no funds
were allocated for this component under the AF. An studied done to understand the
perception of the results on the local population showed that 71 percent of the total
interviewed people in RAAN and RAAS thought that the legal framework is complete
regarding the resolution of land conflicts and 47 percent stated that they felt secure about
their land property. Three out of five productive subprojects were implemented by the
end of the project. The development of subprojects was delayed due inter alia to
difficulties in the demarcation and titling processes. Considering its marginal link to
PDOs, it was agreed to discontinue this activity.

Component F. Information Systems

The purpose of this component was to develop an efficient technological framework (a)
to help modernize cadastre and registry services and land titling and regularization
procedures, and (b) to ensure adequate Project’s financial management and monitoring
and evaluation (M&E). Accordingly, there are five subcomponents under this component:
F.1 – Integrated Cadastre and Registry Information System (SIICAR); F.2 – Integrated
Property Information System (SIIPRO); F.3 – Project Financial Management System
(SIAFI); F.4 – Monitoring and Impact Evaluation System (SMEI); and F.5 –
Participatory Evaluation.

- F.1 Integrated Cadastre and Registry Information System (SIICAR)
This subcomponent supported the implementation of SIICAR as well as the provision of
training on the system to relevant staff of the different land agencies. More specifically,
activities under this subcomponent helped to: (i) modernize, secure and computerize land
related records; (ii) establish at the departmental level a unified information system which
will record graphic and alphanumerical data; (iii) link cadastral data with property
registry information; (iv) maintain updated registry and cadastral field information, and
(v) grant easy access to land tenure information to public and private parties.

At the end of the Project, SIICAR was completely established in Chinandega and was
still in process for Estelí (12%), Madriz (6%) and León (6%) (Table 4). The development



                                            34
of the activities under this subcomponent was delayed at the beginning of the Project due
to reluctance of the staff to use technological tools and a lack of technical knowledge
from the personnel who needed special training. Another barrier to the broader
implementation of SIICAR was the discrepancy of the information as some properties
had sizes and owners in the registry different from those recorded in the cadastre.
Currently, the CSJ has established the Directorate of Registry Systems that oversees the
implementation of maintenance contract of SIICAR and its technical support.

- F.2 Integrated Property Information System (SIIPRO)
This subcomponent supported the development and implementation of SIIPRO to help IP
track the issuance of land titles, including, inter alia, the development of the relevant
software and provision of training. SIIPRO was piloted under the original Credit, and the
additional funding continued supporting its implementation in selected municipalities. At
the end of the Project, the system was installed in the four pilot departments and three
workshops had been conducted to give information about SIIPRO’s use and maintenance.
The System for Legal and Cadastral Information (SILEC) was also developed and linked
to SIIPRO, thus allowing an efficient transfer of information between both systems.

- F.3 Project Financial Management System (SIAFI)
This subcomponent included the implementation of a system to monitor the Project
financial and administrative management (SIAFI). SIAFI was managed by the PCU in
order to provide automated registration and control of the Project’s accounting records,
procurement and planning, and timely preparation of FM reports required by the Bank.
Computer equipment was acquired for the System’s strengthening and technical support
made available to ensure its adequate functioning. SIAFI was installed in León and
Madriz contributing to the efficiency of the management of the financial resources. To
date, the system is working normally.

- F.4 Monitoring and Impact Evaluation System (SMEI)
Support was given for the implementation of SMEI including: (a) maintaining a
specialized unit to ensure adequate attention to M&E; (b) carrying out of validation and
consultation workshops with Project beneficiaries; (c) conducting relevant studies as
agreed in the M&E Strategy included in the Operational Manual, such as evaluation of
the efficiency of the registry and regularization services, and a study for the updating of
relevant baseline information; and (d) carrying out of the final Project impact evaluation
during the last year of Project implementation.

The SMEI kept track of 30 monitoring indicators that were used in the quarterly reports
of Project progress. A technical group also designed a plan to follow up on Project
activities. The group carried out monthly visits to the pilot departments in order to
directly validate information with field Project personnel. An impact evaluation was done
including the results of several thematic studies such as: benefits of titling, perception of
cadastre and registry, the efficiency of co-executing agencies, and Project effects at the
municipal levels.

-   F.5 Participatory Evaluation



                                             35
The component supported activities to include Project beneficiaries and officials in the
evaluation process of the project in order to assess the social and institutional learning
process, the outreach of the project to the people, the fairness of the processes, the
opportunities given to potential beneficiaries, the transparency of the activities, and the
quality of administrative services. For this, consultation workshops, satisfaction surveys,
and participative evaluation workshops were done with selected focal groups of project
beneficiaries. Sixty-eight participative evaluation studies were completed covering topics
such as legal policies and reforms, institutional decentralization and strengthening, land
tenure regularization services, among others.

                          Economic IRR22:                          23.6%

An ex-post economic analysis of the PRODEP23 was conducted to evaluate the economic
efficiency of the Project through a cost-benefit analysis, using actual project outputs and
actual project costs. The analysis also compared the economic feasibility indicators (i.e.
Net Present Value 24 and Economic IRR) to those obtained at appraisal.

The analysis applied the same methodology and assumptions used for the ex-ante
analysis with some minor exceptions that are explained in this Annex. Costs included
direct expenditures in the regularization process and development of technological
platforms and administration/coordination expenses. The economic benefits accounted
for in the analysis are the expected increases in property values derived from a sense of
enhanced security of tenure due to land regularization and titling.

At appraisal, the discounted net benefits of PRODEP were estimated at US$ 7.4 million
with an Economic IRR of 19 and 21 percent for PRODEP’s initial phase and PRODEP’s
additional financing (AF), respectively. At completion, the discounted net benefits were
estimated at US$17.4 million, and the Economic IRR at 23.6 percent. It is evident that ex-
post discounted net economic benefits are significantly higher, more than double, than
those estimated at appraisal. The difference is largely explained by the higher than
anticipated number of urban properties regularized and titled as a result of project
activities, particularly during the initial phase of PRODEP.

Theoretical Considerations

The theory underpinning PRODEP’s economic analysis is based on the presumed linkage
between enhanced security of tenure and property values. It is argued that security of
tenure, (in this case reaching its highest level with the possession of a clear title of
ownership), improves marketability of the property by increasing its desirability, as it
reduces risks. It thus creates the condition for longer-term investment decisions that may
directly increase land value, or are needed to generate an incremental revenue stream,
that otherwise would not be achieved in a short term possession situation, or by an
occupant with insecure tenure. It also allows for the real estate to serve as collateral for
credit financing for revenue generating activities. According to economic theory, the

value of a good is equal to the discounted stream of net benefits it generates during its
lifetime. Accordingly, property with higher income generating capacity should, when all
else is equal, be more valuable than less-productive land.

In addition to the above, there are other benefits to land regularization that are real and
relevant, but that often times, as it was the case for this analysis, are not easily
measurable, or measurable at all, or expressible in monetary terms, and thus were not
included in the analysis. These include potential environmental benefits such as:
protection of biodiversity, or water sources; better management of natural resources; or
social benefits, such as social stability resulting from reduced land-related conflicts; or
improved food security and nutrition from increased production or income, resulting from
an enhanced sense of tenure security and access to capital, etc.

Methodological Approach to the Economic Cost/Benefit Analysis

Estimating the magnitudes of the project’s expected benefits is complex, as property
values are influenced by a wide range of factors, such as location, access to public
services, size, value of construction, use of the property, each of which interacts with
tenure status. However when accounting for these factors through econometric/statistical
methods, the effect of the change in tenure status after regularization can be isolated and
used as an indicator of the economic benefit of land titling, and as a basis to undertake an
economic feasibility analysis.

The ex-post stream of benefits for the cost/benefit analysis was projected using the same
parameters that quantified the expected increment of property value due to titling,
estimated for the ex–ante analysis at appraisal, coupled with the actual schedule of titles
of urban property, and the size of rural area titled, as a result of the intervention.

For the estimation of the parameters that isolate and quantify the effect of regularization
and titling on property values, an Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to partial-
out the effects of other factors that can also explain property values. The basic model
used for estimating these parameters for both PRODEP’s initial phase and its AF were:

                                     Y = f (Xi) + b + e
where:
 Y = Expected value per unit of rural land (manzanas25 in this case), or unit of urban
       property
 b = Constant
 Xi= A set of explanatory variables, including one dichotomic variable for the presence
       (=1), or not (=0) of a registered title
 e = Error

     Manzana is a common unit to measure rural land in Central America; 1 manzana is equivalent to 0.698896 hectares.


                                                          38
Different parameters were estimated for PRODEP’s initial phase (2003-2009) and for its
AF (2010-2012). The particular model specification with respect to the selection of
explanatory variables for each phase was slightly different, taking into account the
particularities of regional coverage, and the data sets used in each case. PRODEP’s initial
phase used data series form the Survey for the Rural Economy Dynamics Study26, and the
explanatory variables in the model captured whether the land had a registered title, if it
was idle, or if it was used for housing or a related use, for annual crops, permanent crops,
pastures, or forest. The AF used data from the MECOVI27, and as explanatory variables
for rural property, whether the property had a registered title, whether permanent crops
were its main use, and whether its topography was abrupt/irregular or flat/relatively flat.
In the case of urban property, in addition to whether or not the property had a registered
title, the explanatory variables included whether the property had in-house running water,
as a proxy for the provision of basic public services.

Economic Benefits

The estimation of PRODEP’s ex-post benefits is based on the following:

i)       The stream of benefits derived from titling of rural property used the parameter
         of US $45/manzana estimated in PRODEP’s first phase ex–ante analysis, for the
         years corresponding to and areas covered during this phase; and the parameter of
         US$ 151/manzanas for the years and areas covered during the AF. The difference
         in the parameters estimated for the initial phase and those estimated for its AF
         could be explained by the difference the moment in time when they were
         estimated, and the different characteristics of the land in the Departments that
         where covered by each phase. As in the ex–ante analysis, it was assumed that
         benefits would start to accrue three years after titling in constant increments over
         a 20-year period, and would be based on the rural area actually titled as a result of
         project activities.

ii)      The direct economic benefits calculated for titling urban property were based on
         the US$ 2,083/title parameter that was estimated during the ex-ante analysis of
         the AF. This parameter was applied to the construction of the stream of benefits
         for urban property for the whole implementation period of PRODEP. As the
         initial phase did not anticipate a significant emphasis on the regularization and
         titling of urban property, this parameter was not estimated ex-ante for this phase.
         However at the AF phase, the emphasis on urban regularization and titling was
         explicitly increased in the design of the project.

The discounted gross benefits from the ex-ante analysis were estimated at US$ 22.8
million. The ex-post analysis using the actual number of titles generated during project
implementation yielded discounted gross benefits of around US$ 34.1 million. As

previously mentioned the difference is largely explained by the higher than anticipated
regularization and titling of urban property as a result of project activities, particularly
during PRODEP’s initial phase.

Costs

The ex-ante analysis considered only the costs directly associated with land
regularization and the functioning of the land administration information system, and the
relative share of the project’s administration/coordination costs related to those
components. Thus, only the analogous costs were considered for the ex-post analysis.
The ex-ante analysis yielded a Net Present Value (NPV) of costs of US$ 14.54 million
over the project’s ten years, while the ex-post analysis yielded an NPV of costs of around
US$16.3 million.

Cost-Benefit Analysis

The discounted stream of net benefits (i.e. discounted gross benefits minus discounted
costs) yielded a NPV of around US$ 17.9 million. This represents the net return (i.e. after
costs) of PRODEP’s investment over its implementation period, in today’s money.

The Benefit/Cost ratio for PRODEP was estimated at 2.09. This means that for each
US$ 1.00 invested in land regularization/titling actions, the project generated US $2.09 of
gross benefits, or US$ 1.09 of net benefits.

Project economic efficiency was also measured by calculating the Economic IRR. The
estimated Economic IRR of 23.6% could be explained as the maximum discount rate at
which the actual investments would be economically viable. It would be only above this
rate that PRODEP would cease to be considered a viable alternative.

In the ex-post analysis, as in the ex-ante analysis, direct benefits from land value
increments, were assumed to accrue as a constant annuity over the course of twenty years.
The benefits of titling were expected to start accruing three years after titling for rural
property and immediately in the case of urban property. The discount rate used (12%)
was the same for both phases under analysis. As seen in Table 1, the NPV for the
Project’s net benefits is around US$ 17.8 million, and the ERR is 23.6 percent.

The aforementioned economic efficiency indicators suggest an economically sound
investment. Even when taking into account 100 percent of PRODEP’s costs (i.e.
including those that were not accounted for, such as the ones related to demarcation and
consolidation of protected areas, demarcation of indigenous territories, decentralization
and institutional strengthening, policies and legal reforms), the investment would be
economically feasible, with an Economic IRR of 13.5% and an NPV of net benefits of
US$ 3.9 million.

Discussion of Results

The ex-post economic analysis shows that investments associated with land regularization
and the functioning of the land administration system provided a reasonable economic
return for Nicaraguan society as a whole. As seen on Table 2, the discounted net benefits
were significantly higher than those estimated at appraisal. This is due to the higher than
anticipated regularization and titling targets that were achieved, particularly with respect
to urban property during the project’s first phase, and lower than anticipated costs.

        Table 2 – Comparison between ex-ante and ex-post benefits and costs

            PRODEP I + AF       Total Ex ante       Total Ex Post      Change
           Benefits          US$ 22.08 Million    US$ 34.1 Million     +54%
           Project Costs     US$ 14.54 Million    US$ 16.3 Million     +12%
           Net Benefits      US$ 7.54 Million     US$ 17.8 Million     +136%



As previously mentioned, the analysis does not take into account all possible value-
enhancing effects. For example, it may be reasonable to assume that surveying activities
might lead to an increase in the marketability of lands and investment incentives in
situations where the cadastre assisted in the resolution of conflicts and clarification of
boundaries. The ex-post analysis did not attempt to account for these benefits due to the
lack of data to estimate the price differentials between surveyed and non-surveyed
properties.

During the course of implementation there was no systematic monitoring of investments
after property titling or of returns to investments. Therefore, assumptions of such as the
lengthy lag in the internalization of benefits, and the size of land value increments after
titling remained unchecked.




                                            41
Conclusion

The ex-post economic feasibility analysis suggests that the PRODEP was an efficient
investment for the Nicaraguan society. Returns were higher than actual costs, and the
difference between them was even higher than that anticipated at appraisal.

It is important, however, to bear in mind that the analysis has its shortcomings: (i) the
data needed to calculate the parameters that isolate and quantify the likely economic
impact of enhance security of tenure through titling, was dropped from the latest
MECOVI, and thus the parameters could not be updated; some assumptions, such as the
lag for benefits to start accruing after titling, and the length of the deferment period of
benefits to achieve their full impact on property values, remain unchecked; and (iii), as
pointed out before, indirect potential benefits and perhaps costs were not taken into
account due to a lack of readily available information that would permit their inclusion.

                                  Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

In 2012, a consultant firm was hired to carry out a household socio-economic survey to
evaluate the impacts of the regularization and titling activities in rural and urban areas.
This Annex summarizes the methodology and the most pertinent results of the Survey:

Description of the Methodology of the Household Survey

The survey covered 2,251 households who were either PRODEP I beneficiaries 29 or
prospective PRODEP II beneficiaries. 30 It aimed at assessing the effects of the Project at
the household level. In particular, it sought to gather information for analyzing whether
cadastral, titling and regularization have contributed to improved economic and social
assets of those who received such services. The questionnaire addresses issues related to
financial services access, improvement in productive equipment acquisition and housing,
and land conflict resolution, as well as the family’s perception of secure tenure, change in
their asset values and their satisfaction with the services delivered by the Project.

In order to compare the PRODEP effects on households with diverse degrees of tenure
security, the survey established three sample groups:

    Group A are the direct beneficiaries of PRODEP I, who were issued new titles;31
    Group B are the households whose tenure situation was only improved by cadastral
     surveying; and
    Group C are inhabitants of Nueva Segovia Department, which is included in
     PRODEP II but currently without project intervention.

Further, the analysis also considered to a limited extent the database of 1,600 rural
households from a 2003 Survey whose base questionnaire was used to design the new
one.32

The sampling was carried out in each group through a multistage and randomized
methodology in which: group A is representative of the rural and urban households who
have been participating in the regularization and new titles issuance program between
2004 and 2013; Group B is representative of households of selected intervention
municipalities (in Chinandega, Estelí, Madriz and León Departments) where cadastral
survey was carried out but who did not benefit from the regularization program; and
group C is representative of rural households from selected municipalities in Nueva
Segovia Department, with similar social and economic characteristics to the treatment
groups. Within groups B and C, households have different tenure situations, ranging from
no legal document at all to registered titles.


29
   Only where cadastral survey was carried out: Chinandega, Estelí, Madriz and Leon departments.
30
   Nueva Segovia Department, where there was no project cadastral intervention in the time of the survey.
31
   Participation is not voluntary, but systematic according to the tenure situation evaluation carried out by INETER and
the Property Institute.
32
   For different reasons, it is not possible to use this baseline for a difference on difference evaluation, but especially
because it contains a small group of household comparable to the treatment group of PRODEP I.


                                                           46
The field survey activities in the five departments (PRODEP I + PRODEP II) were
carried out by a consultancy firm hired by the Government. However, the methodology
and tools design, as well as pilot exercises in the field and database supervision were
supported by FAO-TCIC experts through the cooperative agreement with the World
Bank.

Different levels of analysis of this household survey have been carried out with FAO-
TCIC support. Firstly, it was possible to obtain a relatively reliable characterization of the
direct beneficiaries of the titling program, in terms of their social and economic assets,
and thereby their vulnerability. Secondly, an analysis of the tenure situation was also
possible for group B and C, enabling the design of sub-sampling groups with similar
characteristics for comparative analysis, as well as for PRODEP II baseline construction.
Thirdly, a cross-analysis among some of these different sub-groups was undertaken in
order to compare the situation of the beneficiaries and their assets against their control
groups. Finally, information of the treatment groups will be compared with other survey
data such as the 2003 baseline, the 2012 National Agricultural Census and the future
results of the next Living Standards Measurement Survey.33

Main Findings

A summary of the number of valid cases and plots size statistics for each of the sample
sub-groups is presented in Table 1. It shows that the median plot size in the Control
Group (Group C) was comparable to the median rural plot size in intervention Group B
(2166.6m2 and 2400 m2 respectively) but nearly twice as large as the median rural plot in
intervention Group A (1146.2 m2), although all groups had very substantial standard
deviations. Urban plots in the intervention groups A and B were typically much smaller
as expected, with medians of 211.9 m2 and 245.0 m2 respectively.

Key findings of the survey as they relate to some of the broader objectives of the Project
interventions are as follows:

1. Since 2000 (2 years before the start of the Project), the proportion of households who
   made significant home improvements in the titled intervention group (Group A) was
   more than that in the control group. For the control group, the proportion was 9.4%,
   whereas in treatment Group A, 17.1% of rural households and 19.2% of urban
   households made such improvements. This pattern is consistent with the theory of
   secure property rights creating an incentive for investment, however direct attribution
   to the Project would require more careful analysis of additional factors that may have
   influenced home construction and improvement behavior.

2. The incidence of titling in the name of women is significantly higher in the
   intervention Group A (55.9%) than in the control group (37.1%). When only rural
   households in the intervention groups are considered, the differences are still
   significant, though smaller. In particular women represent 45.3% of titled households
   in Group A and 43.4% in Group B.

3. Households in the control group, which are predominantly rural, had similar levels of
   perceived risks to their security of tenure (7.5%) as rural households in the
   intervention Group A (10.3%). Rural households in intervention Group B have higher
   levels of perceived risk (15.3%). In all three cases, the greatest perceived risk was of
   someone reclaiming all of the parcel’s area. The elevated levels of perceived risk in
   Intervention Group B are not unprecedented and may be reflective of the initial
   apprehensions that arise when boundaries that for generations had been socially
   defined become subject to cadastral measurement and demarcation with titling still
   pending.

4. Households in the control group, which are predominantly rural, had similar levels of
   access to credit (greater than 93%) as rural households in the Intervention Group A,
   although those in the control group were more likely to have solicited credit. Among
   those soliciting credit, use of the parcel of land as collateral was less common in rural
   households of Group A (12.9%) and Group B (8.1%), than in the control group
   (31.9%). It is possible that this counterintuitive finding may be explained by
   differences in unmeasured factors affecting the need or eligibility for collateral-based
   credit and by differences in preferences for credit that does not involve risk of losing
   the land upon which the household produces.

5. Rural households in the Project intervention areas were similarly inclined to
   undertake commercial activities as those in the control group. The proportions of
   rural households engaged in such activities were 11.5%, 13.3% and 14.5 % in Groups
   A, B and C respectively.

6. 97% or more of households in the intervention groups expressed satisfaction with the
   results obtained in the cadastral survey in both urban and rural areas however a




                                            48
   similar proportion of households indicated that they have not made any payment for
   these services.

In summary, PRODEP beneficiaries were overwhelmingly satisfied with cadastral
surveying services that they received. Investment in home construction and improvement
was greater in the titled Project areas than in the control group, consistent with the theory
of the positive effects of land tenure regularization. Project and non-project rural
households did not differ substantially in their propensity to undertake commercial
activities on their plots and such parity was also observed in perceived security of
tenancy and access to credit, when non-Project households were compared only with
rural households who had experienced both cadastral surveying and titling. However,
counter-intuitively, use of the land as collateral was more common in the control group.
As expected, at the end of the Project, rural Project beneficiary households are more
progressive in having women as property title-holders than non-Project beneficiaries.

The preparation of the Final Evaluation Report of the Land Administration Project
(PRODEP) was based on the documents and reports produced and information collected
in participatory workshops carried out by the Project, in addition to primary information
from cadastral databases and household surveys. This Annex presents a summary of the
Government’s Final Evaluation Report, which is available in full in Project files.

To achieve its development objectives, the Project targeted 33 municipalities through a
systematic regularization methodology, and demarcated and titled 15 indigenous
territories in the Caribbean Region. The Project also strengthened land tenure rights of
aproximately 30,000 rural households in the pilot area and an additional 10,000 rural
households from the reform sector on a demand basis across the country. In addition, the
Project contributed to the demarcation and strengthening of environmental management
of 14 protected areas.

Several changes were made to improve PRODEP’s original design and adapt it
operationally based on implementation experience. Nevertheless, Project objectives,
components and activities remained the same. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
(MHCP), originaly responsible for project implementation, was replaced by the Attorney
General’s Office (PGR) in 2008, and the Inter-Institutional Coordination Committee
(CIP) was restructured.

Implementation of PRODEP is considered satisfactory given the results achieved,
especially those related to the legal framework, institutional development, regularization
services, recognition of indigenous peoples’ land rights, and demarcation of protected
areas. Most of the indicators ere substaintially achieved, and some of them were
surpassed. Nevertheless, the roll out of information systems was not fully achieved.

Based on PRODEP’s results, an efficiency analysis was carried out that considered the
Project as highly satisfactory. At appraisal, the discounted net benefits of the Project were
estimated at US$ 7.4 million with an Economic Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 19 and
21 percent for the Original Credit and Additional Financing (AF), respectively. At
completion, the discounted net benefits were estimated at US$17.4 million, and the
Economic IRR at 23.6 percent. It is evident that ex-post discounted net economic benefits
are significantly higher, more than double, than those estimated at appraisal. The
difference is largely explained by the higher than anticipated number of urban properties
regularized and titled as a result of project activities. 

The implementation of a gender strategy across components promoted equitable access
for women and men to PRODEP’s services and benefits, with 51 percent of beneficiaries
with property titles being women.

The Government of Nicaragua, as borrower and beneficiary, has been represented by all
the public agencies involved. Although it acknowledges that there were delays in project
implementation at times, the GoN also recognizes the efforts from these agencies to



                                             51
address issues in a timely manner in order to reestablish a good pace of implementation.
The Project represented a major shift in land policy and land administration in the
country, contributing directly to poverty reduction and strengthening of land tenure.

In conclusion, PRODEP was conceptualized as a regularization pilot project with
strategies and methodologies subject to validation through implementation and results,
which would be the basis for a future National Land Administration Program. During
implementation, adjustments were made to cope with political, legal and institutional
challenges. At closing, the Project has achieved substantial physical and financial
execution in most of its components, and with sustainable achievements in infrastructure,
technical capacity, and social capital among beneficiaries, co-executing agencies, and
other stakeholders.

Achievements
The purpose of the land administration project was to develop a national policy, legal,
institutional and technical framework to support the administration of property rights, and
to demonstrate the feasibility of a systematic land rights regularization program that is
efficient, reliable and equitable. The NDF supported the following activities: (a)
Institutional Strengthening; (b) Decentralization of Land Administration Services; (c)
Regularization services in four urban areas; (d) Integration of Registry and Cadstre
Information; and (e) Support to the PCU of PRODEP.

The Project provided continuity to the land reform process in Nicaragua and the
establishment of new land administration framework. The Project was able to achieve its
objectives despite delays due to contract management shortcomings that were addressed in
a timely manner.

The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) was originally the implementing
agency of the Project. However, it was replaced in 2008 by the PGR, which improved the
pace of implementation. In addition, several govermental agencies were involved in
implementation, including CSJ, DIRAC, INIFOM, INETER, IP, and MARENA.

NDF financed two major contracts: 1) Contract signed with BlomInfo on 18 May 2006 to
undertake a survey and titling of approximately 47,000 land parcels in urban areas; and 2)
Contract signed with SwedeSurvey on 24 April 2009 to undertake the implementation of
the Integrated Information System Land Registry (SIICAR). An additional 10 smaller
contracts were financed by NDF.

Efficiency:
The assessment of cost-efficiency poses a challenge since many of the activities broke
new ground and could not be compared directly with activities in other projects financed
by NDF. However, the Project did contribute to the establishment of a much more
efficient land registration and overall land administration in Nicaragua. The fact that



                                           53
municipal revenue from property tax has increased and the increasing number of conflicts
related to land tenure are being resolved indicate a higher efficiency in the new system.

The institutional strengthening and the technical assistance provided by the Project
allowed the Nicaraguan institutions to be more involved and have ownership of the
process. The land administration sector in Nicaragua used to be highly inefficient and
marked by a high level of conflicts that the authorities were unable to resolve.

As a lesson learned for the NDF, its administrative burden would have been lower if the
NDF-project had focused in fewer components instead of being spread thin across all
components. This in turn, resulted in having to finance a large number of small contracts.

Relevance:
The Project’s Development Objectives (PDOs) were to develop a national policy, legal,
institutional and technical framework to support the administration of property rights, and
to demonstrate the feasibility of a systematic land rights regularization programme that is
efficient, reliable and equitable. PDOs remain relevant and have to some extent been
achieved. National land legislation has been approved, and the introduction of the
SIICAR system has demonstrated its applicability within the Nicaraguan context. The
new legislation recognized the collective ownership to land which is a key issue for the
indigenous peoples and ethnic groups which make up about 8-10 percemt of the
Nicaraguan population. Conflicts related to indigenous territories continue but in recent
years CONADETI has been able to issue 21 titles on indigenous territories out of a total
of 22 collective territorial claims.

Impact:
Project impact is significant according to the indicators achieved. NDF support led to
legalization and titling of 58,446 land parcels in urban areas of Chinandega, El Viejo,
Esteli and Madriz, with a total area of 30.94 km2. The project was also able to resolve 129
land conflicts in urban areas. At the national level, the Project was able to register and title
214,990 land parcels in addition to the existing 54,876 land titles, this was an increase of
292 percent compared to the base line. The development and piloting of SIICAR will
create a lasting impact. SIICAR was developed in Bolivia in the 1990s and adapted to
Nicaraguan municipalities through the NDF financed technical assistance contract with
SwedeSurvey.

Land registration authorities (municipal and national level) have been able to procure with
NDF support significant quantities of the hardware, software and equipment that has been
used by the Project and continues to be in use in the country.

Sustainability:
The project has helped set up and strengthen a number of land registration offices in urban
areas. The titling and land registration surveys have provided municipalities and central
government with improved instruments for expanding their tax base. In the case of
Chinandega, where NDF financed the land registry system, these instruments led to a 32
percent increase in property taxes to the municipality. There is a high level of ownership



                                              54
to the project through the participation and involvement of key State institutions. The
project has focused on testing and setting up SIICAR which is now working in some
municipalities thanks to the World Bank/NDF support. The plan is to replicate SIICAR in
other areas during PRODEP II. In conclusion, it is noted that most of the results produced
by NDF support have good sustainability prospects since they address fundamental
building blocks such as systems development and financing sources.
