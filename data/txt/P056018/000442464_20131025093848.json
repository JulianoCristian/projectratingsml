development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the sustainability of outcomes of land administration\n            interventions requires building broad social and political\n            commitment, as well as maintaining and mainstreaming key\n            competencies across electoral cycles. The complexity of\n            recognizing indigenous people's land rights requires\n            attention to historical and social particularities and\n            intensive social supervision. Improving a land\n            administration system involves gradual changes in the legal\n            and institutional frameworks. A strong focus on\n            municipalities is critical to the sustainability of\n            investments on cadaster and registry modernization in\n            Nicaragua. Alternative conflict resolution (ACR) mechanisms\n            can effectively facilitate cadastral and regularization processes."}, "docdt": "2013-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
