                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term development objective of the Land Administration Project is to improve the security of land tenure and thereby: (i) develop and establish a national
                         policy, legal, institutional and technical framework to support a systematic property rights administration that is efficient, reliable and equitable; (ii) develop, implement
                         and validate a systematic methodology, which would accelerate and improve the processing of requests for new titles and title reviews in three departments so that it
                         could be subsequently applied nationwide; eliminate backlog of title requests; (iii) achieve substantial progress in the recognition and definition of Indigenous Peoples
                         land rights and demarcate 15 territories and community lands; (iv) achieve substantial progress in the definition and demarcation of existing and proposed protected
                         areas and critical habitats.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government is preparing a Second Land Administration Project (P121152), which will be financed by an IDA Credit of approximately US$40.0 million (including an Contingency
                         Emergency Response Component of US$8.0 million to ensure rapid access for Nicaragua to funds in case of a disaster). Reflecting a Government's request, on October 2, 2012 the
                         Bank approved a Project Preparation Advance (PPA) that is supporting project preparation and ensuring continuity between the current and new project. Next mission is planned for
                         January 2013.
