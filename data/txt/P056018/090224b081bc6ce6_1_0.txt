                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term development objective of the Land Administration Project is to improve the security of land tenure and thereby: (i) develop and establish a national
                         policy, legal, institutional and technical framework to support a systematic property rights administration that is efficient, reliable and equitable; (ii) develop, implement
                         and validate a systematic methodology, which would accelerate and improve the processing of requests for new titles and title reviews in three departments so that it
                         could be subsequently applied nationwide; eliminate backlog of title requests; (iii) achieve substantial progress in the recognition and definition of Indigenous Peoples
                         land rights and demarcate 15 territories and community lands; (iv) achieve substantial progress in the definition and demarcation of existing and proposed protected
                         areas and critical habitats.
