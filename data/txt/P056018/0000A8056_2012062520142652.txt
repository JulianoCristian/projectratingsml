                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term development objective of the Land Administration Project is to improve the security of land tenure and thereby: (i) develop and establish a national
                         policy, legal, institutional and technical framework to support a systematic property rights administration that is efficient, reliable and equitable; (ii) develop, implement
                         and validate a systematic methodology, which would accelerate and improve the processing of requests for new titles and title reviews in three departments so that it
                         could be subsequently applied nationwide; eliminate backlog of title requests; (iii) achieve substantial progress in the recognition and definition of Indigenous Peoples
                         land rights and demarcate 15 territories and community lands; (iv) achieve substantial progress in the definition and demarcation of existing and proposed protected
                         areas and critical habitats.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is advancing well due to strong Government commitment, strong inter-institutional coordination, and an emphasis on municipal level implementation.
                         Currently, 94% percent of total funds under the project's Additional Financing have been disbursed. The Government has requested a Second Phase to expand the program to other
                         departments.
