   modernization of five tank irrigation schemes (small\n            reservoirs with earth-filled dams, typically with a storage\n            capacity of a few thousand acre-feet) in the north-central\n            dry zone, serving a total irrigable cultivated area of\n            31,500 ac. The project would include construction works for\n            improving irrigation and drainage facilities. To enable\n            farmers to cope with the tightened crop calendars and to\n            intensify cropping pattterns, the project would also provide\n            for a substantial increase in farm equipment for land\n            preparation and plant protection. The agricultural\n            supporting services would be strengthened, particularly the\n            extension service, and supplies of farm inputs would be\n            improved. For proper handling of the increased farm\n            production, farm roads would be improved. Finally, the\n            project would provide technical assistance for improving the\n            operation and maintenance of the irrigation systems."}, "docdt": "1976-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
