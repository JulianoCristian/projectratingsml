{"cdata!": "The Economic and Public Sector Reform\n            Credit Project aims to support the implementation of the\n            Government's interim poverty reduction strategy paper\n            (IPRSP). The IPRSP aims to improve the living conditions for\n            Kenyans through measures to promote broad-based growth and\n            poverty reduction by encouraging income-generating\n            activities and improved access to basic social services. The\n            credit will focus on a) improvement in the governance\n            framework, particularly in areas that will improve\n            transparency and prudential over-sight of government\n            spending, and b) introduction of a budget consistent with\n            the resource envelope constraints determined by a realistic\n            medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). c) Related to the\n            MTEF, a shift is envisaged in the composition of public\n            expenditure towards the priority poverty reduction programs\n            identified in the forthcoming full PRSP. Other core areas\n            include: d) implementation of right-sizing of the civil\n            service, in line with the core functions of the government\n            and the priorities of the PRSP, and e) implementation of a\n            new and more ambitious privatization strategy. The credit\n            will improve the environment for economic governance and\n            strengthen market confidence so that both public and private\n            resources will be used efficiently to promote growth and\n            improve living conditions."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
