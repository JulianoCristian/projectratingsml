Kenya's Interim Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), and, to improve the\n            outlook for economic growth, and poverty reduction in the\n            medium term, initially by containing the fragile\n            macroeconomic situation, and fiscal difficulties. Although\n            macroeconomic stability masks significant structural\n            weaknesses in the economy, and, from a policy viewpoint, the\n            structure of public spending seemingly favors a recurrent\n            wage-bill expenditure, leaving little for investment in\n            physical, human capital, and services delivery, commitments\n            nonetheless, to improving the economic governance framework\n            are strong, much beyond the conditionality of the Credit.\n            Ten conditions regarding institutional auditing reforms,\n            financial regulations to improve the budget process, the\n            transparency of public spending, donor finance payments, the\n            procurement process, the legal framework on privatization of\n            public utilities, and, some legal and judicial reforms have\n            been met. However, two conditions, civil service\n            restructuring, and financing of core poverty programs, have\n            not been fully met, but for which a waiver is recommended\n            based on the fact that substantial retrenchment was\n            achieved, and that, while core poverty expenditures have\n            been technically difficult (in a way not fully appreciated\n            at the time of project design), steps have been taken to\n            strengthen mechanisms to fully protect spending on these programs."}, "docdt": "2003-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
