The lessons learned indicate that\n            conditions such as retrenching civil servants, or\n            implementing an action plan are intermediate indicators,\n            should be clearly specified in the program matrix.\n            Far-reaching reforms, especially those requiring approval of\n            parliament, require time to build support among key\n            stakeholders. Assessing government commitment to reform is\n            difficult, particularly when key decision-makers, such as\n            the minister of finance, profess their commitment to the\n            program. Understand the impact of the reforms on various\n            stakeholders and work with government to develop mitigation\n            strategies to gain support for reform. Focus on a limited\n            set of key reforms. Offer a series of annual single tranche\n            budget support credits, rather than multitranche operations.\n            Take care to build effective partnerships with the IMF and\n            other donors in designing and supervising policy based\n            lending operations. Consult with the parliament, civil\n            society, and other stakeholders in designing and\n            implementing the reform program, and develop an effective\n            communications strategy. Support increased participation of\n            the private sector in the economy through deregulation,\n            concessioning, and other forms of public-private\n            partnerships, rather than insisting on privatization of\n            specific enterprises."}, "docdt": "2004-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
