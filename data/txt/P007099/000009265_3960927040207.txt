MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE INSTITUTO ECUATORIANO DE-TELECOMUNICACIONES
FOR A FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for
US$45 million to the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Telecomunicaciones (IETEL), with
the guarantee of the Republic of Ecuador, is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for a 17-year term including 5 years grace at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance a telecommunica-
tions project. Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) is expected to
provide £15 million sterling (US$27 million equivalent) as joint cofinancing
on terms similar to the proposed Bank loan. Other parallel cofinancing
sources include Italy US$5.7 million equivalent, France US$47.2 million
equivalent, Japan US$45 million equivalent, Spain US$6.7 million equivalent,
Brazil US$7.7 million equivalent and Mexico US$8.1 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  Telecommunication services in Ecuador are inadequate
with only about 3.5 telephone lines per 100 inhabitants, compared to an
average of 7.0 lines per 100 inhabitants for Latin America as a whole. There
is a large unmet demand for services. Service quality is poor in both rural
and urban areas reflecting network congestion and unserviceable or faulty
equipment and cables that need to be replaced or rehabilitatec.
3.       The Instituto Ecuatoriano de Telecomunicaciones (IETEL), a government
entity, provides international and domestic long distance telephone and telex
services and local telephone service to over 952 of the telephone users.
IETEL's efficiency has been constrained by a poor institutional environment.
Government regulations and procedures require approvals from several
Government agencies and restrict managerial options. Financial,
administrative and managerial systems are weak. Staff training has been
inadequate, contributing to a large extent to poor network maintenance. The
Government and IETEL have recognized the urgent need for improvements in
IETEL. IETEL has taken initiatives to improve performance through corporate
reorganization and strengthening of operations and maintenance procedures with
assistance of foreign consultants. While some constraints need to be
addressed in the context of overall public sector management in Ecuador, the
proposed project and the ongoing public sector management loan (PSML) (Loan
2156-EC) will support major institutional development (para. 6).
4.       While international tariffs, which are pegged to the US dollar are
adequate, domestic tariff levels have been amongst the lowest in the world.
This resulted in increasing subsidies to local service, reducing revenues for
expansion and rehabilitation and increasing network congestion from excessive
use. There has been severe underinvestment in the sector resulting from
(a) lack of resources; (b) low priority given in the past to the sector by the
Government, and thus limited access to external financing; and
(iii) procurement difficulties wv'ch limited expansion to small purchases from
existing suppliers.

5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in Ecuador is to
support macroeconomic and sector policy reform through both'policy based
lending and project loans. As part of these efforts, emphasis is placed on
improving the efficiency of public enterprises, supporting Government efforts
to improve public finances, and development of infrastructure through
appropriate rehabilitation and expan-ion investments. The proposed project is
designed to extend these efforts to the Telecommunications Sector. The
project will help alleviate key constraints whicb have limited sector
development and improve pricing policies. Bank involvement would help the
sector correct past underinvestment and sustain a healthy rate of growth by
promoting more cost effectXve and efficient procurement and project
implementation, increased institutional efficiency and improved sector
policies.
6.       Project Objectives.  The project, the first Bank telecommunications
operation in Ecuador, together with PSML, aims at alleviating the most
critical sector deficiencies. The focus of the PSML is on improving IETEL's
financial, administrative, and managerial systems and procedures. The
proposed project would supplement PSML initiatives (providing further
assistance with institutional strengthening) and would focus on alleviating
physical and resoirce constraints. Specifically, the project would help:
(a) improve the quality of, and access to, telecommunications services in
Ecuador through rehabilitation and expansion of the telecommunications network
and replacement of obsolete equipment; (b) strengthen IETEL's management and
organization and increase its commercial orientation; (c) improve service to
business subscr!bers by modernizing and expanding international telephone,
telex and data services; (d) improve IETEL's procurement practices; and
(e) increase private sector participation through development and use of
private contractors for installation of cables and construction of outside
plant.
7.       Proiect Description.  The proposed project comprises works for:
(a) expansion of local telephone service to 189,000 additional subscribers;
(b) rehabilitation of the cable network in Guayaquil to improve service to
about 50,000 existing subscribers; (c) expansion of the long distance network
by addition of five transit exchanges and associated interexchange routes;
(d) extension of service to rural communities through installation of 76
exchanges in rural areas; and (e) expansion and modernization of international
telephone, telex and data service. The project would also assist IETEL's
institutional development through: (a) technical cooperation or "twinning"
between IETEL and a more developed telecommunications administration; (b) a
management development program for IETEL staff; and (c) technical assistance
to help strengthen IETEL's project implementation capacity. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$330.0 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US$241.4 million (73%).

8.       Agreed Actions:   The Government has agreed on the following: (a) an
increase in domestic call charges from 0.3 sucre (US$0.0015) per impulse to
1.5 sucre (US$0.006) and periodic tariff reviews thereafter to ensure a rate
of return of at least 10% on average net revalued fixed assets, debt service
coverage of at least 1.5 times and net internal cash generation equivalent to
at least 30% of the two year average of its total investments; (b) targets for
agreed performance indicators for FY89 and FY90 relating to financial
performance, project execution, institutional efficiency, and quality of
service; and (c) a detailed time-bound institutional development action plan
which will include measures to improve overall institutional performance,
financial performance and operational efficiency.  It will be a condition of
loan effectiveness that financing covtracts with CDC, Italy and Japan would be
effective. With respect to other cofinancing sources where equipment to be
financed 15 not expected to be installed before mid-1990, the Bank would have
the right to suspend all or part of the loan if such cofinancing is not in
place by June 30, 1990. Signed contracts for conaultancies financed under the
project will be conditions of disbursement for cable contracts. Financial
covenants will require verification of accounts receivable by September 30,
1989 and revaluation of fixed assets by December 31, 1989.
9.       Benefits.  Economic benefits are expected from improved quality and a
more efficient and cost effective provision of telecommunication services.
The economic rate of return is 31%.
10.      Proiect Risks.  Project risks relate to (a) IETEL's ability to
implement the project, given past low levels of investment and institutional
weaknesses and (b) maintenance of management stability and polttical support
for institutional improvements and policy changes. The first will be
minimized by (a) using private foreign and local contractors for cable
installation; and (b) having turnkey contracts for exchange and transmission
equipment. Consulting engineers will assist IETEL with project
implementation. The second risk will be minimized through agreements on a
long-term action pla&a committing the company to specific performance targets
and actions during project implementation, and through close supervision
during 1988 and 1989. Loan conditionalities with respect to project
implementation will also help reduce this risk.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
