World Bank\n            performance is adjudged to be highly satisfactory while\n            Borrower performance is satisfactory. The list of lessons\n            learned include the following: Termination of Consulting\n            services for project management should be available to the\n            PMU until all civil works have been fully completed, tested,\n            and commissioned to ensure that Bank funding and assistance\n            is available in the case of failures during any of these\n            events. The Cambodian electricity company (EDC) was left\n            alone to bring up claims of incomplete works and equipment\n            breakdown to the Contractor. Resolution of these issues has\n            burdened EDC staff time and resources. Current Bank\n            procurement practices regarding conflict of interest could\n            interfere with efficient project implementation in that\n            mandatory selection of different consulting firms for\n            preparation and supervision reduces ownership of bidding\n            documents and continuity in project management.\n            Collaboration between the Borrower and the Implementing\n            Agency is more effective when there is open communication\n            and clear understanding of the different roles of each,\n            particularly at the senior management level. When selecting\n            turn-key contracts types, attention should be given to the\n            implementation capacity and technology needs of the\n            implementing agency. Implementation of a land acquisition\n            program needs a firm compensation policy that applies\n            uniform standards of compensation."}, "docdt": "2001-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
