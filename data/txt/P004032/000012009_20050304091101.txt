  OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellence and independencein evaluation.


About this Report
     The Operations Evaluation Department assesses the programsand activities of the World Bankfor two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is
producingthe expectedresults, and second, to help develop improveddirections, policies, and procedures through
the disseminationof lessons drawnfrom experience. As part of this work, OED annuallyassesses about 25 percentof
the Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperations for assessment, preference is given to thosethat are
innovative, large,or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;thosefor which
ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management have requested assessments; andthosethat are likelyto generate
important lessons. The projects, topics, and analytical approaches selected for assessmentsupport larger evaluation
studies.
     A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is basedon a review of the ImplementationCompletion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for onsite discussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to
validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
OED studies.
     Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally, the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the OED RatingSystem
     The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
     Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistentwith the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved,or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human,financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictability of institutionalarrangements andlor (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutional arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intendedand unintendedeffects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevantobjectives were achieved,or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance:The extent to which services providedby the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequatetransition arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance:The extent to which the borrowerassumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation,and complied with covenants and agreements,towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) prepared by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) for the Cambodia-Phnom Penh Power
Rehabilitation Project. The project was approved on September 28, 1995,for an IDA
credit of US$40 million equivalent and closed on June 30,2000, after an extension of 6
months. Actual IDA financing (US$35.2 million disbursed) was lower due to the highly
competitive bids for equipment and installation works.

        The Phnom Penh Power Rehabilitation Project was assessed because it was IDA'S
first operation in Cambodia following a long period of political turmoil, and tested the
feasibility of reforming the electricity sector of a small, poor and post-conflict country.

        The PPAR is based on the Implementation Completion Report (Report No.
22038) prepared by the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific Region and dated March 26,
2001, the IDA credit documents, and interviews. An OED mission visited Cambodia in
March 2004 to discuss the effectiveness of the Bank's assistance with the government,
the project implementing agency, private power investors, and other stakeholders. Their
cooperation in granting interviews and providing data is gratefully acknowledged.

        Since this first project, IDA has financed a follow-up operation, the Rural
Electrification and Transmission Project, which is cofinanced by the Global Environment
Facility to promote renewable energy. The project was approved in 2003 and started
implementation in 2004.

        Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. Comments have been
taken into account.

Summary

        The Phnom Penh Power Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2782), which was
approved in 1995and closed in 2000, was IDA'Sfirst operation in the electricity sector in
Cambodia. It was implemented after a long period of political conflict, and was a test
case for reforming the fragmented electricity sector of a small country that is one of the
poorest in the world.

        The project's objectives were to: (i) rehabilitate Phnom Penh's distribution
system; (ii) assist the Government of Cambodia (GOC) in its initial efforts to strengthen
sector institutions; and (iii) create an environment in which the power sector can be
developed and operated efficiently with private sector participation. The project's main
result was to re-establish quickly an adequate supply of electricity in the Phnom Penh
area by rehabilitating Phnom Penh's distribution system, with the following benefits: (i)
improvement of the reliability of supply to existing customers; (ii) reduction of system
losses through the improvement of transmission and distribution efficiency; and (iii)
provision for additional distribution capacity, to satisfy rapidly growing demand.

        The project's outcome is rated satisfactory. The project enabled the expansion of
energy access in Phnom Penh, exceeding appraisal targets, as reflected in improvements
in several operational (but not financial) performance indicators of Electricite du
Cambodge (EdC), including system losses as well as service quality and reliability; and
enabled the GOC and the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) -with IDA
advice and technical assistance -to initiate important reforms, including the
restructuring of the electricity sector, the establishment of a legal and regulatory
framework, and the formulation of sound bases for sector planning and investment
decisions. The project achieved an economic internal rate of return near the appraised
level of about 22 percent.

        The project's sustainability is rated likely. The rating takes into account the
groundbreaking (and continuing) sector reforms in a post-conflict country, EdC's
technical and other operational improvements, and the clearly long-term benefits of
operating the distribution facilities that the project financed. The project's institutional
development impact is rated substantial, in view of the project's success in: (i)
strengthening EdC's management, project implementation capabilities and business
operations; and (ii) providing training, advice, and technical assistance to MIME to draft
and negotiate the Electricity Act (promulgated in 2000), create the Electricity Authority
of Cambodia as sector regulator, set energy policy and plan sector development, and
continue legal and regulatory reforms. The Bank'sperformance is rated highly
satisfactory. This is based on the project's high quality at entry and its considerable
assistance to the Borrower in the project's technical, institutional and sector policy
aspects. The Borrower's performance is rated satisfactory, despite the long delays in
promulgating power sector reforms. EdC's performance was satisfactory, having
implemented the project within budget and without major delays, which is noteworthy in
a first operation with IDA and given its limited skills at the start. The government and
EdC were strongly committed to the project. However, although not related to an explicit
objective, the government has been slow in addressing the precarious financial position

                                               A




of EdC, which is partly caused by the government's own significant arrears on its power
purchases from EdC.

        At the sector level, the project yielded two important lessons of broad
applicability. First, it showed that sector reforms can be initiated successfully when there
is strong government commitment, even in post-conflict countries with difficult political,
economic, and institutional environments. Under these conditions, the Bank can provide
a key facilitating role through its financing of critical physical investments, technical
assistance and advice focused on improving electricity sector efficiency and establishing
an independent and transparent legal and regulatory framework. Second, for small
countries with limited institutional capacity, electricity sector reforms should first focus
on commercialization and choosing a market structure that is tailored to the country's
circumstances. Private sector participation can be introduced once the governance
structure and commercial operations are in place.

        At the project level, two lessons emerge from implementation experience. First,
the use of expert advisers should be designed to ensure that they transfer their
management and technical skills to local staff, rather than supplant local capacity by
performing the key tasks with little or no skills transfer. Second, continuity in the Task
Manager during project preparation, implementation and completion is an important
factor in fostering better understanding by the Bank of the Borrower'sneeds and greater
cooperation from the country client.

        In terms of future strategy, the two main challenges facing Cambodia's power
sector are to broaden access for the poor in a manner that is fully integrated with overall
                                            -
power sector reforms     -  as the country moves toward private power provision and the
commercialization of the power sector.

1.      Country Background

1.1     In the early 1990s,Cambodia emerged from almost three decades of war and
political turmoil. Almost a third of its population 2 to 3 million people had been killed
                                                     -                          -
by genocide, its educated middle class had been decimated, and its physical infrastructure
and institutions destroyed. Cambodia was already poor before the conflict and is worse
off today.

1.2     With a current GNP per capita of US$300, Cambodia is one of the poorest
countries in the world. Over 80percent of Cambodians live in rural areas and are
employed in the agriculture sector, which accounts for half of the country's GDP.
Poverty in Cambodia defined by lack of access to adequate health, education, water,
                        -
electricity and roads is highest in the rural areas, lowest in Phnom Penh, and moderate
                       -
in other urban areas.'

1.3     Since 1992,the international community has supported Cambodia's rehabilitation
and development. As part of this process, the government has carried out reforms in
various sectors, including power as a high priority, out of conviction as well as dire
necessity. The lack of domestic resources has compelled the Cambodian government to
finance those reforms with donor funds accounting for two-thirds of all public
investments, which have strongly influenced the reform agenda,. But as noted in
Cambodia's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), "there remains a gap between
public pronouncements and real achievements on the ground with regard to reforms in
governance and anti-corruption, which could undermine donor assistance, private
investment, the quality of services and in general, the credibility of the Government's
commitment to reform implementation."


THE CAMBODIAN POWER SECTOR

1.4     Cambodia's power sector was severely damaged after three decades of war and
neglect. Its institutions remain weak, and its power supply is unreliable, costly, and
mostly limited to urban areas.' Only 13percent of households in the country have access
to publicly provided electricity, the lowest electrification rate among East Asian
countrie~.~Demand for electricity is concentrated in Phnom Penh, which accounts for 70

in 1993 and the incorporation of Electricity du Cambodge (EdC) in 1996.MIME was
established with the following mandates: (i) planning, formulating policy, regulating and
auditing the energy sector; (ii) generating and distributing electricity; and (iii)
coordinating energy projects, including donor activities. EdC was given responsibility for
electricity supply in Cambodia and until 1996,operated as a government department
under the direction of MIME. In 1996, EdC was converted into a wholly state-owned
limited liability corporation in accordance with the Law of Public Enterprises.6The
decree also granted EdC non-exclusive rights to generate, transmit, and distribute
electricity throughout Cambodia. Since 1996,EdC has been gradually taking over
electricity supply from private service providers outside Phnom Penh (see paragraph 1.7
below).

1.6       EdC's sources of electricitysupply come from its own generation and independent
power producers (IPPs). Out of a total capacityof 140MW (of which 109MW is
dependable),private operatorsprovide around 45 percent of installed capacityand 74%
percent of generation.Private participationis officially encouragedunder the new
Electricity Law, whose Article 2 provides for "favorableconditions for capital investments
in, and the commercial operationof the (power) industry", and more specificallyfor "...the
promotion of private ownership and the establishmentof competition". Privateproducers
are included in EdC's future expansion plans, and EdC has hrther contracts for Power
Purchase Agreements (PPAs)under discussionwith potential IPPs. In addition to five
large producers, hundreds of smallprivateproviders provide diesel-basedsupplyto major
towns and rural areas (5% of total consumption). Moreover,thousands of auto-generators
provide either independent supplyto consumers,or back-up to EdC's supply (another 5%
of consumption).' Outside Phnom Penh, private operatorsprovide a wide range of services
fiom recharging batteries to distributingelectricitydirectlyto homes.

1.7       In the mid-l990s, a large part of Phnom Penh's distribution network was in poor
condition and subject to interruptions, failures, and high losses. These losses were largely
attributable to the "wholesaling" arrangement under which EdC had been operated since
1991.Under this arrangement, EdC would sell some 50 percent of its energy to 148
"wholesalers" who were responsible for supplying low-voltage power to about 40,000
consumers. Although this arrangement relieved EdC from the usually cumbersome retail
operation, it was a main cause of high technical and financial losses since wholesalers'
installations were highly inefficient and poorly maintained, and charged rates were much
higher than EdC's authorized retail rate.


THE WORLD BANK'S SUPPORT FOR THE POWER SECTOR

1.8       The Phnom Penh Power RehabilitationProject is the first IDA-supported project in
Cambodia. The World Bank's 1999CambodiaPower Sector Strategypaper identified a set
of development objectivesand strategiesfor the short and medium term to addressthe most

salientproblems of the sector.These included: (a) the lack of a legal and regulatory
framework; (b) an entrenched public-orientedapproach in the management of public
utilities; (c) poor technical, commercial, and financial performance of the sector; (d) weak
investmentplanning; (e) lack of resources and strategyto provide electricityto rural areas;
and (0a weak human resource base. The strategiesidentified revolved aroundthree
development objectives:(i) improvingpower sector efficiencyand reducing electricity cost
through corporatizationand commercializationof EdC, including a tariff reform and
performance-based contract and strategicpartnership with a foreignutility; (ii) addressing
social concernsthrough an electrificationprogram; and (iii) establishingan enabling
environment for an effectivedevelopmentand operationof the power sector through the
establishmentof a suitable legal and regulatory framework.The Phnom Penh Power
Rehabilitation Project was designed to supportthe government in initiatingthese reforms.

1.9      In recent years, however, the Bank showed signs of waning interest in the power
sector in general and defacto, ceded the lead role to the Asian Development Bank
(ADB). Some indicative signs of its withdrawal from the sector are noted in the 2003
PRSP and National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (NPRSP), as well as in the 2003
Public Expenditure Review (PER). These documents focused on institutional and sector
reforms in Cambodia, but provided scant discussion of power sector reforms. A further
sign of the Bank's retreat from the power sector in Cambodia was the slow processing of
the Rural Electrification and Transmission Project (Credit No. 3840 approved in
December 2003), which was intended to serve as the vehicle for the Bank's continued
support for power sector reform. As the Bank's interest eroded during the late-1990s and
early-2000s, there has also been an overall decrease in financial support for the power
sector from the rest of the donor community.



2.       The Project

PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS

2.1      The Phnom Penh Power Rehabilitation Project had three objectives:

         1) Rehabilitate Phnom Penh's distribution system.
         2) Assist the government in its initial efforts to strengthen sector institutions.
         3) Create an environment in which the power sector can be developed and
              operated efficiently with private sector participation.

2.2      The project was too ambitious with regard to the expected outcomes in sector
reform. While the project was intended to be a stepping stone to long-term sector
objectives, the proposed timetable for implementing sector reform proved to be too
optimistic and was unachievable during project implementation. Although ambitious
targets were useful in putting more pressure on the borrower, a more realistic timetable
would have reduced the risk of noncompliance with legal covenants.

2.3      The project had two major components:

                                                    4


        1) Rehabilitation of Phnom Penh's distribution system,including: (i)
            construction of about 23 kilometers of 115-kVtransmissioncircuits around the
            perimeter of Phnom Penh to connect three new primary 115/22-kVsubstations;'
            (ii) constructionof about 100cct-km of 22-KV underground and overhead
            lines, 300 kilometers of low-voltage(LV) lines, 40 MVA Ar power factor
            correction equipment, about 40,000 consumer connections;(iii)provision of
            support facilities,includingtools and equipment, communicationsfor system
            operations, storage areas, and logistics controls;and (iv) improvementof
            environmentaland safety conditionsat existingpower plants.
        2) Technical assistance (TA) to: (i) EdC, on procurement and engineering,
            importation of management services, strengthening of commercial operations,
            setting up an environmental unit and implementing the land acquisition and
            compensation plan (LACP), and in training its staff; and (ii) MIME, on the
            definition and implementation of a new sector structure and regulatory
            framework, and in training its staff in energy planning.

2.4     The estimated total project cost at appraisal was US$45.7 million eq~ivalent,~of
which US$40 million was to be financed by IDA, and US$5.7 million by EdC and
government equity. The actual project cost'' was US$41.7 million, which was 8.7percent
lower than the appraisal estimate. The total IDA financing was US$35.2 million
(compared with the appraisal estimate of US$40 million). Actual government financing
amounted to US$6.5 million. The lower project cost was achieved primarily through a
very competitive bidding process that resulted in lower costs of the bids for most of the
equipment and installation works.

IMPLEMENTATION RECORD

2.6      The project was approved in September 28, 1995, and was expected to close in
December 30, 1999.The project's closing date was extended for six months to June 30,
2000 to complete additional extensions of new line bays at one grid station. Except for
the technical assistance component for MIME, EdC was responsible for implementing the
project, with the help of various international consultants in management, design, and
procurement, as well as construction supervision. A Project Management Unit was
constituted within EdC to coordinate and direct the project.

2.7      The project was rated "at risk" in the aftermath of the 1997political turmoil and
Asian financial crisis, based on four factors: (i) poor compliance with legal covenants due
to delays in the enactment of the Electricity Law and in the implementation of the sector
reform timetable; (ii) shortage of counterpart funds because of the government's
precarious budget situation; (iii) poor financial performance of EdC; and (iv) weak
macroeconomic condition. The slow disbursement of counterpart funds presented special
difficulties for EdC, which needed to pay within 28 days per contract, yet the government
would stretch payments over 2 to 3 months, and each installment required cumbersome
application processes. By the end of 1998,however, the timeliness of counterpart funding

                                                      6


and compliance with legal covenants had been sufficiently addressed to remove the
project from the "at risk" category.       "


2.8      Despite the government's clear commitment to energy sector reform, delays in
implementing key actions resulted from political instability and lengthy rounds of
consultations that were required ahead of any legislative action, causing the government
to default on several dated covenants. However, the lengthy debates within the
government significantly enhanced ownership of the reform process.

2.9      During project preparation, the risk of land acquisition problems emerged due
mainly to the absence of applicable laws, and the limited experience and training of EdC
and local government agencies in land acquisition and compensation issues. IDA
provided assistance to EdC to develop a policy framework and a land acquisition and
compensation plan (LACP). With the government's approval, the timetable for LACP
implementation was agreed during project negotiations. During implementation, the
project provided consulting services to help EdC implement the LACP, including the
preparation of a Due Process Manual. Land acquisition under the project is small, and the
initial implementation problems were resolved. The project helped to further develop
EdC's policy framework, procedures, and implementation arrangements in anticipation of
land acquisition and compensation for future power projects.



3.        Ratings

OUTCOME

3.1       The project's outcome is rated satisfactory based on the ratings of "substantial"
for each of the three sub-criteria of relevance, efficiency and efficacy, which are
discussed below. This rating concurs with the rating in the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR). Assessed in terms of IDA'S development effectiveness, the project has
enabled IDA to expand energy access while playing a key advisory role in helping the
Government of Cambodia during the initial stages of reform, including the establishment
of a suitable legal and regulatory framework, the restructuring of the electricity sector,
and the formulation of sound planning and investment decisions.

RELEVANCE

3.2       The relevance of the project's objectives is rated substantial. The project was
responsive to Cambodia's needs and development priorities at the time of project
preparation and remains so today. It was also consistent with both the 1995 and the 2000
Country Assistance Strategies and the Bank's Energy Business Renewal Strategy of May
2001.

11.The Asian financial crisis was a significant external factor beyond the control of the government and
EdC, which resulted in the sharp devaluation of the Riel and SDR against the U.S. dollar. The political
crisis of 1997-98 paralyzed all Bank activities and interrupted the policy dialogue on sector reform for
almost a year.

                                                   7


3.3     The project's objectives were consistent with Cambodia's priorities at the time of
project preparation and approval in 1994-95. After decades of war and destruction, the
new government wished to rebuild infrastructure, strengthen institutions, reform the
power sector, and attract private sector participation. In its October 1995Energy Sector
Position Paper, the government set the power sector's primary goal as the rehabilitation
and reconstruction of the existing electricity distribution systems,particularly in Phnom
Penh, and installation of new generation capacity to alleviate severe shortages and meet
suppressed power demand. At that time, the government also proposed a new Electricity
Law that would favor private participation supported by the project and establish EdC as
an autonomous corporation. It was in this context that the government requested the Bank
to assist in rehabilitating and reinforcing Phnom Penh's distribution system, while private
investors met the city's short-term generation requirements. The project was a key
component of EdC's least-cost expansion, since without the rehabilitation of distribution
networks, efforts to expand generation would not yield sustained benefits. The
importance of addressing distribution network issues, without which generation
expansion could be put at substantial risk, was an important finding in OED's 2003
evaluation of the World Bank Group's performance in promoting private sector
development in the electricity sector.'*

3.4     The project's objectives were consistent with the June 1995 Country Assistance
Strategy, which focused the Bank's support on helping the government to set clear
priorities, carry out analytical work, implement critical measures that will have a
significant and quick development impact on each sector. The project's objectives remain
consistent with the more recent February 2000 Country Assistance Strategy, which called
for the privatization of EdC, as well as policy and regulatory measures to attract foreign
power investors and support public-private partnerships.

3.5     The project's objectives were also consistent with two of the four main priorities
of the Bank's Energy Business Renewal Strategy, namely, to support private sector
development, and promote macro-fiscal balancing (which the project did not achieve). It
should be noted, however, that the National Poverty Reduction Strategy is silent on the
implementation of the power sector reform.


EFFICACY

3.6     The project's efficacy is rated high: thephysical objectives were fully achieved,
the sector reform objective was substantially achieved, while the institutional
strengthening objective (particularly with respect to EdC) was only modestly achieved, as
discussed in the section below on the Institutional Development Impact.


Physical Achievements

3.7     The OED mission reviewed with EdC the project performance indicators in
Annex 1 of the ICR and found them to be accurate. The mission visited the 23 kilometers

of 115-kVtransmission lines around the perimeter of Phnom Penh, as well as the three
115/22/15-kV substations that were financed under the project. All were in good
condition and functioning well in improving the quality of power supply. In addition,
about 144kilometers of 22-kV medium-voltage lines and 400 kilometers of low-voltage
lines were constructed, which have improved supply reliability to existing customers as
evidenced by the quasi-elimination of blackouts in Phnom Penh, as well as transmission
and distribution efficiency. The project also financed tools, vehicles, radio equipment,
and a telecommunications system, which facilitated EdC's capacity to monitor system
losses and improve communications between the central and new substations. The project
also provided a new control system that has allowed EdC to monitor service quality by
recording power supply interruptions.

3.8    About 55,000 new consumers were connected to electricity service, almost 38
percent more than targeted at appraisal (40,000). In total, residential and commercial
consumers had increased from 43,800 in 1995to 88,334 by the end of September 2000
(the project was closed in June 2000). As new equipment was installed, system losses
were reduced from 24 percent in 1995to 16.5percent as of October 30,2000;
wholesalers were phased-out by October 1998; and the billing and collection system was
computerized. With the project, the wholesaler installations were replaced by a new low-
voltage network and consumer connections.


Sector Reform Achievements

3.9    The institutional development objectives underpinning reform were also achieved,
albeit with significant delays. The project established a policy and regulatory framework
conducive to efficient power sector development and operation, including private
participation. EdC was established as a separate legal entity in September 1996
(compared to the appraisal target of December 1995). Subsequently, EdC's Board of
Directors became effective in August 1997, and a study on "Corporatization of EdC and
Regulatory Framework of the Electricity Sector" was completed in early 1997. Electricity
wholesalers were phased out by October 1998.Most importantly, the Electricity Act was
passed by the National Assembly in November 2000 (compared to the appraisal target of
June 1996). The Act was promulgated into law in February 2001, which allowed the
subsequent establishment of the Electricity Authority of Cambodia as an independent
regulatory body for the power sector (likewise with a 4-year delay). Despite these delays,
the implementation of the above actions is particularly noteworthy in a sector
environment hampered by weak institutional capacity and political and economic crisis.
However, the financial position of EdC continues to be weak as reflected in the poor
financial indicators (negative net income and rate of return on assets in operation since
1995, and accounts receivable nearing 5.8 months toward project closing).

3.10    Given the progress in rehabilitating Phnom Penh's distribution system and
establishing a legal and regulatory framework, the project facilitated the entry of private
investors in power generation. This resulted in two LndependentPower Producer (IPP)
contracts that account for 50MW of new installed capacity, half of the system's current
capacity.

                                              9


EFFICIENCY

3.11    The project's efficiency, based on its internal economic rate of return
(EIRR), is rated high. Its ex-post EIRR of 21.8 percent is similar to the 21.5 percent
calculated at appraisal. The OED mission found in the field that the original assumptions
on costs and benefits used in the ICR were robust and the underlying data reliable, and
thus did not recalculate the ERR. The actual project costs were about US$4 million
lower than estimated at appraisal, with most of the cost reductions occurring in the
distribution system rehabilitation component, which accounted for almost 50 percent of
total project costs. Forecast incremental electricity sales from 2001 were also accurate, as
were the benefit streams associated with the reduction in technical losses, and
improvements in system reliability. Actual incremental sales were lower than appraisal
estimates by 9 percent, but this was countered by savings in capital costs and the 50
percent market penetration among Phnom Penh consumers instead of the lower appraisal
forecast of 42 percent.

3.12    EdC's Financial Performance: In seeking to strengthen sector institutions, the
project had an implicit objective of improving EdC's financial performance, which was
not achieved. EdC's financial predicament was due to factors largely outside its control
including a 45 percent devaluation of the Riel since 1997 and also low tariffs that are not
adequate for cost recovery. Although indicators have improved in 2003 and 2004, EdC's
finances also continue to be eroded by (i) technical and non-technical losses, including
theft, and (ii) high accounts receivables, especially government arrears, which were as
high as 5 to 6 months during the 1998-2002period, compared to the covenanted 3 months
of sales (see Annex B). The government also does not allow EdC to pass on a Value
Added Tax to consumers, although it has to pay loans.

3.13    The project included several financial performance covenants to achieve financial
viability for EdC, which was critical for the efficient development and operation of the
power sector. These financial covenants were included in the project: (i) EdC should
reduce the value of its outstanding accounts receivable to the equivalent of three months
of sales revenue by December 31,1998, and to two-and-a-half months of sales revenues
by December 31, 1999; (ii) for each fiscal year after 1995,EdC should generate revenues
from internal sources at least sufficient to cover all of its expenses; and (iii) for each
fiscal year after 1998,EdC should earn an annual return of not less than 6 percent. Up
until the preparation of the ICR in 2000, EdC had not been able to comply with any of
these covenants as a result of its financial condition.

3.14    The OED mission updated and reviewed EdC's financial performance indicators, as
shown in Annex B, which includetables on EdC's Summary FinancialPerformance
Indicators and EdC Phnom Penh's Financial OperatingResults (FY97-03). Based on the
last table, EdC's accountsreceivabledeteriorated after the project's closing date: the levels
were 3.7 months in 2000,4.1 in 2001, and 4.9 in 2002 (a level of 2.9 was achieved in 2003,
which is still higher than the covenanted2.5 months). Based on its consolidatedstatement,
EdC's rate of return on fixed assets was 4 . 2 percent in 2003, and 1.9percent and 1.3
percent in 2001 and 2002 respectively,comparedto the covenanted6 percent. EdC's net
income has been consistentlynegative,reaching a very high level of -45 billion riels in
2003, which nearly matched the record of -50.6 billion riels in 1998.This consistentlypoor

                                             10


financialperformance has been occurring at a time when electricitysales almost
quintupled, from 116.7GWh in 1995(project appraisal)to 532 GWh in 2003. Although
there have been some improvements (seepara. 3.24),the causes of this poor financial
performancepersist: high levels of overdue electricitybills, a significant portion of which
is from government itselfi high EdC operating expenses; and the fact that EdC's tariffs are
not linked to movements in its operatingcosts, inflation and foreign exchange.

3.15    External audits have been carried out on EdC's financial and project statements
yearly since 1998. EdC remains in full compliance with the audit report requirements of
the Credit Agreement.


INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPACT

3.16    On balance, the project's objective of strengthening sector institutions was
achieved, but with mixed results. The technical assistance (TA) component for EdC and
MIME succeeded in improving the capabilities of the two institutions and restructuring
the sector, but failed to improve EdC's poor financial performance (a more financially
sound EdC was an integral part of the project's sector reform objective). Moreover, the
terms of reference of consultants should have stipulated specific objectives on the transfer
of management, administrative, financial and technical skills, including performance
indicators that can be monitored beyond the closing date of a project.

3.17    MIME: The project's TA for MIME (US$600,000) provided MIME management
and staff with comprehensive training (in energy economics, financial management,
computer accounting), as well as advisory experts on legal and regulatory reform, the
drafting and discussion of the Electricity Act, the creation of EAC as the sector regulator,
and energy policy and planning.

3.18    EdC:The project's TA for EdC (US$3.0 million) strengthened the management,
implementation, and business aspects of its operations. EdC has installed a fully
computerized accounting, billing, and collection system; an environmental unit managed
and staffed by local personnel; and two Project Implementation Units, each with a project
manager. Under the project, EdC was also transformed from a ministerial department to
becoming an autonomous corporation and a separatejuridical entity being managed by a
Board of Directors responsible for operations. The project provided EdC with consulting
services for project design, procurement, construction supervision, and the preparation of
a Due Process Manual for the project's land acquisition and compensation plan. EdC's
staff also received training in contract supervision, project management, and grid
operations, including off-site training on high-voltage network operation and
maintenance at the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand and Electricite du Laos.
EdC headquarters staff now assist provincial branches (Siem Reap and Sihanoukville) in
computerized billing and accounting.

3.19    Despite these positive outcomes, EdC's poor financial position persists, putting at
risk past and future institutional development. Financial weakness leaves EdC unable to
generate sufficient revenues to self-finance expansion or rehabilitation investments or
even sustain operations.

                                               11


3.20    EAC:The Electricity Authority of Cambodiais responsible for licensing service
providers and has licensed 100of more than 250 potential licensees (excludingintermittent
providers). Licensing is of particular importance since it will enable the agency to monitor
service providers. The Bank assisted in developinglicensingprocedures and technical
service standards. The Bank's Public-PrivateInfrastructureAdvisory Facility (PPIAF) also
financed TA for the preparation of guidelines for the selectionof large, medium, and small
power investors, includingPower Purchase Agreement and fuel supplymodels (now being
reviewed by the government for approval). Someprivate investorshave complained,
however, that EdC may have some unfair advantage, since it can get multiple licenses,
while private operators are restrictedto only one license each and are subjectto more
stringentrequirements.

3.21    Two regulations have been prepared so far, and two new effortsto simplifyrural
electrificationand tariff-settingprocedures are underway. It is anticipatedthat the tariff
adjustment policy would not be directlypegged to fuel fluctuationsbut work instead on the
basis of a "Tariff EqualizationFund." An issue is how to define "reasonablecost." First,
there is a need to separateEdC's accounts,which are now all consolidated,thus preventing
analysis of its weak and strongparts. Second,rural entrepreneursare too numerous;
moreover, as a consumer category,they may need specialtariffs to differentiatebetween
type of fuel, scale of the business, and density of supply.Third, there is also a need to press
licensees to increase their operatingefficiency (lossesoutside EdC are 30 to 35 percent).
License fees arepaid every month (e.g., 1.1rieVkWh or 55,000 riel/mo, or about
US$14/mo, for a 50,000k W m o consumption,whch finance EAC's operations).EAC is
exploring the idea ofperformance-based tariff-setting,but this is difficultin the present
political climate in Cambodia.

3.22    All licensing requests are subject to public consultation, which is very new in
Cambodia. EAC is now setting performance standards for licensees, for which public
consultations have been completed. EAC has also finished public consultation on
procedures for resolving disputes. These procedures are being discussed with the
Ministry of Justice before being issued as regulations.


SUSTAINABILITY

3.23    The project's sustainability is rated likely, but arguably only marginally so,
given the fragile financial position of EdC. Although EdC's finances are a countervailing
factor, the "likely" rating gives significant weight to the groundbreaking structural
reforms that were implemented, the technical and operational improvements achieved by
EdC, and the benefits from operating the facilities financed under the project. The
groundbreaking reform process initiated under the project is continuing, with further
support from the ongoing Rural Electrification and Transmission Project (FY04), which
further fosters the government's efforts to promote the efficient operation, development,
and commercialization of Cambodia's power sector, including direct private
participation.

3.24    The rating also takes into account the continuing efforts to implement a Financial
Action Plan to improve EdC's finances, which the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MEF), MIME, EAC, and EdC agreed with IDA and the Asian Development Bank in

                                                 12


June 2003. As of September 2003, the government and EdC have implemented specific
elements of the plan by: (a) settling overdue electricity bills via offsets against amounts
owed to the government by EdC for customs duties and taxes, and cash transfer; (b) the
MEF setting up adequate line item budgets for each ministry, sufficient to meet their
expected electricity consumption, and implementing a plan to improve mechanisms for
collecting government arrears; (c) offsetting the VAT amounts due against EdC's excise
taxes and penalties; and (d) implementing various time-bound measures to reduce EdC's
operating expense^.'^ However, while these actions do start to address current
weaknesses, they are still inadequate as long as EdC's tariffs are not indexed to changes
in operating costs, inflation, and foreign exchange.

3.25    Finally, the rating takes into account the successful transition into regular
operations, which was evident from the OED mission's field visits. On a technical level,
                                                                                                           ~




EdC is fully capable of operating and maintaining the project investments and providing
new service connections. EdC has created two units dedicated to implementing externally
fimdedprojects and is prepared for future investments in new capacity additions,
transmission, and interconnections with other systems. Both implementation units are
staffed with full-time project managers and local staff who are accountable for
procurement, disbursement, and supervision of civil works.


BORROWER PERFORMANCE

3.26    The borrower's performance was mixed but is rated satisfactory, with the
caveats that the reforms were significantly delayed and the government has been slow to
address the fundamental issue of EdC's financial weakness. The overall "satisfactory"
rating takes into account the government's early actions during the project cycle. During
preparation and appraisal, the government met all of the Bank's conditions for Board
presentation and project effectiveness, including tariff increases, writing off government
arrears, and charging previously unbilled consumers. Key government officials acted as
local champions,who maintained dialoguewith the Bank and facilitated or securedkey
decisions from the political leadership (Le., the Minister of Finance,the National
Assembly, and the Prime Minister [co-PMs]in 1995).During implementation, however,
the government's major shortcoming was the delay in complying with several legal
covenants related to the timetable for sector reforms such as the establishment of the
energy regulatory authority and the enactment of the Electricity Act. This delay was
caused by the political crisis in 1997-1998 and the lengthy discussions required for
legislative actions. The timely release of counterpart funding was also a concem during
early stages of project implementation, but better coordination between MEF and EdC's
senior management resolved this issue.

3.27    EdC's performance as the implementing agency is also rated satisfactory. EdC
demonstrated a strong commitment to the project and implemented it within budget and
without major delays, which is noteworthy since this was the first IDA operation in the
sector and EdC's staff skills were very limited at the start.

BANK PERFORMANCE

3.28    The Bank's performance is rated highly satisfactory. This rating is consistent
with the government's rating in its contribution to the ICR, and is based primarily on the
project's highly satisfactory quality at entry. Based on OED's review of the project
archives and field interviews, it was evident that the Bank provided considerable
assistance to the borrower in both the technical, institutional, and sector policy aspects of
the project. The Bank provided relevant and timely advice and TA before and during
project preparation. The Bank supported various studies and TA work which formed the
basis for the project design, in collaboration with and with funding from the Energy
Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), the United Nations Development
Program (TJNDP), the Australian Aid Agency, and the Japanese Policy and Human
Resources Development (PHRD).

3.29    The Bank provided a legal advisor to assist MIME in draftingthe Electricity Law,
and helped ensure that the views of key stakeholderswere heard and incorporatedin its
finalization. Informantshave also creditedthe Bank for helping standardizePower
Purchase Agreements,which facilitatedprivate sector interestin Cambodia'spower sector.

3.30    Before and during project preparation, the Bank ensured that training was
provided to EdC and MIME to improve their implementation capacity, including on-the-
job training, language training, management assistance, and enhancement of EdC's
accounting capabilities. Also during project preparation, the Bank closely coordinated
with ADB, which at that time was developing projects for the power sector. The Bank
also ensured that the Borrower effectively addressed safeguard policies on environmental
and social issues during project preparation, including a land acquisition and
compensation plan, which was a condition for appraisal and was allocated funding under
the project to provide the ground work for setting up an environmental unit within EdC.

3.31    The project design itself was technically and economically sound. Before
appraisal, feasibility studies were carried out and reviewed by Bank technical experts.
The design and routing of the transmission line component consciously sought to
minimize or avoid negative impacts by choosing concrete or wood poles instead of
transmission towers and by re-routing the line along existing roads to have more
flexibility in location and minimize land disturbance. Consequently, adverse social
impacts were much less than typically expected in an urban environment. The project
included a "Performance Plan" between MIME and EdC, which sets performance
indicators to be achieved by EdC and the obligations of MIME to assist EdC in their
achievement.

3.32    Project supervision was also highly satisfactory. IDA made 12visits to the field
during the 5-year implementation period. During those visits, the project archives show
that IDA gave timely advice to MIME and EdC and MIME on project management, as
well as sector planning, policy, and reforms. During the last year of the project,
supervision was carried out directly from the Bank's Phnom Penh office, thus allowing
even closer communications between IDA, EdC, and the government. One positive factor
in IDA'Ssupervision was the continuity in task management, since the team leader
responsible for project preparation and appraisal was the same throughout project

                                                    14


implementation until completion. Informants during the OED mission credited this
continuity in staff as having fostered a better understanding by IDA of the client's needs,
which enhanced the government's willingness to cooperate with IDA.



4.      Lessons and Outlook

4.1     Giventhe substantial reform content of this project,this assessmentreport provides
lessonsthat are applicable to the sector, as well as lessons applicableto project
implementation.


Sector-LevelLessons

P Sector reforms can be initiated successfullywhen thereisstronggovernment
    commitment,even inpost-conflict countrieswith dijjkcultpolitical, economic,and
    institutional environments. Under these conditions,the Bank acts as a facilitatorby
    providing financial support for criticalphysical invesments, coupled with timely and
    relevant advice and technical assistance to the client country,focused on improving
    electricitysector efficiencyand establishing an independent and transparent legal and
    regulatory framework.For the Bank's "brokering" role to be effective,there shouldbe
    open communicationand a clearunderstanding of the accountabilities amongthe entities
    involved,particularlyat the senior management level.
P For smaller countriesand thosewith limited institutionalcapacity, electricitysector
    reforms shouldfirstfocus on commercialization and choosing a market structure that
    is tailored tothe country's circumstances. Private sectorparticipation can be introduced
    gradually, and asset divestiturecan be considered once the governance structure and a
    commercialenvironment are in ~1ace.l~


Project ImplementationLessons

>   In countries with low institutional capacity, the use of expert advisers should be
    designed to ensure that they transfer their management and technicalskills to local
    stafJ;rather than supplant local capacitybyperforming key tasks with little or no skills
    transfer. Ln additionto improving administrative efficiency, the contracts for these
    advisersshould also focus on strengtheningimplementationcapacity.
P Continuityin taskmanagementis an importantfactor ingoodprojectperformance.
    Maintainingthe same Task Manager duringproject preparation, implementation and
    completionfosters better understanding by the Bank of the Borrower'sneeds and greater
    cooperationfrom the countryclient..

Public and Private Sector Roles in the Supply of Electricity Services. 2003. Prepared by the World Bank's
Energy Anchor Unit.

Outlook

4.2      Buildingupon the achevements and lessons learned from this project,the
Governmentof Cambodiafaces three immediate challenges.The first is to broaden access for
the poor, which requires developing an appropriate strategywithin the context of the
country'swider power sectorreforms. Cambodia'smove toward privateprovision is an
alternativesincepublic provision is absent or limited. However, schemesto improvethe
poor's electricityaccess shouldbe designed within the context of an overallpower sector
strategy,particularlywith respect to the design of the regulatoryframework and the creation
of an investmentclimateconducive to privateparticipation.

4.3      The second challengeis to achieve true independence for EAC. The Electricity Law
does not give fill authorityto EAC, which still has to report to MIME, and can only exercise
"autonomyof decision as grantedby the Government." (In comments to this PPAR, it was
clarifiedthat the Electricity Law provides for EAC to fix tariffs per the Law's provisions,
while the Government can decidethe tariffpolicy. Thus, EAC is restricted in the fixation of
tariffs only to the extent that the Government has issued a tariff policy including any subsidy
to be provided. If no policy is issued by the Government, EAC is free to fix tariffs according
to the principles established in the ElectricityLaw.) In 2005 it will become apparent whether
tariff-settingwill be implemented more autonomouslyand whether EAC'smandatewill work
or not. Beyond tariff-setting, EAC will also need to addressissuesrelated to promoting least-
cost supply, affordabilityto the poor, and "motivatingthe private sector and establishing
competition,"whch are the stated missions of EAC.

4.4      The third challenge is to continuethe commercializationof the electricity sector. This
will require actions on several fi-onts." EdC should cease depending on annualbudget support.
To become independent, EdC needs to aggressivelypursue the reduction of overall system
losses,thus minimizing its cost of supplyby achieving least-cost operation and dispatch.EdC
should have the authorityto deny electricitysupplies to those who do not pay their bills. It
should also develop efficient procedures to collect arrears (computerized systemsprovided
under the project shouldprovide the initialmechanism to detect payment defaults). These will
be difficult tasks given the large arrears the government itself owes.Nevertheless, EdC should
strengthenits capability to fillyupdate its property registers,inventory suppliesand spares
based on fill physical verification. An urgent task is to unbundle tariffs by generation,
transmission,and distribution function. This is important for finctional accountingto identify
investments,assets, operating costs, and revenues, by function. Transactionsamongbusiness
units based on standard commercial contractsor industrybenchmarks, and consistent
accountingpolicies shouldbe used to allocate common costs among units. More broadly, EdC
stillneeds to align its accountingpolicies more closely to Western utility practices, and adopt
meaningfil and effective internal and external procedures based on International Accounting
Standardsand disclosurepolicies and procedures.

 Annex C: Borrower's Comments




Dear Alain Barbu,


f have gone through the above Draft Report and have the following
cosnments on Paragraph 4.3 of the above Report:

I do not agree with the obsesvations made in paragraph 4 . 3 , that "The
Electricity Law was not very robust, since it does not give full
authority to EAC, which can 5nly set; tariffs subject to Government-
established ceilings*. The Electricity Law provides that EAC has to fix
the tariffs as per the provisions made in the Electricity Law. The
Government can, of ccxarse, decide the policy. So EAC is restricted in
the fixation of tariff only to the extent the Government bas iehiued a
policy for the tariff including any subsidy to be provided by it. If no
policy I s issued by the Oovcrnmnt, EAC i s free to fix the tariff
according to the principles provided in the Electricity Law.

Yours Sincerely,

TY NORIN
