At the\n            sector level, the project yielded two important lessons of\n            broad applicability. First, it showed that sector reforms\n            can be initiated successfully when there is strong\n            government commitment, even in post-conflict countries with\n            difficult political, economic, and institutional\n            environments. Under these conditions, the Bank can provide a\n            key facilitating role through its financing of critical\n            physical investments, technical assistance, and advice\n            focused on improving electricity sector efficiency, and\n            establishing an independent and transparent legal and\n            regulatory framework. Second, for small countries with\n            limited institutional capacity, electricity sector reforms\n            should first focus on commercialization, and selecting a\n            market structure tailored to the country's\n            circumstances. Private sector participation can be\n            introduced once the governance structure and commercial\n            operations are in place. At the project level, the lessons\n            that emerge from implementation experience address the use\n            of expert advisers, which should be designed to ensure they\n            transfer their management and technical skills to local\n            staff, and, staff continuity is an important factor in\n            fostering greater cooperation. In terms of future strategy,\n            the two main challenges facing Cambodia's power sector\n            are to broaden access for the poor - in a manner that is\n            fully integrated with overall power sector reforms - as the\n            country moves toward private power provision and the\n            commercialization of the power sector."}, "docdt": "2005-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
