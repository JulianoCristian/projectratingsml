Specific project components are\n            designed to: (i) strengthen economic policy making and\n            management; (ii) increase tax revenues through the expansion\n            of the on-going work in tax administration; (iii) assist\n            Government in designing a coherent and well phased strategy\n            for regional planning and management; (iv) raise public\n            sector productivity by supporting the public sector\n            management strengthening program (PSM) in its efforts to\n            rationalize salaries and attract and retain skilled\n            manpower; and (v) implement a living standards measurement\n            study and support the expanded responsibilities of the\n            country's national statistics institute (INE)."}, "docdt": "1988-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
