PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1516-JM)
JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY LIMITED (JPS)
Preface
1.       This is the Project Complt,tion Report (PCR) for a transmission-
distribution project in Jamaica, the second power project, which the Bank
helped to finance with Loan 1516-JM (US$20.0 million). The borrower and
beneficiary was the national power company, the Jamaica Public Service
Company Ltd. (JPS)e The guarantor was the Government.
2.       JPS completed the project, albeit with changes, cost inereases,
and a time overrun. During the period of project execution (1978-1983),
due to declining generating efficiency, stagnation in the electricity
market, and rising fuel prices, the financial and technical performance of
JPS did not reach the level expected at appraisal. There has been
improvement in both areas under the third power project (2188-JM).
3.       Approval of the loan agreement occurred on February 7, 1978;
signing, on March 6, 1978; and effectiveness, on June 1, 1978. The final
closing date was December 31, 1983 (as compared with the original closing
date of September 30, 1982).
4.       The Energy Division of the Latin America and Caribbean Regional
Office prepared this report based on information in Bank files and a final
project report prepared by JPS. The report also reflects information
gathered as a result of discussions with Bank staff.
5.       In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however,
no comments were received.

generating plants) financed by OPEC loan 109P (US$3.3 million).
2/ Exchange adjustment favorable to JPS s US$2.2 million.
3/ The lower return reflects stagnation of demand for electric ?ower due
to poor performance of economy, high operating costs, and inadequate
tariff levels.

SECOND POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1516-:PJ
JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY LIMITED (JP8)
Highlights
Under adverse macroeconomic circumstances, JPS successfully
completed the project, albeit with changes, cost increases, and time
overruns (paras. 3.2.2.-3.2.4). During project lImplementation, JPS
endured technical and financial problems beyond the control of
management (para. 5.2). Bank staff recognised the 1imitations under
which the Government and JPS were operating; and supported them in
their efforts to improve efficiency rather than to Insist on further
tariff Increases (para. 5.2.8).  This support showed flexibility
appropriate to the difficult economic circumstances In Jamaica.



JAMAICA
JAMAICA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY, LTD.(JPS)
SECOND POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1516-JM)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.1   Bank Participation in Sector Financina
1.1.1    Since 1966, the Bank has made three loans benefitting the Jamaica
Public Service Company, Ltd. (JPS) (Annex 1.1). The first loan, 454-JM
(US$22 million; 1966), helped to finance the foreign cost of the first
power project, which consisted of 121 MW of additional generating capacity
and the expansion and improvement of the transmission and distribution
systems. JPS completed the first power project in 1972, substantially
within the original schedule. The forecast and final costs of the project
were close: US$41.1 million and US$44.3 million.
1.1.2    The second loan, 1516-JM (US$20 million; 1978), helped to finance
the foreign cost of the second power project, a transmission-distributton
project (plus various studies and consulting services) which is the subject
of this report. JPS completed the project in February 1984, almost two
years late.
1.1.3    The third loan, 2188-JM (US$30.5 million; 1982), is helping to
finance the foreign cost of the third power project -- rehabilitating the
steani power plants, expanding the transmission and distribution systems,
and providing technical assistance and training. JPS has contpleted most of
the plant rehabilitation and expects to finish the project in 1986, about a
year late, with a cost underrun due to devaluation (US$43.2 million vs.
US$48.6 million).
1.1.4    The Bank is now processing a fourth loan to JPS, about US$17.0
million, which would finarnce most of the foreign cost (US$22.8 million) of
a transmission/distribution project (expected total cost: US$27.2 million).
1.2 Energy Sector Organization
1.2.1    The Government of ~;amaica (GOJ) coordinates and establishes policy
and plans for the energy sector through the Energy Division (ED) of the
Ministry of Mines, Energy, and Tourism (HMET). GOJ establishes electricity
tariffs and carries out financial supervision of JPS through the Ministry
of Public Utilities and Transport (MPUT). The Electricity Authority (EA)
holds the shares in JPS on b..-alf of GOJ, but exercises no other functions.
Though there is the opportunity for conflict between these bodies,
coordination has been satisfactory, in general.



- 2 -
1.2.2    In addition to the Ministries, major entities of tihe sector
include: (i) JPS, which has exclusive responsibility for the generation,
transmission, and distribution oZ electric energy for public consumption;
and (ii) Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ), which operates the
national refinery, markets petroleum products, and performs some planning
and developmerst functions (which now partly overlap with those of JPS).
This matter would be addressed under the proposed fourth power loan. The
Public Utility Commission (PUC) transferred its regulatory functions to
MPUT in 1975.
1.2.3    In 1971, GOJ, through EA, acquired controlling interest in JPS
from foreign private Investors; and now owns 992 of issued ordinary
capital. GOJ appoints all members of the JPS Board. Under the terms of the
JPS license, MPUT has the power and authority to require observance and
performance by JPS of its obligations under the license and to fix tariffs.
1.3 JPS Oraanization
1.3.1    The present JPS organization is adequate, taking into account its
size and objectives. The JPS Board sets policy, which is executed by
management headed by the chairman (who acts as Chief Executive), a Managing
Director, and seven directors (human resources, finance, controller,
administration, customer relations & billing, production and technical
services, and engin6eering).
1.3.2    The gener4al accounting system lhas worked well since its
introduction in 1981; and JPS is carrying out improvements, such as more
closely integrating the general ledger system with connected systems,
especially construct-ion work-in-progress, and reducing tardiness in the
production of revenue and budgetary control reports. This latter
improvement is part of a corporate information system. In connection with
the pieoposed fourth power loan, the Bank is seeking a comm.tment from JPS
to improve its internal audit group. Computerized billing has substantially
reduced overdue accounts receivable since 1982.
1.3.3    Since 1982, with Bank prompting, the management and the Government
have taken steps to improve the financial condition and technical
efficiency of JPS. These steps are discussed in detail in Chapters 3
and 5.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1      Origin of the Proiect
2.1.1    Between completion of the first power project (1972) and initial
appraisal of the second power project (1976), Jamaica experienced worsening
balance-of-payments problems due to structural imbalances within the
economy, deteriorating terms-of-trade, and massive capital outflows. The
national economic problems, together with institutional deficiencies at JPS
(financial, operational, and management), formed the background for
identification, preparation, anc appraisal of the second power project.
2.1.2    Between 1972 and 1975 discussion between GOJ, JPS, and the Bank
with respect to a possible second power project remained inconclusive due
to a lack of decision on the part of Jamaican authorities. During this
period, the financial performance of JPS was unsatisfactory because the PUC
failed to grant adequate tariff increases to offset rapid domestic and
worldwide inflation. Between 1973 and 1975 the rate of return on JPS9
revalued assets was between 2.7X and 5.5Z.
2.1.3    Managerial performance also deteriorated followi$g GOJ purchase of
JPS (1971) and the departure of senior and middle-level expatriate staff.
Prior to 1975, JPS lacked the benefit of a single chief executive to direct
day-to-day affairs, as the Government claimed it could not identify a
suitable person for this position. In October 1975, the Government, after
consultation with the Bank, appointed a full-time Executive Chsairman, who
replaced a committee which had been directing company affairs.  The
committee had consisted of the chairman of the board of directors and three
department directors (operations, finance, and commercial activities). Bank
staff felt that the new appointee was competent, as were the directors of
finan'ce and operations.
2.1.4    Technical operations also suffered from numerous outages due to
poor operating and maintenance practices. To reduce load shedding, JPS
invested In new generating units. This led to excess capacity but did not
result in a satisfactory reduction in outages, as intended due to less-
than-optimum specifications for these units.
2.2      Pro1ect Identification and Preparation
2.2.1    In April 1975, a JPS mission initiated discussions for possible
Bank finaceing of a transmission and distribution project which would be
part of the expansion program for 1976-1982. As the proposed loan offered
the opportunity for significant institution building at both the sector and
company level, Bank staff indicated interest in helping to finance the
proposed project, provided that JPS could provide technical and economic
justifications plus a satisfactory financing plan. After reviewing the
preliminary investment program, which showed that additional generating
facilities would consume more than half of expected expenditures, Bank
staff xpressed reservations about the need for more generating capacity.
Bank staff pointed out that there was excess capacity (para. 2.1.4) which
had become unreliable due to poor maintenance practices. It was agreed that
a Baok mission would visit Jamaica to review progress toward providing the
tecbhical and economic justification of the proposed project.



-4-
2.2.2    An identification mission (May 1975) reported that the proposed
Bank loan could help to stimulate improvements in the following areas:
(a) for the sector: reducing the number of bodies with decision making
power affacting the energy sector (paras. 1.2.1-3) and planning and pricing
for all forms of energy; and (b) for JPS: management, finances, generation
planning, maintenance practices, and tariff structure. By letter (June 23,
1975), the Bank urged JPS to defer investment in new generating facilities,
improve generation-maintenanc.- and loss-reduction practices, asse'ss the
potential for developing local hydro resources for power generation, and
prepare additional information for the appraisal of the proposed project.
2.2.3    In February 1976, JPS and Bank staff held discussions on the
investment program which continued to reflect substantial expenditures on
additional generating plant. Bank staff questioned the basis for JPS' load
growth projections and requested JPS to revise its economic comparisons
between alternative generation expansion plans taking into account the
expected impact of improved maintenance practices on existing plant.
2.2.4    In May 1976, a preparation mission reviewed again the power market
forecast and corresponding expansion program; developed an estimate of the
costs of power outages to consumers, identified a tnumber of financial
issues, and established the remaining information requirements for
appraisal. The financial issues included future tariff increases, asset
revaluation, equity cor.tributions, and taxes.
2.2.5    In connection with this proposed loan, the mission identified the
major role for the Bank as: (1) helping JPS to become an efficient public
utility through an institution building program; (2) focusing the attention
of Jamaican authorities on developing a rational investment program (i.e.,
a proRer balance between transmission-distribution facilities, generating
plant, and maintenance practices); and (3) optimizing energy utilization
through the study of tariff structures. The mission also identified the
major objectives of the project as: (a) improving the reliability of supply
in several parts of the country by adding the required tie-lines between
the generating plants and by providing alternative transmission routes to
several important load centers; (b) extending electric service to several
low-income neighborhoods; (c) providing adequate capacity to lines and
substations which fed the rural network; and (d) assessing the feasibility
of hydroelectric development.
2.3      Project Appraisal, Definition, and Justification
2.3.1    On August 5, 1976, JPS formally requested Bank financing; and tlc
Bank dispatched an appraisal mission to Jamaica (November 8-20, 1976). The
mission found the proposed program to be the minimum required to provide an
adequate and reliable supply of electric power.
2.3.2    Bank and JPS staff agreed on an expansion program for the period
1978-1982 with an expected cost of US$167.4 million and an expected foreign
cost of about US$96.6 million. The program would consist of: (i) the start
of a 70 MW oil-fired steam unit at Hunt's Bay to be commissioned by 1984
and a similar unit at Old Harbour to be commissioned by 1986; (ii) trans-
mission lines (113 miles of 138 kV lines and 63 miles of 69 kV lines),
transformation capacity (about 290 MVA), miscellaneous distribution



- 5 -
investments (2100 circuit-miles of lines below 69 kV, 227 MVA of
distribution transformers, 140 MVAR of capacitors, and 70,000 meters);
(iii) general property; and (iv) technical assistance. Because of
continuing doubts about the need for new generating plants, Bank staff
informed JPS that they would seek during negotiations the agreement of JPS
to a clause requiring Bank review of the construction schedule for the
proposed 70 MW of oil-fired steam units.
2.3.3    Bank and JPS staff agreed on a project consisting of transmission
lines (83 miles at 138 kV and 58 miles at 69 kY), transformation capacity
(about 200 MVA), miscellaneous distribution investments (45 MVA of
distribution transformers, 300 circuit miles of 24 and 12 kV lines, 20,000
meters, and 140 MVAR of capacitors), and technical assistance. The
technical assistance would consist of consultant services for:
(i) improving operating and maintenance procedures in generation,
transmission, and distribution; (ii) designing, procuring, and supervising
the construction of the 138 kV lines and substat,ions and; (iii) tariff
structure study using marginal cost criteria. The project was expected to
cost US$36.1 million with a foreign cost of US$20.0 million, which the Bank
loan would cover. JPS expected to complete implementation of the proposed
project by March 31, 1982.
2.3.4    Bank staff were satisfied that the proposed investment program, of
which the project was a part, was the least-cost solution for meeting the
growth of demand in Jamaica for the period 1978-1982. For most of the
equipment and lines included in the program, there was no reasonable
alternative. The return on the investment program was estimated at 16%.
2.3.5    In addition to the cost, definition, rationale, sources of
financing for Lhe proposed expansion program and the financial issues
listed above (para. 2.2.4), the Bank appraisal mission focused on proposals
for lowering accounts receivable and losses and itsing consultants for
technical assistance. Bank staff also focused on increasing the size of the
proposed loan from US$12 million to US$20 million. Bank staff justified the
larger loan on the grounds that: (1) the program was minimal and could not
be reduced; (2) financ1ng from other sources was not available on
reasonable terms; (3) it would be unreasonable to expect a higher
contribution from JPS customers than that which was already anticipated;
and (4) a latger loan would support the stabilization program of the
Government.
2.3.6    It was expected that procurement would follow Bank Guidelines,
except for about US$75,000 for specialized substation equipment which would
be purchased directly from suppliers. Local suppliers would receive a
margin of preference of 15%.
2.3.7    Bank staff accorded special importance to non-Bank borrowing for
the program. The Bank conditioned negotiations for the proposed Bank loan
to the presentation of evidence confirming the securing of a non-Bank loan
amounting to US$25.0 million.



-6
2.3.8    Subsequently, due to the balance-of-payments crisis in 1977 (para.
2.1.1), the Bank moved slowly in processing the proposed loan, as there
were lengthy negotiations in connection with a Stand-by Credit uad a
program loan (1500-JM) provided by the International Monetary Fund and the
Bank, respectively. In early 1977 the management problem re- emerged with
the failure of JPS to find a suitable replacement for the competent chief
financial officer who departed. In August 1977, the Bank dispatched a
second mission to update the expected cost, implementation schedule, and
financing plan for the proposed expansion program and project.
2.4      Negotigtions. uoan Approval, and Effectiveness
2.4.1    No major problems delayed negotiations (December 5-7, 1977).
Board presentation occurred on January 7, 1978 followed by loan signing on
March 6, 1978. Loan 1516-JM amounted to tUS$20.0 million; the term was
seventeen years, including four years of grace. The interest rate was
7.45%; the commitment fee, 3/4% of 1%.  The Bank declared the Loan
Agreement to be effective on June 1, 1978.
2.5      Major Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
2.5.1    Annex 2.1 sets forth the major covenants of the loan and guarantee
agreements for the second power project. GOJ and JiS did not comply with
their respective revenue covenants during the period of project execution,
1978-1983. Chapter 5 sets forth details on the tariff policy of GOJ and
the finances of JPS.



III. PROJECT COST AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.1      Actual and Forecast Data
3.1.1    Annex 3.1 compares the actual and forecast costs of the project,
stated in both current and constant prices. Annex 3.2 compares the works
completed under the project, including additions and deletions, with those
expected at appraisal, together with their corresponding completion dates.
Annex 3.3 sets farth actual and forecast data on the training component.
Annexes 3.4 and 3.5 compare actual and forecast data on, respectively,
allocation of the proceeds of the loan and cumulative disbursements. Annex
3.6 sets forth the price deflators used to restate current prices to
constant prices as of 1977. The following paragraphs discuss the
information set forth in the annexes.
3.2      Proiect Cost. Changes, and Timetable
3.2.1    Actual and forecast costs are not comparab'e, as the completed
project has substantially been changed (with Bank agreement) from what had
been expected at appraisal. In current prices, the cost of the project
amounted to US$42.0 million or 16.4% more than the forecast cost of US36.1
million. The largest cost increase was in local costs, which amounted to
US$22.7 million as compared with the expected cost of US$16.1 million.
According to JPS, quantities of materials and local-currency costs for
transmission lines and substations were underestimated at appraisal, as was
the cost for consultant services. Difficulties with one paxticular
contractor contributed to time and cost increases.
3.2.2    In constant L  ces as of 1977, the cost of the Project amounted to
US$30.9 million or 16.9% more than the forecast cost, US$26.5 million.
Actual and forecast local-currency costs were, respectively, US$16.1
million and US$10.6 million (Annex 3.1).
3.2.3    The Bank agreed to numerous changes to the project (Annex 3.2).
Some of the changes required no amendment to the project definition in the
loan agreement, as they represented no departure from the basic concept of
the project. Such changes included: (i) elimination of 35 miles of 69kV
transmission line (Greenwich Road-Cane River; Annotto Bay-Port Antonio) and
two corresponding substations (Cane River and Port Antonio; 6.25 MVA of
transformation capacity); and (ii) addition of 12.5 MVA of new
transformation capacity (at Kendal). Other changes required a redefinition
of the project, as they represented an expansion of the basic project
concept. These changes included: (iii) the purchase of communications
equipment for the transmission system; and (iv) the purchase of spare parts
for the generating plants. The purchase of spare parts was financed by
OPEC (loan 109P; 1978; US$3.3 million); but the cost of these parts was not
included in the original cost forecast and is not included the actual cost
data shown a'bove. The OPEC loan is discussed in Section 3.6 of this
chapter.



- 8 -
3.2.4    The forecact completion date for the 138kV transmission lines and
substations was March 31, 1982. The forecast completion dates for the 69kV
substations and transmission lines were between December 1979 and December
1981. The actutl completion date for the works at 138kV was July 1982 for
the transmission lines and between March 1983 and January 1984 for the
substations (22 months late). The 69kV transmission line (Annotto Bay-
Oracabessa) was completed in July 1982 (22 months late) and the 69kV
substations were completed at various dates between June and December 1983
(24 months late) (Annex 3.2). If the current disbursement profiles for
transmission-distribution projects (6 years) in the Latin American and
Caribbean region had been used at appraisal to estimate the completion date
for the project, actual and forecast completion dates would have been
close.
3.2.5    The performance of the JPS Engineering Department reflected
substantial weakness in virtually all phases of procurement. This weakness
was compounded by poor performance on the part of one local contractor in
charge of the construction of civil works at the 138 kV substations. This
contractor experienced work stoppages and cash-flow problems as a result of
too many commitments. After a lengthy period of arbitration, JPS dismissed
the contractor.
3.3      Performance of Contractors and Consultants
3.3.1    In the opinion of JPS, except for the civil works contractor for
the 138kV substations, performance on the part of local contractors was
satisfactory, although they were not always able to meet agreed completion
dates due to late delivery on the part of suppliers. According to JPS,
late delivery reflected the difficulties in establishing letters of credit;
and these difficulties reflected the economic problems of Jamaica. Bank
supervision reports reflected no general criticism of the performance of
local contractors.
3.3.2    In the opinion of JPS, consultants provided satisfactory services
in the areas of: (i) design of lines and substations at 138 kV, preparation
of related bidding documents, and supervision of construction; (ii)
improvement in distribution practices; and (iii) improvement in generation
practices. With respect to distribution practices, the consultants
concluded that JPS technical competence was good but that there was a major
need to improve management effectiveness. With respect to generation
practices, consultants established improved operational procedures,
identified materials required for rehabilitation, and established targets
for power plant availability and thermal efficiency. Services of these
consultants were continued under the third power project (loan 2188-JM).
3.3.3    The Bank agreed to JPS' request to transfer funding for the study
of tariff structures to US AID. The resulting study did not reflect the
draft terms of reference supplied by the Bank which provided for a
restructuring of tariffs based on the marginal cost criteria. A study
based on the marginal cost of the supply of electricity is expected to be
part of the proposed fourth power project.



-9-
3.4      Training
3.4.1    The staff appraisal report (SAR) stated that the Bank loan would
include US$480,000 to cover the JPS foreign- currency costs for training
during the period from 1978 to 1982. In the loan agreement, the amount
allocated for training was US$600,000. The actual amount disbursed under
this category was US$296,636; but according to JPS, this figure understated
the amount spent for training because it did not reflect the cost of
consultancy services for improvement of generation and distribution
practices (para. 3.3.2). In the course of rendering service, consultants
imparted considerable training to JPS staff.
3.4.2    In December 1978, a Bank supervision mission helped JPS establish
a satisfactory training program for the years 1979-1983. By comparing the
forecast training program with actual results, Annex 3.3 shows that the
training finarced with the proceeds of loan 1516-JM roughly (but not
completely) corresponded with what had been agreedj. JPS reported on the
implementation of this component of the project in its project progress
reports which Bank staff reviewed. Bank files do not reflect whether field
supervision of the training component was carried out after December 1978.
3.4.3    JPS explained that its lower-than-expected expenditure on training
reflected deferral to the third power project of subject matter agreed on
under the second power project. Bank staff determined that beneficiaries of
training have remained with JPS for the most part.
3.5      Cumulative Disbursement and Allocation of Loan Proceeds
3.5.1    Annex 3.4 compares actual and forecast data on cumulative
disbursements. Because of delays in project execution (para. 3.2.4; Annex
3.2), the last disbursement lagged expectations by about 24 months. The
Bank agreed to change the closing date of the loan from September 30, 1982
to July 31, 1983, and then from July 31, 1983 to December 31, 1983.
3.5.2    Annex 3.5 compares actual, revised, and forecast allocation of the
proceeds of the loan. The actual allocation of proceeds of the loan
reflects the elimination of two of the transmission lines, the increase in
transformation capacity, the addition of communcations equipment, and
actual expenditures on consultancy services and training (paras. 3.2.1-.3;
3.4.1). Actual and revised allocation of loan proceeds were close for all
categories, except for consultant services and training.
3.6      OPEC Loan
3.6.1    As part of a larger effort to assist GOJ, the OPEC Special Fund
provided GOJ with a loan amounting to US$3.3 million for relending to JPS.
The loan agreement was signed on December 19, 1978 and provided for the
purchase of spare parts for existing generating stations. The equipment to
be purchased included such items as a rotary air heater, unit transformer
radiators, spare instrument and service air compressors, and vibration
analysis equipment.
3.6.2    The Bank expanded the definition of the project set forth in the



- 10 -
second power project loan agreement to include the spare parts to be
purchased with the OPEC loan; administered procurement and disbursements in
connection with the OPEC loan, as agreed with OPEC; and communicated
considerable disbursement information to OPEC. Bank staff also carried out
field supervision of the OPEC-financed portion of the project but Bank
files do not reflect the transmission to OPEC of the findings of Bank
supervision missions, as the Bank had agreed to transmit.
3.6.3    The original closing date for the OPEC loan was December 31, 1982.
At the request of JPS, OPEC extended the closings date of its loan to
September 30, 1983.
3.7      JPS Management Evolution, 1978-1983
3.7.1    Due to the gloomy prospects for the economy, there was a departure
of the competent group of managers who were operating JPS at appraisal
(1977) of the project. Lack of sufficient number of qualified top and
mid-level managers contributed to: (1) poor operational and maintenance
practices at power plants, which resulted in frequent power outages; and
(2) delayed preparation of important financial, accounting, and managerial
data. For example, preliminary financial statements for 1981 were not
available before March 15, 1982.
3.7.2    To remedy the lack of adequate numbers of qualified mid-level
staff, the JPS Board formed in October 1981 three subcommittees to review
technical and financial planning and purchasing decisions; and in December
1981, after the resignation of the Managing Director, the board chairman
took over the position of chief executive. Under his leadership and in
connection with the third power projecl (loan 2188-JM), JPS began
rebuilding by hiring a competent general manager, a controller, and a
budget specialist. Low salary levels are a problem and may hamper the
continuation of the efficiency improvement program. Salary levels will be a
subject addressed in connection with negotiations for the proposed fourth
power loan agreement.

IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1      Actual and Forecast Data
4.1.1    Annex 4.1 compares actual, forecast and revised sales data for the
years 1977-1989, plus corresponding growth rates of sales. Annex 4.2 shows
the actual internal rate of return on the investment program for the period
1978-1983.
4.2      Least-Cost Solution and Expected Sales Growth
4.2.1    At appraisal, the investment program for the period 1978-1982 was
judged to be the least-cost solution for meeting the expected growth in
electricity demand as there was no reasonable alternative to the program,
especially with respect to most transmission-distribution equipment and
routes. Where there were alternatives, JPS would seek the services of a
consultant to determine which route was least cost. Reflecting the
expectation of growth for the economy, sales were anticipated to grow from
1134 GWh in 1977 to 1573 GWh in 1982 (7% annually) with subsequent growth
to 2698 GWh by 1989 (8% annually).
4.2.2    The actual performances of the economy and the electric sector
were well below expectations. Measured in constant 1974 prices, gross
domestic product declined slightly between 1977 and 1983 -- J$1976.4
million in 1977 vs. J$1931.4 million in 1983 -- and actual sales levels,
reflecting the adverse trends in the economy, were well below the level
expected at appraisal (Annex 4.1). Actual sales for 1977-1983 were 21.0%
less than the level expected at appraisal; and the annual rate of growth
for the revised forecast of sales is about 2% annually from 1985 to 1989
rather than 8%, as expected at appraisal. In these circumstances, JPS
deferred expansion of its generating capacity during the period 1978-1982,
although it did undertake a program of repair and rehabilitation of
existing plant.
4.2.3    The significant departure of actual sales levels from forecast
sales levels underlies the importarnce of critical examination of the latter
on the part of Bank staff during project preparation and appraisal.
However, it is doubtful that the duration and full extent of the problems
of the Jamaican economy were discernable during preparation and appraisal.
4.2.4    Given that there were no reasonable alternatives to most of the
equipment and routes for the transmission-distribution program (and where
there were alternatives, the least-cost were executed, including the
transmission lines of the project), the program as executed was the least-
cost solution to meeting electricity demand.
4.3      Rate of Return
4.3.1    At appraisal, benefits associated with the project were measured
by the forecast of marginal revenues; and these were discounted and
compared with the project investment costs and associated marginal
operating expenses. The equalizing discount rate was about 16%.



- 12 -
4.3.2    The actual and revised patterns of sales differ substantially from
what was expected at appraisal. Under the revised sales forecast, sales
levels in 1989 are expected to amount to 1,310 GWh, which level is just
slightly below the level (1349 GWh) expected for 1980 at appraisal of the
second power project in November 1976 and August 1977.
4.3.3    In these changed circumstances, it is reasonable to assign to the
project benefits equivalent to those sales which JPS would have lost if JPS
were to have undertaken no investment, including the replacement of
existing equipment. For the purpose of this calculation, it is assumed
that such sales amount to about 4% compounded annually for the years 1978-
1982, with sales in 1978 as the base year. This percentage corresponds to
the JPS weighted average depreciation rate. With such sales as a proxy for
benefits and based on actual investment and operating costs, the return on
the program is about 10% (Annex 4.2). This is a conservative estimate as
it reflects no estimate of savings to consumers from investment deferred in
"stand-by" facilities and no estimate of reduced fuel costs. l/
1/
Based on current expectations concerning future fuel costs, the return
on the program would be about 11%.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      Actual and Forecast Financial Data, 1977-1983
5.1.1    Annex 5.1 sets forth actual and forecast key financial ratios of
JPS for the years 1977-1983. Annexes 5.2 to 5.4 compare actual and
forecast income statements, sources and applications of funds, and balance
sheets for the same period. During the period 1977-1983, the actual
financial performance of JPS was well below that expected at appraisal due
to a combination of stagnant sales, rising fuel costs, ani decreasing
generating efficiency. The following paragraphs discuss the information
set forth in the financial annexes.
5.2      Actual and Forecast Operating Results, 1977-1983
5.2.1    In 1977, actual and forecast key indicators of financial
performance were close, but thereafter financial results increasingly
departed from appraisal expectations. While the debt-equity ratio improved
from 45% to 34% due to asset revaluation, other key measures of financial
performance exhibited deterioration (Annex 5.1). The rate of return
declined from about 5% in 1977 to a negative 3% in 1982, and then improved
to 6% again in 1983 as a result of tariff increases implemented in
connection with the third power project (2188-JM). Also showing the same
pattern of deterioration followed by improvement were the debt-service
coverage ratio, the self-financing ratio, and the operating ratio.
5.2.3    Due to the poor performance of the Jamaican economy during this
period, electricity sales were stagnant while fuel costs rose faster than
tariff increases and the generating efficiency (as measured by the heat
rate, BTU/kWh) of JPS deteriorated.  Sales between 1977 and 1983 (7586 GWh)
were 21% less than expected, but average tariffs were 70% higher than
expected, resulting in a 34% increase in revenues. Fuel costs on the other
hand were 124% greater than expected (Table 5.1). As a result, JPS' net
operating income for 1977-83 was 91% less than expected at appraisal.
Chapter 6 sets forth details on the decreasing generating efficiency of JPS
during the period of project execution.
5.2.4    JPS suffered power outages due to poor operating and maintenance
practices (para. 2.1.4) and a lack of foreign exchange for the purchase of
spare parts to repair its generators. Public reaction to the power outages
was adverse. In these circumstances, the Government was reluctant to amend
the arrangement for raising tariffs, which consisted of a fuel adjustment
clause and a 1% monthly increase of the basic tariff. Nevertheless,
tariffs in real terms were increased substantially (43%) between 1977 and
1983: from 8.76 J cents to 12.49 J cents (in constant 1977 prices). Fuel
costs increased from 3.16 J cents/kWh to 5.26 J cents/kWh, an increase of
67%. Operating and maintainance costs increased from 2.65 J cents/kWh to
3.09 J cents, in constant 1977 prices, to 3.09J cents, an increase of
only 17%.



- 14 -
5.2.5    The operation of the fuel-adjustment clause limited tariff
increases to less than the fuel-cost increases that occurred.   Recovery of
fuel costs depended on meeting target rates for fuel efficiency (13,500
BTU/kWh) and distribution efficiency (15% of net generation). JPS was not
able to meet the above targets. As the foreign exchange problems of
Jamaica made it difficult for JPS management to obtain spare parts
necessary to improve the efficiency of generating plant, the Bank, in
connection with the third power project, persuaded the Government and JPS
to change the thermal efficiency standard to 14,500 BTUIkWh until 1986.
Because of improvements in thermal efficiency carried out under the second
and the third power projects (2188-JM), JPS earned a return of about 6% in
1983.
5.2.6    In the circumstances of severe financial constraints and stagnant
sales, JPS, during the period 1977-83, experienced negative net internal
cash generation (J$2.5 million) and reduced its construction expenditures
to J$259.9 million as compared with the forecast level, J$315.3 million. At
appraisal, internal cae;h generation was expected to amount to J$124.9
million, or 35% of total requirements. Actual investment requirements
amounted to J$264.9 million (24.8% less than expected) plus J$2.5 million
in negative net internal cash generation which JPS funded with borrowings
(J$210.0 million) and equity contributions (J$57.4 million). Actual and
forecast results are shown in the table at the end of the chapter.
5.2.7    Complicating the financial problems of JPS was an increase in
electricity theft as measured by the large increase in losses. JPS has
sought legislation to reduce the standards of proof required to obtain
convictions, but progress has been slow. As measured by days of accounts
receivable outstanding, there was some Improvement in collections (from 87
days in 1978 to 75 days in 1983) but not as good as forecast at appraisal
(from 70 days in 1978 to 65 days).
5.2.8    Bank staff carried out extensive financial supervision of JPS and
visited Jamaica about every six months during project implementation. On
the basis of these visits, the Bank recommended that the Government:
(i) increase the basic monthly tariff increase from one percent per month
compounded to 2 percent per month compounded; (ii) adjust the fuel
adjustment clause to permit JPS to recover fuel cost increases fully; and
(iii) develop and implement an action program to improve collections and
reduce theft. Further, the Bank deferred consideration of a third power
program for about a year in order to stimulate tariff adjustments. The
Government did not act on these recommendations because of political
constraints. Subsequently, the Bank focused on measures to reduce
operating costs (para. 5.3.2) with more satisfactory results. It seems
unlikely that additional financial supervision would have led to an
improvement in the financial position of JPS.
5.3      Compliance with Financial Covenants, 1977-1983
5.3.1    The loan agreement set forth an audit covenant and major financial
covenants (Annex 2.1) -- namely that, JPS should: (i) furnish the Bank
with an audited financial statement by April following the end of the
preceeding year (Section 5.02); (ii) take all necessary measures to provide
revenues sufficient to earn 8% p.a. for the years 1978-1980 and 8.5%
annually thereafter (Section 5.04); (iii) revalue assets annually (Section



- 15 -
5.05); (iv) seek prior Bank agreement before incurring long term debt if
gross internal cash generation were to fail to exceed debt service for any
succeeding fLscal year by not less than 1.5 times (5.06); (v) limit short-
term borrowing to no more than one-sixth of cash operating expenlses
(Section 5.07); (vi) undertake no major works (defined as two percent of
revalued gross fixed assets) not included in the agreed expansion program
wi hout first providing the Bank with a satisfactory technical and economic
justification and a corresponding financing plan (Section 5.08); and
(vii) complete a study on the feasibility of monthly billings and discuss
the results of the study with the Bank (Section 5.09). The guarantee
agreement contained a covenant (Section 2.01) corresponding to the revenue
covenant in the loan agreement.
5.3.2    JPS and the Government complied with all of the above covenants,
except the revenue covenant. Given the high level of tariffs in Jamaica
(15.16 US cents/kWh in 1982) and the poor quality of service, the Bank
decided not to take a rigid stance on the revenue covenant but, rather, to
seek improvements in JPS' efficiency leading to a reduction in operating
costs. This course of action was at the core of the third power project,
which sought to improve fuel efficiency, through improved generating and
maintenance practices and the purchase of spare parts. The results of these
efforts were successful; and in 1984 JPS' rate of return was 6.4%.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1      The Borrower
6.1.1    Annex 6.1 compares actual and forecast indicators of market
penetration and technical efficiency for the years 1978 to 1983. The actual
indicators show a level of performance well below that expected at
appraisal.
6.1.2    Actual sales levels, numbers of customers, and percentages of
households served were all well below forecast levels primarily because the
demand for electricity reflected the adverse developments in the economy
(para. 4.2.2). Actual numbers of employees and related ratios
(customer/employee and GWh sold/employee), and the power factor ratio were
also well below expected levels. Concerning numbers of employees, JPS
management was confronted with powerful unions which enjoyed strong links
to the dominant political parties.
6.1.3    Losses increased from 13% in 1976 to 20% in 1981 and slowly
declined thereafter to 18% in 1984. JPS management believed that the
increase in losses reflected a major increase in theft -- a reflection of
the difficult times experienced by the average Jamaican consumer and the
high standards of proof required under Jamaican law to convict those
charged with electricity theft.
6.1.4    The heat rate (BTU/kWh) rose from 13,134 BTU/kWh in 1978 to 15,267
BTU's/kWh in 1982 and declined thereafter to 12,950 BTU/kWh in 1985. This
pattern of deterioration followed by improvement showed the cumulative
impact of improving maintenance practices, consultant services and the
purchase of spare parts carried out in connection with the second and third
power projects.
6.1.5    Annex 5.1 compares actual and forecast indicators of financial
performance. These show the same pattern of deterioration followed by
improvement exhibited by the indicators of technical efficiency. Stagnant
electricity sales, rising fuel costs not fully covered by the operation of
the fuel adjustment clause, and adverse currency developments characterized
the financial environment during most of the period of project
implementation.
6.1.6    In the gontext of the difficult economic and political situation
of Jamaica, most of the above technical and financial problems did not lend
themselves to speedy correction on the part of JPS management. There were,
however, some improvements in the areas of accouniting, budgeting, billing
for industrial and commercial customers, and collections; and in 1984, JPS
exhibited an improved technical and financial performance as compared with
its performance in 1980. Bank staff found the performance of the
Engineering Department of JPS to be weak (para. 3.2.5).



- 17 -
6.2      The Goverrment
6.2.1    The Government did not approve the tariff increases that would
have been required to achieve the agreed rate of return during project
implementation. This reflected the sensitivity of the Government to
adverse public reaction to higher tariffs unaccompanied by improved
service. However, the Government did increase its equity contributions
beyond the level originally envisioned and supported a higher level of
borrowings to enable JPS to carry out its programs.
6.3      The Bank
6.3.2    Notwithstanding acceptance of an optimistic sales forecast, the
performance of Bank staff during appraisal was satisfactory. The
performance of Bank staff during execution of the project was also
satisfactory. The Bank showed a realistic and pragmatic approach when
faced with a deterioration of JPS' finances and instead of taking an
intransigeant position regarding tariffs supported the Government in its
well founded concern about JPS inefficiency. Eventually, the performance
of JPS under the third power project (2188-JM) improved; and the Bank
satisfactorily supported Jamaican authorities in their efforts to effect
this improvement.

VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1      A Successful Prolect
7.1.1    The improvement in the technical and financial performance of JPS
after 1983 (paras. 6.1.2-.5) indicates that the major objectives identified
at appraisal (para. 2.2.5) were achieved, with the exception of optimized
energy usage through a power tariff structure reflecting the marginal cost
of supply (para. 3.3.2).
7.2      Communications with Co-lenders
7.2.1    It appears that Bank staff did not communicate the findings of
their supervision missions to OVEC (para. 3.4.2). Apparently this failure
did not complicate relations wi-h OPEC or adversely affect financing for
other projects. However, in view of the Bank's concern to promote
cofinancing, Bank staff should assign greater weight to the Bank's
commitments with cofinancAng and should ensure that their supervision
findings are transmitted to co-lenders so that co-lenders can rely on the
Bank to monitor compliance with all the terms of their agreements.
7.3      The Importance of Flexibility
7.3.1   During project implementation, JPS endured technical and financial
problems beyond the control of management (para. 6.1.6). Bank staff
recognized the limitations under which the Government and JPS were
operating; and supported them in their efforts to improve efficiency rather
than to insist on further tariff increases. Bank staff should remember
that raising tariffs is not the only way to achieve a desired financial
target.
