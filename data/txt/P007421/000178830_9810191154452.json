The Bank loan\n            would finance the foreign exchange costs of that part of\n            JPSC's 1978-82 transmission distribution program that\n            has not been financed by other sources. The project would\n            also assist JPSC in improving its operating and maintenance\n            practices and its pricing policies through the use of\n            specialized consulting services and through training its\n            staff. In line with the Government's social objectives,\n            the JPSC program includes making public service electricity\n            available to low income and rural customers. Domestic\n            bidders would receive a 15% margin of preference in bidding\n            on project items.
