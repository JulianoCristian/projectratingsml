The project ratings are as follows : project\n            outcome is highly unsatisfactory; sustainability is highly\n            likely; institutional development impact is high; Bank and\n            Borrower performance is highly satisfactory. Lessons were\n            derived from the relevance that projects that replicate\n            successful models in a flexible manner can be highly\n            successful at relatively low risk; b) focus of project\n            design on development objectives facilitates\n            outcome-oriented project implementation; c) project\n            supervision strategy should be clear and transparent and\n            should promote a strong internal project supervision effort\n            by the Borrower; and d) building a strong Bank-Borrower\n            partnership needs consistency in task management and in the\n            composition of the task team."}, "docdt": "2005-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
