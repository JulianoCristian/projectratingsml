Rehabilitation Project is to\n            contribute to a sustainable development in the Loess\n            Plateau, increasing agricultural production and incomes, as\n            well as improving the ecological conditions in tributary\n            watersheds of the Yellow River. This is in line with the\n            objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which\n            support the assistance for better utilization of marginal\n            land through sustainable techniques, and, develop\n            income-generation programs in poorer provinces. The main\n            components call for, cropland improvement, which includes\n            the conversion of slope-lands to terraced lands, where soil\n            erosion is controlled and water retained, thus producing\n            higher crop yields. Control dams will be constructed to\n            retain sediments and flooding, and store water for\n            irrigation and water supply. Irrigation will consist of\n            small water cisterns which will catch run-offs from roads or\n            small water surface diversions, as well as small-scale\n            irrigation schemes, mostly in Inner Mongolia. The second\n            component, slope-land protection, will increase the\n            vegetation cover, improving the erosion control capacity in\n            project watersheds, which will be enhanced by planting and\n            protecting trees, shrubs, and grass. Besides various species\n            of trees to be planted on narrow terraces, fruit and\n            nut-bearing trees will also be planted, thus marketing will\n            be improved through investments in horticulture."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
