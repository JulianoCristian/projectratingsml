APPRAISAL OF THE SNMC EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a proposed Bank loan of US$46,0 million to
help finance: (a) part of the ongoing expansion of the Societe Nationale des
Materiaux de Construction (SNMC), the Algerian state enterprise for construc-
tion materials, through erection of a new 500,000 ton per year cement plant
near Saida away trom the coast in the rural south; (b) the expansion of the
Company's distribution network; and (c) a technical assistance program to the
Societe Nationale de Comptabilite (SNC), the state accounting and auditing
company. If approved, the loan would be the Bank's first direct industrial
operation since lending was resumed in FY1973.
ii.       The prime purpose of the proposed Bank loan lies not so much in
ïts tinancial contribution of somewhat more than 20% of estimated project
costs as in its effort at institution building in Algeria's building material
sector. The project attempts to help SNMC cope with present and future or-
ganizational and financial problens created by an ambitious investment pro-
gram which, between 1974 and 1980, is expected to require fixed asset expendi-
tures in excess of US$2.0 billion and which aims at making Algeria indepen-
dent in cement and some other building materials by the end of this decade.
_76thls end, cerent production is expected to increase from about 1.5 xi31ion
tons in 1975 to about 8.0 mdllion tons by 1980.
iii.      SNMC was established in 1968 as a state enterprise to promote the
development of the Algerian construction materials industry and to manufac-
ture, import and distribute a wide range of building materials. The basis
for SNMC's operations were 51, formerly privately-owned, production units
and their distribution network which were nationalized between 1968 and
1972.  Since then the Company has expanded substantially and now includes
about 70 enterprises accounting for more than 65% of production in the
construction materials sector (with a monopoly in cement), the renainder
being produced by other state enterprises or by small factories owned by
regional authorities or private operators.
iv.       Industrial state enterprises, such as SNMC, operate under the close
supervision and guidance of the Government which, through the Ministry of
Industry and Energy, defines individual companies' corporate strategy, appoints
senior personnel, formulates investment programs in line with overall economic
objectives, determines the location and capacities of production units, sets
prices for industrial products and controls the financing of such enterprises
both through the allocation of funds from Government-owned banks and by the
collection of surplus funds for reinvestment in the economy. The firm central
control and the absence of a free market price mechanism for primary products
and staples has undoubtedly led to some misallocation of resources and certain
imbalances in industrial development in Algeria.



- ii -
v.        While SNMC is a very active company and vas able to double the value
of its sales between 1970 and 1974, losses have rapidly increased and reached
25% of net sales in 1974. This was largely due to prices not having been
adjusted adequately or frequently enough to reflect increasing operating costs
and higher import prices for the products SNMC is selling in Algeria, the lack
of an effective budgeting and cost control system, and the fact that all cash
shortfalls were financed by additional short-term debt thereby aggravating
the Company's financial strains even further. In addition, there vere a
number of non-recurring costs associated with the takeover of the previously
private companies and a greatly increased wage bill as all workers were put
on a permanent salaried basis. At present, therefore, SNMC is nôt a finan-
cially viable enterprise.
vi.       Discussions have been held with the Algerian Government to put
SNMC on a sounder financial basis, independent of continuous subsidies,
so that it is able to meet at least its cost and debt service obligations.
It has been agreed that, to achieve such an objective, (i) SNMC will plan and
implement a financial planning, cost control and budgeting system, (ii) prices
of all of SNMC's products will be reviewed annually and new prices will be
proposed at such levels as to cover at least average unit costs plus a margin to
cover debt incurred for that product group, and (iii) if necessary funds will
be made available to SNMC in such a way that the Company can cover its debt
service obligations at least 1.1 times and be able to pay whatever current
liabilities fall due.
vii.      Historicaliy, Algerian cement demand has not been met because
oa  lack of domestic production and insufficient cement imports.  More
recently, domestic production rose by 60% between 1969 and 1975 and at
the same time, imports increased almost ten-fold and, since 1973, have
surpassed actual domestic production. Based on the Government's ambitious
economic development programs, demand for cement is expected to continue
its rapid growth in rural and urban areas where a concerted effort is being
made to improve the housing situation, expand irrigation and increase the
industrial base.  It is estimated that by 1981 cement demand will be between
8.0 and 9.5 million tons per year, representing an annual growth rate of
between 13 and 16% as compared to 20% in the recent past. Saida is one of
at least seven new plants that are to come on stream between now and the end
of the decade to help meet this demand.
viii.     An increase in cement production and demand of the magnitude envi-
saged requires a concurrent expansion of SNMC's marketing and distribution
capability and the Company is currently establishing a number of distribu-
tion centers to handle bulk cement as well as formulating longer-term plans
for distributing a full range of building materials, including those produced
by other state companies. This, however, is not yet enough and in order to
service these centers and to transport cement and other construction materials
more effectively in the rural regions, substantial transport equipment--both
rail silo wagons and trucks--are required. SNMC will also undertake studies
designed to determine the location and method of operation of its future
greatly expanded distribution network and to analyze its long-term transport
needs.



- iii -
ix.       SNMC's present financial position is not untypical of Algerian
state enterprises and underlines the importance of the technical assistance
program to SNC. The proposed program aims to develop SNC's capabilities in
external auditing, implementing basic accounting systems and modern manage-
ment accounting techniques. The program would require collaboration between
SNC and a qualified international accounting and auditing firm over five
years and is expected to include both practical training of Algerian staff
abroad and joint operations in Algeria. Given the impracticality of making
individual loans to state enterprises for improvement of each accounting
department, SNC represents the best available vehicle for effecting a general
improvement in accounting standards.
x.        Of the Bank loan (US$46.0 million) to be made to SNMC, US$30.8 mil-
lion will cover approximately 25% of the estimated foreign exchange cost of
the Saida plant; US$10.1 million will provide the foreign cost of the Most
urgent requirements of trucks and silo wagons plus the foreign exchange
expenditures of the related distribution studies; and US$5.1 million will
be onlent to SNC to cover the foreign exchange component of the technical
assistance program. Residual financing for the Saida plant will be provided
by a supplier's credit (US$57.1 million)Ynand by loans from Algerian financial
institutions, probably Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD), Banque
Exterieure d'Algerie (BEA), and Treasury advances, together amounting to
approximately US$98 million. The Government will also provide the remaining
financing tor the distribution network and the technical assistance component
to SNC as well as any overrun financing that might become necessary to
complete all project elements.
xi.       Procurement of equipment, erection and civil works for the Saida
plant is being carried out in accordance with the Bank's international com-
petitive bidding procedures. A turnkey contract, excluding the civil works,
has been signed with Kawasaki Reavy Industries of Japan. The portion of the
Bank loan allocated directly to the Saida plant will finance: 30% of the
outstanding foreign exchange cost of the turnkey contract (representing 15%
of the total cost); 25% of the civil construction cost, representing its
estimated direct and indirect foreign exchange component; the foreign exchange
cost of a railway spur connecting the plant with the existing network as well
as consultant services and technical assistance connected with the implementation
and initial operation of the cement plant. It is proposed that US$300,000 of
the Bank loan be used for retroactive financing of consultant services.
xii.      The price the Saida plant will receive for its cement is expected
to be based on average industry costs plus a margin sufficient to cover
SNMC's debt service obligations in the cement sector. The Saida plant will,
however, not be able to maintain a positive cash flow until its third year of
operations. The main reasons for the fact that the Saida plant will be a
higher than average cost producer are the plant's high capital cost, due to
its relatively small size, expensive design features such as a high degree
of automation, ample built-in security margins, above average performance
guarantees, the decision to proceed with a turnkey contract and, in partic-
ular, the special environment in which SNMC has been contracting for cement
plants. Nevertheless, the êconomic rate of return of the Saida plant is



- iv -
still about 10%. Once the plant is operating at full capacity, the net
foreign exchange savings vill be significant and are expected to recover
the plant's total foreign exchange costs in 6 years.
xiii.     A number of the beneficial effects of the project are diffiult
to quantify. The benefit of the Saida plant lies also in the broader de-
velopmental impact that it will have on a region which so far has lagged behind
the coastal strip in the north. In addition to the institution-building imi-
pact of the project on SNMC and SNC, the strengthening of the accounting and
auditing functions in public sector firms can be expected to result in better
financial management and economic planning in Algeria. Most importantly, the
project is expected to permit continuation of a constructive dialogue with
SNMC and the Goverument on hov to improve the efficiency of industrial develop-
ment in Algeria.
xiv.      The technical and comuercial risks that the project faces are not
major.  Difficulties may, however, arl:se if SNMC and SNC cannot recruit and
retain sufficient qualified staff to implement their expansion progrem.
But it muet be recognized that the financial viability of SNMC, and the
Saida plant as part of it, depends on the continued functioning of
Algeria's public enterprise and finance system, and therefore on the ready
availability to SNMC of funds from the Government particularly during the
period of its rapid expansion.
xv.       Based on the assurances and agreements summarized at the end of
this report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$46,0 million
equivalent to SNMC, for 15 years including 4 years of grace, at an annual
interest rate of 8.5% plus a guarantee fee of 1.5% per annum payable by
SNMC to the Government on that portion of the loan which is not onlent to
SNC.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises a proposed Bank loan of US$46.0 million to
help finance: (i) part of the ongoing expansion of the Societe Nationale des
Materiaux de Construction (SNMC), the Algerian state enterprise for construc-
tion materials, through erection of a new 500,000 metric tons per year (tpy)
cement plant near Saida, about 200 km south of Oran (Map IBRD 11667); (ii)
the expansion of the Company's distribution network; and (iii) a technical
assistance program to the Societe Nationale de Comptabilite (SNC), the state
accounting and auditing company.
1.02      The Saida plant is part of the Algerian Four-Year Plan (t974-77)
which stipulates an increase in the country's cement production capacity
from about 1.6 million tpy in 1975 to 7.5 million by 1978 and forms an
integral component of the Special Development Program (1972-75) for the
Plateau Region; this program aims at fostering industry and agriculture of
Algeria's less developed regions away from the coastal strip.
1.03      The various project components were appraised in May and July of
1975. The Bank mission consisted of Miss Haug (Chief) and Messrs. Cognet
and Hilton of the Industrial Project8 Department and Mr. Basman (Consult-
ant). Technical terms used in the report are described in Annex 1.
II.  THE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM AND THE COMPANY
A.   Industrial Policy and the Public Enterprise System in Algeria
2.01      SNMC's organizational structure, investment plans, decision-making
process and financial situation must be seen in the context of the Algerian
economic and public enterprise system and the country's industrial policy
which are described in Annexes 2-1 and 2-2.
2.02      Algeria's economy is characterized by heavy concentration on in-
dustrial development and by the absence of the balancing mechanism of an
autonomous pricing system or of other free market forms of financial discipline.
Production of goods and services is dominated by state enterprises with the
private sector accounting for only a minor share. Since 1971, all state
enterprises have had to rely entirely on long or medium-term bank loans for
their investments since financing through equity or retained earnings is no
longer permissible. They are considered instruments of Government policy
and, as such, are not only financed by the state through Government-owned
banks but, in turn, are expected to contribute to Government finances through
tax contributions and investment of internally generated funds with the
Treasury in the form of Government bonds.
2.03      Industrial state enterprises, such as SNMC, operate under the
supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Industry and Energy which
defines their strategy, appoints senior personnel, determines - in collabora-
tion with the Ministry of Finance - the allocation of profits and proposes



-2-
investment program-s to the Plan Secretariat for final approval. Although
state enterprîses participate in formulating their investment programs, the
Plaa Secretariat influences not only production targets in line with overall
econuric objectives, but also the location and capacities of important new
production units. In the past, enterprises seldom questioned the economic
feasibility of investments inscribed in the Four-Year Plans and emphasis
vas instead put on physical Plan fulfillment.
B.   SNNC:  Company Background and Existing Facilities
2.04      SNMC was established in December 1968 as a State enterprise to pro-
mote the development of the domestic construction materials industry and to
manufacture, import and distribute a wide range of building materials. The
basis for SNMC's operations were 51 formerly privately-owned production units
and their distribution network which were nationalized between 1968 and 1972.
Compensation for take-over of the private assets vas resolved to mutual satis-
faction and, by the end of 1974, SNMC dominated the markets for cement (100%),
ready mixed concrete (100%), bricks (80%), tiles (75%), and plaster (55%).
The Company accounts for more than 65% of production in the Algerian construc-
tion materials sector, the remainder being produced by other state monopolies
(responsible for metal products, glass, wood, etc.) and by small factories
owned by regional authorities or private operators.
2.05      The Company produces, imports and markets, in addition to the basic
construction materials just mentioned, manufactured products of either con-
crete (pipes, props, support structures, etc.) or asbestos cement, as well
as ceramicse, sanitary ware, aggregates, sand/cement mixtures and miscella-
neous building materials. Recently, SNMC introduced two new product lines,
SIPOREX, a sand/cement based brick developed in Sweden for housing con-
struction, and some plastic building materials.
2.06      Since its creation, SNMC has invested more than US$400 million in
new production facilities, including 8 quarries, 8 brick and tile plants, 5
plants for manufacturing concrete products, 3 sanitary ware factories and
2 cement plants. The Company currently operates 70 production units, a fleet
of trucks, a construction company and a nationwide distribution system with
22 agencies and 89 depots. As illustrated in Map 11667, the existing facil-
ities, which, are given in some detail in Annex 2-3, are concentrated along
the coastal strip with few plants or agencies serving the rural high plateaux
and nomadic south.
2.07      SNHC's manpower increased from about 6,000 people in 1970 to nearly
15,000 people by mid-1975, of whom 92% are employed in production (Annex 2-4).
During the past five years, SNMC has been able to maintain productivity levels
in thq formerly private companies and has been operating its plants consis-
tently close to capacity.
2.08      The build-up of new capacity in the building materials sector is,
however, far behind schedule. During the first Four-Year Plan (1970-73)
only 55% of the planned increase was actually attained although investments
came to 90Z of planned expenditures. The main causes of SNMC's failure to



-3-
implement investments according to targets were: (i) unrealistically tight
construction schedules, imposed by the Plan and unchallenged by the Company
because of inadequate project preparation and implementation capacity due to
lack of experienced staff, the absence of proper feasibility studies, un-
satisfactory experiences with consultants and continued time pressures; and
(il) administrative difficulties within Algeria for approving contracts,
clearing customs and arranging transport and the need for time-consuming
special procedures for the financing of overruns which, due to severe ini-
tial underestimation of costs, often occurred.
C. SNMC: Management and Organization
2.09      The Company, with headquarters in Algiers, is managed by a Director
General, Mr. Ait Si Mohamed, who is an engineer by training and who joined
SNMC in 1973. He is assisted by five directors, respectively responsible
for Finance, Economic Planning, Technical Planning, Operations and Admin-
istration. Annex 2-5 illustrates SNMC's organizational structure. The
Company has been reorganized several times over the past five years. SNMC's
present organizational structure is basically acceptable and inefficiencies
stem more from (i) lack of coordination between the Technical, Financial and
Economic Planning Departments; (ii) inadequate numbers of qualified staff;
and (iii) insufficient guidance and supervision of middle management, than
from flaws in the organizational set-up.
2.10      SNMC's management efforts are dominated by the need to meet time
achedules and fulfill production and investment targets. Therefore, at the
SMMC level, economic planning and financial control of investments have
become secondary.  Lately, examples of resource misallocation have increased
including, in particular, overcapacities in certain sectors and regions.
2.11      To help realize, on schedule, its ambitious investment program with
a limited number of qualified staff, SNMC has opted for the turnkey approach
for all its major projects and is making a continuous effort to train and
recruit personnel at all levels in Algeria and abroad. To operate its new
plants at capacity, an additional safety margin is provided by a tendency
to overdesign new production units in order to safeguard against production
shortfalls in the future.
D.   SNMC:  Past Performance and Financial Results
2.12      The Algerian state-controlled economic system is characterized
by: (i) the fixing of domestic prices by a Governmental price commission;
(ii) the centralization of financial decisions through the requirement that
investments be approved by the relevant Ministries and the Banque Algerienne
de Developpement (BAD) which is the source of all local and some foreign ex-
change credits for investments in the country; and (iii) as mentioned in
para 2.02, the financing of all investments and working capital by debt and
the immediate back-flow of any surplus funds to the Treasury.

Despite an increase in physical output of about 35% between 1970 and 1974
and a virtual doubling of sales over the same period, losses have rapidly
increased, reaching 25% of net sales in 1974. The major reasons for these
losses are: (i) prices have not been adjusted adequately or frequently
enough to reflect increasing operating costs as well as higher import
prices for the products SNMC is reselling in Algeria; (ii) the lack of
an effective budgeting and cost control system which could set efficiency
targets in the absence of a free market price mechanism; and (iii) taxes of
DA 12.0 million which were levied in each of 1972 and 1973 despite negative
pre-tax income. These losses resulted in a cumulative cash shortfall by 1974
of DA 162 million (US$42 million) which was financed by short-term loans,
thus further aggravating SNMC's financial problems.
2.14      About 87% of SNMC's net los originates from three sectors -
cement, bricks and tiles, and concrete - which together account for about 70%
of the Company's net sales. Losses in the cement sector are the result of
sales prices which - although they cover domestic cement production cost and
a reasonable return on investment - are far below current cement import prices,
whereas losses in the brick and tiles, agglomerates, plaster, quicklime and
concrete sectors are due to maintaining sales prices below SNMC's domestic
production costs.
2.15      Balance sheets for the past five years (1970-74) are given in
Annexe 2-7 and summarized below:

This table again reflects the rapid expansion of SNMC.  In five years, net
fixed assets have increased eightfold and construction in progress by a
factor of 46. On the other hand, equity (derived from the balance sheet
positions of the former private companies) has become negative due to high
losses which, as mentioned above, vere covered, not by Government grants,
but by additional short-term debt.
2.16      To improve the Company's liquidity position, the Governwent agreed,
iû 1973, to a rescheduling of local debt, including:  (i) an extension from
five to seven years for the repayment of medium-term loans from the Banque
Exterieur d'Algerie (BEA) and from 12 to 15 years for long-term BAD loans;
(ii) an extension of the grace perioda for BAD and BEA loans to three
years; and (iii) a DA 110 million medium-term loan for working capital.
The liquidity problem which prompted this debt rescheduling has not had
a serious impact on SNMC's day-to-day operations since the Company has had
unlimited access to short- and medium-term credits through BEA, its primary
bank. Thus the Goverament subsidizes construction material prices through
the banking system.
E.   SNMC: Accounts and Audits
2.17      At the time of nationalization, many of the private plants which
were attached to SNMC did not keep adequate accounts so that one of the first
tasks of SNMC was to establish a complete and uniform accounting system.  Cost
centers, on a product-by-product and plant-by-plant basis, have been defined,
but SNMC has still to implement budgeting and cost control as well as improve
its financial planning. To supplement the financial covenants (para 2.22),
the organizational preconditions must be created which will enable SNMC to
measure and maintain financial discipline. Therefore SNMC has agreed to
furnish to the Bank for comment and to implement thereafter: (i) a plan for
strengthening of its general accounting and financial planning systems, to be
submitted by the end of 1976; (ii) a plan for improvement of its cost account-
ing capability, to be submitted by the end of 1977; and (iii) a plan for strength-
ening budgeting and cost control for each cost center, to be submitted not later
than the end of 1978.



-6-
2.18      SNMC's accounts are reviewed by the Commissaires aux Comptes, the
official State auditors. Staff constraints do not allow them to conduct
audits according to the Bank's standards. As part of the project, a training
program for the Societe Nationale de Comptabilite (SNC), the state auditing and
accounting firm, will be executed under which SNC staff will inter alia be
trained to perform audits consistent with Bank requirements (paras 6.05-6.09).
Agreement was reached that SNMC's accounts will be audited by an independent
auditing firm acceptable to the Bank. The Government and SNMC have agreed
to appoint SNC to this task. Should SNC prove unable to meet the requirements
of an independent audit, the Bank will so inform SNMC and the Goverament and
will review with them ways and means of ensuring a satisfactory audit.
F.   SNMC:  Future Investment Program
2.19      It is evident that the construction materials industry must play an
important role in Algeria's development effort since all public and private
construction depends on ready availability of cement, bricks, tiles and con-
crete. Algeria's experience during the 1970-73 Plan period, when nearly 60%
of domestic cement consumption had to be imported, and the high investment
in housing, agriculture, and infrastructure included in the current Plan
(1974-77) also led to an ambitious investment program for SNMC. Details of
this program are given in Annex 2-8 and sumrarized below.

Within the construction materials sector, cement accounts for nearly 65% of
investments under construction or planned. Details of the cement plant ex-
pansion are discussed in paras-4.02-4.04, 4.06 and 4.07 and Annex 4-1.



2.20      As mentioned previously (para. 2.03), in practice, the responsibility
for financing SNMC's investment program does not lie with the Company but with
the Ministry of Finance and funds are provided through bilateral development or
suppliers' credits and by BAD and BEA loans. Availability of such financing
depends not so much on SNMC's present and future financial position as on
Algeria's ability to generate sufficient funds internally and to attract
foreign credits for meeting the economy's overall investment needs.   In the
past, this system has not encouraged SNMC to adequately control capital
costs or to make optimal technical and economic investment choices. The Bank
recently made a loan of US$40 million equivalent to the Banque Algerienne de
Developpement (BAD) for smaller projects (other than cement production) in
the construction and building materials sector. 1/ The BAD project is expected
to improve investment decisions and financial control in the public sector
and provides for the establishment of a Project Evaluation Unit at BAD.  BAD
will also be invited to participate in the Bank's supervision of the proposed
SNMC expansion project.
G.   SNMC: Future Financial Viability
2.21      Although SNMC is at present not a financially viable independent
enterprise, it can be argued that, in a centrally-planned economy, the sub-
sidization of the building material sector through transfer payments from
another sector or unlimited credit from the Treasury is a legitimate means
of implementing a country's priorities. In theory, such a system may lead
to optimal resource allocation if minimum cost and efficiency objectives are
followed and there is rigorous control of transfers among sectors on the
macro-economic level.  Both conditions have not yet been fulfilled with regard
to SNMC. In 1975, for example, the company budget indicates a net loss of
DA 397 million (US$101 million) of which DA 310 million (US$79 million) is
attributable to imports. As a percentage of sales, the loss is expected to
be about 42%. Making allowance for depreciation, the cash loss is expected
to be around DA 303 million (US$77 million). It is, therefore, desirable to
reestablish SNMC as a self-contained enterprise independent of subsidies in
the long run, i.e. at least to enable it to meet its cost and debt service
obligations.
2.22      During appraisal and negotiations, ways and means of establishing
SNMC on a sounder long-term financial basis were, therefore, discussed with
the Government and the Company. A number of measures were agreed upon with
the Government and SNMC which should meet this objective.  In particular:
1/   Report No. 782-AL-Appraisal of an Industrial Project to Banque Algerienne
de Developpement, dated June 10, 1975.



(a)  SNMC agreed to review prices of all its products annually on
the basis of audited financial statements and to propose prices
equal to the average unit cost of each product plus a margin to
cover debt service associated with that product or product group;
the Government undertook to take all steps necessary with a view
to setting SNMC's prices at a level consistent with these
provisions; 1/
(b)  SNMC agreed to maintain a debt service coverage of 1.1 times in
each year and to meet its current liabilities as and when they
fall due; the Government specifically undertook to ensure that
SNMC will have adequate funds (other than short-term loans)
sufficient to meet these financial covenants; and
(c)  the Government agreed that SNMC's accumulated losses through to
December 31, 1975 should be refinanced on adequate terms and
conditions and confirmed that all losses through to the end of
1974 had already been covered by long-term loans.
2.23      Based on information provided during negotiations on the Company's
future investments, on the prevailing price policy for the non-cement sector
and taking account of the financial agreements listed above, Annex 2-9 shows
indicative financial projections for SNMC from 1976 to 1981.  Selected figures
are shown below:

2.24      It can be seen that, until about 1978, other sectors will remain
more important for the Company than cement, in terms of revenue, but that
cement will increase rapidly as new plants come on stream.  In 1976 cement
is expected to account for approximately 33% of sales and for about 55% by
1981.
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objective
3.01      The emphasis of the project lies on its institution building effect
on the building materials sector. The project attempts to help SNMC cope vith
the present and future organizational and financial problems created by an
ambitious investment program.  SNMC has to develop from a financially weak
enterprise which is struggling to meet its production targets under the Plan,
to one which can meet production and distribution targets as well as maintain
financial discipline and strict cost control. The proposed loan attempts to
contribute to this development by dealing with 3 critical aspects: (i)
cement production, (ii) distribution means and planning, and (iii) accounting,
financial planning and auditing.
B.   Prolect Description
3.02      The project has three inter-related components:
(a) The Saida Plant:  the largest single element in the project
is the construction of a new 500,000 tpy dry-process cement
plant at Saida in the underdeveloped high plateau region.
Including interest during construction and incremental working
capital the plant is expected to cost DA 728 million (US$186
million).  It is part of a plan to increase domestic cement
production by about 300% between 1975 and 1978.
(b) The Distribution System: SNMC is presently preoccupied with
implementing new projects and has not yet focused adequately
on its distribution requirements resulting from the immense
expansion of capacity. The distribution component of the
project includes, therefore, (i) a program of studies defining
SNMC's future distribution facilities, and transport require-
ments; and (ii) acquisition of an estimated 260 silo wagons
and 190 20-ton trucks with related repair facilities plus any
additional transport or maintenance equipment as indicated
on the basis of the above studies. Total cost of this program
is expected to be about DA 82 million (US$21 million).
(c) SNC: The Government intends to develop SNC, the state enter-
prise for accounting and auditing (i) to perform regular
independent external audits and (ii) to provide consulting
services in accounting, cost control and budgeting to state



- 10 -
enterprises, including SNMC. The project includes a 5-year
technical assistance and training program for SNC to develop
its inhouse accounting, cost control and auditing capabilities.
The program is estimated to cost DA 29 million (US$7.4 million).
Aside from the immediate objective of ensuring for SNMC an
independent audit satisfactory to the Bank and the possibility
of providing expert assistance when establishing the required
financial planning, cost control and budgeting system (para 2.17),
the strengthening of SNC will help improve accounting standards
more generally throughout Algeria.
3.03      A list of Bank-financed items under the project is contained in
Annex 3-1 and a summary capital cost table for the project as a whole is
shown below. Each component is discussed separately in Chapters IV, V and
VI and more detailed information is available in Annexes 4-2, 5-7, 5-9 and
6-1. A project implementation schedule is contained in Annex 3-2.

To ensure project completion under any eventuality, the Goverament has agreed
to provide a cost overrun guarantee, i.e. to make available any additional
local or foreign funds as may be needed to complete the project on terms con-
sistent with maintenance of the financial covenants referred to in paras. 2.22
and 5.25.
C.   Allocation of Bank Loan and Disbursement Schedule
i.0O5     The Bank loan will be used to finance part or all of the estimated
foreign exchange costs of equipment, construction and consultant fees as
detailed in Annexes 3-1, 4-2, 5-9 and 6. The disbursement schedule for all
project components combined is contained in Annex 3-3.  Any loan funds re-
maining uncommitted for items on the Bank list would be used to finance other
project components, if found justified, or othervise be cancelled.
IV. THE MARKET FOR CEMENT
4.01      A detailed description of the market for cement in Algeria, includ-
ing a discussion of export prospects, transportation requirements and pricing
policy, is presented in Annexes 4-1 and 4-2.
A.   Supply and Demand Balance
4.02      Historic Demand/Supply:  While cement has been produced in Algeria
at least since the early years of the century, SNMC did not begin manufacture
until 1969 when it took over three cement plants (Pointe-Pescade, Meftah I
and Zahana I) of a combined annual capacity of 1.05 million tons. Since then,
SNMC has concentrated on the satisfaction of domestic demand by installing
new production capacity and by importation. The results of this expansion
are just beginning to be felt, as shown in the following table:

4.03      The major achievements in SNMC's program so far include:  (i) start-
up of a new 500,000 tpy plant, Hadjar-Soud I, (1973); (ii) the closure of the
small Meftah I plant (1974); (iii) start-up of a new 1 million tpy plant,
Meftah II, (1974); and (iv) construction of an extension to the Hadjar-Soud
plant, Hadjar-Soud II, with an incremental annual capacity of 500,000 tons,
which is due to come on stream in late 1975.
4.04      Despite the relatively high level of imports, accounting for about
60% of consumption, and an average annual consumption increase of about 20%
during 1969-1974, actual cement demand continues to exceed supply as illus-
trated by black market prices 50-100% above official levels. The scarcity
of cement in Algeria is not only due to inadequate imports and domestic
production, but also due to inefficiencies in the distribution system, in
particular port handling of imports.
4.05      Projected Demand:  Algeria's second Four-Year Plan (1974-77)
stipulates an average annual cement demand of almost 7 million tons by 1977.
However, past experience indicates that it is unlikely that the Plan will be
carried out on schedule and this figure must be seen as an optimistic upper
limit for cement demand.  In the period after 1977, when the Saida plant will
come on stream, demand projections can only be based on notional data since no
reliable post-1977 planning document exists and secondary effects of economic
growth are limited in centrally planned economies.   The following table
indicates a range within which future cement demand might fall based on various
projection methods. It should be noted that SNMC's estimates, which are based
on full implementation of the 1974-77 Plan, are consistently higher than those
of the Bank (Annex 4-1).

-  Correlation with GDP/Capita
most likely estimate        5.02    5.96    7.04    8.26       9.42
Both the "most likely" estimates assume an 8.6% p.a. real growth of the
Algerian economy through 1981.  Starting from the estimated 1975 consumption
of about 3.8 million tons, the  "most likely" projections would represent
average annual growth rates of cement demand of between 16.5% and 13%
as compared to the consumption growth of 20% annually between 1969 and 1974.
4.06      Projected Supply:  In view of the rapid growth in import volume,
the steep rise in import prices (para 4.20) and the constraints which insuffi-
cient cement availability have imposed upon Algeria's investment programs, the
Government has increased its emphasis on expansion of domestic cement pro-
duction. The 4 Year Plan (1974-77) includes as a goal self-sufficiency in
ceement supply by 1980 and plans are for SNMC, as the sole producer of cement
in Algeria, to construct 12 new plants beyond those already in operation or
due to come on stream during 1975. Excluding four plants with a total
nominal capacity of about 3 million tons per year, which are still in the
early planning stage, SNMC's production capacity is estimated to develop as
follows:

- 14 -
4.07      The above build-up in cement production is based on capacity utiliza-
tion rates of 40% during the first year of production, 60% in year 2, 85% in
year 3, and 90% thereafter. Individual capacities, present status and
expected start-up dates for each new plant and assumed production rates for
all plants are given in Annex 4-1. With the exception of CIMA, a joint ven-
ture between SNMC and Morocco, all these plants are being contracted on a
"turnkey" basis, which is expected to help SNMC assure timely implementation
of the expansion program. Substantial foreign exchange financing is being
secured on concessional terms through bilateral credits for all plants.
4.08      Projected Demand/Supply Balance:  Based on the above demand and
supply projections, the following table shows the likely demand/supply
balance through 1981:
Algeria:  Projected Cement Demand/Supply Balance (1975-81)

4.09      As noted in para 4.06, an additional four cement plants are cur-
rently under consideration, with a total capacity of 3 million tpy, which
could come on stream during 1981-83.  There are serious doubts whether such
additional capacity could be justified at that time since: (i) slippage
of investment plans inscribed in the 4-Year Plan (1974-77) must be expected
along with perhaps some similar delay in meeting cement production targets,
s0 that both cement supply and demand may move at lower levels than antici-
pated with the consequence that available cement production capacity of the
nine plants now being implemented could still meet demand increases in the
early 1980s; (ii) the growth of cement consumption may tend to level off
after 10 years of very rapid growth; (iii) Algeria's prospects for export-
ing at cost large quantities of cement in the early eighties are marginal,
because of likely oversupply in the Mediterranean area; and (iv) SNMC's
managerial capacity may be overtaxed if it had to deal with a major addi-
tional export program.
4.10      Allocating regional cement supply and distribution according to
plant location, during the early 1980s a regional oversupply situation may
occur in the west where the Saida plant is to be located. This oversupply
may range from between 0.5 and 1.0 million tons annually and will have to be
shipped to the central region (over a distance of 250 km or more), where



- 15 -
excess demand is expected to prevail. Such shipments will put an additional
strain on the existing transportation and distribution system, and might have
been avoided by more careful planning of plant locations. However, the
regional supply/demand imbalance only indirectly affects the market for the
Saida plant since from a transportation point of view it is optimally located
to meet the projected cement demand on the high plateau around Saida and in
the southern desert where it does not compete with any other cement plant.
4.11      In view of SNMC's additional expansion plans and because of the
expected regional cement supply/demand imbalance in the early 1980s, SNMC
has agreed to provide the Bank, during 1978, with a detailed cement market
study whose proposed content shall have been discussed with the Bank. Should
SNMC decide to invest in further cement capacity prior to completion of this
study, the Company agreed to carry out all necessary preparatory studies,
the scope and content of which will be the subject of an exchange of informa-
tion and views with the Bank, and to furnish them to the Bank upon their
completion for a further exchange of views.
B.   SNMC Distribution Network
4.12      A description of SNMC's present and planned distribution system
is contained in Annex 4-2 and summrarized below.
4.13      Distribution Channels:  SNHC's current distribution system has
evolved in an ad hoc manner out of the facilities which the Company inherited
in 1968.  It consists of 89 depots and 22 agencies operated by SNMC.  While
the agencies handle the entire range of the Company's products, their cement
storage space totals only about 22,000 tons and individual agencies vary
greatly in size, turnover and level of efficiency.
4.14      On account of the limitations of the existing network, the 4-Year
Plan (1974-77) stipulated a shift to a regional cement distribution system
based on bulk-handling from the plants and storage in bulk-silos at 37 new
distribution centers. These centers, to be operated by SNMC, were to sell
cement, either bagged or in bulk, to SNMC agencies and depots or final con-
sumers and were to result in greater accessibility of bulk cement to large
consumers and lower transportation and overall distribution costs. Ten of
these centers were to be completed in 1975 at a total cost of DA 132 million
(US$33 million) and each of them will have approximately 30,000 mr of open
storage, 5,000 m2 of covered storage and two cement silos of 1,500 ton capa-
city each. However, three problems have arisen which have caused the concept
of the centers to be re-evaluated: (i) owing to the high initial investment
cost, it is unlikely that SNMC's average per ton distribution costs - which
rose from DA 20/ton (US$5.1/ton) to DA 37/ton (US$9.4/ton) between 1973 and
1974 - will decline when the centers come into operation since their operating
costs alone, in 1974 terms, are now estimated at about DA 10/ton; (ii) the
original concept of the centers limited them to cement sales while a large
part of total demand in the rural areas is for a wide range of building
materials; and (iii) the number of customers able to receive bulk cement is
small and their needs can be adequately handled by the plants and the 10
distribution centers soon starting operation.



- 16 -
4.15      In addition, the location of some of the centers appears question-
able since three of those under construction are located within 15 km of a
new cement plant with similar bagging'and storage facilities. It has, there-
fore, been decided that: (i) only a few centers (in addition to those under
construction) will be built; and (ii) the existing agencies and depots as
well as the new centers will be absorbed into a national network of distri-
bution centers for construction materials which are to sell building materials
manufactured by SNMC as well as by other state enterprises. The planning
and timing of this new network are discussed in para 4.19.
4.16      Transport:  Cement shipments fall under the monopolies of either
Societe Nationale de Transport Routier (SNTR) or Societe Nationale des Chemins
de Fer d'Algerie (SNFCA) but neither has the capacity to handle all SNMC's
output. SNMC is therefore allowed to own its own trucks and silo wagons,
the latter being operated, through a leasing arrangement under which SNMC
pays a preferential tariff, by SNCFA. The present transport capacity is
inadequate and 50% of cement sales are picked up by consumers at the
plant or dockside. Of the remainder, approximately 35% (on a ton km basis)
is at present transported by SNCFA (rail); 10% by SNTR (road); and only 5%
by SNMC (road). Road transport is about twice as expensive as rail haulage
(DA 0.21 vs. 0.10/ton km) and the weight of this disadvantage will further
increase as demand in the hinterland grows and average truck journeys become
longer.
4.17      In the framework of the 4-year Plan, SNMC has prepared a preliminary
transport plan which determines the transport means required to distribute
its projected cement output of about 5.9 million tons in 1978. The study,
which together with assumptions detailed in Annex 4-2, projects transport
requirements as follows:
Algeria: Cement Transport Requirements (1978)
Nos. of Vehicles
Ton Km            Total      Incremental
Silo Wagons (50-ton)         241 million           440            260
Trucks (20-ton)               750,000              230            190
The extension of SNMC's truck and railway wagon fleet is justified as the
least-cost solution to the cement distribution problem.  SNCFA, the Algerian
state railway company which operates the SNMC-owned wagons, is expected
to grant SNMC a rebate on its tariffs which would permit SNMC to recover
its investment within eight years. In addition, financial analysis of the
truck fleet expansion project indicates that SNMC could operate its truck
fleet at a total cost per ton kilometer that is 15% below the present tariff
of the Algerian freight transport company, SNTR (Annex 4-2).
4.18      SNCFA at present operates 60 silo railway wagons for SNMC and has
ordered another 120, leaving a shortage of 260 as compared to the 440 wagons
required.   To help alleviate the cement transport problem in Algeria, it is
proposed that the Bank finance under the loan an initial phase of this
expansion:



- 17 -
Transport Equipment Financed under the IBRD Loan
Estimated CIF Cost /1
(US$ million)
150/50-ton silo wagons (US$40,000 per unit)                  6.0
90/20-ton trucks (US$35,000 per unit)                        3.1
Total                                   9.1
/1   In 1977 prices including contingencies.
The Bank-financed trucks and wagons will be procured in 1976/77 following
ICB according to the Bank's guidelines. For the purpose of bid comparison
a margin of preference equal to 15% of the cif cost or the actual customs
duty, whichever is less, will be given to local manufacturers. The Bank
loan will finance 100% of foreign expenditures for, or 65% (representing the
estimated foreign exchange component) of the total cost of, about 150 silo
railway wagons and about 90 trucks out of minimum requirement of 260 wagons
and 190 trucks. Financing for the remainder of the trucks and wagons, for
the required maintenance equipment and facilities as well as for such
additional transport and maintenance equipment as shall be determined on the
basis of SNMC's detailed distribution study (para. 4.19), will be provided
through the Governnent.
4.19      Distribution Planning:  In the past, SNMC did not need to pursue
an aggressive marketing strategy for building materials, since demand was
considerably greater than supply. Consequently, distribution planning and
optimal transport allocation have not been developed as a function. To enable
SNMC to handle, by the end of this decade, the distribution of more than triple
its present output, SNMC's distribution function has to be defined and strength-
ened within the next two years. In a first stage a series of studies needs
to be undertaken, in particular: (i) a study determining location and operating
characteristics of SNMC's distribution facilities; (ii) a detailed study of
SNMC's requirements for transportation equipment and maintenance facilities
during 1976-1981; and (iii) a study on the development of an integrated nation-
al production-transport-distribution system for cement. The Bank will make
available under the loan US$1.0 million to cover the foreign exchange cost
of consulting services for these studies. SNMC will present to the Bank a
detailed program of the studies to be carried out and their timing - prepared
in consultation with the Bank - by the end of March 1976.
C.   Pricing of Cement
4.20      Cement prices in Algeria remained constant between 1966 and 1973
when they were increased to DA 130/ton bulk and DA 140/ton bagged (US$33
and 36/ton respectively) delivered at SNMC factory gate, agency or depot.
Price differentials according to geographical location, mode of transport
etc. do not exist. The 1973 cement price was established on the basis of



- 18 -
SNMC's average unit cost of producing, importing, transporting and dis-
tributing cement in 1972, plus a fixed margin.  However, while cement prices
in Algeria have been kept constant since then, costs have risen sharply:
(i) the average dockside price of imported cement increased from DA 120/ton
in 1973 to DA 200/ton in 1975, and (ii) at present, the average production
cost of Algeria's new plants which have not yet reached full capacity is
estimated at up to three times that in older plants. Therefore, in order
to cover its present cost of cement production and distribution, SNMC would
require a delivered price of about DA 230/ton versus the 1975 price of DA 130/
ton for bulk cement and DA 140/ton for bagged cement.  This cost structure
will improve as new plants reach full production at which time costs should
be about DA160/ton - below comparable import prices.
4.21      In July 1975, SNMC requested a price increase for all its products.
Subsequently a new pricing policy for all building materials but cement was
decided upon, which determines SNMC's sales prices at cost plus a 10% profit
margin. Cement pricing is still under review and a decision is expected
before end 1975. However, it is understood that cement prices will also be
adjusted periodically to reflect production costs plus a margin sufficient
to cover debt service obligations (para. 2.22).
4.22      Average cost-plus pricing as used in Algeria is widely applied in
capital-intensive industries, such as cement. New plants have high unit
costs as they are gradually brought up to capacity operation and pre-oper-
ating expenses are written off. Thereafter, costs decrease by some 20-30%
and experience an even larger reduction when, after about 10 years of oper-
ations, depreciation and financial charges become negligible. Average cost
pricing systems in countries with a relatively even mix of old and new
plants or, as is the case of industrialized countries, a marginal capac-
ity increase relative to existing capacity, tend therefore to result in a
fair amount of intra-industry or intra-company subsidization at gradually
increasing prices, whereas in countries, such as Algeria, with primarily
new plants such pricing systemns imply high initial and then decreasing
cemènt prices over time.  This situation is, of course, aggravated by
the fact that, in Algeria, all investrents are financed by debt.
V. THE SAIDA CEMENT PLANT
A.   Technical Aspects
5.01      Scope and ObJectives:  The plant is part of a lime and cement complex,
to be constructed and operated by SNMC near Saida. The cement plant, with
a rated capacity of 500,000 tpy will use dry process technology and produce
Ordinary Portland cement and possibly some special cement types.  The cement
plant is being constructed under a turnkey contract, except for civil works,
with the Japanese firm, Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), having been selected
as contractor following international competitive bidding.



- 19 -
5.02      Raw Material Availability and Analysis:  Geological investigations
were undertaken by a Bulgarian company during 1972/73, confirming the avail-
ability of sufficient reserves of limestone, clay and sandstone to operate
the cement - lime complex at full capacity for more than 50 years. Abundant
limestone reserves exist about 1.5 km from the plant site but the clay deposit
is located more than 35 km distant. The clay samples show low silica and
high alumina components which necessitate sandstone and iron ore additions
as corrective components for dry process production. Sufficient sandstone
is available at a deposit 30 km from the site and other additives (e.g. gypsum)
are quarried by SNMC, purchased locally (iron ore), or imported (pozzolana).
Details on raw material deposits and sources of supply are given in Annex 5-1.
5.03      Plant Description:  A detailed technical description of the plant,
as proposed by KHI, is contained in Annex 5-2.  Dry process technology
was chosen because of the acceptable humidity of the raw materials, the
substantial fuel savings associated with this process and the objective of
standardizing cement-making technology in Algeria. The plant will be fully
automated in line with SNMC's desire to incorporate the latest technology; it
includes a complete line of mechanical and electrical cement machinery with
a kiln of a rated capacity of 1,500 tons per day of clinker and all other
necessary auxiliary installations as well as extensive workshops, a laboratory
and administrative and social buildings.
5.04      The design of the plant provides for a doubling of capacity with a
minimum of new equipment and no infrastructure additions and includes ample
security margins in all but the kiln and cement grinding departments. As
detailed in Annex 5-2, the raw material quarrying and handling equipment,
the limestone crusher and the dispatching facilities are substantially over-
designed, with their capacities exceeding by 3-10 times the required norm
for handling 1,800 ton per day of clinker during a 30 working hour week.
During negotiations, SNMC was asked to review with KHI the possibility of
eliminating these overcapacities. The possible investment saving could be
up to US$5.0 million. This issue is further discussed in para 5.13.
5.05      Infrastructure and Utilities:  Infrastructure and utilities are
described in Annex 5-3. The plant requires the construction of roads connecting
the quarries and the plant site and of a 25 km railway link to the SNCFA main
rail network. SNMC is responsible for undertaking and financing, as part of the
project, all necessary infrastructure work except for the provision of housing.
5.06      Power for the cement - lime complex will be supplied by SONELGAZ 1/
through its distribution center north of Saida and a pressure reducing station
at the site. SONELGAZ will be responsible for the construction of the con-
necting lines whereas the related investment costs will be covered by SNMC
and are provided for in the plant's capital cost. Assurances were obtained
that SNMC will take all necessary steps to ensure timely availability of gas
and electricity for the project.
1/   Societe Nationale d'Electricite et de Gaz



- 20 -
5.07      Ecology:  The plant is designed to meet anti-pollution standards
required by Western European c untries (Annex 5-4):  (i) to prevent a dust
discharge of mare than 50 mg/m , electrical precipitators and filters will be
installed which amount to nearly 7% of equipment cost; (ii) the sulphate-alkali
mixture of the raw meal and the stack height is to be such as to maintain
an annual mean of below 100 micrograms/m ; (iii) noise pollution will be kept
to a minimum because of the fully automatic operation of the plant; and (iv)
sewerage discharge will be treated by the normal bio-chemical process.
SNMC agreed to construct and operate the Saida plant according to sound
ecological and environmental considerations and to establish and maintain
a monitoring system for dust, gas and noise pollution at the plant.
5.08      Manpower and Training:  Details of labor force projections and
training are contained in Annex 5-5. Cement factories have high capital/labor
ratios; thus the plant will provide direct employment for only about 220
persons, including 50 unskilled workers. Training of all personnel will be
provided by KHI as part of the turnkey contract and take place at KHI's
workshops, similar dry-process plants in Europe and at Saida. In addition,
by 1976, SNMC intends to create its own Permanent Technical Training Center,
with UNDP/UNIDO assistance, which will supplement the supplier's training.
The training plans are satisfactory provided the Company will be able to
recruit the required personnel.  Assurances were obtained from SNMC that it
will make adequate and tinmly arrangements for recruiting and training of
personnel for the Saida plant.
5.09      Procurement:  As mentioned above, the Saida plant will be built
under a turnkey contact. While this approach entails normally higher capital
costs, it offers in the Algerian context certain clear advantages. First,
the number of SNMC's qualified technical staff is very small and clearly
insufficient to plan and supervise the ambitious ongoing investment program.
Second, this concept allows a single contractor to be held responsible for
completion dates, performance guarantees and costs.
5.10      Procurement procedures for the Saida cement plant were initiated in
November 1973. Following pre-qualification and ICB according to the
Bank's guidelines and including two-stage bidding, KHI was chosen as
lowest evaluated bidder and a contract signed in April 1975. The turnkey
contract includes detailed engineering, supervision of civil works, supply
and erection of equipment, commissioning and training. It excludes the
execution of the actual construction work for the plant. In May 1975, site
preparation was completed by a local firm and SNMC has started ICB procedures
for the plant's civil construction contract. SNMC will also bid internationally
the materials and supplies for the construction of the railroad, following
Bank procedures. Details on procurement are given in Annexes 5-6 and 5-7.

5.11      Plant Implementation and Technical Assistance:  SNMC has engaged
SOCADEI (France), a Lafarge subsidiary, to provide consulting services.
The selection of this company followed Bank procedures. SOCADEI was
instrumental in preparing procurement documents and evaluating offers and
will be supervising construction and commissioning, and vill elaborate the
quarry exploitation plan. The plant implementation schedule is given in
Annex 5-6. The plant is forecast to start operating in mid-1978 and
performance tests are expected to be concluded by end 1978.
5.12      Both SOCADEI's and KHI's responsibilities end with the completion
of the performance tests about six months after start-up. SNMC has signed
agreements with Lafarge, Asland and COMSIP International for the provision
of technical assistance if SNMC so requires. The companies may not be able,
however, to meet SNMC's needs during 1977-80, when five new cement plants will
come on stream. Although SNMC's training program is commendable, SNMC's
experience with new cement plants during the next two years may prove that
considerable technical assistance will be required. Therefore, SNMC has
agreed to make, by December 1977, adequate arrangements for technical services,
satisfactory to the Bank, for operation of the Saida cement plant.

By international standards, the capital cost of the Saida plant is high, with
fixed assets (not including infrastructure and investment for the lime plant)
amounting to US$285 per annual ton of cement produced compared to US$180 in
comparable plants now being built. The high unit cost would be reduced to
about US$225 per ton if plant capacity were doubled. However, the market
prospects in Saida'a natural hinterland do not justify such an expansion
within the next 8-10 years. The reasons for the high capital costs include
(i) built-in overcapacity and excessive safety margins; (ii) capital-
intensive design features such as a high degree of automation, (iii) guarantee
requirements and penalties exceeding the international norm, and (iv) a
premium paid for plant implementation under the turnkey contract. However,
in addition to the above reasons, which may account for a cost increase of
about US$20 million, there is another major factor in Saida's high capital



- 23 -
cost: During the past 2 years, SNMC has signed other turnkey contracts for
5 cement plants with leading cement contractors.  These suppliers are well
aware of: (i) the prevailing working conditions in Algeria; and (ii) SN4C's
emphasis on time achedules, technical quality and output guarantees rather
than on the level of capital costs. SNMC$a approach and. the Algerian system
have, therefore, created a procurement climate which induces high priced offers.
Under such circumstances the normal cost-reducing effect of international
competitive bidding has not materialized.
5.14      The above capital cost estimates can be considered accurate:  The
turnkey, consulting and site preparation contracts are firm so that costs of
equipment, erection, engineering and supervision representing 75% of the base
cost estimate, are not subject to price escalation. The estimate for buildings
and civil works reflects a May 1975 quote of a European contractor and
SNMC's current experience with other cement plants. Infrastructure costs
are based on quotes from SONELGAZ, SNCFA and local contractors. Import
duties and taxes of about 7% have been added to equipment and erection
and 22% to consulting services. An estimated DA 2.7 million for training
and DA 2.8 million for technical assistance have also been included. Pre-
operating start-up expenses and engineering fees include SOCADEI's and KHI's
fees, the cost of the SNMC project team, and material and supplies during
commissioning of the plant. To cover possible omissions and changes in
project design, physical contingencies of 5% and 10% have been added respec-
tively to the base cost of items for which contracte have or have not been
signed. The allowance for price escalation amounts to 14% of that 25% of
the base cost plus physical contingencies that remains subject to price
escalation. The annual escalation rates used during the construction
period are 15% for foreign equipment and construction, 10% for foreign
services, 5% for local equipment and supplies and 7% for local services.
5.15      As mentioned previously, the Saida cement plant is part of a cement-
lime production complex. The above capital cost includes DA 17.9 million
(US$4.6 million) for land, infrastructure, civil works and equipment which
can be allocated to the lime plant.
5.16      Working Capital Requirements:  Working capital requirements through
1979, i.e. the first full year of operations of the plant are estimated at
DA 31.8 million (US$8.1 million). The detailed build-up is given in Annex 5-8.
The amount is high due to the fact that the majority of SNMC's customers are
state enterprises or Government agencies which pay only three months after
delivery.
5.17      Financing Plan:  In accordance with financing practices in Algeria
(para 2.02) the total financing required for the Saida plant of DA 728.4 million
(US$185.8 million) will be covered by loans as follows:

IBRD                        120.7               30.8           16.6

Advances                  383.7               97.9           52.7
Total                  728.4              185.8          100.0
5.18      In May 1975, SNMC signed a supplier's credit agreement, as part of
the KHI turnkey contract, totalling DA 224 million, of which DA 194.5 million
(87%) is for 13 years including 3 years of grace, bearing an annual interest
of 8.0%, and DA 29.5 million, covering KHI's services, is for 8 years, includ-
ing 3 years of grace at 8.5% interest. In line with similar Japanese credits
to Algeria, the credit covers 70% of the turnkey contract's foreign exchange
cost, equivalent to 48% of the Saida plant's total foreign exchange cost.
The Saida plant component of the proposed Bank loan to SNMC is US$30.8 mil-
lion equivalent. The Bank loan will cover about 25% of the plant's total
foreign exchange requirements. Both the supplier's credit and the IBRD loan
will be guaranteed by the Government of Algeria; the foreign exchange risk
rests with SNMC.
5.19      Financing of incremental working capital requirements (estimated at
US$8.1 million) will be provided by Treasury advances on terms at least as
favourable as those of the IBRD loan. The remaining financing gap (estimated
at US$89.8 million) will be covered by long-term loans from BAD or other
appropriate domestic lending institutions. The latter generally carry
interest at 5.5% per annum and repayment periods in line with a project's
financial prospects. The financial projections are based on a repayment
period of 16 years, including four years of grace, calculated from the year
in which the disbursement is made. The Government indicated that the BAD
loan would be on terms at least as favourable at those of the IBRD loan.
5.20      Allocation of Bank Loan and Disbursement:  The Bank loan will finance
part of the foreign exchange cost of goods and services for the Saida plant,
in accordance with a list of items shown in Annex 5-9, consisting of (i) 30%
of the outstanding foreign exchange cost of the KHI turnkey contract for supply
and erection of the Saida plant, representing about 15% of the contract's total
foreign exchange cost; (ii) 25% of the cost of the plant's civil construction
contracti representing the estimated direct and indirect foreign exchange
component; (iii) the cif cost of materials and supplies for the construction
of the railway link; (iv) the foreign exchange cost of the SOCADEI engineering
contract; and (v) the technical assistance contract after commissioning. Since
the services of SOCADEI were important during project preparation and were
contracted upon the Bank's request, it is recommended that the Bank finance
the SOCADEI contract retroactively from May 1, 1975 up to a maximum of
US$300,000.



- 25 -
5.22      The disbursement schedule for Bank financed items connected with
the cement plant is given in Annex 5-10.  It is based on detailed estimates
of order placement and payment conditions in line with the expected delivery
and construction schedule.
C.  Financial Analysis
5.22      Operating Costs:  Production cost and revenue estimates are based
on the proposed product mix of 60:40 bulk and bagged Ordinary Portland cement
and a production start-up in mid-1978 gradually leading to full capacity ope-
ration by 1982. Projections in 1975 constant terms are given in Annex 5-11
and those in current terms in Annex 5-12. To reflect inflationary cost changes,
it has been assumed that local labor rates will increase by 7% p.a., other
local coste by 5% p.a. and foreign inputs by 15% p.a. in 1975-77, 10% in 1978,
8% in 1979 and 7% thereafter. In 1982, at full production of 500,000 tpy, the
Saida plant is projected to reach a direct operating cost of 55 DA/ton in
constant terms and 86 DA/ton in current terms.
5.23      These operating costs will be about 5-10% higher than those of
other new cement plants in Algeria which - having double the capacity of
Saida - realize economies of scale. However, Saida's operating costs
are 10-20% lower than those of comparable plants in Europe and North Africa
due to the low cost of fuel (gas) in Algeria. Fuel costs account for only 18%
of operating costs, as compared to 35% in European plants. However, since
ceement plants are very capital intensive, financial and depreciation charges
are high and in the case of Algeria, account for up to 65% of total production
costs. As a result, the competitiveness of Algerian cement plants is more
sensitive to changes in capital costs than fuel charges. For the cost struc-
ture of the Saida plant, an increase of fuel prices of 70% is equivalent to a
10% increase in capital cost.
5.24      Revenues:  In line with Algeria's pricing policy for building mate-
rials, as discussed in paras 4.21 and 4.22, it has been assumed that in future
cement prices will reflect the cement industry's average unit cost (excluding
excessive costs attributable to start-up problema of new plants), plus a margin
sufficient to ensure meeting of debt service obligations. Details on price
build-up and revenue calculations are given in Annex 5-12. By the early 1980s
this policy is expected to result in a domestic price structure comparable
to prices prevailing in most Western European countries, where, on the average,
at present plants have substantially lower depreciation and financial charges.
5.25      Financial Viability:  Financial statements for the Saida cement plant
have been projected in current terms. Although the plant will not be operated
as an autonomous unit, for accounting and management purposes its financial
results should be separated from SNMIC's overall financial performance. The
following financial agreements have been reached: (i) that SNMC will maintain
and furnish to the Bank separate accounts for the Saida plant and will also
provide the Bank with annual financial forecasts for the plant; (ii) that SNMC
will maintain a debt service coverage of 1.1 times for the Saida plant and
that the Government will, if necessary, take measures - other than provision



- 26 -
of short-term debt - to enable this coverage to be achieved; and (iii) that
SNMC will maintain a ratio of current assets to short-term liabilities for
the Saida plant of not less than 2.5:1 and that the Government will provide
funds - other than short-term debt - to enable this ratio to be achieved.
5.26      Detailed income, cash flow and balance sheet forecasts through
1988 are given in Annex 5-12 and selected items are summarized below:
Saida Plant: Selected Income Statement and Balance Sheet Items
(DA u'llion - current terms)

Net Sales                        24.0    70.4    86.0    85.0    98.0
Operating Costs                    9.8    25.7    33.5    42.0    45.9

Current ratio                      1.7     1.8      1.7     1.9      2.0
5.27      Break-even Point Analysis:  The profit break-even point of the Saida
plant in 1982, the first year of full production, would be about 180Z of
capacity. The plant is not expected to break even before 1987, the 6th year
of full production. The cash break-even point will not be reached before 1988.
Details of this analysis are contained in Annex 5-13.
5.28      Financial Rate of Return:  Particularly in a centrally-planned econony,
where state enterprises operate as agents of the Government, the financial rate
of return on a project is of only limited value since it takes no account of
the discrepancies between domestic prices and world market prices. In the case
of the relatively 8mall and costly Saida plant, the financial rate of return
is only 3.7% since prices reflect the average cement industry cost. Dbtails
of calculations and senaitivity analyses are given in Annex 5-14.
D.  Major Risks
5.29      Due to the overdesign of the plant, the technical risks are relatively
small.  However, technical problens could become critical in the unlikely
event that SNMC cannot attract and keep qualified technicians to operate the
plant at its rather remote location. Furthermore, it is likely that the
automatic control systems will not be fully operative for some time, but tech-
nically, a fully automated plant can achieve an equivalent output when con-
trolled manually or semi-automatically.



- 27 -
5.30      The major potential risk to the project lies in the question as to
whether the proposed pricing policy and financial measures, agreed
upon during negotiations, will operate effectively and whether they can serve
as a vehicle for the introduction of improved management and greater product-
ivity-in the industrial sector, despite the fact that the financial viability
of both S1MC and the Saida plant will remain during the period of SNMC' a rapid
expansion effectively dependent on the Governmentis continued financial
support.
E.   Economic Justification
5.31      Economic Rate of Return:  The economic rate of return represents the
most important criterion for rational investment planning. Despite the high
cost of the Saida plant, the economic rate of return is estimated at somewhat
above 10%. The calculations are based on an opportunity cost of importing
cement of about US$58/ton, delivered at Saida, through 1981 and about US$5Ottôn
thereafter.  Further details on prices, shadow pricing of labor and fuel and
sensitivity analyses are given in Annex 5-15.  A summary of sensitivity tests
is shown below:
Saida Plant: Economic Rate of Return - Sensitivity Tests
Case                      Description               Rate of Return
1.                 Base Case                            10.3%
2.                 Revenue Increase - 25%               13.9%
3.                 Revenue Decrease - 25%                 6.1%
4.                 Capital Cost Increase - 15%           8.7%
5.                 Operating Cost Increase - 15%         9.7%
5.32      Linkages and Employment:  While the plant creates only about 220
additional direct operating jobs, an average of 850 Algerians are likely to
be employed during the construction and erection of the plant. The indirect
employment effect downstream is difficult to quantify, but the supply of
cement will have considerable impact in the construction and service industries
as well as in the transport sector. In addition, ready availability of cement
will facilitate "autoconstruction" in the rural areas thus absorbing a certain
degree of underemployment.  While it is true that import of cement might have
a similar effect in terms of regional development, the presence of port-hand-
ling constraints makes such importation unlikely and, in any case, imported
cement would tend to be consumed in the major urban areas. The existence of
an assured cement supply in the plateau region will therefore encourage rural
cement utilization which was previously constrained by the presence of major
cement consuming centers in the north.
5.33      Foreign Exchange Effect:  Domestic production of cement in Algeria
compared to importation has two major advantages: (i) direct foreign exchange
savings; and (ii) the fact that self-sufficiency facilitates the actual phy-
sical availability of cement by eliminating the inefficiencies of port



- 28 -
handling and fluctuations in world market prices. The net foreign exchange
savings of the plant, at 1975 prices, are estimated at between US$30 and
US$35 million per year, once full production is reached, offsetting the plant's
foreign exchange cost after 6 years of capacity production. Further details
on the foreign exchange effect are shown in Annex 5-16.
5.34      Regional Development Effect:  The  regional developmental impact of
the project is linked to the Government's policy of reducing regional economic
disparities by promoting industrial and agricultural growth in the plateau
regions and in the rural south. At present, the modern, wage-earning sector
is almost entirely limited to the coast in the North. Results of this have
been wide income differentials, rural-urban drift and large-scale emigration
to France.  SNMC's Saida plant will be the Company's first cement production
unit located away from the coast and its immediate hinterland.  Compared to
imports or transhipments, the Saida plant offers transport savings of DA10/
ton. The easier availability of cement in the region south of Saida should
also facilitate implementation of the Governnent's industrial, rural develop-
ment and housing programs in that area. Details on these programs are given
in Annex 5-17.
VI.  SNC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
A.   SNC - Background
6.01      SNC was established by the Governnent in 1967 as part of a policy to
reform and organize accounting in Algeria which, hitherto, had been carried
out in an ad hoc manner with little attempt at regulation or consistency.
Although its primary function is to act as external auditor to state enter-
prises, the rudimentary development of financial and management accounting
in most companies has meant that much of SNC's work has been directed towards
meeting the preconditions for a successful audit; i.e. setting up basic
accounting systern, providing practical guidance to accounting staff and
offering management consulting services. Since it operates with a substantial
number of companies and, since, through its audit function, it has the power
to enforce changes on a continuing basis, SNC represents the most promising
vehicle for improving public sector financial responsibility.
6.02      SNC is under the tutellage of the Ministry of Finance, but enjoys
full autonomy in the acceptance and discharge of professional obligations, the
adoption and enforcement of standards, and in its own budget. During the last
three years SNC has realized a modest surplus. In the Ministry of Finance,
the Directeur de l'Inspection, who is also in charge of the Commissaires aux
Comptes (the official State Auditors), is specifically responsible for guidance
of SNC. As a result, a natural coordination exists between the Commissaires
aux Comptes and SNC; the role of the former being much more limited in the
enterprises where SNC carries out an audit.



- 29 -
6.03      SNC employs some 80 people, with a professional force of about 50,
90% of them working in the accounting and auditing sector. The typical SNC
assignment differs from traditional auditing, due to inadequacy of records
and lack of competent personnel in the 8tate enterprises. In Algeria, an audit
is only considered as a starting point to diagnose a company's financial con-
dition; it typically leads to correction and completion of accounting records,
preparation of financial statements and installation of new and more effective
accounting systems. SNC's methods are careful and rigorous though somewhat
cumbersome.  As accounting practices of enterprises improve, SNC will gra-
dually limit its intervention to conventional audits. For the meantime, how-
ever, its chief impact is to create basic accounting systems upon which suc-
cessful audits are based.
6.04      A review of the needs of industrial enterprises indicates that in
the future, SNC should increase its role as external auditor in the public
sector and should provide further assistance in (i) installation of modern
cost accounting and budgeting methods; (ii) development of internal audit
departments; (iii) automatic data processing; and (iv) application of the
new "Plan Comptable National."
B.   Program Objective and Description
6.05      The general objective of the proposed technical assistance program
is to develop SNC's capabilities in the fields of external auditing, modern
management accounting techniques and in implementing basic accounting systems.
The services SNC will provide are badly needed in Algeria and will assist
enterprises in producing proper financial statements on the basis of which
management as well as ministries can take appropriate decisions in the areas
of investment supervision, financing, pricing and cost control. As for specific
activities related to SNMC, the proposed program would aim at making SNC fully
capable of undertaking SNMC's annual audit and, it is anticipated, for assist-
ing SNMC in (i) improving its cost accounting system; (ii) establishing a
budgeting and cost control system; (iii) defining the framework and methods
for successful financial planning; and (iv) applying the new accounting system
defined by law.
6.06      The program, as presently conceived, vill be based on a 5-year
collaboration between SNC and a qualified foreign auditing and accounting
firm to be appointed in accordance with Bank guidelines.  It would include
course instruction, practical training of SNC personnel abroad, and joint
auditing/accounting operations in Algeria. Details of a suggested program
are given in Annex 6.
6.07      The cost of the program is estimated at US$7.4 million, including
fees for the foreign auditing firm, salaries and travel expenses of SNC staff
during training, and adequate provisions for price escalation but excluding
interest during execution. It is suggested that the Bank finance, under the
SNMC loan, US$5.1 million equivalent or 100% of the foreign exchange cost of
the SNC project component. It is also recommended that no guarantee fee be
charged for this portion of the loan. The Government has given assurances



- 30 -
that residual financing for the program will be available as and when neces.sary.
As a condition of effectiveness, it has been agreed that SNMC will conclude an
on-lending agreement with SNC wkhch will ensure tiat SNMC is provided with
funds to service tie relevant portion cl: the loan.
6.08      The adequate implementation of the training program will require
an increase of SNC's staff from 80 to 220 people within 5 years. Such an
increase appears possible since some 20 students are expected to graduate
annually in accounting by the end of 1975 with an increase of up to 100 per
annum within the next five years. Most of them will seek the "expert compt-
able" degree, which requires a two-year practical training in SNC and possibly
an additional five-year "service civil". Nevertheless, SNC may experience
staffing difficulties because of rigorous selection criteria and the relatively
low remuneration it offers at present. Assurances were, therefore, obtained
that SNC would make adequate arrangements to (i) recruit qualified personnel
in sufficient numbers for the program; and (ii) appoint a qualified full-time
program director not later than mid-1976.
6.09      There are certain risks attached to this program:  first, its
success depends on SNMC's ability to recruit and retain qualified Algerian
staff; second, general working conditions in Algeria are not easy. Thus, it
is possible that the relationship between SNC and the foreign consulting firm
might deteriorate after one or two years, leading to insufficient cooperation
to create the necessary technology transfer.
VII. AGREEMENTS
7.01      The Loan and Guarantee Agreements will record the following major
agreements and assurances:
A.   From the Company:
(a) that SNMC shall furnish to the Bank, according to a
mutually agreed schedule, plans for strengthening of
the Company's general accounting, financial planning,
cost accounting, budgeting and cost control capabilities
and will implement and maintain the system thereafter
(para. 2.17);
(b) that SNMC undertakes to review its prices annually
on the basis of audited financial accounts and to propose
price levels equal to the average cost of each product
or product group plus a margin to cover debt incurred
for such product or product group (para. 2.22);
(c) that SNMC will take all action within its power to
maintain sufficient current assets to meet current
liabilities as they fall due (para. 2.22);
(d) that SNMC will take all action within its power
to maintain a debt service coverage of 1.1 times
(para. 2.22);

(e)  that SNMC will furnish to the Bank a detailed cement
market study during 1978 whose proposed content will
have been discussed with the Bank (para. 4.11);
(f)  that SNMC will furnish to the Bank for discussion, and
will discuss with the Bank the proposed scope and content
of, any preparatory studies for cement expansion envisaged
prior to submission of the detailed market study under (e)
(para. 4.11);
(g) that SNMC will furnish to the Bank by March 31, 1976
a program and schedule for the distribution studies
which will have been established in consultation with
the Bank (para. 4.19);
(h)  that SNMC will construct and operate the Saida plant
with due regard to ecological and environmental
considerations and will establish and maintain a
pollution monitoring system for the plant (para. 5.07);
(i) that SNMC will employ consultants, satisfactory to the
Bank, to assist with engineering, supervision and
commissioning of the Saida plant and with carrying out
the studies to define the Company's distribution system
and to determine procedures for its implementation
(para. 5.11 and 4.19);
(j) that SNMC will make arrangements satisfactory to the
Bank, by the end of 1977, to obtain such technical
services as required for efficient operation of the
Saida plant (para. 5.12); and
(k) that SNMC will take all action within its power to maintain
for the Saida plant a debt service coverage of 1.1 times
and a ratio of current assets to short-term liabilities of
2.5:1 (para. 5.17);
(1) that the on-lending arrangement with SNC will provide
for, by June 30, 1976, appointment of a full-time
qualified director for the program and for the recruit-
ment of qualified personnel in adequate numbers for the
program (para. 6.08).
B.   From the Government:
(a) that the Government will take all steps necessary with
a view to setting SNMC's prices at levels consistent
with 7.01 A (b) above (para. 2.22);



- 32-
(b) that the Governmnent vil take st~eps - other than tbé pro-vision
of short,-term deltt - to enabl-e SMI'C to maintain the f'inanciaJ.
ratos referred to in 7.01 A~ (d) and (k) ab>ove andl to meet
its current IliabiLities a-s they faU due (para. 2.22);
(c) that the Government wili undertake ail steps necessary
to make available to SNMC ail funds required to complete
the project if there is cause to believe that the funds
available to SNMC will be inadequate (para. 3.04); and
(d) that the Government viii take ail steps necessary to
make available funds, facilities, services and other
resources necessary to enable SNC to carry out its
program (para. 6.07).
7.02      As a condition of effectiveness, the following convenant was also
agreed upon:
that SNMC and SNC shall have entered into an agreement for
the on-lending of that portion of the loan allocated to the SNC
technical assistance program and shall have ensured that SNMC
vill be provided with funds as required to cover debt service
obligations on that portion of the loan (para. 6.07).
7.03      Based on the foregoing assurances and agreements received, the
project represents a suitable basis for a loan to SNMC of US$46 million
equivalent for 15 years including a 4 years grace period.

SNMC CMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
TECHNICAL TERMS AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION
A.  Technical Terms
The following is a list of the nost common technical terms used in
the cement industry:
CEMENT         A hydraulic binding material in the for. of an amorphous
powder consisting of tri- and bicalcium silicates, tricalcium
aluminates and tetracalclum alumino-ferrites.  Cement is pro-
duced by heating a mix of rav materials (limestone, clay and
sand) which transforme into cement clinker through incomplete
fusion at a temperature of about 1450'C. Clinker is ground
together vith suall quantities of gypsum, which acts as a
retarder, controlling the setting time of the resulting cement.
The most cormon cement types are:
Ordinary Portland Cement used in ordinary concrete
structures.
Rapid lardening Cernent used in structures requiring early
strength which is achieved by quick setting of the cement.
Sulphate Resisting Cement used in structures exposed to sea
water or sulfurous materials.
low Heat Cement used in structures of massive concrete blocks
(e.g., dams) to avoid overheating during setting.
Superfine Cement used for special structures requiring high
strengths and for prestressed concrete.
Portland Blast Furnace Cerent prepared, in part, from blast
furnace slag and used in ordinary cement structures.
Oil Well Cement used in the construction of oil vells (for
lining).
Mixed Cement used for masonry work (mortar) and small concrete
structures.
CLINKER        Clinkerization is the process of burning to produce incomplete
fusion in the material heated. Less than one-third of the
material heated becomes fluid. The output of this process is
a rocky material called clinker. Clinker is ground with sm8all
additions of gypsum to produce cement.

COMBUSTION AIR       Used with fuel to fire the kiln.
Primary Air is the small amount of air injected into the
kiln together vith fuel under high pressure.
Secondary Air, which constitutes the major part of combus-
tion air, is provided by fans and is heated up to about
800°C in the cooler prior to flowing into the kiln.
COOLER               Vessel in which hot clinker leaving the kiln is cooled.
The cooler is designed as heat exchanger heating the
secondary combustion air. Three major types of coolers
are in use:
Air Quenching Grate Cooler: a moving grate, slightly
inclined on which the clinker falls from the kiln to be
cooled by fans under the gate.
Planetary Cooler: this consists of 8 to 14 cylindrical
tubes (incorporated into the shell of the kiln) into which
the clinker to be cooled falls.
Rotary Cooler: (Internal Cooler) cylinder of same con-
struction as the rotary kiln and located under the firing
hood. It rotates on tires.
CRUSHING             Ra  materials are normally quarried in the form of large
lumps and blocks and must be subjected to a reduction in
size before being further processed into a slurry or raw
meal which in turn is fed to the kiln. The reduction of
raw materials from a maximum admissible size to an aggre-
gate of a specified size is achieved in a crusher. Major
known types are:
Roll crusher: which mills the materials particularly
suited for moist material liable to cause clogging.
Jsw crusher: which knocks into pieces the material
particularly suited for large size lumps.
Impact crusher: such as hammer crusher and hammer mill
ideally suited for raw materials of cement manufacture if
these are not too moist or too abrasive. This type allows
drying during the crushing process.
Impeller crusher:  which hits the materials against the
bars of a gull and overcomes impact resistance of
material.
Gyratory crusher: which rotates the materials around
a cone in a continuous reduced spaee suitable for hard
materials which are not too moist, and therefore, liable
to clogging.
DUST COLLECTION      Dust pollution has been a serious environmental problem
posed by cement plants as dust is generated at nearly
every stage of the production process. Furthermore, large
quantities of emitted dust also represent lost production.
Appropriated filters have been developed:
Bag filter: A series of chambers with bags of nylon or
other material installed, which dedust the airstream loaded
with dust particles. A system of valves permits reversal



ANNEX 1
Page 3
of the aîr stream in a particular chamber to clean the bag
and collect the accumulated dust. Only suitable if tem-
peratures of the airstream and particles do not exceed
1000 to 1500C.
Cyclone: It consiats of an upper cylindrical portion and
a lower funnel shaped portion. The airstream enters the
cyclonic chamber tangentially at the upper portion. Through
centrifugal force, dust particles strike the vall of the
chamber and slide down to the discharge opening of the
funnel. The cleaned airstream leaves the cyclone through
a central outlet pipe. Cyclone's efficiency can be en-
hanced by arranging several units in line (multicyclone
batteries).
Gravel filter:  A filter consisting of a series of chambers
filled with gravel.  The dust-laden airstream flows through
the filter pockets thereby unloading the dust particles.
Cleaning of the filter is by reversal of airstream and
simultaneous stirring of the gravel bed. This filter is
suitable for temperatures above 500'C and, therefore, often
used for waste gases of clinker cooler and kiln.
Electrostatic filter: Electrostatic dust precipitation
makes use of the forces generated in electrically charged
bodies while the dust laden gas passes between two elec-
trodes connected to high tension (30,000 to 80,000 V).
The positive electrode collects the dust particles which
have received a negative charge, thereby neutralizing them.
Dust must be removed from time to time from the electrode.
Optimum operation is achieved at temperatures of 90' to
180'C and 15-30% moisture.  Therefore, a spraying tower
for cooling the gas and moistening the particles is often
employed with the electrostatic filter.
GRINDING            Raw Grinding:  Reduction of raw material size to specified
fineness by means of a mill.
Wet Process: The hard materials (limestone) are subjected
to preliminary crushing and soft materials (clay) are
stirred with vater to form a slurry.  Then both materials,
mixed in the correct proportions, are ground to fine slurry.
Dry Process: Crushed raw materials are dried and ground
into fine raw meal powder.
Cement Grinding:  The preparation of cement powder from
clinker and gypsum by means of a mill. The fineness of
grinding (Blaine value) has a significant influence on the
properties of the resulting cement.
Grindability of a material depends on its properties, such
as structure, cleavability, brittleness and hardness.



ANNX 1
Page 4
HOMOGENIZATION      The thorough and complete blending of various raw materials
to prepare a homogenous mixture.  This can be achieved in
storage silos in which the pre-homogenized mix is stirred
and mised by a blover (dry process). Wet process plants
use slurry tanks with installed rotating arms to achieve
homogenization. The tanks serve simultaneously as storage
facilities.
KILN                A vessel in which the raw meal is burnt to be chemically
transformed into clinker (clinkering) at temperatures of
around 1450°C.  A Shaft kiln typically with a throughput
of between 50 and 250 metric tons per day, formerly
operated on a discontinuous basis using the dry process.
New developments, using pelletization techniques, operate
continuously. A Rotary kiln, a large cylindrical steel
tube inclined from the horizontal by 1 to 3 degrees, slowly
revolves, supported by tires and rollers. It is suitable
for wet as vell as dry processes and is typically used in
modern large-scale plants with throughputs of 1,500 to
4,000 tpd.
MILL                Raw Mill:  Grinds raw materials.  The types employed in
modern cement plants require prior crushing of raw mate-
rials. The most common type is the tube mill, a horizontal
cylindrical steel shell, equipped with lining and grinding
media (e.g., cast steel balls - Ball mill) and which rotates
at between 14 and 20 r.p.m. The free fall (tumbling) of the
grinding media provides for the impact by which the material
is ground. Suitable both for wet and dry processes.
Compound Tube Mills: (or combination mills, compartment
mills) have two or more compartments, separated by slotted
diaphragms and filled with different types of grinding media,
to achieve successively finer grinding.
Closed Circuit Mill with centrifugal separator and bucket
elevators. The material ground in this tube mill is con-
veyed in a steady flow by a bucket elevator to a separator,
vithin which oversize particles are rejected by centrifugal
action and returned to the millfeed.
Air-swept Mill: Tube mill or ring mill, the output of which
is continuously assorted by an air separator. Oversize
particles are returned to the millfeed.
Ring Mill: Grinding elements (balls or rollers) roll under
pressure on a circular path (the grinding ring). Variations
of this type are spring pressure or spring-loaded mills,
centrifugal ring ball mills, centrifugal suspended roller
mills, edge mills.
Cement Mill: (or Clinker Mill), a tube mill which refines
the mix of clinker and gypsum to cement powder.  Compound
mille vith centrifugal separator are commonly in use.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
Wash Mill: A concrete tank wvth installed rotating arms to
break up and stir a soft raw material (clay). The resulting
slurry is screened to remove stones or other impurities
prior to grinding. It is used in dry as vell as vet pro-
cess plants.
PREHEATING SYSTEM   is a heat exchange system designed to recover the caloric
content of the kiln exhaust gases with which to heat up
the raw meal.
Grate Preheater: The preheating system of the semi-dry
process, consisting of a traveling grate which moves raw
material pellets through a drying and a preheating chamber.
Suspension Preheater: The preheating system of the dry
process consisting of one to four stages of simple or twin
cyclones on top of each other. The lower cyclones are used
as heat exchangers, the top cyclones as dust collectors.
PREHOMOGENICATION, Storage facility which is also used for prehomogenization
PLANT                or blending of raw material.
RAW MEAL            A homogeneous powder consisting of the ground raw mix.  It
is used to feed the kiln to produce clinker (using the dry
process).
RAW SLURRY           Kiln-feed for the wet process kiln.
B. Process Description
1.        The cement production process is based on three basic raw materials--
limestone, clay and sand. These raw materials with a maximum specified block
size (blasting) are reduced to aggregates of pre-specified maximum dimensions
in the crushing department and stored; pre-homogenization is achieved through
intermediate storage. After proportioning according to weight and volume, the
raw materials are ground to a fine raw meal powder in the raw mill. The raw
meal is homogenized and then transported, via conveyors, to the kiln depart-
ment. Within the kiln, heat induces a clinkering process, in which an incomplete
fusion of the raw meal takes place. This clinker is then ground together with
a small percentage of gypsum to produce cement, which is shipped either in
bulk or in bags.
2.        Three types of processes have been developed; the wet, dry and
semi-dry processes.
The Wet Process
3.        The raw materials, being wet in the natural state, are mixed with
water to create a slurry, whose titration (quantity ratio) can be controlled
easily. By means of pumps and ducts the slurry is introduced into the kiln,



ANNEX 1
Page 6
where the clinkering takes place. Energy consumption of the process is high
(between 1350 to 2200 kcal/kg of clinker), since more than a liter of water
must be vaporized within the kiln per kg of clinker.
4.        The main advantage of the process is its simplicity, easy operat-
ional control and maintenance. However, for raw materials with a natural
humidity of below 10 to 15%, the dry or semi-dry process usually operates more
economically because of lower energy consumption, even though investment costs
for the wet process are normally lower than for the comparable dry process
equipment. The recent increases in fuel prices have increased the upper limit
of humidity for the dry process applicability to about 15%.
The Dry Process
5.        This process leaves the raw material in its natural state of humidity
up to the raw mill stage; vithin the ravmill the material is ground and simul-
taneously dried to a specified limit. The dry raw meal powder is homogenized
mechanically or by means of blowers, then introduced at the top stage of a pre-
heating system. Working as a heat exchanger, the system preheats the material
by recovering the caloric value of the kiln exhaust gases whose flow is counter
to that of the material (Counter flow system). Thus, part of the calcination
takes place in the preheater, vith the final clinkerization taking place in the
kiln. Within the cooler, the secondary air recovers heat from the clinker,
thereby cooling it down.
6.        The intricate thermic equilibrium stage in the raw mill - preheater
- kiln - cooler section allows a total thermic consumption for the dry process
plants of 750 to 950 kcal/kg of clinker. Nevertheless, the savings in fuel
are, in part, outweighed by disadvantages such as a more complicated process
flow, which is sometimes difficult to control and to maintain. Continuous
and automated sampling for control is necessary. Investment costs are usually
higher than for the vet process, despite the use of a short kiln (about half
the length of the vet process kiln).
7.        The industry has developed several variations of the dry process,
using long or short kilns cyclonic preheaters of one to four stages with simple
or twin/type cyclones vithin the stages. The decision as to the type of dry
process to be selected is a function of: (i) the supplier (some of the varia-
tions are patented); (ii) the chemical components of the raw materials and
fuel (particularly their level of harmful alkalies and chlorides); (iii) fuel
economy; and (iv) initial investment costs and operating costs, particularly
control and maintenance.
The Semi-Dry Process
8.        In this process the raw material is pelletized in a balling drum by
means of between 12 to 20% of vater. The wet pellets with a diameter of about
1.5 cm discharge drom the drum directly into a hopper on the feed end of a tra-
velling grate preheater. The grate conveys the pellets through a drying zone
of about 300'C, then through a preheating zone of about 875°C. Kiln exhaust
gases flow partly via a bypase through the drying zone, partly directly through



ANNEX 1
Page 7
the preheating zone. After passing through the preheating chamber, the hot
pellets are stripped from the travelling grate and cascade into the short kiln
where they are heated further to clinkerize at about 1450°C. The pelletized
clinker is then cooled over a grate cooler.
9.        The thermic consumption of this process is about 850 kcal/kg of
clinker, thus comparable to the dry process. Hovever, the process is more
expensive both in initial investment and operating costs, as it contains many
moving parts. Its suitability is confined to raw materials which lend them-
selves to pelletization. Its advantage lies in the stability of the process,
the accuracy with which it can be adjusted and controlled, and the removal
of harmful alkalies and chlorides from the raw material in process, which is
achieved by collecting the dust from the bypass in a cyclone dust collector.
The resulting cement has, therefore, a lower alkali content than can be
obtained vith dry process equipment.

SNMC CEMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
THE ALGERIAN ECONOMY AND THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. The Four-Year Development Plans
1.        Algeria's economic development programs have been embodied in three
Plans (1967-69, 1970-73 and the current 1974-77 Plan) which, in this centrally
planned economy, are mandatory policy and strategy statements of the Govern-
ment.
2.        In 1966, Algeria's Revolutionary Council defined the fundamental
objectives which the country intended to pursue during the period ending 1980.
These are: (i) to expand and organize the productive base enabling the economy
to reach, by about 1980, a stage of self-sustained growth with full employ-
ment; (ii) to achieve economic independence, which implies that the country
would rely first on its own resources for development, although international
economic relations would be expanded and diversified; and (iii) to improve
income distribution, particularly among regions. These objectives, and the
strategy which has evolved towards their implementation, take into account
the country's physical and socio-economic potential, and form a set of coherent
choices to which the leadership is deeply committed.
The Second 4-Year Development Plan (1974-77) _/
3.        The current Plan (1974-77) is ambitious, but in line with Algeria's
objectives of achieving rapid economic independence, primarily through the
creation of a strong industrial sector. Five specific goals are highlighted
in the Plan:
(a)  the achievement of maximum production for domestic consumption
and for export;
(b)  the reduction of bottlenecks resulting in investment slippages
through increased emphasis on training of management and
skilled labor;
(c)  the increase of employment, especially through regional
programs (industry and rural development);
(d) the improvement of standards of living through special
urban programs and expanded social benefits; and
(e) the achievement of a better economic balance between regions.
1/   The 1967-69 Plan was called a "Pre-Plan".



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
4.        These objectives have been translated into targets, including (i) a
volume of investment, over the Plan period, of at least DA 85 billion at 1973
prices and possibly DA 110 billion, (ii) and an annual growth rate of GDP (in
real terms) of at least 11%, (iii) the creation of 45,000 new jobs outside
of the agricultural sector, and (iv) an average increase in private consump-
tion of 11% p.a. The prospects of achieving these targets are heavily
dependent on Algeria's balance of payment prospects, and on the development
of the absorptive capacity of the economy. It is likely that the improvement
registered in Algeria's balance of paynents in 1974, as a result of the oil
price increase, will be followed by a deterioration in 1975, which vill
probably be more pronounced than was expected in the 1974-77 Plan. This
development would be due mainly to a substantial short-fall of anticipated
receipts from crude oil and natural gas exports. It is therefore likely
that Algeria will have to opt for a significantly slover growth of investment
and private consumption than was foreseen in the 1974-77 Plan, beginning in
1976.
5.        The authorities will have to overcome considerable additional
constraints, some of them inherited from the past. First, in most sectors,
hnvestment will have to more than double in real terma as compared with that
of the 1970-73 Plan. Algeria's ability to implement and absorb such rapid
growth is questionable, judged by past results. Second, the considerable
difference in growth rates between various sectors could result in serioua
structural imbalances, income disparities, and bottlenecks in the implementa-
tion of investments. Third, the regional objectives of providing better
living conditions (employment, income distribution, social services) are
unlikely to be fully achieved unless special programs (e.g. training,
administrative reforms) are initiated rapidly. Finally, despite the reforms
of the financial sector in 1971, improvements or changes are still needed
in this area, such as the establishment of a more rational pricing system
and the strengthening of financial institutions to enable them to play a
more active role in the execution and supervision of investments.
B. lndustry
6.        During 1967-71, all means of industrial production were gradually
transferred to the public sector, foreign holdings nationalized and State
Enterprises created. Each State Enterprise was given control over a given
sub-sector. At present, the 24 largest State Enterprises own nearly 90%
of all industrial fixed assets, while private enterprises act for less
than 5% of such assets. Most State Enterprises are very large and account
individually, in many instances (such as petrochemicals, steel, etc.) for
the whole industrial sub-sector. During 1966-74, the industrialization
strategy was aimed, in decreasing order of priority, at the creation of:
(i) heavy basic industries (hydrocarbon, steel, plastic, fertilizers); (ii)
processing industries (metal electrical products, tractors, construction
materials, etc.); and (iii) light consumer goods industries.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
7.        Given the absence on an industrial base in 1965, the main objective
was and to a large extent continues to be rapid physical build-up of a new
production structure. In adopting and implementing this policy, the authorities
deliberately relegated criteria of returns on investments, efficiency in
production and pricing policies to second place. Notwithstanding waste and
inefficiencies and, perhaps more importantly, serious imbalances in the produc-
tive capacities of various industries, the structure of the economy has over
the past ten years changed radically as a result of this policy.
8.        Industrial production over the period of the 1970-73 Plan reached
88% of the planned targets, which, given the constraints of the economy,
was quite an achievement. Hydrocarbon and food products reached, or exceeded,
the targets of the Plan. However, other manufacturing industries were lag-
ging badly, especially two industries of crucial importance to Algeria's
development: construction materials (4.4% annual growth, instead of 14%
foreseen in the Plan) and metal and electrical products (6.6% vs. 25.5%).
As regards investments, the lagging performance in these and other fields
resulted, in turn, in considerable delays and cost overruns. At the end of
the Plan, more than half of the investments supposed to be completed were
still under construction since their implementation periods had been seriously
underestimated.
9.        Both production and investment difficulties are the result of
partially inherited slow and complex administrative procedures, technical
difficulties, inadequate infrastructure (ports, railways and telecommunica-
tions), and lack of management and skilled labor. The last aspect, in
particular, remains a major constraint, in spite of the considerable progress
made in education and training. In some instances, price controls have com-
pounded these difficulties through their effect on the financial position of
enterprises.
10.       Under the 1974-77 Plan, 48% of planned investment will be for the
industrial sector. Some key aspects are:
(a) Continued rapid growth of basic and heavy industries, using
Algeria's natural resources. The bulk (63%) of projected
investments in the industrial sector over the period will be
allocated to the hydrocarbon industry (DA 10.5 billion,
or 41% of total industrial investments), chemical
industry (DA 4 billion) and mining (DA 1.1 billion).
(b) An acceleration of growth of transformation industries such
as metal, mechanical and electrical industry, building
materials, chemicals and wood processing (35% on industrial
investments), and increased production of consumer products.
(c) The launching of a Regional Industrial Development Program
(RIDP) for smaller, decentralized projects. For that purpose,
about DA 1 billion is planned to finance investment in some
500-odd projects.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 4
The Plan aims at a considerable growth of value added (18% for processing
industries, 14% for mining and energy), corresponding to a doubling of
industrial output in four years. At the same time, 83,000 new jobs are to
be created. While such growth targets may not be reached fully, t:he consider-
able efforts planned in training, edu,:ation, and housing, the new stress
placed on consumer products, and the efforts to simplify the administrative
apparatus, should give the Plan's exe:ution more of a chance of coming close
to its targets than the previous one :.had.

SNMC CEMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
THE PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SYSTEM IN ALGERIA
A.   Introduction
1.        Following independence, achieved in 1962, Algeria opted for a
one-party system and a reconstruction of society along socialist lines.
An extensive development effort was initiated to consolidate economic
independence, with priority given to industrialization and to the inte-
grated development of the economy under firm control of the State. An
important aspect of this strategy vas the creation of a large number of
public enterprises, combining production and distribution functions and
often enjoying a monopoly over foreign trade. As modern industrial,
financial and trade activities vere gradually taken over or controlled
by the central authorities, particularly after 1965 when President Houari
Boumedienne and the Revolutionary Council came into pover, the public
sector came to dominate the economy. The share of public investment in
total fixed capital formation increased from 55 percent in 1966 to over
95 percent in 1972, as investments vere initiated by the Central Govern-
ment, public enterprises and, recently, by regional public authorities.
The monopolistic position of many public enterprises in foreign trade nov
covers about 80 percent of the total value of imports. On the domestic
market, however, a certain degree of competition exists from private
enterprises, though these mainly consist of small firms with activities
related to textiles, shoes and leather. Public enterprises, including
mixed enterprises with majority participation by the public sector, nov
number about 100, with 37 enterprises of an industrial character accounting
for over 60 percent of industrial employment.  Each branch of industry is
led by a public enterprise responsible for the bulk of manufacturing and
acting as an autonomous business entity with the aim of producing a surplus
for contribution to the Algerian economy. However, product prices are
agreed on with the Ministry of Commerce. Salaries are largely controlled
and investment plans are approved by the Central Govermment.
B.   Control
2.        Public enterprises operate under the guidance and supervision of
a Ministry of Control (ministere de tutelle). In the case of public enter-
prises of an industrial nature, this role is usually assumed by the Ministry
of Industry and Energy. The control authority defines the general policy
guidelines for the enterprise and sees to their implementation in the pub-
lic interest. It approves organizational changes in the enterprise, makes
appointments to senior positions, determines annual and multi-annual invest-
ment programa before their transmittal to the Plan Secretariat and deter-
mines the allocation of profits, in cooperation with the Ministry of
Finance.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 2
3.        Financial control of public enterprises is exercised by the
Ministry of Finance, the Development Bank (BAD) 1/ and the primary banks.
The Ministry appoints an accountant (commissaires aux comptes) to each
enterprise to check monthly and annual statements. Provisional state-
ments of accounts are submitted to the Ministry before the end of each
year. These are used to review past performance and to determine the
level of annual contributions to the State budget, subscriptions to the
Treasury bonds 2/ and working capital requirements for the following year.
Each public enterprise is assigned to one primary bank (one of three state-
owned deposit banks) by the Government.  The primary bank follows closely
the current and investment operations of the enterprise, and must approve
the company's quarterly and annual operating budgets, which it also helps
to establish. Long-term financing for investments approved by the Planning
Secretariat is provided by BAD or foreign banking institutions. Foreign
loans are also subject to control by BAD and the prlmary banks.
C.   Management and Organization
4.        Each public enterprise is headed by a Director General, appointed
by the Government on the nomination of the control ministry. The Director
General is responsible for the general management of the enterprise. In
theory, he is assisted by a management council and a committee for guidance
and control as defined in the "Charte et Code de la Gestion Socialiste des
Enterprises."   The Management Council (Conseil de Direction), chaired by
the Director General and composed of a number of his closest associates
and one or two worker representatives, is kept regularly informed of the day-
to-day operations of the enterprise and decides on a number of matters con-
cerning the economic and financial aspects of the enterprise and its
organization, as well as the status and renumeration of personnel.
D.   Worker Participation
5.        The "Charte et Code de la gestion socialiste des entreprises" vas
passed in 1971-72 and the principles of worker participation are nov prac-
tised in selected public enterprises. The participation of workers in the
management of the enterprise is provided for by a workers' assembly of
seven to 20 members elected from among all workers. The workers' assembly,
which meets for two ordinary sessions per year, but can be convened for
extraordinary meetings, has theoretically extensive povers. It offers
advice and recommendations on development and investment plans and on the
provisional accounts which have to be submitted to the assembly. It is
1/   Banque Algerienne de Developpement.
2/   Public enterprises do not have financial resources of their own, but
transfer their reserves and amortization funds annually to the Treasury
in the form of subscriptions of long- and medium-term interest-bearing
bonds (see para. 8).



ANNEX 2-2
Page 3
consulted on important reforms concerning the structure of the enterprise
and the status of vorkers. The workers' assembly is associated with the
development of personnel policy and vocational training programe. It par-
ticipates in decisions on the allocation of the financial results and
profits distributed to workers. In theory, it has general control over
the management of the enterprise and the execution of programs. To this
end it issues an annual report in which it reviews the company s development.
6.        Permanent commissions prepare matters to be taken up by the
workers' assembly and represent vorker interests in between sessions of
the assembly. Commissions can be set up for economic, financial, social
and cultural affairs, personnel and vocational training, discipline, and
security matters. Commission members are designated by the workers'
assembly, except for the commission for disciplinary matters and the
commission for hygiene and security which are composed of an equal number
of representatives of the workers' assembly and management.
E.   Financial Structure
7.        The financing of public enterprises vas reorganized during 1971.
Up till then, the funds for a public enterprise's investment vere mobilized
either by the enterprise itself or by the Treasury, and such transactions
were not necessarily coordinated. The major component8 of the reform were:
(a) centralization of financial decisions through
investment approval by the Planning Secretariat,
the "ministere de tutelle" and BMD;
(b) strengthening of the banking system's control
function;
(c) financing of all investments by credit vithout
equity provision;
(d) channelling of the public enterprises' internal
cash generation into "development bonds" and
contributions to the Government budget and con-
tributions to workers.
The purpose of the reform vas to (i) bring the total amount of
public investment in line with the economy's financing capacity and (ii)
to ensure that adequate financial resources are allocated to priority
investments.
8.        Development Bonds.  Public enterprises no longer have financial
resources of their own to finance new investments. The counterpart of
their depreciation allowances has to be deposited with the Treasury in
the form of 5-10 year development bonds bearing interest of 5 percent.
These bonds can be used for the repayment of long-term debts. In prac-
tice, only well-established public enterprises have invested in bonds,
whereas others have to use internal cash generation to cover debt service.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 4
9.        Contribution to the Government Budget.  The public enterprises'
special contributions to the Government budget are analogous to the divi-
dends that a company pays to its shareholders. The contribution is levied
by the Gavernment on after-tax profits, and is determined annually by the
Treasury on the basis of a company's sales, profit and investment level.
In case of loss, structural difficulty or force majeure, an enterprise
is exempt from payment or pays a reduced amount.
10.       Contribution to Workers.  The system acknowledges the principle,
that workers should participate in an enterprise's net profit after taxes.
The form and amount of such contributions are still within the Government.
11.       The Role of the Banking System.  Each public enterprise is per-
mitted to deal with only three banks: (i) BAD, which grants long-term
credit for investments and, in turn, draws on Treasury Funds; (ii) a
primary bank, which grants short- and medium-term credit directly from
its own funds and handles all banking transactions for the company, including
the disbursement of BAD's long-term loans; and (iii) the Central Bank, for
foreign currency transactions which have been approved by the primary bank.
Foreign credits can be contracted by the primary bank, BAD, or the Goverument
on behalf of public enterprises (or by the enterprise itself), but they are
channeled only through the concerned primary bank.
12.       The reform has decentralized control of public enterprises to some
extent, since the Treasury no longer finances investments directly, but may
intervene only if the enterprise shows losses or chronic liquidity problems.
Such an intervention may take the form of a "restructuration", an "lassainisse-
ment" or an increase of working capital. An "assainissement" restructures
the enterprise's financial obligations in line with its investment, production
and sales programs in order to enable it to operate on a financially viable
basis. A "restructuration", comprising debt rescheduling and interest rate
adjustments, is possible if the debt service coverage of a public enterprise
becomes insufficient. Several "restructurations" have been approved re-
cently, since many public enterprises show chronic liquidity problems.
There are several reasons for this situation: (1) price levels have not
been adjusted regularly to reflect higher costs and import prices, (ii)
long-term investment has been financed by credits which are not in line wvth
depreciation charges and (iii) investment costs for new projects have been
underestimated and cost overruns had to be financed temporarily by short-term
credits until official authorization was received.
13.       A note of caution:  the public enterprise system is still in a
dynamic and experimenting phase. It is continuously adapted to new
experiences and ideas, so that it is difficult to give a picture of
its functioning which is not outdated.

SNMC CEMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
SNMC - ORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGERIAL STRUCTURE
A.   Background
1.        SNMC - Societe Nationale de Materiaux de Construction was estab-
lished in December 1967 as a public enterprise (i) to promote the develop-
ment of the domestic construction materiab industry and (ii) to manufacture
and import building materials. The basis for SNMC's operation are 51 former
privately owned production units, and their distribution networks, which were
nationalized between 1968-1972 as follows:
May 20, 1968:        Plaster factory at Ghardaia; brick and tile plant
at Mers-El-Kebir, Roseville and El-Harrach, asbestos
cement unit at Kouba, factories for concrete pipes
at Chabat El-Leham, El-Hakjar and El Harrach, and
Oued-Rhiou.
June 12, 1968:       Cement factories in Zahana and Point-Pescade.
July 23, 1968:       Distribution agencies in the east; brick and tile
factories at Didouche Mourad and 4-Chemins-Bedjaia;
ceramic tile factory at Annaba and Bedjaia.
October 22, 1968:   Ceramic tile factory at Ibn-Ziad.
May 3, 1969:         Concrete production unit at Oued Fodda, brick
factories at Ammi-Mlokhtar de Ghazaouet and
Mers-el-Kebir, plaster factory at Fleurus.
July 25, 1969:       Brick factories in Bechar and Mostaganem.
August 12, 1969:    Brick and tile factory in Tiaret, asbestos cement
unit in Zahana, concrete plant CMCO in Oran and a
quarry in Mers-el-Kebir.
October 21, 1969:   Prefabrication unit in Hamiz and 4 quarries in
Annaba.
September 1, 1970: Plaster unit in Champ des Chenes, brick and tile
factories in Boudouaou (Gare, Bouzegza, Colonel
Amirouche), Mezzaias, Skikda, El-Khemis Douba and
Baba-Ali.
October 30, 1970:   Concrete production unit in El-Asnam.



ANNEX 2-4
Page 2
May 23, 1972:        Concrete production unit in Oued Smar, brick and
tîle factories in Emir Abdelkader, Baraki, Meftah,
Hadjar, Boufarîk, Rouiba, Reghaïa, El Arraf and
Dertradj, and Omar.
SNMC obtained the import monopoly for building materîals in 1969 and has been
responsible for imports of sanitary equipment since 1971. At present, SNMC
operates some 70 plant units (Annex 2-3) and employs nearly 15,000 people
(Annex 2-4, p. 4).
B.   Organizational Structure
2.        SNMC operates under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Indus-
try and Energy. As "ministere de tutelle," it nominates the management council
and determines the strategy and orientation of SNMC by approving annual
and multi-annual investment plans, techno-economic studies for each invest-
ment project and the Company's annual budget. The role of the other ministries
vis-a-vis SNMC is more specific. The Planning Secretariat influences the scope
and content of the Company's annual and multi-annual investment programs, and
gives the final approval for each investment project ("individualisation des
projects").  The Ministry of Commerce authorizes annually SNMC's import
quotas of building materials and the Company's own import needs for foreign
equipment and spare parts. The Ministry of Commerce also controls the price
commission, which fixes SNMC's prices. The Ministry of Finance (i) appoints
the Company's "Commissaires aux Comptes,", (il) authorizes all loans carrying
a Government guaranty, and (iii) in coordination with the Ministry of Indus-
try and Energy, approves SNMC's annual budget and the distribution of the
Company's profit.
3.        SNMC has been reorganîzed several times since its creation.  In
1972, the Company hired DMP-Cresap, McCorm!ek and Paget, a British consulting
firm to review the organizational structure. The report, however, did not
propose essential changes, but merely emphasized the strengthening of the
financial control units on the production and distribution level. A chart
of SNMC's organizational set-up as of May 1975 is given inr-Annex2-5.
4.        Although SNMC's latest reorganization created one Department in
eoutrol ef operations SNMC's organîzat1on remains characterized by the
strIct sepàratton of production and distribution functions. The production
units receive monthly production targets as well as shipping orders, i.e.,
a production manager has no authority to market output but his sole respon-
sibility is to send specific quantities to predetermined distribution centers
and warehouses.
5.        Implementation of new projects is the responsibility of the Engi-
neering Department. After project completion, it is transferred to the
Production Department. For the final phase of project preparation and actual
project execution, however, a special SNMC project team is appointed which



ANNEX 2-4
Page 3
handles all technical, financial and administrative questions which might
arise. The Economic Planning Department in coordination with the technical
project team prepares the techno-economic study which is the basis for
project approval by the Ministry of Industry and Energy and the Planning
Secretariat ("individualisation de projet"). Serious coordination problems
did arise in the past between the Technical, Economic Planning and Finance
Departments during the planning and follow-up of investments. They are
compounded by the general lack of staff and the geographical separation
between the Technical Department and the other Departments in Algiers. To
overcome at least some of the coumunication problems, a special finance
division was created vithin the Technical Department whose main responsibi-
lity should be investment cost budgeting and control.

ALGERIA
SNMC EXPANSION PROJECT
SNMC - FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
ASSUMPTIONS
1.          The financial projections for SNMC, presented in this annex,
are based on data provided by SNMC's Financial Department, both before
and during negotiations, amended in line with Bank experience, except
where noted below. To reflect the Company's expected cash flow position,
all figures are in current prices.
2.          Since it was not possible to obtain a full copy of the 1975
SNMC Budget, financial projections have been limited to the income
statement and to the Company's sources and applications of funds.l/ In
addition, it should be noted that the projections exclude the impact
of importation under SNMC's monopoly.
3.          Net Sales:  The cement price used in the projections is the
price required to cover full costs in the cement sector plus a sufficient margin
to cover debt service 1.1 times for the sector. Prices for other products
are in line with present SNMC policy which is in line with agreements
received from the Government and SNMC. After 1980, however, it is assumed
that cement prices will not fall with declining depreciation and financial
charges but will hold at 180 DA/ton for 1981.
4.          Operating Costs:  Operating costs for the cement sector are
based on anticipated unit costs for the Saida plant (Annex 5-11), applied to
SNMC's total production.  These estimates are about 10% more conservative
than those put forward by SNMC.
5.          Investments:  Figures for cement investment other than the
Saida plant are those provided by SNMC modified in line with Bank estimates
of physical and price contingencies as shown below:

1974 balance sheet and known investments in 1975 - have been included in
the Main Report (para 2.23).

In addition, DA 78 million has been allocated for maintaining Zahana I in
operation after 1980 and DA 39 million for necessary pollution control at
Pointe-Pescade. Replacement expenses are in line with those used in projections
for the Saida plant (Annex 5-12).
6.          Change in Working Capital:  Working Capital for SNMC is based on
one month's sales for cash, three monthsl sales for accounts receivables, one
month's costs for payable and inventory as a percentage of total cost of goods
sold as prevailed in 1974.

A.   THE SUPPLY OF CEMENT IN ALGERIA
I.   Historic Domestic Production
1.        SNMC was formed in December 1968 as the monopoly producer and im-
porter of cement in Algeria and, shortly after its foundation, it took over
the country's three major cement producing plants which had previously been
owned and operated by private French interests. These were:
(a)  Pointe-Pescade:  Located 8 km from Algiers, with an effective
annual capacity of 450,000 tons. The plant first entered
production in 1914, although its present equipment was
installed in the 1950s.
(b) Meftah I: A very small plant, also located in the Algiers
region, had an annual capacity of only 50,000 tons with
output restricted entirely to CM 250. 1/ It has since
been closed.
(c) Zahana 1: Started production in 1948. Its original
equipment is reaching the end of its useful life, although
it was converted to natural gas in 1964. Eighty-five
percent of its output is CPA 325 and the remainder is
ASTM water-resistant (Prise-Mer) cement primarily for
barrage works. It is located in the western region, 2/
50 km inland from Oran.
_/ The abbreviations used in this annex to refer to cements are: CM 250 -
Ciment de Maconnerie 250, used for masonry and stonework: CPA 325 -
Ciment Portland Artificiel 325, ordinary Portland cement for general,
non-specific application; ASTM IV, vater-resistant cement for irrigation
and barrage works.
2/   The use of the terms Eastern, Western and Central Regions should not be
taken to indicate any more than a merely heuristic distinction, although
they do approximately coincide with the colonial administrative divisions
of, respectively, Constantinois, Oranie and Algerois. For purposes of
analysing the market for cement, and SNMC's distribution network, such
a distinction is from time to time helpful since the road and rail networkb
both are predominantly located in thè Northern litoral with North-South
spurs roughly coinciding with the three regions. Each region may be
understood to include the following Wilayas:
West:     Bechar, Mostaganem, Oran, Saida, Bel-Abbes, Tiaret,
Tlemcen.
Center:   Algiers, Blida, El Asnam, Medea, Tizi-Ouzou.
East:     Annaba, Constantine, Batna, Bedjaia, Biskra, Jijel,
Setif, Skikda, Touggourt.

2.        The total nominal capacity of these units, all of which utilized
the wet process was 1.05 million tons per annum, but, as illustrated below,
this total had not been achieved since 1961 largely owing to the political
dislocation which accompanied independence. At Zahana in particular, the
utilization rate had fallen to about 80% by the time of SNMC's takeover.

/1   For 1961, figures are based on CEMBUREAU statistics: thereafter SNMC
data are used.
3.        Since 1968, SNMC has embarked on a vigorous policy of expansion
and modernization, under the first and second national 4 Year Plans. In
1973 Hadjar-Soud I opened with a nominal annual capacity of 500,000 tons.
This plant, which is located in the Eastern Region, near Annaba, is the
first dry process plant which SNMC has introduced. It has the potential
to produce a wide range of special and water-resistant cements as well as
CPA 325. A new plant at the same location, Hadjar-Soud II, is currently
under construction and is expected to start production towards the end of
1975, with the same annual capacity of 500,000 tons. In 1974, as indicated,
Meftah was also shut down as a new plant in Meftah with a nominal annual
capacity of one million tons, came on stream. By the end of 1975, therefore,
the nominal capacity of those SNMC plants actually in production will have
risen to 3.0 million tpy.
4.        The following table shows the annual production of SNMC's cement
units since the formation of the company through the end of 1975:

II.   Historic Import Requirements
5.        From independence to the setting up of SNMC's monopoly, Algeria
had been a net exporter of cement, having exported a total of approximately
337,000 tons between 1964 and 1968, primarily to France. However, with the
rapid growth'in the demand of cement in Algeria, emphasis shifted towards
satisfaction of the domestic market as a priority and imports have increased
steadily as shown below, until, since 1973, they have exceeded total domestic
production. All importation of building materials is carried out through
SNMC's monopoly and, despite its sharply higher cost, imported cement enters
the national distribution system at the same price as that of domestic cement.

Spain, USSR, and Turkey. More recently, France, Greece and Romania have become
important.

7.        Authorization for cement importation is given to SNMC by the
Ministry of Commerce, which fixes SNMC imports by value on an annual basis.
In 1972, DA 80 million was allocated to SNMC for imports and in 1973 this
was increased to DA 150 million. Since contracts are generally signed well
in advance, this system of budgeted importation by value has worked fairly
well. However, at the beginning of 1974, faced with rapidly rising world
market prices, efforts were made by certain exporting countries to renegotiate
contracts, and conversely, in 1975 SNMC renegotiated contract prices in the
light of the European recession and drop in cement demand.

8.        On the basis of contracts already signed or currently being negotiated,
SNMC's intends to import in 1975 more than 2.2 million tons of cement by quantity
and origin, are shown as below, with an estimate of the likely price per ton:

9.        A major constraint on cement importation has been the limited
handling capacities at Algerian ports which, at present, have no silo
facilities. 1974 cement throughput, by port of importation, is illustrated
in the table below:

10.       A further disincentive has been the wide difference in handling costs
at each port, illustrated in the histogram below. These divergencies are, at
least partially, a function of the gross overcrowding and inefficient organiza-
tion at the major ports.  Algerian port charges for cement are 3-5 times higher
than the handling charges of comparable Medeterranean ports. However, in addi-
tion, the differentials represent an effort by the Government to divert traffic

III.   Projected Domestic Production
11.       In view of the rapid growth in import volume - as well as the rise
in import prices - the Government has allocated a high priority to expansion
of domestic production capacity. This was begun in the First 4-Year Plan
(1970-73) and the Special Regional Programs (1971-75) and is continued in the
Second 4-Year Plan (1974-77) which has as a goal self-sufficiency in cement
production by 1980. To reach this target, the Plan and the "Perspectives
1980" include provisions for twelve cement plants in addition to those
currently existing or scheduled to come on stream during 1975.  With the
exception of the CIMA project, a joint Moroccon-Algerian venture, all these
will be constructed through "turnkey" contracts. The Company's total likely
future production, from existing facilities and projects in the advanced
planning stage is likely to evolve as shown in the table below.

12.       The following paragraph gives more details on the operating
characteristics and state of preparation of the above listed facilities.
Meftah: unlike most of SNMC's future plants, Meftah which will have
a nominal capacity of 1 million tpy was not constructed on a "turnkey"
basis. Project implementation, under the supervision of the Canadian
consultants SNC, has been delayed by nearly 18 months. Start up 'is ex-
pected in mid-1975.
Hadjar-Soud I: after prolonged start-up difficulties, this plant - which
was due to come on stream in early 1974 with a nominal capacity of 500,000
tpy - should begin to operate near capacity by 1976. It was constructed
under the supervision of the Swiss engipeering firm, P.E.G.
Zahana I: studies are currently being undertaken as to the feasibility of
converting this plant to dry process technology. It is tentatively estimated
this would cost around US$20 million. If no such investment is made the plant
might close by 1979.
Pointe-Pescade: an old wet-process plant with serious pollution problems,
this plant would require investments of about US$10 million to upgrade equip-
ment to allow production beyond 1979.
Hadjar-Soud Il: this 500,000 tpy project is an expansion of Hadjar-Soud
I through the addition of a second kiln. Start up is expected in October
1975.
Zahana II: a single-kiln, 1 million tpy "turnkey" project for which a
contract was signed with Fives-Cail Babcock (FCB) in December 1973.
Financing is being provided by German bilateral development aid and by
French suppliers' credits on very concessionary terms.
Setif: a single-kiln, 1 million tpy "turnkey" project for which a
contract was signed with KHD (Germany) in August 1974. Financing will
be through German bilateral aid.
El Asnam: a single-kiln, 1 million ton "turnkey" project for which a
contract was signed with Kawazaki Heavy Industries in October 1974.
Financing will be provided by Japanese suppliers' credits.
Constantinois and Beni Saf: contracts for both of these 1 million tpy
single-kiln plants were signed in January 1975 with Creusot-Loire (France).
Finâncing will be through French bilateral credits. SNMC presently expects
that part of production from Beni Svf - which is located on the coast near
Oran - will go for export or supply of Eastern Algeria by ship.
Saida: unlike SNMC's other planned facilities, Saida will have a nominal
capacity of only 500,000 tpy. For details, see Annexes 5-1 to 5-17 of this
report.



ANNEX 4-1

CIMA and CIMAT: In its desire to advance Mahgrebian unity, the Algerian Gov-
ernment has encouraged SNMC to participate in two companies with Moroccan and
Tunisian partners.  In each case, SNMC will hold 50% of the new company's
stock and has pledged to take 50% of each unit's production at its full cost
price. The new plants vill, however, be constructed on Moroccan and Tunisian
territory, respectively. In the case of CIMA, project execution vill be under
the supervision of APCM (United Kingdom) and the major mechanical equipment
packages were contracted in July 1975. Unlike the other SNMC projects, CIMA
vill have two kilns with a total nominal annual capacity of 1.1 million tons.
Financing through the World Bank and the Arab Fund is currently being consi-
dered. In the case of CIMAT, geological studies have been completed and a
decision has been taken to execute the project on a "turnkey" basis. Ciment
Francais has been selected as Engineering Consultant.
Additional Plans for Expansion of Domestic Cement Production
13.       In addition to those units whose production is described above,
SNMC is also considering four other plants. They are already contained
in the Second 4-Year Plan (1974-77) and preparatory work is currently
underway. These projects should be reconsidered in the light of the start-up
of the other new plants and the indicative market forecasts, shown in Chapter
III of this Annex. The projected supply/demand balance does not appear to
justify further expansion vithin the time frame currently envisaged by SNMC.
There is a strong possibility of over-supply of cement in Algeria by the
beginning of the eighties, if SNMC does not evaluate the viability of these
four projects before proceeding vith their implementation.

14.       Nevertheless, should SNMC proceed with these new projects irrespective
of market conditions - or should the market change to justify their implementa-
tion - it is possible that, after 1982, total nominal cement production capacity
in Aglgeria might be in the region of 12 million tpy.

B.   THE DEMAND FOR CEMENT IN ALGERIA
I.   Historic Domestic Demand
16.       Even in an economy where Government is by far the largest consumer
of building materials, the existence of black markets for private sector
consumers of cement, with prices substantially above those officially obtaining,
is indicative both of repressed marginal demand for cement and possible
distribution problems. Such a repressed market situation creates difficulties
in quantifying total national demand and, hence, historical consumption figures
tend to underestimate actual demand.

17.       Since 1969 Algeria has faced an acute shortage of construction
materials. In the 1967-69 Plan, although 81% of the industrial investment
program in the public sector was in fact achieved, cement production did not
meet the increasing demand so that the resulting gap had to be met by sharply
increased lmports. A similar pattern was reflected in the 1970-1973 Plan.
During the latter period, overall growth in domestic cement production was
about 20% less than the targetted increase of 100% due to the delayed im-
plementation of 2 cement plants.  At the same time consumption increased by
154%. Even importation at this level, however, was not sufficient to meet
targets in other sectors and - while insufficient supply of cement may not
have been one of the major factors contributing to the slippage - there can
be no doubt that some part of the delay in plan achievement must be attributed
to non-availability of cement.
II.  Projected Domestic Demand (1975-77)
18.       Methodology:  Based on experience elsewhere of market studies for
cement, the three most widely used techniques for forecasting future demand
are sectoral analysis, correlation with macro-economic indicators and extra-
polation of previous consumption data. As indicated below, however, each of
these methods has intrinsic weaknesses when applied to the Algerian case and
one must, therefore, be wary of draving more than indicative conclusions from



ANNEX 4-1
Page 11
the figures presented in this section. Both SNMC's own analysis and that of
the Bank's mission can demonstrate no more than a range within which future
consumption is expected to fall.
(a)  Sectoral Analysis:  The best indicator of future cement
consumption is expected construction activity. Furthermore,
vithin any one economy there exist relatively constant
relationships which obtain between cement utilization
and investment in any particular sector. In Algeria, the
only planning document which exists for the period after
1977 is the "Perspectives - 1980" which, published in 1973,
was largely superceded by the 4 Year Plan (1974-1977). The
"Perspectives" forecast a total cement requirement of just
over 29 million tons for the period 1974 to 1980. According
to the Plan and as shown in para 18, total cement required
through 1977 alone now comes almost to this figure. While
an attempt is made below to assese cement requirements
based on Governrent investment after 1977, it should be
borne in mind that any such estimates can only be notional.
(b)  Correlation:  Statistical analysis shows that a fairly close
correlation exists between cement consumption and macro-economic
indicators such as GDP, GNP and gross fixed capital formation.
Per capita cement consumption is often used as an indicator
of a country's level of development, which is in turn reflected
in per capita GNP.  One may, therefore, establish a regression
equation, based either on cross-sectional international data
or on time-series data within one country, to predict future
consumption in that country. The chief drawback of this method,
in the case of Algeria, is that (i) the present development
dynamic is of recent origin and relatively few time series
observations exist and (ii) any correlation based on past
consumption must inevitably ignore unquantifiable repressed
demand and hence, will be an inaccurate indicator of future
demand if the relationship between available cement and total
demand changes over time.  In Algeria, as new domestic
capacity is brought on stream, one would assume that the
difference between consumption and unrestricted demand would
tend to zero, and that, ceteris paribus, a regression equation
based on historic consumption would tend to underestimate
future demand. It must, however, also be observed that - for
reasons which are set forth below - it is probable that the
national income projections contained in the 1974-1977 4 Year
Plan will prove unduly optimistic and that to fit them into
a regression equation based on actually-realized GDP data
would tend substantially to inflate projections of demand
above those felt to be realistic.  To some extent, these
two types of errors would therefore tend to offset one
another.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 12
(c)  Extrapolation:  For the same reason as above, namely the as-
symetrical relationship vhich has historically prevailed be-
tween consumption and demand, one cannot simply extrapolate
past consumption trends into the future. Additionally, Algeria
is very much a paradigm case of a dualistic economy in which a
more developed, urbanized northern litoral dominates a tradi-
tional or transitional rural south, both in terms of overall
investuent and in cement use. In such a case, one must expect
secondary and tertiary effects as more people move out of
pastoral nomadism into the cash economy. Furthermore, the
existence of building materials vill create forvard linkages
which vill have a multiplier impact downstream, possibly
accelerating the change towards a relatively modern life-style
vith its concomitant use of permanent construction materials.
Simple extrapolation cannot take account of these shifts in
taste and interrelated linkages and is, therefore, inapplica-
ble in this case.
19.       In the light of the methodological constraints indicated above,
the analysis which follows endeavors to establish a range vithin vhich
future demand may be expected to fall. The feasibility of this range is
then checked by reference to the sketchy sectoral data which exists for
the later period and by comparison vith cement consumption of other countries
at the stage of development which Algeria is expected to have attained by
1980. The folloving table summarizes the results of some of the more
meaningful projections. More detailed interpretation of this data follows
in para. 22.

SNMC's demand estimates, ranging from 8.5-9.4 million tons of cement in 1980,
clearly exceed the Bank's more conservative projections which range from
6.3 - 8.3 million tons in 1980. Taking into account the questionable ac-
curacy of data, assumptions and the methodological approaches, the "most
likely" demand for cement in 1980 is in the range of 7.0 - 8.2 million tons.
SNMC Projections (Correlation with GDP)
20.       SNMC has developed a linear regression equation between GDP and
gr2ss cement consumption which, it is claimed, has a correlation coefficient
(r value) of 0.988. Based on seven observations between 1971 and 1973,
the best-fit predictor was found to be:
Y = 0.1176 GDP - 933,079
2
r  = 0.988
Y  = cement consumption in tons
GDP = GDP in millions of 1973 Dinars



ANNEX 4-1
Page 14
Based on this relationship, on full realization of the 4 Year Plan (1974-77)
and on a 10% annual real growth rate for GDP thereafter, SNMC has projected
future cement demand as shown in the following table.  This estimate is
henceforth referred to as Projection I.
SNMC - Projection I
Estimated Domestic Cement Demand (1974-80)
(SNMC Correlation with GDP)
Year                                Annual Cement Consumption
1975                                     5,360,000 tons
1976                                     6,060,000 tons
1977                                     6,850,000 tons
1978                                     7,625,000 tons
1979                                     8,480,000 tons
1980                                     9,420,000 tons
21.       There are, however, a number of lmpelling reasons for doubting that
dermand will actually develop according to this forecast:
(a) GDP or GNP projections for Algeria vary widely. Although
real growth in GDP from 1970-1973 was only about 6%, as
compared with a target of 9%, the rise in oil prices has
made the target rate of growth of 10-11.2% in the 4 Year
Plan (1974-77) more likely. However, the Plan is based on
an assumed 1973 GNP of DA 43 billion, while statistics
quoted in the Plan itself put actual 1973 GNP at DA 27
billion and Bank estimates place it at DA 31 billion.  In
order to reach the 1977 target, the economy's rate of
growth would have to be substantially higher than that
indicated in the Plan to overcome the initial shortfall. 1/
(b) A three-year period - even with semestrial observations - is
an inadequate base for projections through to 1980, leading
one to suspect the validity of the extremely high correlation
coefficient quoted above. In addition, the linear nature of
the function - while it follows from such a short observation
period - is unlikely to hold over the longer term and should
not be inferred a priori. Although it may prove a better fit
if the actual curve should prove to be sinosoidal.
1/   This shortfall was almost entirely due to the failure of the hydrocarbon
sector to perform up to expectations.

22.       Accepting the validity of SNMC's linear regression equation,
Projection Il - illustrated below - represents the impact that a downward
reassessment of future GDP, in line with estimates provided by the Bank's
recent economic mission, would have on future cement consumption. 1/

constant 1973 prices were as shown below:

In the "most likely" Projections, it was assumed that real petroleum prices
would remain stable at the levels prevailing in the first quarter of 1975,
the economy thus obtaining an annual growth rate of 8.6%. In the "low"
Projections, a GDP growth rate of 7.5% p.a. and a decline of real petroleum
prices by 5% annually between 1975 and 1980 was assumed.  In both cases,
cement consumption forecasts are more than 1/3 lower than those produced by
SNMC. However, the problems of assumed a priori linearity and an inadequate
observation period remain.
IBRD - Projections (Correlation with GDP)
24.       In order to go some way towards meeting these problems, a regression
analysis was conducted between cement consumption and GDP and between cement
consumption per capita and GDP per capita. Both raw data and their natural
logarithms were used and raised on observations for 1968-1974. The 1968-1974

period was chosen (i) as the period during which SNMC has gradually consolidated
its position as the monopoly producer of cement and (ii) because it avoids some
of the problens associated with repressed domestic demand during 1962-67 when
exports were being made to France.
25.       Both untransformed and double logarithmic regressions were run
because - although it was intuitively unlikely that the resulting relation-
ship would be linear - it seemed desirable to ascertain the degree of
improvement in the fit generated by using logarithms.
26.       The input data for the regressions was as shown in the following
table: GDP data were drawn from the recent economic report.

27.       The resulting equations and the accompanying correlation coefficients
were as follows, where C = total cement consumption, Cp = cement consumption
per capita, G = GDP and Gp = GDP per capita:

C = 194GDP - 3789;                        r  = 0.955
(b)  Correlation of log cement consumption with log GDP
log C = 3.417 log GDP - 4.045;            r  = 0.964
(c)  Correlation of per capita cement consumption with per capita GDP
CpC = 0.202GDP pC - 474;                  r  - 0.882

Log CpC - 2.903 log GDP - 4.960;           r  = 0.958
28.       For all equations above, r2 values are slightly - though not
significantly - higher for double logarithmic functions than for those
with untransformed variables.  Hovever, analysis of residuals would indicate
that the linear functions are as good predictors as log functions.
29.       Input data for these projections are based on the estimates of
a recent Bank Economic Mission to Algeria and are shown below:

34.       These projections are substantially lower than thosse based on
correlation between cement consumption and GDP. One of the major reasons
is the type of investment program during 1969-74 which serve as base
years for the regression. During these years gross capital formation has
been heavily concentrated in capital and equipment intensive industry with
low cement utilization ratios. Since it is the expressed policy of the
Algerian Government to shift investments during 1975-1980 to more "cement
intensive" sectors such as housing, education and agriculture, the correlation
between cement consumption and groass fixed capital formation cannot be
considered a valid predictor of future cement demand.
Sector Analysis
35.       Although, no reliable guide to Government policy beyond 1977
presently exists, the 4 Year Plan (1974-77) and the "Perspectives - 1980",
together, do provide some indications of the direction that certain sectoral
investments will follow. The proceeding analysis - sketchy though it must
inevitably be - does therefore provide some sort of check on the feasibility
(if not the probability) that actual demand will fall within the limits
indicated by the previous correlations. It is, however, predicated upon
implementation of the 4 Year Plan and, in addition, cannot comprehensively
cover major industrial and agricultural users of cement.
36.       The sectors in which future post-1977 demand can be inferred are:
(a) Housing: Two hypotheses have been assumed - Hypothesis I in
which the housing def-icit anticipated in 1977 - approximately



ANNEX 4-1
Page 20
1.05 million units - is absorbed by 1985, and Hypothesis II
in which it is absorbed by 1990. Both hypotheses are based
on (i) the known housing stock in 1973, (ii) the construction
of 200,000 units between 1974 and 1977, (iii) an annual rate
of population increase of 3.5% as projected in the 4 Year Plan,
(iv) an annual replacement of 6,500 housing units, and (v) a
usage of 25 tons of cement for each unit, plus 5 tons for
necessary infrastructure if the unit is in an urban region
and 7 tons if it is rural. Taking account of the likely
easing of the cement supply constraint after 1978, the demand
for cement in the housing sector will be at least 2.3 million
tons by 1980.
SNMC:  Estimated Cement Demand in the Housing Sector (1978-1981)
(000 tons)
1978   1979   1980   1981

Hypothesis II (20 tons per unit)/1 1847   2205   2356   2527
j1   SNMC estimates that, if 20 tons of cement are used instead of 25 tons,
brick requirements will increase from 8 tons per unit to 11 tons. Per
unit cement estimates are in line with other comparable countries,
although no hard and fast rule can be applied since much depends on
traditional building techniques. Recent figures indicate that cement
use per housing unit is about 20 tons in France, 31 tons in Italy, 14
tons in Spain, 12 tons in Greece and 26 tons in Germany.
(b) Education: to get anywhere near the Plan targets of 100%
and 50% enrollment ratioe for primary and secondary students
respectively by 1980, construction activity for the educa-
tional sector must increase sharply. The related cement
requirements are projected to reach 680,000 tons in 1980.
(c) Other non-industrial sectors: while these sectors are indi-
vidually relatively unimportant, in the aggregate their cement
consumption is significant and, in the cases of tourism and
health facilities, is expected to rise quite sharply after 1977.

is therefore expected to be approximately as shown below for the period
1977-1981. It should, however, once again be stressed that these figures
are only indicative and that they have been inferred from general statements
of policy rather than calculated on the basis of firm commitments.

38.       In the past, cement consumption by these sectors in Algeria as
a percentage of total cement consumption has averaged about 35%. This is
substantially lower than comparable countries in the Mediterranean where
the non-industrial and non-agricultural sector accounts for at least 50%
of cement consumption. Based on such a 50:50 split between sectors and
the more conservative assumption that only 20 tons of cement vill be used
for each housing unit, total cement demand may range from 6.8-11.2 million
tons in 1980.

ANNEX 4-1
Page 23
In 1980, Algeria can expect to reach a GNP per capita of about US$740. Based
on international comparison, this implies a per capita cement consumption
of 370-400 kg or a total domestic cement demand ranging from 6.6-7.5 million
tons by 1980. These projections are in line with the cement demand forecasts
based on correlation and sector analysis and summarized in para 20.
C.   PROJECTED SUPPLY AND DEMAND BALANCE
40.       Based on SNMC's projected cement production (para 1) and the
most probable range of domestic cement demand in Algeria as summarized in
para 19, it is likely that Algeria will continue importing cement at least
until 1978.

- high            (1.70)  (1.97)  (1.83)  (0.93)  (0.19)  (0.19)
The situation for the 1979-80 period remains uncertain.  If all of SNMC's
7 cement plants currently under construction come on stream as scheduled
and cement demand does not reach the targeted level, a temporary oversupply
of up to 1.0 million tons may materialize. On the other hand if SNMC encoun-
ters start-up difficulties and/or cement demand develops as projected, a
continuous deficit in domestic cement supply of equally likely.
D.  THE REGIONAL YARKET FOR CEMENT IN ALGERIA
I.   Historic Consumption 1/
41.       As shown below, in the past cement consumption has been concentrated
in the central region around Algiers, althouRh in recent years the eastern
region, around Annaba and Constantine, has grown rapidly in importance. In
the west, although the absolute level of consumption had grown by about 350%
between 1962 and 1973, the region's share in total consumption has actually
dropped from the levels prevailing in the early 1960s.
1/   For a-n explanation of the terms "eastern", "central" and "western" regions,
see p. 1, footnote 1 of this Annex. The division of the country into these
regions is a conceptual tool rather than an existing administrative division.

II.   Historic Supply
42.       In the past, regional consumption has been significantly constrained
by regional supply. The major reason for this was the critical shortage of
transport. The recent equalization of cement prices throughout the country
does not any longer favor consumption activities near a plant site. However,
transport deficiencies do still exist so that cement availability is not
evenly spread throughout the country.
43.       Of the four plants operating prior to 1975, all were established
in the north; Meftah I and Pointe-Pescade in the center, Hadjar Soud I in
the east and Zahana in the west.  Regional domestic cement supply from 1969
to 1975 was, therefore, approximately as shown below.

44.       These northern plants exclusively serviced the hinterlands re-
presented by their respective regions.  In 1974, for example, Zahana's entire
output of ordinary cement was consumed in the west,1/  while Hadjar-Soud I
production was restricted to the east and that from Meftah and Pointe-Pescade
to the center. Given transportation, distribution and port handling con-
straints, it has also been necessary to lmport cement on a regional basis to
alleviate regional shortfalls. Again using 1974 as an example, approximately
27% of total cement imported was intended for use in the central region, 47%
in the east and 26% in the western region.
III.   Projected Regional Supply
45.       Based on the domestic supply projections (para 11), the future
regional supply of domestically produced cement will be approximately as
shown in the table below.
SNMC: Future Domestic Cerent Supply by Region /1

Center:  Pointe-Pescade, El Asnam and Meftah.
East: Hadjar-Soud I and II, Constantinois, Setif and CIMAT.
West:  Zahana I and II, Benisaf, CIMA and Saida.
1/   A small amount of water-resistant, "prise-mer" cement was however, consumed
in the other two regions.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 26
In fact, El Asnam is located in a position to service both the
western and central regions and Setif could also expect to
distribute a substantial portion of its output in the center. To
that extent, therefore, the distinctions are somewhat arbitrary.
IV.   Projected Regional Demand
46.       In late 1973, SNMC provided the Bank with a breakdown of future
cement demand by Wilaya and distribution agency, based on a total cement
demand in 1980 of 6.80 million tons. Although SNMC's estimate of total
demand and the Wilayate structure have both changed, the company expects
the relative importance of individual areas to remain much as indicated since
the basis for the breakdown was primarily anticipated population growth. A
summary of SNMC's 1973 estimate for 1980 is, therefore, presented below. In
line with the country' Investment Program, the main changes forseen between
1975 and 1980 are expected to take place in the east and center, the share
cf the former rising from 33% to 36% and that of the latter dropping from 40%
to 38%. These changes, however, are not major and the share of the west is
likely to remain virtually unchanged.

Mostaganem   7%    El Asnam          6%      Annaba          9%
Tiaret       3%    Tizi Ouzu        5%       Batna           5%
Tlemcen      4%    Algiers          17%      Setif           9%

Bechar      3%
Sub-total   26%    Sub-total       38%       Sub-total      36%
47.       Applying these relative proportions to the most likely estimate
of the national demand in 1980 (para 18), regional demand can be anticipated
to be within the limits indicated below.

viii supply nearly 25Z of the cement demand [n the western region.  Georgra-
phically, the Saida plant is located in Algeria's hinterland and it will be
SNMC's most soufhern plant. The natural market for the plant vill therefore,
be the wilaya of Saida and the region south of the high plateau including the
wilayas of Bechar and Adrar as vell as the Western Sahara. Estimates of
future cement consumption for this specific market indicate a possible cement
d    fmd of 445,000 tous by 1980 in these régions.

These projections assume that the Government of Algeria continues (i) its
regional programs oriented towards construction of rural housing, irrigation
and infrastructure extension and (ii) that major industrial projects currently
being,planned for the area 1/ will come on stream in the early 1980s.
V.   Regional Demand/Supply Balance
49.       The analysis of the previous chapters indicates that total
domestic cement supply and demand may approximately be balanced by 1980.
However, a comparison of regional forecasts suggests that the selection of
plant locations for the new cement plants nov under construction is likely
to lead to a regional supply/demand imbalance by 1980.

The production of cement in the Western region vill not, even under the most
optimistic circumstances, be consumed in this area. Quantities of up to 1.5
million tons may have to be shipped or exported from cement plants such as
Zahana, CIMA, or Beni Saf to the central region. Although rail and shipping
connections do exist, transport of cement implies substantial additional costs
which could have been avoided by more careful planning of the optimal cement
plant locations in Algeria.

A. INTRODUCTION
1.        SNMC is not only responsible for the production and importation of
building materials in Algeria, but also distributes cement on the wholesale and
retail levels. A special distribution department deals with the planning of
domestic consumption, and physical allocation and transportation of building
materials is handled by three regional offices in Oran, Algiers and Annaba.
Until now, problems related to the distribution of building materials --
in particular cement -- have been transport inefficiencies and not marketing
problems. Supply greatly exceeds demand, so that cement users are willing
to transport cement themselves from SNMC's facilities. This situation is
likely to change before the end of the decade. The planned expansion of
domestic production facilities is expected to free previously repressed de-
mand and to increase domestic consumption from 3 million tons in 1974 to
about 7 million tons in 1980, thus requiring a simultaneous expansion of the
distribution system.
B. DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS
I.   Existing System and Facilities
2.   The existing system of cement sales and distribution has evolved in an
ad hoc manner out of the facilities which were operated by private owners at
the time of SNMC's formation. SNMC now operates 22 agencies of which 18 are
located in the western region. These agencies carry a full range of SNMC
products, but cement storage space for all agencies combined is only 11,500
tons.

The agencies are supplemented by 89 SNMC depots, 33 of which are in
the western region. Each depot - storage capacities of which vary between
10,000 and only 200 tons for all SNMC products combined - is provisioned by



ANNEX 4-2
Page 2
one distribution agency to which ail sales are credited.  The depot represents
the lowest level of SNMC's distribution network, although there also exist
small independent retailers who sell bagged cement in general stores and
cooperatives.
3.        These agencies vary widely in aize, operating costs and efficiency,
and none as yet has the capacity to handle bulk cement. As shown in the table
below, annual sales of all SNMC products per agency varied in 1972 from DA
22 million at Algiers to only DA 300,000 at Sidi Bel-Abbes. Similarly, stock
on hand at the end of the year, as a percentage of total sales, also varied
widely, from 8% at Annaba, 6% at Setif and only 2% at Batna to 65% at Blida
and 57% at Sidi Bel-Abbes. In general, larger agencies and agencies nearer
their sources of supply have tended to operate more efficiently than smaller
agencies located away from the coastal region.

4.        Sales statistics for the agencies reflect the pattern of official
sales rather than the actual physical consumption of cement, which may take
place elsewhere particularly if the cement credited to the agency was in fact
picked up directly from the factory by the client himself.   This is parti-
cularly important since about 90% of cement is purchased by Governrent
agencies or State enterprises, many of which are big enough consumers to
justify regular pick-up of cement at the plant.
5.        The costs of handling and distributing cement increaséd by more
than 20% between 1973 and 1974. The increase was primarily due to port
handling charges for imported cement.

II.  Distribution Centers
6.        In the first 4-Year Plan (1970-73) it was decided to move towards
a regional distribution system based on bulk handling from the cement plant,
stockage in specially constructed silos at distribution centers devoted
primarily to cement sales and, finally, sales either in bulk form or bagged
at the distribution center, to SNMC depots or final industrial and non-industrial
consumers. Initial plans were for 12 of these centers, construction of which
has been repeatedly delayed beyond their originally estimated 1972 start-up
date. However, it was later decided to construct over 30 to serve the entire
country. Originally, three of the centers were to have two 1,500 ton silos,
for an annual cement capacity of 120,000 tons.  The remainder were to have
only one 1,500 ton silo, for an annual capacity of 60,000 tons. However,
late in their planning it was decided that each center would have an annual
capacity of 120,000 tons. Ten centers are presently under construction and
all of them are located on or near a rail line as shown below. Start-up of
most of these units is expected by the end of 1975.

/1   Studies for the distribution centers were carried out by several consultante
including PEG, BELAID and Algetudes.
7.        These distribution centers will include three warehouses, two
concrete silos each weighing 5,500 tons, open-air stockyards, repair facili-
ties, administrative offices, a canteen and an infirmary. Contracte have been
signed for the construction of 10 centers. The present cost estimate of US$32
million is more than DA 47 million (US$13 million) higher than the original
estimate, the bulk of the overrun coming on equipment and assembly. Long-tern
RAD credits, totalling DA 72 million, at 5.5% over 12 years and medium term
loans of DA 47 million at the same rate but payable over 5 years will cover
local costs of these centers, while the direct foreign exchange requirements
are being provided by suppliers credits at 6%, repayable over 5 years.
8.        Planning of the location of the distribution centers has not been
coordinated properly with the location of new cement plants. In 3 cases,
Saida, Nezloug, and El Asnam the silos and bagging facilities of the
distribution centers are being constructed wîthin 15 km of a new cement plant.
The associated investments of about US$10 million represent a direct misalloca-
tion of resources.
9.        The major advantages of the distribution centers are (i) an improved
geographical availability of large quantities of cement in bags as well as
bulk for large-scale consumers; and (ii) economies in transport costs by bulk
shipping. However, due to their high investment cost, SNMC's average distril
butîon costs per ton are unlikely to decline after the distribution centers
come into operation.  Operating costs of the centers (in 1974 value terms) are



ANNEX 4-2
Page 5
estimated at DA 10 per ton during the 1975-80 period and will decline there-
after to not less than DA 5 per ton as depreciation charges level off. 1/
III. Planned Distribution Channels
10.       The 4 - Year Plan (1974-77) included an additional 34 distribution
centers. Rapidly rising investment costs led SNMC to re-examine the concept
of distribution centers as its basic distribution channel. In the first place,
their original conception limited them to cement sales, while a large part of
the demand - particularly in rural areas - is for a wide range of construction
materials. In the second place, the number of customers who demand bulk cement
is relatively small and can be served by the existing plants and 10 distribu-
tion centers. Above all, the geographical spread of cement supply in 1983,
through 11 cement plants and 10 distribution centers, will be sufficiently
wide that the transport cost savings by shipment of bulk cement to even
more distribution centers does not any longer outweigh the considerable invest-
ment costs of such installations. Only 3-5 additional distribution centers
are, therefore, likely to be constructed during the coming years. These
centers will be located near Tlemcen and Marnia, at the Moroccan border, and
at Tebessa, near the Tunisian border. They should be completed by 1978/79
and will be designed for storage and trans-shipment of 500,000 tpy of bulk
cement from CIMA and CIMAT, respectively.
il.       SNMC's plans for its future distribution system are therefore based on:
a)   the new and existing cemrent plants with their bagging and bulk
storage facilities;
b)   10-15 distribution centers with bagging installation and bulk
storage silo; and
c)   a large number of distribution centers for a range of building
materials which would eventually absorb the existing agencies and
depots.
12.       The general distribution centers for construction materials will
market all types of construction materials including bagged cement and other
SNMC products, but also including wood, steel frames, glass, etc. which are
produced by other state monopoly enterprises. SNMC, in cooperation with SNS,
is in the process of studying the optimal location, size, design and management
structure of the new all-round marketing centers. The concept of such general
1/   Estimate based on SNMC data as follows: - wages and salaries:  approximately
DA 2.66 million annually; maintenance: based on 0.5% of the cost of civil
engineering and 2.5% of the equipment cost, this would be about DA 580,000
per annum; depreciation: based on write-off of 20 years for civil
engineering and infrastructure, 10 years for equipment and 5 years for
other assets, depreciation charges would be DA 11.9 million in the first
5 years, DA 4.3 million in the next five years and DA 2.75 million there-
after; Utility charges: DA 364,000.

stores should not only contribute to a better geographic dispersion of cement
and other construction materials but ought to also cater to the specific needs
of private and small scale constructors.
C. TRANSPORT
I.   Transport Modes and Costs
13.       In theory, all shipment of cement either bagged or in bulk, falls
under the monopoly of either SNTR 1/ or SNCFA, 2/ the state haulage and railway
companies. In practice, neither of the two companies has the capacity to
handle SNMC's transport volume. Accordingly, SNMC is allowed to own its own
fleet of trucks and has purchased 60 silo wagons which are operated for it
by SNCFA. However, SNMC's truck fleet is still small, so that the bulk of
cement sales is picked up directly by the customer at the plant or dock side.
In 1974, domestic cement consumption reached 2.9 million tons of which 193,000
tons or 7% was transported by SNTR, 246,000 tons or 8.5% by SNCFA, an esti-
mated 1.0 million tons (34%) by SNMC, and more than 50% by customers them-
selves in their own trucks or in trucks owned by SNTR.
14.       Railroad Transport:  The existing rail system is constructed primarily
on an east-west axis, with narrow-gauge spurs running south from Mohammedia to
Bechar, from Ighil Izane to Tiaret and to Djelfa and Khenchela.
The total system is 3,950 km, of which 1,260 km is narrow track. In the west,
although the coastal belt is well served, the 750 km narrow guage southern
spur to Bechar is under-utilized and has not had major rehabilitation for
over 15 years. In 1969 it carried only 25,275 tons of freight and the stated
weight limitation is 12 tons an axle or 3 tons a meter - approximately half
that of a well-maintained normal-gauge track. SNCFA currently operates about
1,700 narrow-gauge wagons, with an aggregate capacity of just under 20,000
tons. It also operates 60 50-ton capacity cement silo wagons, owned by
SNMC. SNCFA has ordered a further 120 silo wagons, financed by a World Bank
railway loan.
15.       Road:  Like the railroad, the national road system is primarily
east-west with three north-south spurs perpendicular to the coast. The total
length of this network is 79,000 km of which 45% is paved. The Saida area
itself is served by RN6, which links Oran with Bechar, and by metallized
roads connecting Saida with the administrative centers of Mecheria, El Bayadh,
Aricha, Aflou and Ain Sefra. Under the 1970-73 Plan DA 8.35 million was
allocated for regional road improvement and under the Special Program for the
Saida area further substantial investments in road rehabilitation were foreseen.

16.       SNMC operates, from its three regional centers, a fleet of approxi-
mately 40 vehicles suitable for transportation of cement, divided by location
as shown in the table below. Annual transport volume of this fleet has not
exceeded 1.2 million tons and many of the trucks are reaching the end of
their useful life. 1/ Twelve of the SNMC owned vehicles are silo trucks,
each of about 50 ton capacity.

14.       Transport costs vary according to transport mode, distances involved,
gradients to be encountered and, in the case of SNTR, whether the truck will
have to return empty.  The official tariffs charged by SNCFA and SNTR have not
changed in the recent past. In case SNMC-owned wagons are used, SNCFA grants
a rebate to SNMC amounting to 15% on the normal gauge railroad and 6% on the
narrow gauge railroad.
The cost structure of each carrier in 1972, the last year for which
disaggregated data are available, are illustrated in the table below:

Clearly, the railway is the most economical means of transporting cement.
The tables below demonstrate, for the case of Saida, that SNTR can only compete
with SNCFA tariffs on short distances and on 20 ton trucks with return load.

15.       At present, the costs per ton-kilometer for SNMC's transport
fleet compare well with SNTR tariffs.  Further savings through economies of
scale can be expected after expansion of the fleet and its maintenance
facilities. However, average transport cost per ton of cement will increas2
since (i) cement consumption in the hinterland is increasing and (ii) SNTR,
SNCFA and SNMC will transport a higher share of the total volume of cement
shipped.
II. Future Transport Requirements
16.       The projected transport volume of cement in 1978 has been calculata
under the assumption that: (i) SNTR will more than double the tonnage which
it transports to 500,000 tons per year; (ii) SNCFA will be responsible for
all bulk shipment from SNMC plants to SNMC's Distribution Centers with silo



ANNEX 4-2
Page 9
capacity; and (iii) customers will continue to pick up cement from the factory
as in the past, the volume of such private pick-up increasing from 1.5 million
tons in 1974 to about 2.0 million tons in 1978 as new plants come in operation
and more customers benefit from their proximity to the plant.
17.       Rail.  The following pattern of transport volume and distances
between SNMC plants and distribution centers appear to be realistic for 1978.

According to the Bank's appraisal of SNCFA's operation, in the context of the
first railway loan, 1/ about 10% of available rail cars are being repaired
at any point in time. Average productivity of a railway wagon in Algeria
has been estimated at 586,000 ton/km per annum. SNMC would, therefore,
require 440 50-ton silo wagons in 1978 to cover the demands for 241 million
ton-km. Since SNCFA operates or has contracted for 180 wagons, there will be
a shortfall of at least 260 silo-wagons by the end of 1978. 2/
18.       SNMC - Trucks.  As to road transport, SNMC will fill the transport
needs between the plants and cement distribution centers on the one hand, and
depots or the general distribution centers for building materials on the
other hand. In addition, SNMC might have to provide bulk silo truck transport
to large customers. To determine the number of trucks SNMC will have to
operate in order to transport 2.35 million tons of cement in 1978 between
SNMC operating and marketing units, the following assumptions have been made:
20-ton trucks can be on the road for an average of 250 days per year over a
distance of 250 km per day. Assuming further that the average trip requires
75 km and 60% of all journeys involve empty return trips, the annual efficiency

2/   SNCFA's 1974-77 program does not provide for these 260 additional wagons.



ANNEX 4-2
Page 10
of a truck is 750,000 ton-km. This results in a need for 230 20-ton trucks
to transport 2.35 million tons of cement. About 30 of these trucks should
be silo-trucks in addition to the existing 12 ones. SNMC might also acquire
a limited number of 10-ton trucks to service small depots, but the majority
vill be more economical 20-ton trucks. Not taking into account the replace-
ment needs for the existing 40 trucks by 1978, SNMC vill require at least
190 new 20-ton lorries.
19.       Repair Facilities.  The present size of SNMC's truck fleet has
made only limited demands on the Company's capacity to provide maintenance
and repair facilities. SNMC realizes that the need for additional repair
facilities and management would grow vere its truck fleet to increase to
230 20-ton trucks. Two possible solutions are still under study, either:
(M) trucks vill be directly allocated to individual plants which vill also
undertake their maintenance; or (ii) 5 new transport centers will be created
near Algiers, El Asnam, Constantine, Annaba and Oran which vill be responsible
for the organization of all SNNC's truck fleet. The latter solution offers
some advantages since it may encourage optimal utilization along the coastal
strip and hence economize on investments in new truck repair facilities. On
the other hand it may discriminate against distribution from plants in the
hinterland such as Saida, since trucks would have to be sent from Oran (about
150 km) to distribute construction material within a radius of about 75 km
around Saida. It is therefore likely that a compromise vill be reached through
which SNMC will maintain 5 transport centers along the coast and an addi-
tional 2-3 facilities in the hinterland possibly around Saida, Touggourt
and Batna. The investment costs required for truck repair and maintenance
facilities are difficult to estimate at the moment. They may range from
US$800,000 to US$3.5 million depending on the number of repair centers and
on the quality of their equipment.
20.       Economic Justification.  The extension of SNMC's truck fleet can
be justified from an economic point of view since it represents a least
cost solution and is likely to improve the quality of cement distribution.
A cost/benefit analysis based on the least cost method has been undertaken
and is summarized below.
(a) SNMC's future cost structure for the truck transport
facilities vas compared with SNTR's tariffs. As noted above
SNMC trucks will primarily be used to transport bagged cement
(and other construction materials) over an average distance
of 75 km between SNMC plants and depots with 60% return
trips empty. SNTR's tariff for such haulages in a 20-ton
truck averages DA 0.135 per ton-kilometer.
(b) Assuming that SNMC expands its truck fleet to 230 20-ton
trucks with corresponding maintenance and repair facilities,
SNMC's cost structure can be estimated as follows:

Investment Cost               US$ Million
190 20-ton trucks
delivered cost                   7.6

Total                        9.4
Operating Cost                 DA per ton-km
For one 20-ton truck
averaging 750,000 ton-km
per year:
Labor                         0.015
Materials & supplies          0.065
Maintenance                   0.021
Depreciation /1               0.009
Financial charges /2          0.004
Total                    0.114
/1   Based on depreciation over 7 years.
/2   Assuming financing of 90 trucks at IBRD
conditions (15 years repayment plus 4 years
of grace at 10%) and the remainder at 5.5%
over 7 years.
(c) Consequently, SNMC should be in a position to transport
2.35 million tons of cement at 15% below the tariff
presently charged by SNTR.
4-
However, lower cost is only one of the factors which favor the expansion of
SNMC's truck fleet. In addition there are definite qualitative advantages:
SNTR's investment program for 1974-77 does not include provisions for
the required new trucks so that it is very likely that by 1978 they vill
not be able to cope with SNMC's transport demand. Although the direct
pick-up of cement by the consumer represents an economical solution, it
favors large-scale consumers with their own transport means and reinforces
regional imbalances of cement consumption.
D. CEMENT PRICES AND PRICING SYSTEM
21.       Cement prices in Algeria remained unchanged from May, 1966 until
October, 1973, during which time they were fixed on an ex-factory level.
Prices ranged from DA 96.02/ton for bagged cement to DA 88.07/ton, 1/ ordinary
portland cement which was in line with domestic production costs as shown in
the table below:
_/  DA 82.5/ton if TGP (sales tax) were excluded.

22.       In 1972, SNMC started to realise losses in the cement sector since
import prices had risen markedly above the domestic sales prices.
The Price Commission subsequently reviewed the level of cement prices in
Algeria and revised the pricing system as of October, 1973. Accordingly,
prices are no longer fixed at the ex-factory level, but at the SNMC level,
i.e. SNMC must charge a uniform price per ton to all its customers independent
of geographical location, plant, dock side or agency. The system is designed
to encourage cement use in the south and rural areas away from the developed
coastal strip. The prevailing prices for 1973-75 are as follows:

which included ex-factory production costs, handling charges, transport

and a 10% margin ("marge de distribution"). It is not quite clear--on the
basis of SNMC's cost accounting records in 1973--if overhead expenses and
marketing costs were properly allocated 10 had to be absorbed by the 10%
margin. SNMC's cement cost structures in 1973 and 1974 are illustrated
below.

24.       The table above indicates a cost increase of 60% between 1973 and
1974 which was foreseeable but which was not taken into account by SNMC or
the Algerian price commission. The reasons for this change in the cement
cost structure are twofold:
(a)  The cif cost of imported cement increased further, from
DA 113 per ton in 1973 to DA 160 per ton in 1974. Including
additional costs of importing (transit, unloading, storage
and financial charges), the average cost of imported
cement export reached DA 217.00 per ton in 1974. In the
future cif prices of cement are likely to remain constant
or even to decrease in real terms. However, in Algeria
miscellaneous port charges account for nearly 30% of the
cif import price and have contributed heavily to the fact
that Algeria's imported cement price levels exceed international
standards. CIF price decreases as well as greater efficiency
in port handling are therefore needed to stabilize the cost
of imported cement.
(b)  SNMC started production in 2 new cement plants during 1974-75
whose unit production costs far exceed the costs at existing

plants. The actual or estimated production and unit cost
breakdown is as follows:
1973            1974             1975
000              000             000

/1   Pointe-Pescade, Zahana
/2   Meftah, Hadjar Soud I
This trend will continue during the next 5 years, as an
additional 7 cement plants come on stream.
25.       Until SNMC's new plants reach full capacity, their unit costs will
tend to be 2-3 times more expensive than those of older plants. Even after
full capacity is reached, these will still tend to be a differential of 50-
100% for up to 10 years based on higher depreciation and financial charges.
This will, therefore, be reflected in a new level of SNM 's cerent cost
structure.

SNMC EXPANSION PROJECT
RAW MATERIAL AVAILABILITY AND ANALYSIS
A.   INTRODUCTION
1.        SNMC's first investigation into the raw material supply for the
Saida cement plant was based on the geological map prepared by the French
mining service. After preliminary location of several deposits of limestone and
clay within an area of 2,500 m2 to the east of Saida in summer 1973, SNMC
requested the Bulgarian consulting firm BULGAR PROJECTS to carry out a detailed
study with the aim of locating raw material deposits suitable in both quantity
and quality for the production of 500,000 tpy of clinker and 100,000 tpy of
lime. Proven reserves were to be sufficient for at least 50 years at this
level of production.
2.        To locate suitable clay and limestone deposit for the production of
cement and limestone BULGAR PROJECTS has undertaken:
(a) a geological survey of the region to the South and South-East
of Saida to fix the sites of the limestone deposits,
(b) a detailed geological survey with borings, corings,
and chemical analyses, to determine the quality of
the selected deposits; and
(c) detailed boring and coring wvth chemical and physical
analyses to ascertain the physical and chemical charac-
teristics of the selected limestone deposit.
3.        After location of limestone, clay and sandstone deposits, BULGAR
PROJECTS undertook in its laboratories in Sofia:
(a) the petrographical studies of the representative samples;
(b) the pilot production tests of clinker manufactured from various
combinations of the abovementioned raw materials, with
and without correction components; and
(c) the chemical, physical and petrographical studies of the
obtained clinkers.
B.   OUM EL DJERANE LIMESTONE DEPOSITS
4.        The limestone deposit is situated about 5 km south of the village
of Oum el Djerane; 1.5 km from the plant site, and on both sides of the road
between Oum El Djerane and Manora. The front of the deposit is 2 km long,
and makes a right angle with the road. The altitude of the deposit varies



ANNEX 5-1
Page 2
between 1,144 m and 1,188 m. The deposit of limestone is partially covered
with quarternaire clay of 0.20 to 0.60 m thickness, following the topography.
These clays have a rusty-brown color and contain limestone fragments of
different sizes. The limestone strata are of the Jurassie period, Bajocien
level, and belong to the Nador Carbonate Formation. The thickness of the
limestone varies between 15 m and 51 m. The strata are virtually horizontal,
the inclination varying between 5G to 10', to the North of North-West. It is
a hard stone with fine calcite grain structure, with a porcelain aspect, a
white to grey color, and some local spots of violet-rose. The top levels of
the strata are altered and fissured to 2 at 5 meters, and have some pro-
nounced carstic formations. The fissures and the cavities are filled wlth
rustry brown clays. The walls of the fissures and the cavities are partially
covered with a deposit of ferrous and magnesium hydroxides.
5.        The remaining levels of the strata consist of very homogeneous,
compact and hard limestone. Only the bottom levels of the strata have a few
insertions of marly clay of 0.10 to 0.2 meters thickness.
The limestone strata lie on partly rusty-brown colored marly clay
of the same geological period and level as the limestone. The chemical
constitution of the marly clays is not suitable to the fabrication of cement,
due to a high tenor of magnesium and various mineral oxîdes. The strata of
m-arly clay lie on dolomite strata of unexplored thickness.
6.        To calculate the reserves of the Oum El Djerane Limestone deposit,
26 borings of a total length of 1,015 m have been done over an area of
2,618,000 m2. Alone, the reserve studied in detail covers the needs of a
cement plant of 500,000 tpy with a lîme plant of 100,000 tpy for more than
70 years. (See tables 3 and 4)0 The reserves are made up of homogeneous hard
limestone of 1.5 average humidity, with a chemical composition suitable for
the fabrication of cement with dry process technology. The harmful component
(chloride, phosphates) percentage is below admissible limits (see Table 1).
7.        Exploitation of the limestone quarry will rely on conventional
methods, by means of drilling and blasting in terraces of 10 m to 20 m
working face heights.
C.   SIDI EL MINOUN NORTH CLAY DEPOSITS
8.        The clay deposit is situated South of the road R 77, near the
Marabout Sidi-Ahmet Chibani (about 57 km from the Oum el Djerane limestone
deposit on the other side of the town of Saida). The altitude of the
deposits varies between 735 m and 788 m. The deposits are partially covered
with deluvial sandy-clay of dark-brown color. With the insertion of gravel
of various sizes, the thickness of the cover varies between 0.50 and 3.0
meters.
9.        The clay strata are of the Bajocian division of the Jurassic period
and has an inclination of 30° North. Their thickness varies between 7.00 to
16,000 meters. The upper levels of the strata are alterated and fissured.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 3
The color of the clay is greenish-beige and partially rusty brown in the walls
of the fissures due to the ferrous hydroxide. The altered clay is plastic,
and is of a very fine grain. The bottom layer of the strata is compact and
grey. When in contact with the atmosphere the color progressively turns to
white and decomposes into laminae. There are insertions of hard strata
varying between 0.1 to 0.5 meters in both levels, consisting of marly clay
with coherent sandstones, and a few lenticular insertions of iron-moulded
brown and white marly clay of 0.3 to 0.07 m thickness. To fix the deposits
of the Sidi El-Minoun clay deposits, 29 borings of a total length of 910
meters have been carried out in an area of 227,462 m2. The reserves studied
in detail in an area of 136,878 m2 cover by thenselves the needs of the
cement plant for a period of more than 50 years. (See table 3 and 4)
10.       The constitution of the clay strata is quite homogeneous.  The
humidity of the clays varies between 6 to 15.3%. The average humidity is
8.7%. (See table 1 and 2)
11.       The clay is composed of low silica modula and high alumina modula
(See table 2). There are no components harmful to the fabrication of clinker
in dry process technology. A correction will be needed to raise the silica
modula and reduce the alumina modula in raw meal preparation. Sandstones
and iron ore will be added for these purposes. This sandstone will be
extracted from the deposits at Oum el Djerane.
12.       The exploitation of the clay deposits will be carried out by con-
ventional methods, i.e., by digging and excavating in terraces.  Special
precautions muet be taken to drain the water from the quarry, especially
during the rainy seasons.
Note:  SNNC has undertaken a new study of clay deposits near Ain
eVBHadjar. Ain el Radjar in located weut of the Saida-Bechar road, only
11 kms from Saida. These deposits offer the advantage of being closer to
the site of the limestone deposit at Oum El Djerane and of being connected
by national roads of shorter distances. The deposit is about 36 km by road
from the plant site and is also situated relatively close to the projected
route of the rail spur from the plant site to the operating railroad.
D.   OUM EL DJERANE SANDSTONE DEPOSITS
14.       The sandstone deposit is situated 3 km north of the village of
Oum el Djeran, and about 17 km by road from both the limestone deposits and
the plant site.
15.       The altitudes vary between 1074 and 1101 meters.  The deposits are
covered with marly clay of a thickness varying between 0.10 to 15 m. The
marly clays have plastic characteristics. The colors are greenish grey and,
near to the surface in the alterated zones, brownish yellow. In the strata
there are insertions of rusty brown sandstone of about 10 cm thickness.
These sandstones are of the Jurassic period, and are made up of quartz cemented
wvth clay. The colors of the sandstone are brownish-red to rusty brown.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 4
2
They are brittle, and have a high tenor of SiO .  (See table 1 and 2).  The
sandstone strata thicknesses vary between 15 and 23 m. There are a few
insertions of sandy-clay levels of about 0.20 m thickness in the strata.
The sandstone strata lie under the greenish-grey marly clay formation.
The marly clay tenor of SiO2 is very low.
16.       To study the sandstone reserves of the Oum el DJerane deposits, 24
borings of a total length of 916 meters have been made over an area of
151,860 m2. The reserves studied in detail, of 54,160 m2 alone cover the
needs of the cement plant for more than 80 years. (See table 3 and 4)
17.       The sandstone will be used as a correcting component for the clays,
with the purpose of correcting their silica and aluminum modulas. The maximum
yearly consumption will be 25,000 tons. The constitution of the reserves
is homogenous. Exploitation of the sandstone will be by way of drilling,
blasting, and loading. Special precautions must be taken for the drainage of
water. The stripping of the cover will pose some difficulties due to its
considerable thickness in some parts of the deposits.
E.   IRON ORE
18.       The use of iron ore has been foreseen in the project as a correction
component in the chemical composition of the raw meal. The iron will be
obtained from the mine of Beni Saf, near Oran, (Mine de Fer De Makta el Halid)
(See table 5). This ore is to be transported by dumper trucks, over a dis-
tance of 300 kilometers. The maximum yearly consumption of iron ore will be
12,500 tons.
F.   GYPSUM
19.       The gypsum is mixed in the proportion of 1:25 with the clinker for
the fabrication of cement. The annual gypsum needs will be provided by the
SNMC plaster plants of Fleurus, situated 170 km east of Oran, and 320 km
from Saida. The yearly gypsum consumption of the plant will be about 20,000
tons. The transportation will be by dumper trucks or rail. (See table 6)
G. RAW MNAL COMPOSITION
20.       With the above-mentioned raw materials, the Saida cement plant
will be able to prepare raw meals suitable for the production of APC 350
and APC 400 as well as ASTM IV cements, by way of dry-process technology.
The limestone of Oum el Djerane and the clay of Sidi el Minoun North
will be the main components to be used for the preparation of the raw meal.
21.       The sandstones of the Oum el Djerane deposits and the iron from
Beni Saf will be used as correction components for the purpose of raising
the silica modula and reducing the aluminum modula. They will also be used
for the preparation of a special raw meal for the fabrication of low-heat
cement.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 5
22.       The chemical composition of the raw materials does not show a
harmful level of chloride sulphates, alkalis or phosphates for dry process
technology (See table 7). Using a good homogenization procedure, the
Saida cement plant will be able to produce an excellent quality of clinker.
The technological tests that have been done at the laboratories
of BULGAR PROJECTS in Sofia, with 6 different mixtures of raw materials,
confirm the feasibility of obtaining an excellent quality of clinker with or
without correction components (See table 8 and 9).

ALGERIA
SNMC EXPANSION PROJECT
SAIDA CEMENT PLANT: DETAILED DESCRIPTION
A.   General ProJect Conception
1.        The general guidelines followed by SNMC in the design of previous
cement plants include provisions that:
1)   Minimum capacity of each plant must be 500,000 tpy of clinker
or 1,500 tons per day of kiln capacity;
2)   Dry-process technology be used;
3)   The production process must be driven by fully automatic
processes with fully automatic controls;
4)   The most modern technology should be incorporated in
the plant;
5)   All departments in which technical imperatives do not impose
a continuous run must be designed for a capacity of 8 hours
per day and a five day week;
6)   The equipment capacity should allow a sufficient security
margin to allow temporary increased production to offset
losses associated with expected production shutdowns;
7)   The anti-pollution, safety and security measures of the plant
must be consistent with internationally accepted standards; and
8)   The project must be realized in the shortest possible time
period under the full responsibility of a turnkey contractor.
This approach, which has been applied to the new cement plants for which SNMC
has recently signed contracts, has the advantage of assuring the supply of
the latest cement manufacturing technology according to a predetermined time
schedule and with a minimum involvement of SNMC's scarce technical staff. It
represents a choice as to the allocation of economic resources which the
Algerian authorities have consciously taken. Hovever, disadvaatages include
(i) the possibility of sub-optimal process choices, (ii) high capital cost
requirements because of excessive security margins, (iii) capacities which
might not be in line with market requirements, (iv) premiums paid for the
latest technology, (v) the risk of costly start-up problems with fully
automatic cement plants, and (vi) the possibility that capital-intensive
rather than labor-intensive construction methods will be preferred.



ANNEX 5-2
Page 2
B.   Process Choice
2.        The dry process has been chosen as basic technology for the Saida
cement plant.  Three factors determined this choice:  (i) all new cement
plants in Algeria will use this technology and SNMC expects that such a
uniform production technology vill minimize expenses for staff training and
spare parts and allow the shift of staff between plants; (ii) the plant vill
be located in a semi-arid area where water availability is limited--the
choice of the wet process vould require an additional 20 lb/second which
vould have to be diverted from agricultural purposes; and (iii) a comparison
between the investment and operating costs of the Saida plant and those of
comparable wet process plant shows that the lover fuel costs of a dry
process plant offset its higher investment cost and higher pover consumption,
so that ceteris paribus neither process offers a significant cost advantage.
In view of the limited availability of water and the desirability of stand-
ardization, the choice of the dry process for the Saida plant is endorsed.
C.   Description of the Installation
3.        The following technical description is based on the turnkey contract
signed between SNMC and the Japanese supplier Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI).
A flow sheet and plant lay-out are given at the end of this Annex.
I.  The Limestone Quarry:
The limestone quarry, situated 1.5 km from the site of the
factory, vill operate in the conventional vay, with terraces of a height of
about 20 meters. Drilling rigs vill drill holes for the dynamite charges.
After blasting, the oversized blocks will be reduced by secondary blasting.
A hydraulic shovel of 4 m3 capacity vill load the rocks into dumper trucks
of 23 tons capacity each. The dumper trucks will discharge the stone into
bine of a KAWASAKI HAZEMAK crusher of 600 to 700 tons per hours capacity,
located 1.5 km from the factory.
In the crusher the stone will be reduced from 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.0
meters, dovn to 20 mm, 60 to 70% of this being even finer. The crushed
stone vill be transported to the factory by means of a belt conveyor. A
bag filter installation is foreseen for the collection of the dust in the
crushing installation. The crusher vill work 6 hours a day, 5 days a veek.
Its capacity is calculated to meet the needs of the cement and lime plants.
The equipment of the quarry will include 2 drilling rigs of a dianeter of
3 inches, 5 rock hand-perforators, 3 stone-breakers, two compressors of a
capacity of 25 m3, one compressor of 10.5 m3 per minute, 3 dumper trucks
of 22 tons capacity each, one hydraulic shovel, vith a capacity of 4 m3
one bulldozer and one grader.



ANNEX 5-2
Page 3
Il. The Clay Quarry:
3    The clay quarry vill operate conventionally with a face shovel of
1.5 m capacity for digging and excavating the quarry faces of about 10
meters height, which vill be set in terraces.
The shovel vill load the dumper trucks of 17 tons, which vill
transport the clay to the factory crusher bin. The distance between the
quarry,and the factory ls about 30 kms. The overburden vill be removed by
means of a bull-dozer. Thirteen 17-ton dumper trucks are foreseen for the
clay transportation.
The quarry vill be in operation for a duration of less than 6 hours
a day, five days a week.
TII. The Sandstone Quarry:
The sandstone quarry vill operate vith a drilling rig of a diameter
of 2 inches. After blasting, the sandstone vill be loaded on dumper trucks
of 17 tons via a rubber-tired loader of a capacity of 0.8 m3.
The dumper vill discharge the stone into the factory sandstone
crusher bin. The distance between the quarry and the factory is about 15 km.
The equipment foreseen for the quarry vill consist of one drilling rig of
2 inches, one hydraulic shovel vith a capacity of 0.8 m3, one rubber-tire
loader and one dumper truck of 17 tons. A work-shop truck, a lubrication
truck, one vater truck, and one fuel tanker truck are also foreseen as common
equipment for all quarries.
IV. Clay and Sandstone Crushing
The clay and the sandstone, filled up in the bins of the crusher,
vill be fed to the drying HAZEMAK SAPT crusher of 150 tons per hour capacity
in appropriate quantities, regulated by the automatic drive system. To dry
the rav material, the crusher vill also be supplied with hot air from the
hot air generator of 12.106 Kcal/h at 750'C.
In the crusher, the stone will be reduced from max. 800 x 800 x
800 mm to max. 20 mm vith only 10% in excess of this. Humidity vill be
reduced by 4%. The crushed material vill be sent to the pre-homogenization
department by means of a conveyor belt. In the crusher an electrostatic
precipitator has been foreseen for dust collection. An automatic weighing
and sampling device will be installed at the outlet of the crusher and
connnected to the automatic drive system.
V. Pre-Homogenization
In the factory, the crushed limestoue vill be sifted and particles
coarser than 20 mm. vill be sent to the lime factory where they vill be



ANNEX 5-2
Page 4
crushed again for raw material fabrication.  After this secondary crushing,
the stone vill be sifted once more and the particles of a 8ize less than
10 mm vill be sent back to the pre-homogenization department. 2 such siftings
vill allow optimal use of the limestone between both plants.
The limestone pre-homogenization department vill be a covered hall
vith a lime storage capacity of 2 x 15,000 tons. By means of special
longitudinal shifting equipment vith a capacity of 700 tons pér hour, the
crushed limestone vill be stored and spread out in the form of layers vithin
the storage area. The limestone thus stored in layers vill be taken by
special transversal shifting equipment vith.a capacity of 300 tons per hour,
and vill be conveyed by rubber conveyors to the crude grinding department.
The clay and the sandstone homogenization department is to be a
covered hall vith a capacity of 2 x 4,000 tons of mixed clay and sandstone
and 6000 tons for iron ore, gypsum and pozzolana, equipped vith both longitu-
dinal and transversal shifting equipment vith capacities of 260 and 100 tons
per hour respectively. Retaking of the clay and sandstone mixture vill take
place by means of the transversal shifting equipment.
Iron ore, used as corrector in the raw meal, gypsum and pozzolana,
used in the cement, will also be stored in the covered clay and sandstone
pre-homogenization section. These materials vill be supplied to the factory
by means of dumper trucks or railway bine which vill be discharged into a
special hopper, after which they vill separately be conveyed to the storage
area of the pre-homogenization unit.
Iron ore, gypsum and pozzolana vill be transported the longitudinal
shifting equipment. The iron ore vill be conveyed to the crude grinding
department. The gypsum and the pozzolana vill be conveyed to the cement
grinding department by means of rubber-belt conveyers.
VI.   Crude Grinding
The limestone, the mixed clay and sandstone and the iron ore will
be taken from the bins in a proportion determined by the central automatic
drive system and will be carfted to the KAWASAKI RAZEMAK drying crusher which
will have a 150 tons per hour capacity.
Transfer of the material will occur by means of an automatic
sampling and veighing device attached to the central automatic drive system.
In normal conditions the crusher vill be heated with hot gas coming
from the kiln, so that the calorific power of the gas will be used to dry
the raw material. During start-up or when the kiln is stopped for any reason,
the crusher vill be heated by means of a hot gas generator of 7.106 Kcl/hour
at 750°C' capacity.
The raw material thus crushed and dried vill be conveyed to the
KAWASAKI grinding mill, which has a capacity of 150 tons per hour and a



ANNEX 5-2
Page 5
diameter of 4.1 meters. The output of the mill vill be sent to a KAWASAKI
separator by means of a mechanical elevator, where the coarse material vill
be separated and returned to the mill and the fine material vill be sent to
the homogenization silos by means of pneumatic meal pumps.
The gas from the hot gas generator or from the kiln vill be condi-
tioned, by means of vater injection in the conditioning tower, to meet the
physical performance requirements of the electrostatic precipitator. Its
efficiency vill be less than 50 mg/m3.
The fine raw material particles which vill be collected in the
precipitator vill be sent to the grinding mill, if it is operational, and
pumped to the homogenization silos if it is not.
The grinding department vill be fully automatic and vill run 16
hours per day and 7 days per week.
VII.   Homogenization
The ground raw meals will be stored in two homogenization silos
vith a capacity of 5,000 m3 each, an inside diameter of 15 meters and a height
of 30 meters. Storage vill take place by means of one special feeder in each
silo to spread the meals. Homogenization of the raw meals vill be continuous
at the bottom of the silos, at a height of about 5 to 6 meters, by means of
the Claudius Peters system. The homogenized raw meal vill be automatically
removed from the silos and fed to a one-kiln alimentation bin, the level of
which vill be maintained by an automatic level control. The raw meal vill
be transported to the bin by air slides and a mechanical elevator. A bag
dust filter is foreseen on top of each silo. The raw meal vill be taken
from the constant level bin and automatically weighed and sampled before being
sent by pneumatic pumps to feed the kiln. The raw material flow vill be
regulated by the central drive system.
VIII.   Kiln
This vill consist of a dry-process, short rotary kiln with a
capacity of 1.500 tons/h., a diameter of 4.5 m and a length of 75 m. It
vill be provided with an air-supended heat exchanger, consisting of five
superimposed cyclones. These five cyclones vill be superimposed in the
form of four floors, with one each on the first three floors, and two on
the last. The botton one will have a diameter of 6.8 m; the second one a
diameter of 6.4 m; the third, a diameter of 6.1 m; while the last two vill
have diameters of 3.7 m each.
The kiln will be followed by a FOLAX system air-floated clinker
cooler of 5 compartments of 3.36 m x 20.42 m. The kiln will burn Algerian
natural gas and will be driven by a fully automatic system. The safety of
the burning zones of the kiln shell vill be ensured by a set of ventilators.
For the safety of the cyclones, a vater-injection system is foreseen. The



ANNEX 5-2
Page 6
burning zone of the kiln and the cooling zone of the clinker cooler will both
be watched by means of industrial television sets placed on the central
drive control board. The teperature of the clinker after the cooling process
vill not be above 600C. After the cooler, there will be a crusher for the
purpose of reducing the oversized clinker. The output of the kiln will be
automatically weighed after which it vill be transported to either the clinker
silos or the cement mill bin by means of a chain conveyor and mechanical
elevator system. The dust of the clinker cooler vill be collected by a gravel
filter with an efficiency of 50 mg. per m3.  The kiln department vill run
without interruption.
Dumper loading facilities are foreseen between the automatic
weighing system and the cooler to enable transportation of the kiln product
in case of need.
IX.   Clinker Storage
As described above, the cooled clinker will be stored in six silos
with a capacity of 5,000 tons each, 15 meters inside diameter and a height of
27 meters. The total clinker storage capacity is 30,000 tons and meets the
storage needs for twenty days kiln production. The silos vill have automatic
extraction devices providing for the possibility of mixing different kinds of
clinkers, and also for the purpose of mixing clinkers to improve or maintain
the quality of the cement. The extracted and mixed clinkers vill be trans-
ported to the cement mill bin by means of rubber conveyors and mechanical
elevators.
The clinker dust from the storage department vill be collected in
bag filters on the top of the silos, and by the one bag filter common to
all six silos.
Clinker from open air storage will be taken by loader and dumper
trucks, using the gypsum and pozzolana storage and transporting system for
this purpose.
X.   Cement Grinding
The clinker, gypsum and pozzolana vill be kept at a constant level
in their respective bins. The materials vill be fed to the KAWASAKI mill
which vill have a capacity of 100 tons/h and a diameter of 4.4 meters. The
output of the cement mill vill be sent to the KAWASAKI dynamic separator
by means of a mechanical elevator, and there the coarse particles cf cement
vill be separatel and recycled to the mill. The resulting cement, of
3,000 - 3,500 cm /gr Blaine, vill be transfered to storage silos by means
of pneumatic cement pumps.  The circulation air of the grinding system will
be dedusted by means of a bag filter of 50mg/m3 efficiency.  The department
vill run 15 to 19 hours a day, and vill be fully automatic.



ANNEX 5-2

XI.   Cement Storage and Bagging Department:
The pumped cement vill be stored in five silos of 5,000 tons each,
each having an inside diameter of 15 meters and a height of 28 meters, with
a total storage capacity of 25,000 tons. It is intended to reserve:
2 silos for CPA 350,
1 silo for CPA 400,
1 silo for ASTM IV, and
1 silo for special cements.
The cement vill eventually be taken from the bottom of the silos
and transported by air slide to:
Three truck-tanker loading stations vith a capacity
of 250 tons per hour each;
-    Two wagon tanker loading stations vith a capacity of
350 tons per hour each;
-    Two bagging installations vith a capacity of 50 tons
per hour each; and
-    One bagging station of 100 tons per hour capacity.
The two bagging installations vill feed:
-    Three truck and two wagon bag loading stations each
of 120 tons per hour capacity.
The lay-out is such that all loading stations can be fed from all
silos. Handling facilities are operated in 8-hour shifts, 5 days per week.
For dust protection, there vill be five bag filters at the top of
the silos and three others in3the expedition pits. All these filters vill
have an efficiency of 50 mg/mr
XII.   Electrical Installation
Distribution of electrical power on the plant site is assured by
5.5 and 0.4 kV installations.  There vill be five sub-stations, one in the
quarry and the others in the factory. An emergency generator of 450 kVA vill
installed. Close to the ACR motors, a manual local command board vill be
installed for security and maintenance purposes. Regulation of the tension
under charge vill be within limits of ±107.9.
XIII.   Centralized Automatic Control System
Control of all the equipment between raw meal clinker fabrication
(excluding the limestone crushing and storing system) and cement production



ANNEX 5-2
Page 8
(excluding the bagging plant) will be manual, semi-manual or fully automatic
from the centralized control board.
All the control device indicators, the ammeters on the motors, the
indicators of temperatures, pressures and status, will be installed on the
process panel of the centralized control board. The system will use
computers the functions of which will include:
(i)  automatic starting and stopping of all production lines, and
(ii)  semi- or full automatic regulation of the raw meal - clinker
and cement lines by:
-    maintaining adequate control devices;
-    regulating the flow of material, as vell as the
flow of circulating gas and air, for adequate raw
meal, clinker, and cement production (This will
take place by acting on the feeders of the materials,
following the automatically analyzed sample results,
and checking the condition of the air, gas and material
circulating in the process Unes.);
-    signalling defects in production lines; and
-    keeping a conduct data jounal of each production line.
The operator will retain the possibility of taking manual control
of the production lines, entirely or sectionally.
The required computer program will be developed and implemented by
KHI in close collaboration vith SNMC and SOCADEI after production start-up
and preliminary acceptance of the installations.
XIV.   The Laboratory
The laboratory will be adequately equipped for the performance of
physical analyses and chemical tests on cements produced, in accordance
with international standards and norms.
XV.   Mechanical and Electrical Workshops and Warehouse
The mechanical and electrical workshops will be equipped with
lathes, as well as drilling, milling, shaping, plate curving, cutting and
welding machines, and light and heavy tools for use in preventive and repair
purposes. A crane suitable for the lifting of equipment is foreseen in each
department. The warehouse will be situated near the workshop and will be
big enough to store all spare parts and consumables.



ANNEX 5-2
Page 9
XVI.   Administrative and Social Services Facilities
The central building will house all the administrative and technical
departments, the laboratory, the workshops, and the varehouse. The automatic
control unit and computer will be located in the same building.  An infirmary
and sanitary installations are foreseen near the central building.
Other installations vill include: (i) A complete telephone and
telex system; (ii) A fire extinguishing system with a special vater distri-
bution line; (iii) a lightening-conductor system for the whole plant; (iv)
a canteen Mi) and (v) staff housiag.
D.   Capacities, Contractual Guarantees and Penalties
4.        Table 1 summarizes the capacity, specific pover and calorific
consumption, supplier guarantees and penalties for each major equipment
item.
The plant has a guaranteed specific electrical consumption of
130 KWh/ton of cement and a specific calorific consumption of 842.1 - 944.3
kcal/kg/clinker.
From the turn-key contractor's point of view, project completion
will be attained when the production line reaches an average of 100% of the
foreseen guarantees, with fully automatie drive, in 15 consecutive days.
If the project is not realized within the fixed schedule and if the pro-
duction lines do not reach the foreseen guarantees, penalty clauses will
be imposed vithin internationally agreed limits, i.e., the maximum penalty
rate vill not exceed 10% of the foreign exchange cost of the equipment.
5.        Plant design includes ample security margins in all but the kiln
and cooler installations. Possible doubling of capacity is allowed for in
the plant layout. If an expansion to 1 million tpy vere to take place, all
existing equipment and infrastructure would be adequate except for crude
grinding and homogenization facilities, the kiln, the cooler and the cement
grinding equipment. The incremental capital coet of such an expansion has
been estimated at $85 million in 1975 prices.
6.        However, in addition to justifiable security margins and provisions
for capacity extension, the plant includes overdesign of the raw material
quarrying and handling equipment, the limestone crusher and the dispatching
facilities. Information on the extent of this overcapacity is given below:
(a) Limestone Crusher
The Saida plant complex requires crushed limestone to
operate the cement plant and limestone factory. The
quantities needed vary according to plant capacities as
follows:



ANNEX 5-2
Page 10
Plant Capacities                     Crushed Limestone
(1) 1,500 tpd clinker
300 tpd quicklime                       2,900 tpd
(2) 20% capacity increase                     3,580 tpd
(3) 100% capacity increase                    6,800 tpd
The limestone crusher foreseen in the KHI-contract has a
maximum capacity of 700 tons per hour and will average not
less than 600 tons per hour. Depending on the number of
working days and hours, this results in the following
available capacities:
Capacities
(tpd)
Maximum  Average  Requirement
Work Schedule                 (700 tph) (600 tph)   (400 tph)
5 days/wk - 6 hr/day                  4,200      3,600      2,400
5 days/wk - 8 hr/day                  6,600      4,800      3,200
6 days/wk - 8 hr/day                  6,300     5,400       3,600
5 days/wk -12 hr/day                  8,400      7,200      4,800
7 days/wk -16 hr/day                 12,600    10,800       7,200
As illustrated above, the proposed 600-700 tph crusher is
much more than enough to meet the plant's requirements.
Clearly a crusher of only 400 tph capacity, operated
5 days per week for 8 hr per day, would be adequate for
present plant. The same crusher operated (as the crude
grinding department currently operates) in 2 shifts
of 8 hr each for 6 days per week would also meet plant
requirements even after a 100% capacity expansion of the
cement and lime plants.
(b)  Dispatch Facilities
Over-capacity is even more pronounced in the bagging plant
and bulk handling facilities. The total daily plant
output could, as presently proposed, be handled--either
bagged or in bulk by rail or truck--in a 6-hour working
day, clearly indicating a gross misallocation of resources.

5 days/wk - 6 hr/day          1,500 tpd    1,500 tpd  2,100 tpd
6 days/wk - 8 hr/day          2,250 tpd    2,250 tpd  3,150 tpd
7 days/wk -16 hr/day          4,500 tpd    4,500 tpd  7,100 tpd
One of the reasons for the overcapacity in the raw material crush-
ing, handling and cement dispatching facilities is the assumption of only
6 working hours for 5 days per week--comparable plants in Europe work crush-
ing and dispatching facilities either on two shifts or at least on a 6 days
per week, 8 hour per day schedule. Although manpower requirements are
relatively easy to meet since most of the personnel is unskilled labor,
SNMC's choice of working hours undoubtedly leads to a gross underutilization
of capacity.

ALGERIA
SNMC EXPANSION PROJECT
SAIDA CEMENT PLANT - INFRASTRUCTURE AND UTILITIES
A.   Introduction
1.        The plant site is located about 1.5 km from the limestone deposit
of Oum el Djerane, vest of the departuental road from Oum el Djerane to
Manora, and about 25 km from Saida. The actual plant layout vill require
about 34,000 m2 and SNNC las acquired land of 25 ha. On the same plant site,
SNMC plans to build a lime factory vith a capacity of 100,000 tpy. Geotech-
nical studies of the site have been completed and earth moving and site
preparation works are underway. Details are given on the attached map (IBRD
No. 11669).
B.   Infrastructure
Roads
2.        In general, the road net-work in the Saida region is well developed.
The site of the factory and all necessary raw material deposits are near
national or departmental bitiminous surfaced roads, adequate for average
speeds of 80 km/hr. Rehabilitation of the national road, Saida-Oum el
DJerane-Manora, is underway.
3.        The site vill be connected to the national Saida-Oum el DJerane-
Manora road by a new road of about 1 km. To connect the plant site with
the clay deposit of Sidi Minoun North a road of 15 km will be constructed.
This project may be abandoned if studies on the clay deposit at Ain el
Hadjar are positive. In this case a road of only 2 km vill be constructed
to connect the deposit with the national road about 36 km from the plant site.
4.        All new road construction vill be the responsibility of SNMC.
Railroad
5.        A railway link vill be constructed between the plant site and
SNCPA's 1/ narrow gauge railroad network near Ain el Hadjar to allow the
distribution of cement and lime by rail. The connection requires about 25 km
of rail, representing the single largest infrastructure investment for
this project.
1/   This rail link will be owned and operated by SNMC.



ANNEX 5-3
Page 2
6.        A French consulting firm, Jardin Billard, has been contracted by
SNMC to undertake engineering design and execution supervision. The pre-
liminary engineering results, determining the optimal route for the railvay
line, have recently been completed. SNMC, and not SNCFA, vill be responsible
for the construction of the link. SNMC plans to engage a local construction
firm and vill procure on its own account the major materials and supplies
according to Bank guidelines.
Housing
7.        As in many parts of Algeria, there is an acute housing shortage
in the Saida area. Construction of SNMC's cement and lime plant complex
at Saida vill require provision of housing, social, health and educational
facilities for at least 300 families, of which 50-150 do not yet live in
the area. In Algeria, industrial enterprises are not supposed to construct
housing for their personnel since the Ministry of Housing coordinates and
executes the country's housing expansion. Housing investment requirements
have therefore not been taken into account in the capital cost or financial
and economic rate of return calculations.
C.   Utilities
Water
8.        Water vill be pumped from vells.  The simmary hydrological studies
show that the water sheet around the plant site is about 30 meters deep and
is situated on a dolomitic formation. Its capacity is expected to meet the
needs of the cement and lime plants, estimated at 500 ton per day or 12 lb/sec.
The vater vill be used: (a) in the general cooling system of the
equipment; (b) in the conditioning towers of the electrostatic precipitator
for humidifying and cooling the hot gas of the kiln; (c) in the cement mill
for cooling; (d) in the kiln, in emergency cases, for protecting the cyclones;
(e) for lime production; and (f) for sanitary purposes and human consumption.
In order to economize on water, the general cooling system vill
operate on a closed circuit in both the cement and the lime plant. Only
evaporated vater vill be compensated for by fresh vater.
9.        SNMC is presently negotiating vith a vater research firm for
the drilling of deep wells.
Electricity
10.       The Salda cement plant, rated at 500,000 tpy of clinker, vill have
a total annual electricity consumption of 65.106 kwh, or a consumption of
about 130 kwh per ton of cement. The Saida lime factory, vith a capacity
of 100,000 tpy of lime, will have a total annual electrical energy consumption
of 2.5 106 kwh, which amounts to a consumption of 25 kwh per ton of lime.
The total consumption therefore is estimated at 68.106 kwh.



ANNEX 5-3
Page 3
il.       Power requirements vill be met by SONELGAZ, 1/ the state elec-
tricity and gas company. To meet SNMC's needs for the cement-lime complex,
SONELGAZ has been asked to install a double energy line of 60 hw tension
and 2.20 MVA capacity between its substation in Saida and the plant site
(30 km). Preliminary discussions between SNMC and SONELGAZ indicate no
problems; a supply contract should be signed shortly and pover availability
vill be assured during the construction phase.
12.       As part of the turnkey contract, a substation vill be installed
on the plant site to distribute the required power. The substation (capac-
ity: 2.175 KVA and 30/5.5 RV tension) vill operate vith 2 transformers of
17.5 MVA and 60/5.5 KV tension each. One of these transformers acts as a
standby since the capacity of one alone meets the pover needs of both the
cement and lime plants.
. Gas
13.       The cement and lime plants vill use Algerian natural gas as fuel.
Estimated annual consumption of the cement plant is 53.106 m3 of natural
gas at 1 bar pressure. Specific consumption for the production of cement
is about 900 kcl/kg of clinker. The lime factory vill have an annual con-
sumption of 10.106 m3 of natural gas at 1 bar pressure. The specific
consumption for the production of lime is about 850 kcl/kg of lime.  The
total annual gas consumption of both plants vill therefore be about 63.106 m
of natural gas at 1 bar.
14.       The gas vill be supplied by SONELGAZ from its distribution
center currently under construction north of Saida. In principle, SONELGAZ
has agreed to construet a pipeline between the distribution center and the
plant site and provide the required quantity of gas at 5 bar pressure. To
control the distribution of gas between the cement and lime factory, SONELGAZ
plans to install its own pressure reducing station at the site. SNMC has
requested SONELGAZ to design its pipeline taking into account a possible
doubling of plant capacities.
15.       SONELGAZ has already started to undertake topographical studies
for the construction of the pipeline. A supply contract between SONELGAZ
and SNMC should be signed shortly.

ECOLOGY
A.   INTRODUCTION
The ecological problems posed by dry-process cement plants are
generally (i) air pollution from dust and gases; (il) noise pollution from
crushers and mills; and (iii) water pollution from the sewer drainage of
sanitary installations.
2.        Algerian pollution control regulations for industrial enterprises
are being revised by the Ministry of Public Health and are scheduled to be
published in the near future.
B.   THE SAIDA CEMENT PLANT
3.        SNMC's anti-pollution requirements for the design of the plant fit
the standards generally applied in Western Europe. SNMC follows these rela-
tively strict pollution standards in all of its projects including the Saida
Cement plant.
1)   Dust Pollution
4.        The design of the Saida plant avoids dust production from open-air
storage. The pre-homogenization pit will be covered and clinker storage
provided in silos. At the same time, each dust-producing location within
the factory will be equipped with electrostatic precipitators, with gravel
filters, cyclones and bag-filters adapted to the physical condition of the
dusty gases.
In3 all cases the maximum dust discharge into the air will be less
than 50 mg/m under normal atmospheric conditions.
There will be an electrical precipitator for the kiln and clay
crusher, a gravel filter at the clinker cooler, cyclones for primary coarse
precipitation needs and bag filters at all other dust producing places.
6.        The total cost of the dust prevention equipment will account for
6.9% of the total equipment cost, not including electrical motors, installation
and civil engineering construction. With a good maintenance program the
Saida plant should not have any dust pollution problem.



ANNEX 5-4
Page 2
2)   Gas Pollution
7.        The Saida cement plant vill use Algerian natural ias as fuel.  The
chemical composition of the natural gas shows 0.30 mg per m of sulphur at
1 bar pressure.
After combustion of the natural gas in the kiln, the level of SO2
in the burnt gas will be about 5 mg/m3 under normal conditions.
In the kiln, sulphates from the SO 2 ill tend to combine with
alkalis from the raw meal, so 3the level of SO in the output of the chimney
will be much less than 5 mg/m
In the project, a 60 meter cn±ney is foreseen.  The total output
of the gases will be about 2,500 m3imin.
8.        Taking into consideration the prevailing direction of the wind
and the site2of the factory, the dispersion of gas from the chimney will be
such that SO pollution will always be much lower than the maximum admissible
level of 1,000 micro rams per m3, and with have an arithmetic annual mean of
100 micrograms per m.
3)   Alkali Pollution
9d        Alkali pollution in a cement plant usually comes from waste
slurries when the wet process is used and from cyclone by-passes of the
kiln heat exchanger when the dry process is used with high alkali content
raw materials. A periodic discharge from the by-passes is necessary to
prevent the cyclones forming by recrystalization.
10.       The Saida cerent plant, a dry process plant, vill use raw materials
vithout a harmful level of alkalis, so that a by-pass system is not necessary
in the kiln. Consequently, the plant is not likely to have any alkali
pollution problem.
4)   Noise Pollution
il.       All noise-producing equipment will be housed inside buildings.
The noisiest part of the factory will be the grinding department. In con-
ventional factories, when the mill is being fed with raw material, the noise
level can reach 100 dB 1/, with a normal noise level of about 90 dB. In
the Saida plant, all the grinding departments will be driven and controlled
from the central command board far away from the installation.
1/ dB = decibel.



ANNEX 5-4
Page 3
12.       Mill equipment will be periodically checked by special teams and
no permanent operating department personnel is foreseen. Any worker exposed
to the noise, will, therefore, have to endure 90 dB for a few hours only.
Normally, this noise can be endured for a period of about 8 hours.
5)   Sewage
13.       The sewage of the Saida plant, its main administrative building
and social installations, will be collected in sewage pits. After being
asepticized by the usual biochemical process, it will either be dried in
a dry-well, or will be evacuated into the main rain drainage system of
the factory.

MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS, TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
A.  Manpower Requirements of the Saida Cement Plant
1.        SNMC estimates that 210 people--including directorial, administra-
tive and technical personnel--will be required to operate the Saida cement
plant. The breakdown by skill level for the production department is shown
below; it does not include 27 administrative staff for the plant manager's
office, accounting and general services department.

2.        The total manpower requirement is relatively high for a fully
automated 500,000 tpy cement plant.  It is due to:
(a) the additional labor needed to exploit and transport
raw materials from 3 geographically dispersed quar-
ries, and



ANNEX 5-5
Page 2
(b) plant operation by a single team, working only 8 hours
per day, five days a week, in all but the kiln and main-
tenance department.
B.   Training Program for the Saida Plant
3.        As part of the turnkey contract, Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI),
is responsible for the training of all engineers and technicians for the
Saida cement plant.  KHI submitted a 3-phase training program (attached
chart, page 4) which foresees:
-    first phase:  SNMC engineers with experience in
the cement industry will be sent to KHI instal-
lations or associated cement plants for a period of
12 months, in order to be trained as instructors.
Upon their return to Algeria, they will organize
courses, assisted by a KHI instructor, for the
newly-recruited engineers, technicians and oper-
ators who are later to participate in the train-
ing program at KHI or cement plants.  The duration
of this introductory course in Algeria will be six
months.
-    second phase:  the staff already trained in Algeria
will spend time at the turnkey contractor's workshop
and plants. These courses vary from 3-9 months
depending on job specification.
-    third phase:  shortly before and after production
startup, KHI's instructors will organize comple-
mentary training courses in the Saida plant involving
all engineers, technicians and operators.
Most of the training in KHI workshops will be in Japan. For
instruction in cement plants, KHI has made arrangements with European cement
manufacturers.
4.        The training program appears to be adequate and is comparable to
programs followed by other cement producers. Its success, however, will
depend, not only on the quality of KHI training courses, but on the skill,
motivation and continuity of the recruited Algerian staff.
C.   SNMC General Training Program
5.        SNMC is currently implementing an ambitious expansion of its dry
process cement plants. By 1980, at least 12 plants are scheduled to be in oper-
ation, all being run by local staff and only two having been Droducing for more than
7 years. SNMC will require 55 engineers, 616 technicians and 300 skilled
or semi-skilled workers to meet this target.



ANNEX 5-5
Page 3
6.        To train the required staff, all contracts for new cement plants
include substantial training components under the responsibility of the
turnkey contractor. In 1974 SNMC decided to create a Permanent Technical
Training Center for the manufacture of building materials. The program of
the institution should not try to substitute for the training conducted
by the suppliers but (i) should supplement their program by on-the-job
instruction in SNMC's existing units and classroom work; (ii) should offer
courses for recyling and skill improvement for SNMC's existing staff; and
(iii) should provide introductory instruction for newly-recruited personnel.
7.        SNMC intends to start with a nucleus of courses by end 1976.
Location of the center will be at one of the cement-brick-lime production
complexes at Hadjar-Soud or Meftah.  SNMC has approached two cement
manufacturers and consulting firms (Asland, Spain and Lafarge, France)
to design the curriculum of the center and to conduct its courses during
the first 2-4 years. UNIDO has shown some interest in providing technical
assistance for the Training Center. Such technical assistance has still
to be defined in further discussions with SNMC and UNIDO representatives,
but could include secondment of experts to elaborate the center's program
or to conduct courses and granting of fellowships to Algerian instructors
or technicians for training abroad.
8.        Independent of these programs, all plants offer their own
independent training activities such as courses in promotion, maintenance,
safety, Arab culture, etc.
D.   Technical Assistance
9.        As in SNMC's other new cement plants, in the case of Saida, the
turnkey contractor's responsibility regarding training and operating ends
with the successful completion of the performance tests and the final
acceptance of the plant by SNMC. In 1974 SNMC signed a frame technical
assistance contract with Lafarge. The contract stipulated that Lafarge
will make available to SNMC, at the latter's request, qualified technical
personnel to assist in the operation of SNMC's cement plants. The agreement
offers SNMC a comfortable degree of technical backup. However, with 7 new
cement plants coming on stream during the next 5 years, SNMC might need
substantial outside expert assistance which Lafarge with its large but
nevertheless limited pool of qualified personnel may not be able to provide.
In view of this, SNMC has also regotiated similar technical assistance
contracts with Asland and COMSIP Automation.
10.       Although SNMC's training program is commendable and the frame
agreements provide some valuable assistance, SNMC ought to take affirmative
action to assure the availability of outside technical assistance after the
final acceptance of the plant. As foreseen under the loan, such assistance
can be provided, as it has been the first new SNMC plants, by a permanent
team from the Consulting engineer, or by recruiting experienced technicians
to fill the key positions and to continue training of staff.

SNNC EXPANSION PROJECT
SAIDA CEMENT PLANT - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Turn-key Approach
1.        Since 1971, SNMC has signed contracts for the construction of 7
cement plants. All but the two first plants are to be executed under the
turn-key approach. The Algerian Government and SNMC realize that under normal
circumstances the construction of a cerent plant on the basis of procure-
ment of individual packages offers certain economies, the advantage of
optimal equipment choices and generally lower capital costs in comparison
with a cement plant constructed under a turn-key arrangement. The extent
of such economic and financial advantages is difficult to quantify.  SNMC
believes, however, that in the special case of Algeria at the present stage
of its economic development, the execution of cement plants under turn-key
contracta offer certain advantages which outweigh possible savings in direct
capital costs:
(a) SNMC has a motivated but small technical staff which is
clearly insufficient to prepare and design - or even supervise
- the parallel construction of more than 3 cement plants. To
realize the investment targets of the 4-Year Plans (1970-73) and
(1974-77), SNMC had, therefore, to choose between heavy
reliance on foreign consulting firms or adopting the turn-key
approach. After its rather strained experiences with consulting
firms responsible for the construction of SNMC's two first dry
process plants (Meftah and Hadjar Soud), SNMC opted for the
turn-key concept.
(b)  a turn-key contract offers the advantage of single contractor
responsibility.  It eliminates day-to-day involvement in plant
execution and minimizes the coordination tasks for the sponsoring
company, at the same time as it provides completion dates, per-
formance guarantees and prices for which only a single party
can be held accountable.
2.        Turn-key offers for the Saida cement plant were invited in November
1973, following pre-qualification and ICB procedures according to the Bank's
guidelines and including 2-stage bidding. The lowest evaluated bidder -
Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) - was prepared to undertake only engineering
and supervision of the plant's civil works component without their actual
execution. SNMC therefore agreed to contract separately for the civil
construction works.



ANNEX 5-6

Plant Design and Supervision of the Turn-key Contractor
3.        Although the Saida cement plant is being implemented under a
turn-key arrangement, in 1974 SNMC engaged the services of a French cement
consulting firm, SOCADEI, a Lafarge subsidiary. During the planning and
preliminary design phase, SOCADEI's main tasks vere (i) to analyze the
geological survey, (ii) to conduct all necessary physical, chemical, and
semi-production tests to determine the process choice for the various
cement manufacturing stages, (iii) to prepare procurement documents; and
(iv> to evaluate the offers.
4.        After the signing of the turn-key contract, SOCADEI remains in
charge of supervising the turnkey contractor. It will provide 120 man-months
of consulting services over 2-1/2 years. In particular, SOCADEI will under-
take and make available the following staff for particular functions:
Construction Supervision
1 site engineer for                 24 months
2 construction engineers for        12 months
1 mechanical engineer for            18 months
1 electrical engineer for             9 months
1 computer specialist for             6 months
Elaboration of Quarry Exploitation Plans
1 expert for                         3 months
Supervision of Commissioning
a team of 6 specialists for a 6-month period,
consisting of 2 operating engineers, 1 laboratory
specialist, 1 mechanical engineer, 1 electrical
engineer, 1 process control specialist.
The Role of SNMC
5.        SNMC's responsibilities during project implementation will include:
(a) execution of geotechnical studies of the site,
(b) construction of roads from the site to the deposits,
(c) construction of the railroad link (Annex 5-3),
(d) drilling of wells for water supply (Annex 5-3),
(e) provision for power and gas supply (Annex 5-3),



ANNEX 5-6
Page 3
(f) contracting for and execution of the civil vorks com-
ponents of the project, 1/
(g)  inspection of the main equipment in the contractor's
workshops, and
(h) coordination with SOCADEI in supervision of the turn-key
contracts during start-up tests, the provisional accept-
ance tests and in performance tests of the production
facilities.
A Saida project team vas appointed in 1974 to develop the plant design in
coordination with SOCADEI. It vill now be transferred to the plant site to
participate in construction supervision. This team will be strengthened by
the recruitment of new staff as plant construction progresses and as team
members are partly trained for production assignments in the plant.
Project Implementation Schedule
6.        KHI prepared a preliminary time schedule for plant implementation
which is shown in the attached chart. A detailed PERT program has also been
elaborated. Production start-up is scheduled for December 1978, i.e. 32
months after contract effectiveness.
1/   Technical responsibility for engineering and superv ision, however,
remains with KHI.

1.        The capital cost estimates summarized in Page 1 are based on
May 1, 1975 prices, with the exception of the turn-key contract signed with
KHI for the supply of equipment and spare parts, erection of equipment,
construction supervision and training of personnel and representing 65% of
capital costs. The turnkey contract is a fixed price contract without price
escalation clauses and was signed in April 1975. All other items are estimated
on the basis of 1975 price quotations or actual costs for other cement projects
in Algeria.

3.        Detailed design of building and civil works and supervision of
construction, as well as supply of the steel structure, will be provided for
by Kawasaki as part of the turnkey contract. The actual execution of civil
works still has to be contracted under a separate contract and is shown
above as items (e) and (f).   Site prepation includes geotechnical studies
and earthmoving on the plant site. These have been completed by DNCNP, an
Algerian civil constructor which has also been involved in the construction
of SNMC's Meftah and Hadjar Soud plants. The cost of DA5.68 million represents
the actual contract price as of May 1975. On-site infrastructure includes the
internal road network, sewage and drainings disposal, service ducts (electrical
cables, water and gas pipes), drainage and fencing of the plant area.
5.        Foundations, main and ancillary buildings include plant foundations,
construction of production departments, storage areas, silos and administrative
buildings including warehouses and workshops. Estimates are based on compara-
ble 1974 costs for the El Asnam and Setif cement plants and on the 1975 quota-
tion of Five Lille-Babcock for the Saida cement plant. Specifications have
been prepared by Kawasaki and ICB procurement procedures following Bank guide-
lines have been initiated. The civil vorks construction contract should be
signed shortly.

8.        25 ha of land have been purchased from private individuals for the
plant site and possible housing site. Quarries are not to be acquired, but
are made available by the Algerian Government.
9.        Engineering of design of a 25 km railway link is being undertaken
by Jardin Billard, a French consulting firm. SNMC plans to contract the
railway construction to an Algerian construction firm and to procure major
materials and supplies by ICB following the Bank's Guidelines. Cost esti-
mates include DA 1.8 million for the engineering study and DA 37.6 million
for the railway construction, thus assuming a cost of DA 1.44 million per km
of railway constructed, which is in line with estimates from actual cost of
a recent IBRD railway project in Algeria.
10.       Road construction includes 15 km of road for connecting the clay
quarry with the plant and 1 km of access road between the lime quarry and
the national roads. The cost estimate for roads is based on the most

pessimistic assumption. Geological studies for a clay quarry nearer the plant
site are under way. Exploitation of that quarry could decrease investment
coste for roads by DA 2 million.
11.       Electrical items designated as infrastructure consist of the
construction of two 6OkV-20MVA lines over 30 km and the installation of a
transformer station at the plant. Cost estimates have been provided by
SONELGAZ which will be responsible for construction of the line and installa-
tion of the substation.  Supply of the transformers is included in the KHI
turnkey contract. Gas connection includes a pressure reducing station (DA 0.5
million) and pipeline connection over 30 km (DA 2.05 million).
12.       Requirements for water supply to the plant include drilling of and
equipment for 4 wells located near the plant site. Several constructors have
been contacted for procurement of th«ae items and selection is under way.

13.       This item comprises DA 35.05 million for sea freight and insurance
as a part of the KHI turnkey contract and DA 2.56 million for transport over
175 km from Oran to the plant site. Cost estimates for internal transport
vere provided by SONATIMAT, 1/ an Algerian company which will be responsible
for local transportation. KHI is obliged to insure itself locally with CAR,
the Algerian State insurance enterprise.

ANNEX 5-7
Page 5
Temporary installations cover water and electricity supply, telephone and
telex facilities during construction. Salaries covered under pre-operating
expenses are the salaries paid to SNMC personnel assigned to the Saida project
during the period mid-1975 to mid-1978. This estimate is based on an average
staff of 45 people for three years. Overheads include miscellaneous adminis-
trative costs and company car expenses; they are estimated to amount to 23%
of salaries. Start-up costs cover gas, power, consumables and other material
used during the commissioning period of two months. Supervision of the
commissioning is part of the SOCADEI consulting contract and the KHI turnkey
contract.
Engineering (Item 6)
15.       This item covers all engineering work for the design of plant
equipment and other consulting services. The cost estimate includes the
firm price of the SOCADEI contract (DA 12.28 million) and engineering and
design provided by Kawasaki (DA 6.53 million) under the turnkey contract,
but excludes civil engineering and design included in the cost of buildings
and civil works.
Traininfi and Technical Assistance (Item 7)
16.       An estimated DA 2.71 million for training and DA 2.80 million for
technical assistance has been added. Training costs include training fees
payable under the KHI turnkey contract and salaries and travelling expenses
for SNMC's staff. Details are given in Annex 5-5. A contract covering
technical assistance required after completion of the performance tests has
not yet been signed.  The cost estimate of such a contract is based on SNMC's
recent experience and includes the salaries and fees for 10 men years.
Duties and Taxes (Item 8)
17.       Duties and Taxes have been calculated on the basis of prevailling
tariffs as follows:
Item                  Nature of Tax          Tax Rate %
Equipment                          Import duty               3.00

ANNEX 5-7
Page 6
Duty rates vary from item to item, and the 3% applied to equlpment is an
average, taking into account the various natures of items included in
equipment.
Physical Contingencies (Item 9)
18.       To account for minor changes and omissions, a physical contingency
of 10% has been added to the base cost of all items except those for which
contracts have been signed. For the latter category, the contingency
allowance has been reduced to 5% to take into account the advanced stage
of-design and implementation.
Price Escalation (Item 10)
19.       Price escalation has been estimated on the basis of expected
world inflation rates for industrial construction and equipment, and of
the projected evolution of prices in Algeria. During the construction
period (1976-1978) the following rates have been applied to capital cost
items which are not based on already signed fixed price contracts.
Foreign equipment and construction .15% per year
Foreign services .............................      10% per year
Local equipment and supply ....... ...........       5% per year
Local salaries ..............................        7% per year
Price escalation provisions for this project total are only about 3% of total costs
since nearly 70% of all cost items are covered by fixed price contracts.
Allocation of Capital Costs Between the Saida Cement and Lime Plant
20.       The Saida cement plant is part of a cement-line production complex
SNMC is constructing near Saida. The lime plant is still in an early plan-
ning stage. The capital cost estimates detailed above have made no attempt
to exclude the cost components which can directly or indirectly be attributed
to the lime plant, since financing for the infrastructure equipment included
in the turn-key contract has to be provided during the implementation of the
cement plant. However, for the purpose of financial and economic rate of
return calculations of the Saida cement plants, common costs have been
allocated as follows:

Assumptions
1.  Cash:  One month's operating costs only.  SNMC provides all operating units with this amount to purchase immediate production
inputs. Working capital needs for debt service, receivables or inventories are dealt with directly by SNMC.
2. Accounts Receivables: Three months of sales; long delays are anticipated since 9070 of customers are other state enterprises
or Government Agencies.   In the opinion of SNMC, however, it may be possible to cut this down to 2 months.
3.  Inventories:  a.  Materials and Supplies:  I month's requirement.
b.  Paper Bags:  1.5 months of requiremnents at DA 21 per ton of bagged cement.
c. Work in Progress: 38,500 tons at 15% of production cost.
d.  Finished Goods: 38,500 tons of clinker as cement at 80% of production cost.
4. Accounts Payable:  Two months payment delay for utilities, 3 months for paper bags.

Computation of Probable Direct and Indirect Foreign Exchange Content of
Internationally-Bid Civil Works
The Bank is prepared to finance the indirectwand direct foreign exchange cost
of the civil construction contract for the Saida cement plant under the
condition that the contract is internationally bid according to the Bank's
procurement guidelines. The contract includes construction of the plant
foundation, silos, main and ancillary buildings. It does not cover the
supply of steel and the detailed civil engineering design. The foreign
exchange component has been derived as follows:
ESTIMATED COST COMPONENTS OF THE CIVIL CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT
Local     Foreign    Total
----- (DA million) ------
Equipment                            32.45      13.91      18.54
Labor                                             -        46.36

69.55      23.18      92.73
All costs given on page 1 include 75% of the approximate price escalation
and physical contingency allowance. The remaining 25% appears as an
unallocated item. Thus, the civil construction cost listed on page 1,
DA 27.81 million, is comparable with the DA 23.18 million shown above.

production lines are scheduled to be completed in February 1978. After a
commissioning period of 4 months, provisionary acceptance of the plan is
expected for July 1978 and completion of performance guarantee tests by
December 1978. For the purpose of financial projections, it vas assumed
that the plant vill reach its nominal capacity of 1500 tons of clinker per
day gradually over the first 3 years of production start-up. During the
first year the plant wiU produce at 50% of this capacity; thereafter, the
number of operational days per year will increase from 300 to 320. These
assumptions give the following production build-up:
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982
Number of Operation Days               75      225     300      315     320
Clinker (000 Tons)                    112     337      457     472      480
Cement (000 Tons)                     117     352      477     493      500
II. Operating Costs
2.        Operating cost projections in constant 1975 terms are given in
Table 1 of this Annex. They have been calculated by SNMC based on the
design characteristics of the Saida cement plants and unit cost presently
experienced in SNMC's operating plants. At full production (1980), the
Saida plant is projected to reach operating costs of 55DA/ton in constant
1975 terms.  These costs are 10-20% lover t.an those of comparable plants in
Europe and North Africa.  The competitive cost advantage is due to the avail-
ability and the relative low price of fuel gas in Algeria. The composition
of SAIDA operating cost is as follows:
Average Production Costs
DA Per Ton               %
Labor                                     6.22              11.3
Materials, Supplies, Spares              14.66              26.6
Utilities                                21.72              39.5
Bags                                      8.40               17.1
Miscellaneous Expenses                    4.02               5.5
TOTAL                               55.02             100



ANNEX 5-11
Page 3
3.        A low operating cost level is, however, a relatively unreliable
indication for the competitiveness of a plant's ex-factory production cost.
At the present, depreciation and financial charges of new plants account for
50-70% of ex-factory production cost. A 10% increase in capital cost has
ceteris paribus the same effect on the total production cost per ton as a
70-90% fuel cost increase.
4.        The following paragraphs discuss assumptions used for pro-
jecting the individual operating cost items.
Labor
5.        Labor cost estimates are based on 1975 salaries paid by SNMC for
the relevant jobs; they include 40% social benefits and bonus. The cost of
special training and recruitment of personnel (detailed in Annex 5-5) are
scheduled to be completed before start of operations and are covered in the
pre-operating expenses. Labor costs during operation can be split into the
following categories:
Persons Employed    Labor cost
(DA Million)
Direct Labor                       115                1.51
Maintenance & Support               54                0.49
Administration                      47                1.11
216                3.11
Materials, Supplies and Spares
6.        A substantial amount of materials and supplies such as refracto-
ries, grinding medias, tyres and explosives will be imported. Raw materials
and the basic additives such as iron ore and gypsum are available locally.
The following base costs and average consumption rates have been assumed.
Consumption                Unit Price
Refractories               400g/ton of clinker    2.10 DA/kg
Grinding Media             0.6kg/ton of clinker   2.15 DA/kg
Sundry
- Fuel                                            0.60 DA/ton of cement
- Grease                                          0.25 DA/ton of cement
- Tyres                                           0.46 DA/ton of cement
- Explosives                                      0.24 DA/ton of cement



ANNEX 5-11

Iron                       8.3 kg/ton of clinker  0.08 DA/kg
Gypsum                     4.7% of clinker pro-   0.55 DA/kg
duction.
7.        The capital cost include DA 18.28 million for spare parts, a pro-
vision which should cover the demand of at least 2 years. To cover annual
costs of spares and maintenance supplies, the following amounts were added:
1978                0.5% of Equipment Value
1979                1% of Equipment Value
1980                1% of Equipmeut Value
1981 aud             1.5% of Equipment Value and 0.5% of Value
thereafter           of Buildings and Civil Works
Utilities
8.        Utility costs have been calculated as an average based on SONELGAZ'
1975 split-rate tariff and on the expected consumption of the Saida cement
plant. The specific calorie consumption of the kiln is relatively high because
of the high projected humidity of the raw materials (15%).
Consumption                Unit Price
Electricity          130 Kwh/ton of Cement            0.09 DA/Kwh
Gas                  1000 kcal/kg of Clinker
with Califoric Value of
9500 kcal/m3
Water                100,000m 3 per Year             0.5 DA/m3
Paper Bags
9.        60% of plant output will be sold bulk and 40% in bags.  SNMC does
not directly import paper bags but purchases from SONIC, 1/ the state paper
monopoly enterprise at DA 1.05 per bag or DA 21 per ton. This price,
utilized in the case estimates, is high and reflects the start-up of paper
maufacture in Algeria.
Miscellaneous Expenses
10.       Administrative expenses include office expenses, audit fees, car
expenses and miscellaneous overheads but exclude salaries. They are esti-
mated at 15% of labor costs based on the historical cost structure in other
SNMC cement plants.

ted items such as refractories, grinding media, sundries and spares) and a
1% sales tax.

SNMC EXPANSION PROJECT
Saida Cement Plant - Financial Projections
A.   ASSUMPTIONS
1.          The financial projections are based on the production plan ouXlined
in Annex 5-11. The plant is expected to start operating in the second half o:`
1978 and to reach its full production capacity by 1982. To reflect the plant's
projected cash flow positions all financial statements are in current prices.
However, financial rates of return calculations are based on data expressed in
real value terms (Annex 5-14).
2.          Net Sales:  At present, Algeria's pricing policy for  cement is
based on the 1973 average cost of domestic production, and imported cement plus
a margin for distribution and profit. It entirely fails to take into account
either the very sharp rise that has occurred in import prices or the changing
cost structure of the domestic industry as new and more expensive plants come
on-stream.   For the purposes of the financial projections, therefore, this
policy has been replaced by that agreed upon during negotiations: viz that
SNMC will set cement prices at a level sufficient to cover full costs plus a
margin to cover debt service obligations associated with the cement sector.
However, to reflect likely world market prices, it has been assumed that, after
1980, the cement price will not fall but, instead, will increase in line with
world inflation, i.e. at approximately 7% per annum.  Thus prices will rise to
about DA 205/ton by 1978, fall to DA 180/ton in 1980 and will increase thereafter
in current, though not in real, terms.
3.          Operating Cost assumptions used in calculating these costs in
constant terms are elaborated in Annex 5-11. Projections in current terms
are based on the following inflation rates;
Labor:                 7% p.a.
Local supplies:        5% p.a.
Foreign supplies:    15% for 1975-77
10% for 1978
8% for 1979
7% thereafter
4.          Depreciation:  The depreciation schedule follows the legally
required rates, whereby assets have to be amortized or depreciated as follows:
Building and civil works                 : 20 years
Infrastructure                           : 20 years
Quarry equipment                         : 10 years
Rolling stock                             :  5 years
Other equipment                           :  15 years
Spares                                   : 15 years
Pre-operating expenses                    :  5 years
Engineering & Technical Assistance        :  5 years
Interest during construction             : 10 years



ANNEX 5-12
Page 2
5.          Taxes:  State enterprises in Algeria pay taxes on their consolidated
earnings and, hence, the Saida plant - which will be a separate accounting unit
for control purposes - will not be autonomous for tax purposes. The theoretical
tax rate is based on 50% of net profits and this rate has, therefore, been applied
in the financial projections. In addition, contributions may also be made to
the State budget (50% of profit after taxes) and to workers (25% of profit after
taxes). However, these are extremely hypothetical payments and have, therefore,
been excluded from the projections.
6.          Financing Plan and Financial Charges:  As outlined in Annex 2-1, in
the Algerian public enterprise system the notion of equity does not exist, and
all new projects and replacement investments are financed by loans. Financial
charges are, therefore, capitalized during construction and charged to the
income statement as of start-up. They have been calculated on the basis of
the following finaneing plan:
Supplier's Credit:    SNMC has signed a supplier's credit agreement providing
DA 224.4 million, or US$ 57.1 million, to cover 70%
of the foreign exchange costs of the KHI turnkey con-
tract. Terms and conditions of this credit are very
concessionary: DA 29.4 million are lent at 8-1/2% p.a.
interest for 8 years including 3 years of grace and
DA 195 million at 8% p.a. interest with a repayment of
13 years including 3 years of grace. Repayment is on the
basis of equal principal plus interest.
IBRD Loan:             The Bank loan to SNMC includes a loan component of
DA 120.7 million (US$ 30.8 million) for financing of the
Saida cement plant (Annex 5-9). The loan will be given
for 15 years including a grace period of 4 years. Interest
is assumed to be 10%, including the 1.5% guarantee fee payable to
to the Government of Algeria. Repayment of the loan is
assumed to be on equal principal plus interest.
Local Financing:       It is assumed, on the basis of agreements reached with SNMC
and the Government, that residual financing for the Saida plant
will be provided by BAD, BEA, or by Treasury advances which
will cover working capital requirements of DA 31.8 million
(US$ 8.1 million) through 1979. Terms of these loans will not
be less favorable than those of the IBRD loan. For the
financial projections, it has been assumed that they will
be for 16 years, including 4 years of grace, at an interest
rate of 5.5% p.a. , based on constant annunity.
7.        Treasury Grants and Intra-SNMC Transfers:  The projections also include
provision for losses incurred by the Saida plant to be covered either by direct
Treasury grants or, in line with the proposed pricing policy, by intra-company
transfer. It has been assumed that treasury grants will be made until the plant
ls operating at full capacity and will be based on the difference between the actual
unit cost in each start-up year and the unit cost in the first year of full production.
The remainder of the plant's losses will be financed by SNMC funds. In addition, the
projections foresee further intra-SNMC transfers, if necessary, in order to maintain
a debt service coverage of 1.1 times for the Saida plant. By 1987, it is expected
that grants and transfers will total about DA 370 million (US$ 94 million).

3.         The very high break-even points are a function of (i) a pricing
policy based on the .cost structure of-SNMC's cement sector as a whole rather
than on that of the Sa:.da plant; (ii) financing entirely by long-term debt;
and (iii) the high capital cost of the Saida plant. The impact of the
pricing policy is illustrated in the following graphs:

SNMC CEMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
SAIDA CEMENT PLANT - FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN
AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Assumptions
i.        Cost and benefit streams used in calculating the financial rate of
return were derived from the capital cost estimates and operating cost projections
(Annex 5.9, 5.11) and exclude financial charges and depreciation. All costs
and benefits are valuedinn real terms; i.e., they have been deflated to mid-
1975 by the average world inflation rate which is assumed to be 10.8% in 1975,
9.h% in 1976, 7.5% in 1977 and 7% thereafter.
2.        Other basic assumptions used in the financial rate of return calcu-
lations are as follows:
Construction period :   4 years
Operating life            20 years
Working capital      :   Fully recovered at the
end of the project
Scrap value          :   20% of the initial value
in real 1975 terms

SNMC CEMENT EXPANSION PROJECT
SAIDA CMENT PLANT - ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
A.   Assumptions
1.        The economic cost/benefit streams shown on page 4 have been calcula-
ted on the following basis: (a) all costs and revenues are expressed in real
(i.e. mid-1975) prices; (b) the benefit stream is valued at the opportunity
cost of importing cement, since it is assumed that without the Saida cement
production, SNMC would have to import an equivalent amount of cement; (c)
production costs are calculated by using shadow pricing or world market
prices for all tradeable inputs; and (d) all transfer payments are excluded.
No shadow pricing of foreign exchange has been employed.  Although, in
Algeria foreign exchange transactions are restricted and exchange rates are
fixed by the Government, there appear to be only marginal differences between
the official and hypothetical free market foreign exchange rates.
2.        The Benefit Stream.  The economic benefit of this project is ex-
pressed by the alternative cost to Algeria of importing 500,000 tpy of
cement.  The opportunity cost of such imports has been estimated at US$58.1/
ton of cement from 1978 through 1981 and US$49.7/ton thereafter.

The FOB prices of US$29/ton and US$27/ton for bagged and bulk cement respectively
are long-term estimates of real cement prices based on projected supply and demand
in the Mediterranean Basin. The freight rate differential indicates, amongst
other things, the higher charges for denurrage likely to be experienced at bag
handling ports. Freight rates are based on likely supply sources for Algeria.



ANNEX 5-15

Paper bag costs are based on 5-ply bags for exports.  It is not expected that
Algeria will have any bulk handling facilities until Beni Saf comes on stream
towards the end of 1978. After that, it is assumed that 60% of imported cement
would be in bulk with the rest bagged. Port handling charges are currently
2-3 times those prevailing in other comparable Mediterranean ports, but it is
assumed that charges will be substantially lower at the new bulk facilities.
The estimate for local transfer is based on the average transport cost and the
distance (250 km) between the coast and Saida. Taking into account that
the market of the plant is located south of Saida, this estimate accounts
for the incremental transport cost in case of cement imports instead of
Saida plant output.
Capital Costs
3.        The capital costs used for the calculation of the economic rate
of return are similar to the capital costs used for the financial return
calculations (Annex 5-14). However, the following adjustments have been
made:
a)   To reflect the high rate of unemployment in the Saida
region, unskilled labor has been shadow priced at 60%
of market price and DA 17.15 million deducted from the
cost of building civil works and infrastructure.
b)   DA 17.53 million have been deducted which represent costs
vhich can be accounted to the quicklime plant for purchase
of land, site preparation, the railway link, connections
to gas and electricity, the clay quarry equipment and a
crusher.
c)   Duties and taxes equivalent to DA 20.02 million have
been excluded from initial investment and subsequent
replacement costs.
d)   Working capital has also been adjusted, taking into
account shadow pricing of labor and gas and the
exclusion of transfer payments in the operating
costs.
e)   Scrap values for working capital, buildings, civil works
and infrastructure have been recalculated, reflecting
changes in the base values of these items.
Operating Costs
4.        The economic operating costs are based on the operating costs
in real value terms used for the financial rate of return calculations
(Annex 5-14), but including the following adjustments:



ANNEX 5-15
Page 3
a)   Labor.  As in the case of investment costs, the cost
of unskilled labor has been shadow priced at 60% of its
financial value, i.e. an amount of DA 0.42 million per
year has been deducted from labor costs. Social charges
amounting to 30% labor costs have also be excluded.
b)   Gas.  The cost of gas used for the project has been
valued at the opportunity cost of exporting it. The
date at which these benefits would occur is the date
at which the gas would be available for export, i.e.
not at the time of usage of the gas for the project,
but at the time the gas reserves are actually exploited
without the project. At the present time, Algeria's
export capacities depend more on market prospects and
political considerations than availability of supply.
Consistent with estimates of reserves aand rates of
exploitation shown in the recent IBRD-finance SONELGAZ
project, it can be assumed that without the project the
gas would not be exploited before the year 2000. There-
fore, the economic cost of gas during the project life-
time has been valued at its financial cost, but for the
economic calculations, the incremental benefits which
would have resulted from exporting the gas used for the
project have been added in year 2000 to the operating
cost stream. These incremental benefits have been
obtained by multiplying the quantities of gas consumed
during project life with the world market price of gas
(US$1.5/million of BTU) less the financial well head
and transport costs (US$0.66/million of BTU) already
taken into account and less the liquefaction costs
(US$0.25) which would be incurred in the case of
exports.
c)   Taxes and duties included in miscellaneous expenses
have been excluded.
5.        Based on the above mentioned assumptions, the project's economic
rate of return is 10.25%.

ANNEX 5-17

ALGERIA
SNNC EXPANSION PRDJECT
SAIDA PLAUT: REGIONAI DEVELOPMENT IMPACT
A.   Introduction
1.        In many ways, Algeria represents a chronic example of a dualistic
society and the economic justification for the Saida project is closely
related to the Government's continuing policy of reducing regional differ-
entials in terms both of income and economic opportunity.
2.        At present, the modern, wage-earning sector is concentrated in
the major urban areas, which are themeelves restricted to the fertile
northern coast. The three existing industrial development poles are: (i)
the region around Algiers; (ii) the Constantine-Annaba-Skikda triangle;
and (iii) the area between Oran and Arzew. However, estimates provided by
the Secretariat d'Etat au Plan indicate that, out of a total resident popu-
lation of 14.7 million in 1973, 9 million - or in excess of two-thirds of
the population - lived in a non-urban environment and that, of these,
6.5 million, or 70%, were engaged in predominantly traditional agriculture.
In comparison, manufacturing, mining, construction, commerce, transport and
services, together, in 1966 only accounted for about 900,000 workers.
3.        Agricultural employment, however, disguises rural underemployment.
In 1973, it was estimated that only about 40% of the agriculturàl labor
force was permanently employed and that about 8% was "strongly underem-
ployed". Thus income disparities between rural and urban areas and between
agricultural and non-agricultural workers are considerable. In 1973, for
example, annual per capita consumption averaged DA 1860 (US$450) for the
urban population and only DA 540 (US$130) for the rural population.
4.        This income differential is further exacerbated by relative
access to education. Thus, for example, while approximately 82% of
children between the ages of 5 and 14 were enrolled in elementary educa-
tion in the Wilaya of Algiers in 1971-1972, comparable figures for Saida
and Saoura - in the plateau and desert regions respectively - vere 40%
and 55%.
5.        A corollary to this is the marked lack of economic opportunity
away from the relatively developed coast. For example, in 1970, 55% of
construction workers were employed in Algiers alone, 7% in Oran, 6% in
Constantine and only 0.1% in the Wilaya of Saida. A direct result of
this economic imbalance is the drift from rural areas into the already
over-populated urban centers which brings with it urban unemployment and
a widening gap between the migrant's aspirations and his actual achieve-
ment. Thus, the population of the major Northern urban centers mare than



ANNEX 5-17
Page 2
doubled from 1960 to 1966, putting an increasing strain on the Government's
capacity to meet demands for social services and amenities. One safety-
valve - though one which brings with it its own problens - is emigration,
particularly to France where about 600,000 Algerians now work. Without
this outlet, the strain on the urban areas would be even more intense. 1/
6.        In 1966, at the Ouargla Conference, the Government adopted a
policy of regional development which led to regional devolution through
the Wilaya system and to special programs for agriculture and social
services in Batna, TiziOuzou, Titteri and Tlemcen. At the national
level, however, rapid industrialization - which was the key to the first
4 Year Plan (1970-73) - inevitably aggravated the problens of uneven devel-
opment, in spite of the Governnent's deliberate policy of eliminating wealth
(as opposed to income) inequalities.  Government policies, therefore, now
aim to minimize the rural urban cleavage: (i) by redirecting industrial
growth into the outlying areas; (ii) by encouraging the stabilization of
the predominantly nomadic rural population through the provision of per-
manent social infrastructure, e.g. schools, hospitals and low-cost housing,
in or near the small country towns; and (iii) by facilitating a shift to
larger-scale, perhaps cooperative, farming techniques through Governnent-
financed irrigation works, wider accessibility of produce markets and col-
lection centers and emphasis upon agricultural education.
7.        In order to achieve these goals, the regions are given assistance
through the transfer of funds from the central budget to the local author-
ities, and the responsibility of local authorities for the preparation and
execution of investment plans has been expanded. Special integrated invest-
ment programs have been prepared for certain regions. Four of these pro-
grams, involving an expenditure of DA 2.3 billion, were included in the
1967-1969 and 1970-73 Development Plans, and a total expenditure of DA 2.7
billion was approved for Special Programs during 1972-75, in addition to
expenditures included in the 1974-77 4 Year Plan.
B.   Economic Structure and Recent Development of the Saida Region
8.        The Wilaya of Saida itself has a population of about 300,000,
widely dispersed and predominantly nomadic. Agriculture is the main
activity with about 80% drawing their income from this sector.  In
line with general Governnent policy and the particular situation in the
Wilaya, the development effort is aimed at improving living conditions
primarily by raising per capita income and settling the nomadic popula-
tion of the south. Thus, the initial thrust of development has been in
agriculture, education and housing, with the creation of an industrial
infrastructure still very much in the planning stage. A similar policy
is being followed in the neighbouring Wilayas of Bechar, Laghouat and
Adrar which are also characterized by low population density, pastoral
nomadism and an embryonic industrial infrastructure.
1/  New emigration has been very strictly limited since 1973.

9.        Under the first 4 Year Plan (1970-73), an ambitious special devel-
opment program was authorized for the Saida region through which approxi-
mately DA 1.4 billion (US$330 million) was allocated for disbursement during
the 1972-75 period. A sectoral breakdown of this allocation is shown below.
Although most of these planned investments will be realized eventually, not
more than 35% will be completed during the Plan period.

10.       Besides the Special Program, the first 4 Year Plan also included
investments of DA 106 million (US$25 million) for the Saida region, pre-
dominantly in social services, infrastructure and education. These invest-
ments, shown below, were approximately 95% achieved, though cost overruns
vere up to 20-30% on most items and about 40% of projects slipped into the

11.       Notwithstanding the impact of the Special Program and the 4 Year
Plan (1970-73), the second 4-Year Plan (1974-77) represents the Government's
major regional initiative to date. In March 1972 preparation of the Plan
was launched at the Wilayate level and it includes provision for DA 5.3
billion (US$1.3 billion) for disbursements by local Government.
12.       Estimated non-industrial investments and projected cement use in
the Wilaya of Saida are illustrated in the table below. This includes both
locally administered programs, and investments made by Central Government
agencies in the region. It does not, however, include programs which have
slipped from the first Plan period, nor does it include provision for in-
dustrial development under the region's Special Development Program.

13.       Regional development and, hence, cement consumption in the longer
term is dependent upon the extent to which economic growth becomes self-
sustaining and upon the extent to which economic linkages generate second-
ary industry, the processing of agricultural goods and the development of
a local service sector.
<a) Agriculture: Regional agriculture has been charac-
terized by poor soil and low productivity. However,
coordinated action, under the two 4 Year Plans and
the Wilaya's Special Program is now being taken
to modernize the sector, to increase arable land,
to establish collective equipment pools and to improve
access to water. Improved seed strains have been dis-
tributed, new plows have been made available, and
demonstration farms have been established. In addi-
tion, animal husbandry is being developed - particu-
larly beef and dairy cattle and sheep raising, although
the possibility of increased coimercial production of
poultry and eggs is also being investigated. Mobile
units for sheep transportation have been introduced
and a veterinary center and three dispensaries have
been constructed along with a training center for
livestock raising. At the same time, an agricul-
tural training center in the town of Saida itself
has also been expanded. While the importance of
regional agriculture should not be overestimated, it
is clear that expanded grain processing, meat packing
and tanning all could develop greatly within the next
few years.
(b) Industry: At the present time, Saida's industrial
base is very thin with only about 450 people employed
in large scale enterprises. However, plans for the

region's industrial development are ambitious. Includ-
ing projects inscribed in the 4 Year Plan (1974-77) and
in the Special Program - but excluding SNMC's own in-
vestments 1/ - industrial investment in the Wilaya of
Saida is expected to develop as shown in the following

14.       In addition to these investments, a comprehensive program of
socialized villages and urbanization is foreseen. The number of such vil-
lages is expected to grow from only one in 1973 to approximately 25 by
1980, each of which will have an average of approximately 100 housing
units plus ancillary facilities.

SNMC EXPANSION PROJECT
SNC: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
A. BACKGROUND
1.  Professional Accounting Education in Algeria
1.        In 1971, the accouuting education system in Algeria vas reorganized
by the Goverument following a number of ordinances. Three levels of account-
ants vere defined:
a.   Accounting technicians (CAP): 1/  are equivalent to holders of
the French CAP d'aide comptable degree. The degree is obtained
after about 2-3 years of specialized training in accounting.
Accounting technicians are restricted to positions equivalent
to accounting clerk in accounting firms or in accounting depart-
ments of commercial or industrial enterprises.
b.   Medium level accountants (BP): have obtained a "Brevet
professionnel" degree.  This degree requires (i) a certifi-
cate in accounting (CMTC), 21 (li) on-the-job training for
two years and (iii) a certificate in economics and legal
affairs (CED). 3/ After finishing secondary school or after
having obtained a CAP qualification, students can enroll at
the Institut Financiere et Comptable of Algiers (ITFC) for
a two-year course which prepares for the CMTC'examination.
The institute (ITFC) vas created in 1970 to train a large
number of accountants vithin a minimum time. Other insti-
tutions such as "technicom" or "lycees techniques" which
are specialized secondary schools also prepare for the BP
degree. At present, these institutions graduate about
500 medium level accountants per year.
c.   High level accountants (expert comptable):  students qualify
as "expert comptable":  after (i) a four-year university course
in Finance (licence en science financiere), (ii) two years
of practical training and (iii) passing a final State Exam.
Legally the BP graduates may enter university and study for
a Finance degree; in practice their access to university
has been restricted so far, which constitutes a severe
obstacle to professional promotion. The university degree
in Finance vas created recently, and the first students
1/   CAP:  Certificat d'Aptitude
2/   CMTC:  Certificat de maitrise des techniques comptables.
3/  CED:  Certificat d'economie et de droit.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
vill be graduating in 1975. In 1975, about 20 received
a diploma but this output should increase sharply over the
next five years. According to qualified accountants in
Algeria, these students have an excellent general back-
ground in economics, but the practical accounting educa-
tion offered at the University is poor and not vell coor-
dinated. The regulations for "expert comptable" specify'
that on the job training is part of his accounting educa-
tion and has to be performed in SNC or, at the specific
request of SNC, in a private accounting firm or temporarily
in a State Enterprise under the supervision of an "expert
comptable". As Algerian accounting firms other than the
SNC are very small, many students are expected to vork for SNC
SNC after graduation. The form cand content of the final
qualifying examination has not been defined, since no
candidates have yet reached this level.
2.        Without being specialized in accounting, other degrees prepare for
financial professions. For example, for two years the same courses are fol-
lowed by students in Business Administration and in Finance. The Ecole
Superieure de Commerce d'Alger is a business school with 80 students grad-
uating each year. It is comparable with the French system of "Grandes Ecoles",
but the Government intends to abolish this school in order to avoid competi-
tion vith the University. The Ministry of Industry has created a training
institute, INPED 1/. The institute is supposed to train people with work ex-
perience. In the last two years, about 30 executives have studied at INPED
over a period of 15 months. Although it is the policy of Government to re-
serve educational matters for the Ministry of Education, a multitude of train-
ing courses in various accounting-related fields are organized by Minis tries
or State Enterprises due to the severe lack of qualified staff and relevant
courses offered by the existing educational institutions.
3.        At the level of state enterprises, efforts are also made to improve
the professional competence of the accounting staff. Some state enterprises
have set up training departments specialized in the field of accounting,
aiming at assisting the existing staff in the fulfillment of its tasks.
4.        The massive efforts made in the training of accountants have already
produced significant results. However, if it is estimated that the need for
basic accountants has not yet been fully met, and that a critical shortage
still exists at the level of highly qualified accountants. The organization
of the expert-compatible education together with the growing experience of
the existing staff in the state enterprises should progressively improve this
situation.

Organization of the Accounting Profession in Algeria
5.        Until 1970, no clear guidelines existed for the accouuting pro-
fession. As a result, in addition to accountants working in commercial
and industrial enterprises, a great number of small independent professional
accountants established themselves. Although, according to Algerian authori-
ties, the qualifications of these accountants vere often very poor due to the
absence of regulation over professional titles, they could post impressive
titles and charge high fees to the private sector. In addition, the number
of contracts with foreign firms for auditing and organization increased rapidly.
The studies carried out by these firms were often too expensive, not adapted
to the Algerian context, and did not lmprove on the local situation. To meet
its requirements and to enforce the orderly development of the accounting
profession in Algeria, in 1967, the Goverument created SNC, 1/ a State Enterprise
for accounting, with the objectives of providing accounting assistance t-o the
public sector.
6.        In 1971, the accounting profession in Algeria came under tighter
regulation. The idea vas to maintain the private accounting sector but under
Goverament control, and to enforce professional standards. In this respect,
a "Conseil Superieur de la Comptabilite" vas created, presided over by the
Minister of Finance, and composed of representatives of various ministries,
training institutions, SNC and independent professional accountants. SNC vas
given the responsibility for furnishing the Conseil with secretarial services.
The Conseil's role is defined as (i) regulating the accounting profession by
avarding licenses for practising, taking disciplinary sanctions and flxing
tariffs; and (ii) establishing a code of accounting ethîcs.
7.        The Conseil has already effectively succeeded in controlling the
accounting profession. Qualified accountants vere awarded licenses, whereas
others received only a temporary permit which can be extended ouly if the
holder acquires an accounting degree. As a result of this action, about 30%
of the private accountants may disappear.  Foreign accounting firms with
offices in Algeria have also to be authorized, and about three of them vere
licensed. Contracts with other foreign firms have to be approved by SNC,
but due to the large number of these contracts, and to the overruling impor-
tance of the Ministry of Industry which requests their involvement, the
approval given by SNC is often perfunctory. The Conseil, in collaboration with
SNC, has also elaborated a Plan Comptable National (National accounting system)
to replace the French system currently in use. The new system vill be enforced
as of January 1, 1976; it has the advantage of presenting accounting data
(i) on a company level, to facilitate management decisions by showing gross
profit, distinct from operating and extraordinary profit and requiring perpet-
ual inventory; and (il) on a national level after aggregation of all companies'
accounts. The Conseil also helped to organize accounting education and
training in Algeria.

Accounting and Auditing in State Enterprises
8.        In 1962, at the time of independence, Algeria faced a severe shortage
of accountants. This resulted from the departure of the French who provided
all the administrative and financial personnel and from the preference of
Algerians for pprofessions such as law and medicine. In addition, the major
commercial and industrial companies were nationalized and combined into about
200 State enterprises, each of them monopolizing one sector of the economy.
Many of these new enterprises had no unified accounting system and organiza-
tion, but rather a multitude of different or non-existant systems with hardly
any qualified people to operate them.
9.        Due to Algeria's massive training effort, the contribution of foreign
accounting firms and the work of SNC, the situation has much improved. Accord-
ing to SNC: (i) 30% of the State Enterprises have reached acceptable standards
of accounting, which correspond to those forming the public sector which
existed before independence and which was not reorganized substantially there-
after (energy, railway, post office, etc.); (ii) 40% of State Enterprises
have much improved their situation, producing within a reasonable time annual
financial statements, whose quality however is not yet fully acceptable; and
(iii) 30% establish none or very poor quality statements, mainly due to in-
adequate interest by internal management for accounting matters. The contin-
uous effort in training, the necessity of managing the massive investments
already made and the tightening of financial resources are expected to dictate
a growing interest in financial and accounting matters in Algeria. In addi-
tion, the accounting education system has already provided the basic accountants
and will provide in the future highly qualified accountants. Therefore, a
basis exists for generating improvements of the existing accounting situation
in the state enterprises.
10.       Audits of accounts of State Enterprises can be categorized as
follows:
a.   State audits by the "commissaires aux comptes".
According to law, the commissaires aux comptes, who
are nominally in charge of judging the way State
Enterprises manage public funds, operate under the
responsibility of the Direction de l'Inspection in
the Ministry of Finance. While they are formally in
charge of auditing accounts of state enterprises, in
fact, they are not in a position to carry out this
function efficiently. There are 60 - often poorly
qualified - commissaires aux comptes who have to
supervise 200 enterprises. This situation results
from the shortage of qualified accountants in Algeria,
from the low level of remuneration offered by the
Ministry of Finance compared to salaries paid in



ANNEX 6
Page 5
state enterprises, and to the rivalrybetween the
Ministry of Industry (on which most State Enter-
prises depend) and the Ministry of Finance which
controls the commissionaires aux comptes.
b.   External audits by SNC or by foreign auditing firms.
Most external auditing presently carried out by SNC is
done at the demand of internal management of State Enter-
prises. However, in the past the Ministry of Finance has
also asked SNC to make audits on behalf of the commissaires
aux comptes. As SNC is placed under the control of the
Direction de l'Inspection in the Ministry of Finance,
a natural coordination therefore exists between the commissaires
aux comptes and SNC, the role of the commissaires aux comptes
being much more limited in the companies where SNC carries
out an audit. Furthermore, the proposed future statutes
of SNC will specify that staff members of SNC may act as
commissaire aux comptes. External audits carried out
by foreign accounting firms are also carried out at the
demand of internal management, very often under the pressure
of the Ministry of Industry.
c.   Internal audit.  Only a very limited number of state
corporations have internal audit departments. Taking into
account the size of these corporations and their geographic
dispersion, it is extremely desirable that they all develop
internal audit capabilities.
11.       In addition to usual justifications, external auditing has two
specifie justifications in the Algerian context: (a) as major decisions
in the areas of investment, financing and pricing are taken at a central
level by Ministries, there is a strong need for Ministries to be sure that
decisions are taken on valid data provided by the state enterprises; (b)
external auditing provides a diagnostic of a situation carried out by inde-
pendent and highly qualified people, and therefore it is the starting point
for improvements in the accounting situation of state enterprises, badly
needed as pointed out previously.
B. SNC - SOCIETE NATIONALE DE COMPTABILITE
1. General
12.       In 1967, SNC was estabiîshed by the Algerian Government as part of
a plan to reform and organize the practice of accountancy in Algeria. In
broad terms, SNC exists for the triple purpose of acting as external auditor



ANNEX 6
Page 6
to State Enterprises, offering management consulting services to them and
providing practical guidance to the accounting staff of these firms. It
will be responsible for implementing the National Accounting System in state
corporations, commencing January 1, 1976. SNC also furnishes the Conseil
Superieur de la Comptabilite with secretarial services.
13.       SNC is placed under the tutellage of the Minister of Finance, but
it enjoys full autonomy in the acceptance and discharge of professional
obligations, the adoption and enforcement of standards, and the hiring and
training of personnel. It adopts and administers its own budget and sets
its own fees for professional engagements. At least in the last three years,
it has managed to break even and even to realize a modest surplus.
2.   Organization and Staffing
14.       SNC is managed by a President-Directeur General (PDG), appointed by
the Minister of Finance. He is assisted by two Assistant General Managers,
one responsible for Operations and the other for Special Studies and Research.
While the latter has no professional staff, he acts in close liaison with the
former's staff, which consists of about 50 professionals including two highly
qualified expatriates, working in the area of auditing and consulting. SNC
also includes a legal and taxation department, composed of five people, and an
administrative and clerical staff of approximately 30. In total SNC employs
some 80 people, with a professional staff of 50, 90% of whom work in the
accounting and auditing sector. SNC has its Head Office in Algiers and maintains
agencies in Oran, Constantine and Annaba. A fourth agency is about to be opened
in Tizi-Ouzou.
15.       SNC's accounting and auditing force can be categorized asfollows:
15 people are accounting technicians, with a low level of general education,
a medium level accounting degree (BP) and long work experience; another 15
have a good level of general education (French DECS, 1/ Ecole Superieure
de Commerce d'Alger) including accounting education, but they do not have
work experience; the last 15 have the same level of education as the previous
category, but with two to three years work experience.
16.       Ever since its creation, SNC has experienced severe difficulties
in attracting and retaining competent professional manpower. Its professional
staff actually receded from approximately 80 to the present level of 50, but
this trend now appears to have been checked. As explained to us, this constant
decline was due to a combination of factors including regorous selection
policies, elimination of the bookkeeping staff, difficult working conditions
and long hours, and stricter remuneration rules than applicable in other state
corporations. A further factor has been the lack of a university program
specifically aimed at training accountants.
1/ Diplome d'Etudes Comptables Superieures.



ANNEX 6
Page 7
3.        Scope of Activities
17.       The typical SNC assignment differs substantially from a traditional
audit engagement, reflecting the inadequacy of company records and lack of
competent personnel in the state corporations. As the situation improves,
SNC will gradually limit its intervention to conventional audits. Although
it varies considerably both in size and in nature, depending on the client,
SNC's work typically comprise three phases at present:
a.   Correction and completion of accounting records.
Since most client corporations lack the skilled book-
keepers and accountants needed to maintain proper and
accurate records, SNC has to undertake a meticulous
examination of all accounting entries and underlying
evidence, leading up to the preparation and recording
of entries and the providing of on-the-spot counselling
teo client staff. Although it is an extreme example, it
was reported to us that, it one case, no fewer than
30,000 correcting entries had to be initiated by SNC.
SNCts intervention at this level, therefore, has an
important training element since clients must be
instructed in the basics of financial accounting.
b.   Preparation of financial statements.
It might be assumed that at the conclusion of this thorough
examination, SNC would be in a position to prepare a proper
set of financial statements for its clients. Such is,
however, not always the case. Among the reasons for this
are: Si) the absence of generally recognized standards
of disclosure, resulting both from the inherent characteristics
of the Plan Comptable inherited from the colonial epoch and
from its inadequacy in a centralized socialist economy; (il) the
absence of cost accounting systems, precluding the computation
of accurate historical cost for self-manufactured stock-in-trade
and fixed assets; and (iii) the need, yet to be satisfied, for
careful inventory and pricing of fixed assets taken over
since nationalization of businesses. SNC nevertheless does
prepare financial statements for its clients at the conclusion
of each engagement and at least such items as net profit and
working capital are arrived at with a measure of realiability.
Once again, the continuing nature of SNC's relationship with
clients, as their annual auditor, makes for a transfer of
accounting skills and a gradual improvement in the client's
standards as they reflect more closely SNC's advice.
c.   Installation of accountinS systems.
The logical result of the preceding two phases is the
recommendation of better accounting systems and methods.
Within its limited resources, SNC does present recommenda-
tions to the management of client corporations in the field



ANNEX 6
Page 8
Within its limited resources, SNC does present recommenda-
tions to the management of client corporations in the field
of general accounting. On recurring engagements, it often
experiences the gratification of noting an improvement
resulting from the application of its earlier recommendations.
It can, therefore, be seen that - while ostensibly performing an audit
function - SNC is in practice laying the foundations for a basic accounting
system, vithout which a successful audit is impossible.
4.   Methods of Operations
18.       SNC's methods of operation can be qualified as old fashioned, with
incomplete documentation of files. Yet in many ways they are careful,
rigorous and ensure satisfactory quality in limited areas. The following
procedures seem to be followed: reconciliation of bank balances; test count
of inventory items and prices; test examination of extensions and additions;
ageing of accounts receivable as a basis for computation of provision for
bad debts; limited outside confirmation of receivables; limited physical
inspection of fixed assets; trial balance ofsubsidiary ledgers and recon-
ciliation of controlling and reciprocal accounts; test of payroll rates,
deductions, extensions and additions; verification of cut-offs with respect
to stock records and cash operatiôns; and record of irregularities uncovered
and disposal thereof. These definitely show, on the part of the SNC staff,
an awareness of traditional audit techniques. However, the work of SNC
also shows conspicuous deficiencies such as the absence of detailed audit
programs, internal control questionnaires, and detailed working papers
recording the nature and extent of test or other procedures applied. In
addition there is only limited awareness of modern audit techniques such as
statistical sampling, flow-chart analysis, analytical auditing and computer
soft-ware audit techniques and there is no standard audit report setting
forth the scope of the audit, the procedures applied, the irregularities
uncovered if any and the auditors' opinion as to the fairness of presenta-
tion of the financial statements.
19.       To compensate for technical deficiencies, of which SNC's top
management is well aware, SNC frequently resorts to the guidance of foreign
accountants. There is seldom an important audit where at least one such
expert is not employed to plan and direct or supervise its accomplishment,
in addition to the nominal SNC "chef de mission". At present, two foreign
accountants are working as permanent staff with SNC, and another three are
provided through specific contracts with a French accounting firm. 1/ This
outside assistance has been costly and, in view of its limited extent, little
technology transfer has taken place.

5.   Financial Situation
20.       Financial statements for the last three years are given in Appendix 1.
A summnry is given below:
SNC - SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS
(DA million)
1972      1973       1974
Revenue                                   4.43       5.32       6.12
Net Income before Contribution
to State Budget                         0.60      0.55       0.27
Net Income as % of Revenue               13         10         4
Working Capital                          (1.09)    (0.63)    (0.31)
Current Ratio                             0.80       0.90      0.95
Revenues have increased slowly (about 35% in three years) as a result of
SNC's difficulties in attracting and retaining competent professional man-
power. After incurring substantial losses since its creation, SNC started
to show a profit, amounting to about 10% of revenue, and dropping to 5% in
1974 due to an important provision for bad debts. Working capital has been
negative, as a result of past losses and nonrecovering of receivables (aver-
age credit is 11 months). The financial viability of SNC has been maintained
temporarily through non-payment of short-term debts mainly to the Government
(taxes and social charges). The financial situation is currently improving
with the achievement of profits and the reduction of receivables.
6.   Future Development
21.       In 1974, SNC worked on 28 contracts.  Because of staff constraints
and the complexity of engagements, many requests had to be turned down. It
is estimated that SNC at present meets only 10% of the requirements of the
State Enterprises, with the remaining 90% being serviced by North American
and European consulting firms. As it is Government policy to gradually
take full control of this sector, SNC vill have substantial opportunities
in the future.
22.       Te satisfy the possible demand for its services, SNC must develop
its professional staff. As already noted, a program has been developed in
the University, specifically aiming at training accountants.  The first 20
students to be graduated vill come out of university in 1975, increasing to
100 annually within a period of five years thereafter.  It is expected that
most of these students will seek the expert-comptable degree, and therefore
will have to do two years practical training in SNC. In addition, as a
condition of being licensed for practising as privatp accountants. the



ANNEX 6
Page 10
graduating "expert comptables" vill be subject to five years civil serv-
ice which can only be served in an enterprise approved by the Ministry of
Finance. The education of these new students, with the possibility of
retaining them over a period of two to seven years, should considerably
ease the staffing problems of SNC. Projections of the SNC staff are given
in Appendix 2. A summary is shown below:
SNC - NUMBER OF ALGERIAN STAFF
(end of year)'
1975    1976    1977      1978      1979    1980
Level A (high school)            10       55 -- - -- 
Level B (UDF /a or equivalent) 25        37        51       72        98     126
Level C (UDF or equivalent
and 3 years experience)       15       25       38        40        39     44
Level D (UDF or equivalent
and 5 years experience)       -        -        -          8        17     27
Total                      50       67       89       120      154    197
/a   University degree in Finance.
SNC considers that a four-fold increase in its staff is realistic and even
conservative.  It is based on the assunption that about 50% of the students
graduating in "Finance" would come to SNC, and that SNC would recruit 20 C
level people during the next three years. The pattern of shifting the staff
from category to category is based on experience. It assumes that only 70%
of the staff at the upper limit of a category in any one year would be effec-
tively promoted. It also assumes that 20% of the staff entering Level B and
10% entering Level C in any one year would quit SNC after two years.
23.       The future scope of SNC's activities have been identified through
visits to clients and discussions with Algerian authorities. As a result,
it seems that the major role of SNC vis-a-vis the State Enterprises should
be (i) to act as external auditors, (ii) to help in training internal staff
accountants, (ii) to assist in establishing modern cost-accounting and bud-
geting methods and management informations systems, (iv) to assist with
introduction of modern data processing systems, (v) to assist in develop-
ing internal audit departments, and (vi) to act as agents for the Ministry
of Finance in the application of the new accounting system, and in the
development of specific accounting subsystems for each economic sector.
These roles, however, should not be thought of as mutually exclusive. For
example, a successful audit is predicated upon a sound basic accounting



ANNEX 6
Page 11
system which is also the foundation for cost control and budgeting. SNC -
as a Government agency supervising a wide range of state enterprises - pro-
vides the best vehicle for implementing a general improvement in standards of
accounting since, by setting as a goal the production of satisfactory finan-
cial statements, it forces client companies to effect basic changes in
accounting procedures consistent with that goal.
24.       As for specific activities related to SNMC, it is proposed that
SNC would be responsible for the annual audit of SNMC. The report would be
addressed to SNMC's internal management, the commissaires aux comptes in
charge of SNMC, and the Bank. In addition, as indicated in para 23, SNC
would assist SNMC (i) to establish a cost budgeting and control system for
all its cost centers, (ii) to apply the new accounting system and (iii) to
define the framework and methods for successful financial planning.
C. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
1. Objectives
25.       The basic objective of the proposed program is to improve the
general standard of accounting, budgeting and cost control in Algerian
state enterprises, including - but not limited to - SNMC. In order to meet
the requirements of a successful audit, companies will have to carry out
basic improvements in their accounting systems without which cost control,
budgeting and financial planning cannot be effective. SNC will assist in
implementing these basic improvements. Because it is a consulting firm and
therefore is in a position of acquiring a wide experience of various situa-
tions, SNC can be extremely efficient for assisting state enterprises in the
achievement of these improvements. However, the implementation of improve-
ments will remain the responsibility of the state enterprises' staff and, as
already noted, due to the massive efforts made in the field of training, a
basis exists ready for implementing and operating recommendations made by
SNC. At the level of SNC, therefore, the aims of the program are: (i) to
provide SNC staff with an adequate knowledge of modern management accounting
to enable them to introduce basic accounting systems in client corporations;
(ii) to introduce SNC's audit staff to modern auditing concepts and techniques;
(iii) to enable SNC to set up internal audit departments in client corpora-
tions; and (iv) eventually to enable SNC staff to replace the foreign
accountants currently operating in Algeria.
26.       One of SNC's tasks will be the implementation of the new accounting
system in the State Enterprises. An estimated 10 staff members will be needed
for a period of two years for this purpose. The Technical Assistance Program
outlined below does not include instruction related to this new accounting
system.



ANNEX 6
Page 12
2.   Description
27.       The followink chapter identifies possible components of a technical
assistance program which may meet the above objectives. The details of the
program will have to be discussed between SNC and qualified accounting firms.
The envisaged program would be implemented over a period of five years and
would comprise three distinct parts running simultaneously.
Part I: SEMINARS
28.       The purpose of seminars would be to complement SNC staff's education
in accounting and auditing. The seminars should be designed in view of the
background of new recruits who tend to have a general education in the economic
and legal aspects of business rather than in practical application of account-
ancy. These seminars should also broaden the knowledge of SNC's present staff
which has limited experience in the area of general accounting. Therefore,
in addition to courses attended by all staff members, more specialized courses
should be offered. All in all, a staff member would take an average of 15
weeks of seminars over a period of three years, or even over one to two years
at the beginning, in order to meet SNC's urgent need for qualified staff.
Outsiders, e.g. accountants from client corporations or individual commissaires
aux comptes, will also attend these seminars. It is suggested that about 1/3
of the participants should be from bodies other than SNC if the seminars are
to have maximum impact on accounting standards.
29.       A possible seminar program could comprise 10 courses totalling
20 weeks, as shown in the table below. It will be seen that, of the suggested
courses, only numbers 2, 3 and 4 deal exclusively with SNC's role as external
auditor:
1. Accounting & administrative systems    4 weeks   new staff
2.  Basic auditing                          3 weeks   new & existing staff
3. Advanced auditing                        1 week    "          "I   "
4. Management of an audit                    1 week    "         "i    "
5.  Internal auditing                        1 week    "         "
6.  Basic cost accounting & financial
planning                               2 weeks   existing staff
7. Practical applications of cost
accounting & financial planning        2 weeks   new & existing staff
8.  Basic data processing                   2 weeks   existing staff
9.  Data processing and internal controls  2 weeks   new & existing staff
10.  Financial management                    2 weeks   existing staff
A detailed suggested curriculum for each module will be found in Appendix III.



ANNEX 6
Page 13
Part II: PRACTICAL TRAINING ABROAD
30.       Participation in accounting operations in Europe or America should
give SNC staff members an opportunity to learn how a well-organized auditing
firm, as well as a well organized company, operates. Therefore, practical
training abroad should be provided for SNC staff with at least 2-3 years of
experience in Algeria.
31.       Although it would be desirable that all staff in this category
(level C) have an opportunity to participate in an auditing operation in
Europe or America, considerations of cost and time preclude such a massive
operation. 'On the other hand, if a sufficient number of Algerian auditors
can participate in such outside training they, in turn, could provide the
example and leadership to their colleagues once they return to Algeria. It
is recommended that annually 10 staff members be employed in accounting firms
abroad for a period of one year. These trainees should become part of the
auditing teams in the employing firms, and participate in regular audits in
preselected firms resembling Algerian enterprises.  A ratio of 5:1 between
trainees and supervisors in employing firms appears desirable for this
purpose. The inclusion of some trainees in management consulting activities
would also be desirable.
Part III: SUPERVISION OF WORK
32.       The main component of the technical assistance program will be the
actual planning and supervision of audits executed by SNC staff, over a five-
year period. As Algerlans acquire the necessary expertise, and as basic
standards of accounting in client enterprises lmprove, they vill gradually
replace foreign supervisors. Appendix IV shows the staff projections on which
the foreign supervisor requirements are predicated. A ratio of 3:1 between
trainees (encadres) and supervisors (encadreurs) would be desirable, keeping
in mind that a contingent of 10 foreign accountants in SNC at any one time
appears to be the practical upper limit. This ratio was strongly supported
by the foreign accounting staff presently employed by SNC, who feel they have
too many staff to train effectively. As a result, five foreign supervisors
from September 1976 through 1977, 10 in 1978, five in 1979 and three in 1980
will be needed.
3.   Coordination and Procurement
33.       Within SNC, a full-time, qualified program director will be appointed
to coordinate and supervise the three parts of the program. SNC suggested
appointing to this position the Assistant General Manager responsible for
special studies and research division. le should be assisted by a deputy who
would concentrate on the progranming and supervision of the seminars.



ANNEX 6
Page 14
34.       As already noted, this program should be considered as very tenta-
tive. It is intended to provide SNC with guidelines for future development
and to control the latitude which the consulting firm vould have to dictate
the terms and hence the profitability of its final contract with SNC. The
program should be considered as a seamless entity, but in view cf the neces-
sity of introducing flexibility, it is felt that, should SNC sa choose, the
initial contract need be for only two and a half years (end 1978) with an
option to renew thereafter. 1/ It is suggested that a single accounting and
auditing firm be engaged to provide the technical assistance program described
above. Such a firm should have the following characteristics: large size,
international reputation in its field, French-speaking staff available, and
big corporations as clients. Minor parts of the program could be sub-contracted
if necessary. The idea of a single responsible firm is proposed in order to
create a synergy effect which would result in a massive transfer of technology.
Several firms operating separately, each of them with its own methodology, may
create difficulties of coordination.
35.       As a tentative time schedule it has been envisaged that teres of
references be prepared and sent to a short list of qualified auditing firms
by November 1975 with the objective of starting the technical assistance
program by mid-1976. The Bank is prepared to assist SNC in drafting terme
of references and contract descriptions as far as feasible, and it has been
agreed that a Bank mission vill visit Algeria to discuss the terms of ref-
erence, probably in December 1975 or January 1976.
4.   Cost Estimates and Financing
36.       A program of this magnitude cannot be priced accurately.  The billing
rates of potential firms vary from firm to firm depending on interest, experi-
ence and availability. Although indicative capital cost estimates have been
prepared, no detailed breakdown of them is presented here since it is felt
that to do so would lead to the possibility that interested accounting firms
might tailor bids to fit the figures estimated by the Bank. However, it is
felt that the total financing requirement - including price escalation based on
on 9.4% for 1976, 7.5% for 1977 and 7% thereafter - vill be about US$7.4
million for the full 5-year program and about US$3.7 million for the first
phase. The proposed Bank loan of US$5.1 million vould, therefore, cover about
70% of total program costs or 100% of expected foreign exchange appenditures.
5. Justification and Risks
37.       Assuming an average assignment duration of about 30 staff/months
per client, SNC would be in a position to provide vithin five years 80 state
corporations vith its services. This vould increase its share in the account-
ing market from 10% at present to 40% after five years. As a result, SNC
could satisfy a major portion of the demand for accounting and auditing
services in Algeria. The services SNC could render during and after the
program is completed are very much needed in Algeria. Many state enterprises
1/   SNC has so far indicated a preference to sign a contract for the full
program (5 years).



ANNEX 6
Page 15
show losses and have not kept account of their massive investments. The
general accounting training which vould be an integral part of the program
vould go a substantial way towards alleviating this problem. At a time when
Algeria is encounterlng lîquidity problems, there is also a need for audited
financial statements on the basis of which management, as vell as ministries,
can take appropriate decisions in the areas of investment decision, invest-
ment follow-up, pricing and cost control. In addition, the foreign exchange
savings vould be.significant. If the cost of the five year program vas to be
depreciated over ten years, SNC vould have to increase its present fees by one
third, in order to break even. Nevertheless, the level of SNC's fees vould
still remain much lover than those of the big international accounting firms
(about one half), involving foreign exchange savings for Algeria.
38.       The risks involved in this program are not negligible.  In addition
tO the problem of limposing changes on client enterprises, the success of the
program depends on SNC's ability to recruit and keep qualified Algerian
staff. After two to five years training vithin SNC the staff may leave,
being offered better remuneration or other advantages in other state enter-
prises. At the same time, however, that such a staff los8 would be detrimen-
tal to SNC, provided the skills are retained in Algeria there may vell be
an overall net gain as the staff attracted to other enterprises implement
the techniques learned with SNC. Furthermore, general vorking conditions in
Algeria are not easy. There is a substantial risk that, after one or two
years of initial cooperation, the relationship between SNC and the foreign
consultant will deteriorate. To minimize possible misunderstandings the
responsibilities of both parties should be defined in detail in the contract.
