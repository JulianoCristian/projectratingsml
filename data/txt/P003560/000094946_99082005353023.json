"Overall this project's outcome is\n            rated as satisfactory. Project sustainability is likely\n            while International Development Association (IDA)\n            performance is highly satisfactory and Borrower performance\n            is in part also highly satisfactory. Lessons learned include\n            the following: A comprehensive design approach establishing\n            an integrated system to link production, processing, and\n            marketing is highly beneficial and conducive to foreign\n            capital investment in agricultural projects. Stable project\n            management at all levels and good coordination among the\n            project management offices and involved technical bureaus\n            are essential to success. Good plant design and excellent\n            equipment are key factors in attracting private sector\n            partners to processing plants. Also, adequate and timely\n            availability of working capital has to be ensured for\n            processing plants. Management of revolving funds needs to be\n            ensured. Decentralization of responsibility for\n            implementation of irrigation and drainage works, and\n            subsequent operations and maintenance, requires substantial\n            support from provincial authorities in order to develop\n            local capabilities for water resource management. The\n            incorporation of windbreaks in irrigated areas in Henan\n            offers sound environmental protection. Adequate and timely\n            allocation of counterpart funds is a prerequisite to smooth implementation."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
