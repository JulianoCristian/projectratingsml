poverty in several of the poorest counties in Henan Province\n            by increasing crop, livestock and fish production and\n            productivity. The project will: (a) improve and expand four\n            Yellow River Diversion Schemes (YRDS) and sink 4,900 wells\n            for conjunctive water use within the schemes; (b) sink 8,900\n            wells and rehabilitate another 3,600 in areas outside the\n            YRDSs; (c) eliminate water logging and salinity problems by\n            providing drainage and flood protection schemes; (d) provide\n            needed inputs; (e) strengthen research and extension; (f)\n            increase efficiency of livestock production through better\n            feed, breeds, and veterinary services; (g) develop low-lying\n            areas for fish production; and (h) invest in agroprocessing\n            and agroindustry so as to utilize project outputs and\n            by-products. The project will strengthen overall project\n            management and environmental protection programs by\n            providing equipment, technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1991-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
