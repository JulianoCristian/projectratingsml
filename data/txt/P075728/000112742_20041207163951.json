It discusses the number of household affected, the\n            amount of land acquired, the agricultural workers affected,\n            and the costs of resettlement allocated. Measures to\n            minimize resettlement impacts include: optimizing the route\n            of the pipe network, using pipe-jacking technology, reducing\n            the construction period and temporary resettlement costs for\n            project affected people (PAPs), and reducing the closing\n            period for enterprises and shops. The four subprojects,\n            Dashadi, Liede, sewage networks, and the solid waste\n            disposal center are examined in separate volumes.  In\n            general, compensation and rehabilitation measures will\n            include: timely compensation, restoration of attached\n            structures, tax relief for expenses, job creation, priority\n            employment given to young adults who are rural PAPs,\n            psychological counseling and skill training, house\n            relocation fees, replacement costs for structures, and\n            non-natives will be able to rent nearly identical land for\n            fish breeding and poultry raising. The project will pay\n            special attention to vulnerable groups such as the elderly\n            (without children), widows, single-parent families, the\n            disabled, the chronically ill and destitute, and will\n            periodically monitor their conditions."}, "docdt": "2004-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
