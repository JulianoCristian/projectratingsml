                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PDO: The project is improving the quality of the environment after completion of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), one operating at full capacity and the other at 80%.
                         Together these two WWTPs bring the percentage of domestic wastewater collected and treated from 50% at appraisal to 85% now. Pollution removal by these two WWTPs has
                         allowed the water quality in the key Pearl River Delta rivers to comply with water quality standards for Class III 77.8% of the time (compared to the target of 80% set at appraisal).
                         The volume of wastewater treated will increase further as completed sewer networks are brought on line. Construction of the hazardous waste management facility is nearly complete
                         and procurement of a private operator to run the facility is underway, and this facility will improve the environment further once it begins operations in 2012. Institutional reform is
                         progressing well with Guangzhou Sewerage Treatment Company having substantial control over all of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities in the city. Operating revenue
                         is now fully sufficient to meet operating expenses excluding depreciation, which bodes reasonably well for operational sustainability.

                         GEFDO: The project has reduced pollution loading through two inter-municipal pilots, namely the Nangang Wastewater treatment system in Guangzhou and the Gaoxin/Shiken
                         Pumping Stations in Foshan. The Nangang system alone is reducing about 7,500 tonnes/year of chemical oxygen demand and 450tonnes/year of ammonia nitrogen according to
                         the actual monitoring data submitted. The third pilot, the Luoxi Island wastewater treatment system in Guangzhou, was dropped due to repeated procurement failures. However it is
                         the smallest pilot does not affect the GEFDO, as other two contiguous municipalities/cities using shared facilities are running more than expected performance. In addition, the project
                         financed ten on-line monitoring stations and an information system to gather data to aid in environmental management in Guangdong Province.
