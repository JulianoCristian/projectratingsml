                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
The Bank has received a request, dated August 3, 2010 (Attachment 1) from the Ministry of
Finance, to: (a) extend the Loan (and Grant) closing date by 16 months (12 months for Grant) to
December 31, 2011; (b) increase the disbursement percentage from 50% to 100% for category
(1)(a) Works under Parts A.1, A.2 and A.3 of the project; (c) cancel part of the loan
(US$284,180); and (d) grant a four-month disbursement grace period.


PROJECT STATUS
The project was approved on June 8, 2004, and US$66.7 million (52%) of the original Loan
amount of US$128 million has been disbursed. Implementation delays arose due to very slow
and costly land acquisition, which in turn resulted in counterpart funding shortages. The
Borrower originally requested a two-year extension of the Loan closing date to enable
completion of the critical sewer networks to connect to the two wastewater treatment plants
constructed under the project, as well as completion of a hazardous waste treatment plant, and a
number of subprojects supported by the blended GEF grant.

The Bank earlier agreed only to an eight month extension, to August 31, 2010, to allow time for
GSTC to investigate and remedy irregularities highlighted in the 2007 and 2008 audit reports,
based on an agreed Action Plan submitted by GSTC. These issues have been satisfactorily
resolved, as described below. Construction of the two wastewater treatment plants is complete
and civil works construction is ongoing for the hazardous waste treatment facility. Bidding for
equipment supply and installation for the hazardous waste facility is ongoing. All remaining
works relating to the sewer networks and the hazardous waste facility are scheduled to be
completed and commissioned by December 31, 2011.

Implementation of the Action Plan. Progress made in implementation of the key actions agreed
in the Action Plans described below: (a) Refund 2007 ineligible disbursements, and Refund
2008 ineligible disbursements for overstatements - Completed satisfactorily. GSTC has
replaced the Resident Engineer and the contract of the Representative Agent has been
terminated. Action has also been taken against contractors who sublet works, and the respective
subcontracts have been canceled.

(b) Explanation for Irregularities in the Procurement Process of domestic training - In-
progress. The 2008 Audit report identified the use of procurement procedures not provided for
in the legal agreements for the selection of consultants for three domestic training activities. The
Bank team subsequently identified another three contracts for training activities that had not

                                                 6
followed agreed procurement procedures. The Bank team has followed up with Guangzhou PMO
and GSTC for the irregularities in the procurement procedures for these contracts. GSTC has
provided explanation of the circumstances that led to non-adherence to the agreed procurement
procedures. Based on the response from GSTC, the Bank is considering an appropriate course of
action to resolve the matter.

(c) Implement new regulations to improve internal controls of project expenditures, and
appoint an experienced cost engineer, satisfactory to the Bank, to oversee measurement of
works - Completed satisfactorily.

(d) GSTC to resolve all accounting issues identified in the 2007 and 2008 Audit Reports -
Completed satisfactorily. GSTC received a clean Audit Report for 2009.

(e) Complete Land acquisition and resolve counterpart funds issues in the Hazardous
Waste Management Component - Completed satisfactorily.



PROPOSED CHANGES

   ·     Financing

               o   Table below provides the updated project costs. The cost increases are due to:
                   increase of labor/material cost; depreciation of the US dollar against the Renminbi; and
                   increase in land acquisition costs. .


                                 Project Costs (US$m.)
                  Components/Activities                Current                           Proposed

               o Revised Financing Plan (see Data Sheet)

               o Reallocations - The restructuring would increase the disbursement percentage for
                 Category 1(a) (civil works related to the wastewater management component)
                 from 50% to 100%. This increase will enable the undisbursed balance of the loan
                 to be fully disbursed and alleviate counterpart funding shortages (see Annex 1).



                                                       7
o Cancellation ­ A total amount of US$ 924,180 will be canceled: these comprise the
  cancellations due to the waiver of front-end fee and the refund of ineligible expenditures
  (see earlier discussion) respectively.
  · Closing date

       The Loan Closing Date is being extended by 16 months enable GSTC to complete all
       ongoing and planned works for the sewer network and hazard waste management facility.
       (See Annex 2).

   ·   Implementation schedule

       A revised implementation plan, acceptable to the Bank, has been submitted by GDPMO.
       It includes, for each contract, the latest cost estimate, start/finish dates, Bank financing
       estimate, and the counter-part financing estimate.

   ·   Disbursement Grace Period

       A four-month disbursement grace period, to enable thorough GDPMO internal review of
       payments to avoid any ineligible payments.


APPRAISAL SUMMARY

   ·   Financial and Economic Analysis

   The increased cost for completing the project does not affect the economic feasibility of the
   project, as the project remains a cost effective way of achieving the PDO. GSTC is
   updating its tariff forecasts based on the updated project costs, with the objective of meeting
   the financial covenant of achieving full cost recovery. GHWMC is a government entity,
   and Guangzhou Municipal Government will provide the necessary counterpart funds for
   project construction and any subsidies required to fully meet the financial covenant. There
   is no financial covenant regarding hazardous waste; however, GMC will provide sufficient
   funds to ensure operational sustainability.

   ·   Environmental and Social Safeguards

   As there is no change in the investment components, the environmental category of the
   project remains category A, and no new safeguard policies are triggered. Timely and good
   quality external monitoring reports confirm that resettlement under the project complies with
   Bank Guidelines. GSTC has agreed to improve the quality of internal resettlement
   monitoring reports, and will furnish both internal and external monitoring reports as per an
   agreed schedule (see also Table 2 below).

   · Risks
   Table 2 summarizes the risks to the achievement of the project development objectives or
   outcome targets and the mitigation measures to be implemented.
