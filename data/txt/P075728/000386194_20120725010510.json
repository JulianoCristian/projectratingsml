"loan_no": "4742", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Guangdong Pearl River\n            Delta Urban Environment Project for China were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; Global Environmental\n            Objective (GEO) outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was substantial; risk to GEO outcome\n            was substantial; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: Project\n            Management Offices (PMO's) functions should be\n            delegated to an entity which is relatively robust and has\n            the capacity to coordinate with related government entities.\n            The PMO should be well staffed and provided with sufficient\n            financial support. Whenever Project Implementation Units\n            (PIUs) delegate their owner's responsibility to other\n            entities, they need to strengthen supervision on the work\n            conducted by the delegated entities. The cost of land\n            acquisition and ability to mount adequate, timely\n            counterpart funding should be very realistically assessed\n            during the site selection process in order to avoid lengthy,\n            costly delays. The challenges of setting up a successful and\n            effective institutional framework for the management and\n            operation of the new facilities depends on possessing a\n            broad knowledge of the market. To ascertain such knowledge,\n            it is necessary to conduct a sound cost recovery analysis\n            and to design realistic terms of reference for the private\n            operator, if that route is chosen. In the wastewater sector,\n            institutional changes take time, and the support provided\n            needs to adequately capture the local context. For instance,\n            the introduction of Private Sector Participation (PSP)\n            requires a careful analysis of the various PSP modalities.\n            From the technical point of view, it is important to\n            carefully analyze influent wastewater characteristics and\n            conduct accurate flow projections in order to optimize the\n            design and technologies of Wastewater Treatment Plants\n            (WWTPs). When planning sewer networks construction, the\n            budget, schedule and potential obstacles need to be\n            realistically assessed, to ensure the entire wastewater\n            treatment system can be completed in a timely manner. Being\n            able to foresee and mitigate the main obstacles during\n            construction of a sewer network is necessary to minimize\n            public objection to construction and to secure temporary\n            land use rights. Sludge management strategies should be\n            developed according to the influent wastewater\n            characteristics and potential reuse market or its final\n            disposal method and locations. This will not only provide\n            the plant operation more flexibility but it will also reduce\n            operating costs. In doing so, adequate equipment selection\n            and system operation including odor control should be\n            planned early in project design."}, "docdt": "2012-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
