﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives, Global Environment Objectives and Design
1.1   Context at Appraisal
Guangdong Province is an economic powerhouse, led by its Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, which,
from 1990 to 2000, witnessed phenomenal economic growth, driven predominantly by the
manufacturing sector. GDP was rising by an average of 14.7 percent annually, and in 2002,
Guangzhou made the highest contribution to the GDP of the Province, with US$80.5 billion
equivalent. However, the PRD's rapid economic growth came at a heavy environmental cost.
Water quality in many stretches of the Pearl River was worse than Class V standard (Chinese water
classification system is explained in Annex 10), which made the river system unsuitable for
irrigation, aquaculture, or even recreational use. It also contributed to serious pollution of the South
China Sea.
Domestic and industrial wastewater. The main sources of pollution entering the river were from
untreated domestic and industrial wastewater and non-point sources. In 2000, total wastewater
generation (domestic and industrial) was estimated at about 11.5 million m3/day. Projections for
2010 were about 12.3 million m3/day, of which 17% was from industry. In 2004, the total treatment
capacity in the PRD was only about 2.6 million m3/day, or approximately 28% of domestic
wastewater. By 2010, it was expected that the wastewater treatment capacity in the PRD would
increase by 8.8 million m3/day to 11.4 million m3/day. To reduce industrial wastewater, an
Industrial Pollution Control Program (2005-2015) was put in place to monitor and control industrial
discharges from 179 polluting industries, including the relocation of the worst polluting industries.
Another problem arising in the wastewater sector was the proper treatment and disposal of sludge.
A related problem for water and wastewater services was the institutional and financial viability of
the sector institutions. Although Guangzhou Sewerage Treatment Company (GSTC) had just been
created at appraisal, the institution was still weak and could not collect its own revenues through
tariffs. Rather, the Guangzhou Municipal Finance Bureau (GMFB) collected fees for its services,
then reallocated the revenues to its various municipal departments, including GSTC, to carry out
operations and maintenance (O&M). There was little awareness of the importance of cost recovery,
financial planning and budgeting.
Hazardous waste. Another environmental problem was the growing volume of hazardous waste and
illegal dumping, which posed considerable risks to public health and to surface and ground water.
During preparation, there was one hazardous waste treatment plant in Shenzhen, and construction of
incinerators was being considered by other PRD municipalities. In 2005, Guangzhou was generating
about 224,900 tons of hazardous waste annually, most of which was shipped away for treatment and
disposal, except approximately 3,300 tons that were incinerated by one private incinerator in
Guangzhou. This situation was costly and unsustainable and capacity needed to be built.
Regional planning for environmental infrastructure in the PRD was based on narrow administrative
boundaries rather than drainage catchments or rational planning. The PRD Clean-up Plan (PRDCP)
called for the construction of 162 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), but the expected result was
a proliferation of uneconomic small capacity plants requiring high capital and recurrent costs.
Planning at that time did not adequately emphasize regional considerations, economies of scale and
I


﻿least-cost strategies. Making planning more difficult was the fact that regulation and enforcement of
water quality standards were hampered by uncoordinated and inadequate water quality monitoring
and data management by the responsible agencies. As such, opportunities for regional environmental
planning and management of the PRD and the South China Sea, involving a range of stakeholders in
Guangdong, Hong Kong SAR, China and Macao SAR, China, had not been adequately explored.
Rationale for Bank involvement
When Guangdong Province requested Bank assistance for the project, the Bank already had a
substantial body of expertise from over 20 projects in the water supply and wastewater sector in
China, and had obtained mostly satisfactory, sustainable results. The Bank had gained expertise on
(a) regional environmental issues; (b) issues unique to mega-cities; and (c) issues related to the
clean-up of water bodies (Lakes Dianchi and Tai) and water resources management (Huai River
Basin). For this project, the Bank's cumulative experience was sought to design a project to reduce
pollution in another mega-city, located in one of the most environmentally stressed areas of the
world, the PRD. Guangdong Province requested Bank financing primarily to employ methodologies,
standards, and techniques to improve wastewater planning, construction and management. It also
sought the Bank's technical expertise and leveraging power by supporting technically and
institutionally sound initiatives and promoting innovative activities to help address the main
environmental problems more efficiently.
1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO), Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) and
Key Indicators:
PDO: To assist in addressing the environmental problems of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong
Province and the South China Sea, through the improvement and rationalization of environmental
service delivery based on a regional planning approach.
GEO: To improve the environmental condition of the South China Sea's large marine ecosystem, by
addressing the major threat of land-based pollution.
Key indicators (PAD, page 3) included: (a) increased percentage of domestic wastewater collection
and treatment; (b) increased pre-treatment of industrial wastewater before discharge, and relocation
of highly polluting industries; (c) increased collection and treatment of hazardous wastes; (d)
increased water quality monitoring information, and data sharing for environmental management;
and (e) increased collaboration between Guangdong and Hong Kong SAR, China Special
Administrative Region for environmental management of the PRD and the South China Sea region.
(Note that the PAD does not differentiate which indicators are for the PDO and which are for the
GEO, but the ISRs used (d) and (e) above as GEO indicators as reflected in the datasheet.)
Key Performance Monitoring Indicators (PAD, page 32) included: (a) wastewater volume treated;
(b) compliance with discharge standards; (c) compliance with water quality objectives in Guangzhou
PRD area; (d) quantity of hazardous waste treated and disposed; (e) wastewater tariffs implemented
to meet financial projections; and (f) hazardous waste fees and charges implemented to cover costs
of collection and disposal.

﻿1.3   Revised PDO, GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification: n.a.
1.4   Main Beneficiaries.
The intended beneficiaries were the approximately 30 million people living within the PRD,
including the 14 million residents of the Guangzhou metropolitan area, who would benefit through
improved quality of the environment and river systems. It was also expected that approximately 6.9
million residents of Hong Kong SAR, China would benefit through protection of the vital drinking
water supply from the PRD, and from reduced water pollution in the South China Sea. GSTC and
the Guangdong Solid Waste Management Center (GSWMC) stood to benefit from the project's
specific institutional strengthening activities to support ongoing reforms in the wastewater sector and
the creation of a new institutional framework in the hazardous waste sector respectively.
1.5   Original Components (as approved):
(1) Wastewater Management (total cost US$325 million, or 75% of total). In Guangzhou, the
project was to finance: (a) construction of a new wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) at Dashadi
with a capacity of 200,000 m3/d; (b) expansion of the Liede WWTP by 200,000 m3/d ("Liede Phase
III"), and (c) about 500 km of trunk sewers to convey wastewater from the drainage catchments of
Dashadi and Liede, and four other drainage catchments.
(2) Regional Hazardous Waste Management (total cost US$24 million, 6% of total). This
component entailed the construction of the first phase of a hazardous waste treatment facility
comprising a pre-treatment center and a secured landfill capacity of 150,000 m3 in phase 1, to treat
waste from all districts of Guangzhou and neighboring municipalities, including preparation of a
regulatory framework for hazardous waste management, and selection of a private sector service
provider to operate the facility. A waste market survey and corporate market assessment were also to
be carried out.
(3) Inter-Municipal Environmental Infrastructure (total cost US$65 million, 15% of total).
Promotion, as a pilot activity, of shared environmental infrastructure development for two or more
municipalities, districts or towns willing to plan, construct and manage shared facilities. This
component included preparation of the framework for cost-sharing, ownership and O&M.
Following establishment of the framework, two or three subprojects, identified during preparation,
were to be financed for demonstration purposes. This component also included a review and update
of the PRD wastewater management plan (the PRDCP) which was expected to result in more
efficient use of resources, least cost wastewater facility planning, and enhanced inter-municipal
collaboration.
(4) Water Quality Monitoring and Information Systems (total cost US$11.6 million, 3% of total).
Support for physical investments and information systems to enhance the capacity of the Guangdong
Environmental Protection Bureau (GDEPB) for water quality monitoring, consistent with the
national program of the State Environmental Protection Agency. This included installation of a
network of automatic monitoring stations (AMS), real-time data assembly and processing at a
control center, development of databases, a website, management information system, and data
sharing arrangements with Hong Kong SAR, China.
3


﻿(5) Institutional Strengthening and Training (total cost US$6.4 million, 2% of total). Provision of
technical assistance for: (a) financial, institutional and project management support; (b) public
hygiene promotion; (c) strategic studies for private sector participation (PSP), regional planning and
urban development; and (d) training and study tours.
1.6   Revised Components: n.a.
1.7    Other significant changes:
The project underwent several Level II restructurings between 2005 and 2010. In 2005, the purpose
of the restructuring was to remove the disbursement condition of hiring a supervisory consultant
before disbursing for works for GSTC. In 2006, the legal agreements were amended to facilitate
disbursements for GEF sub-grants and to increase the financing percentage for consultant services.
The restructuring in 2010 increased the percentage of Bank financing for works, canceled
US$284,180 of the Loan, extended the closing date to December 31, 2011 and added a four-month
grace period for the submission of eligible expenditures incurred on or before the closing date. The
restructurings did not result in any changes in scope or design, but the components and their
corresponding indicators and target values were modified as described below, with delays resulting
in a cumulative two year extension of the Loan/Grant closing date.
Component 1: The number of kilometers of sewerage network was reduced from 500km to 371km
due to inaccurate feasibility studies and to construction difficulties which arose when laying new
sewers in densely populated areas of the city and the related resettlement challenges.
Component 2: The capacity of the secure landfill (phase 1) was increased from the planned capacity
of 150,000 metric tons to 290,000 metric tons following the results of a detailed site survey. The new
area required increased from 20 to 33 hectares. The facility suffered extensive delays due to difficult
land acquisition and inadequate counterpart funds.
Component 3: During implementation, three pilot subprojects (Luoxi Island, Nangang District and
Foshan) were confirmed. However, the Luoxi Island Wastewater Treatment System suffered
repeated procurement failures and was ultimately dropped late in 2011. The allocated funds were re-
invested in the Nangang sub-component. The Shenzhen Pingshang River Wetland Treatment Works,
identified during preparation, were also dropped as further appraisal deemed them inappropriate for
funding.
Component 4: Four revisions were made as follows:

﻿Activity              Status                     Comments
Source investigation, research, and       A central government program launched in 2007

on water quality management for  cancelled  launching such a conference on a regional basis and
the South China Sea area                  reallocated the funds to other components.
The Province had already allocated a training budget
Training                        cancelled  and because it became more difficult to secure overseas
training, these funds were reallocated to other activities.
Component 5: A program for hygiene promotion was included to upgrade public toilets in low-
income neighborhoods in Guangzhou city. However, Guangzhou ended up launching its own
upgrading program using own funds in order to save the Bank loan for institutional strengthening
activities. A study on Metropolitan Regional Planning was also included during preparation but
finally was not pursued. The study on PSP and Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) in the wastewater
business was modified when Jiangmen Municipal Government changed its plans of tendering a BOT
contract for the Duran WWTP and decided to finance the facility with public funds. Therefore, the
original task of drawing up the terms of reference for the BOT contract was substituted by a mid-
term review of the existing BOT contracts in Jiangmen and the development of a regulatory system
on concessional operation.
2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
(a) The soundness of background analysis, lessons learned and rationale for Bank involvement
During project preparation, the Bank recognized Guangdong's progress in economic, financial and
institutional reforms over the previous years in order to start addressing the serious environmental
problems of the Pearl River Delta. Building on ongoing initiatives, the Bank designed a project to
extend innovations to the environmental infrastructure sector.
Background analysis. The Borrower, with Bank assistance, conducted a comprehensive background
analysis, assessing urban, regional and environmental trends in the PRD, identifying key wastewater
and solid waste management infrastructure, and analyzing sector priorities for investment under the
proposed loan and GEF grant. The analysis included existing policy instruments, like the PRDCP
and the Industrial Pollution Control Action Plan (IPCAP), the assessment of feasibility studies,
definition of project objectives and components and site selections for works. Different alternatives
for design and implementation were analyzed, considering the scale of the project, the choice of a
local versus a more regional approach, the adequacy of different financing instruments, whether to
focus on one versus more than one environmental sub-sector (wastewater and solid waste), and the
analysis of more specific options for each component.
5


﻿Lessons learned from earlier operations were considered during preparation and introduced in the
final project design, like the need to pay attention to setting tariffs by the level of average
incremental costs; or the emphasis on establishing an autonomous wastewater company as a key
feature for sustainability. The benefits of including private sector participation were also introduced
in the project design of the hazardous waste component.
The rationale for Bank involvement was clear and straight-forward. The PDO was well aligned with
government priorities stated in the PRDCP and IPCAP and with the goals of the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) as the project supported environmentally sustainable development processes related
to the rapid urban transition in China by improving the management of water resources and
hazardous waste. The GEO was consistent with GEF's Operational Program and the Sustainable
Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia that referred to the PRD as China's largest source of
land-based pollution by helping to reduce land-based pollution in the South China Sea.
(b) Assessment ofproject design
Project design responded to a clear need to contribute to improve the environmental conditions of
the Pearl River Delta. The choice of supporting investments in two different environmental sub-
sectors rather than concentrating just on wastewater, can be considered successful since project
contributions in the incipient solid hazardous waste sector in combination with key activities to
improve the water quality monitoring system are expected to positively contribute to the capacities
of the local and regional governments to address some of those key environmental challenges.
Stakeholder participation. Preparation of the project involved most major stakeholders, and plans
were in place to keep them engaged during implementation. GDPMO, with the support of solid
international consultancies to define the scope of the different project activities, organized
consultative meetings on environmental and social issues with a broad range of stakeholders,
including women and low income communities. These meetings facilitated participatory
consultations in the preparation of the safeguards documentation, gaining stakeholder support for the
project. Affordability analyses were carried out to ensure that proposed tariffs were affordable by the
poorer segments of the population.
Safeguards. The project was designed as Category "A" with two safeguards triggered: OP 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. In response, a comprehensive
environmental assessment (EA) was carried out in close conformity with Bank and Chinese national
policies, and the final version was disclosed to the public through the Bank's Infoshop in December
2003. Specific EAs were conducted for the Dashadi and Liede III WWTPs, the trunk sewer networks
for four other WWTP catchments and for the hazardous waste facility and landfill. Public
consultations are well documented in Annex 14 of the PAD. In compliance with OP4.12,
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) were developed including a main volume with a policy
framework. The RAPs were disclosed in December 2003 and notice of their availability was
publicized in Chinese newspapers in January 2004. The project included provisions to monitor
compliance with EIA, EMP, and RAP implementation, by independent monitoring agencies.
6


﻿Sustainability and complexity of the selected project design were assessed from the technical,
financial, environmental, social and institutional perspectives. Implementation arrangements were
made in advance, except for the inter-municipal component that was designed during
implementation. Adequate arrangements for financial management during the entire implementation
period and the procurement plan for the first year were done before project approval.
In 2005, the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) carried out a review of the project's "quality at entry"
and rated it "satisfactory", with compliments given to the pilot initiatives on inter-municipal
cooperation and PSP. The team was encouraged to focus on the "evolution of the institutional
framework for the Pearl River basin management, even if the process itself will inevitably be long-
term". This assessment agrees with this recommendation, but it found other areas where quality at
entry was soft as discussed next.
Shortcomings of Quality at Entry
The project's broad regional scope and approach, although well justified, proved to be too ambitious
for a first intervention in the sector in Guangdong. The specific goals of moving towards regional
collaboration between the principal urban centers of the PRD were very difficult to introduce in the
local and provincial political agendas. Furthermore, the Bank did not appreciate the challenges or the
risks of implementing a more rational, cost effective wastewater plan through inter-municipal
collaboration. The project was right to include the establishment of an institutional framework for
inter-municipal collaboration, but instead of going ahead with actual works, it should have included
a dissemination strategy geared toward building political commitment. Works might have been
financed after political will was established, either with additional financing, own financing, or
under a separate operation.
Very wisely during preparation, the necessity of accelerating institutional development changes in
the environment sector was strongly emphasized, as seen in the formation of the GSTC as a financial
autonomous enterprise before appraisal, and an institutional strengthening component was included
to help the project institutions consolidate ongoing reforms; however, as GSTC had just been
formed, it had no corporate identity or culture and no experience in managing a large Bank-funded
construction program. The institutional strengthening component should have included additional
consulting services to augment GSTC's and GSWMC's management capacity and as well as a
project implementation management consultant to provide close oversight and on-the-job training.
Critical risks related to the achievement of project outcomes and outputs were identified but none
was assessed as high or substantial. Corresponding mitigation measures were clearly spelled out and
risks related to environmental, social and fiduciary aspects were implicit in the individual
assessments. Significant difficulties with resettlement that arose during implementation indicate that
more attention should have been paid to investigating Government commitment to following Bank
social safeguards and fiduciary policies, or the potential implications of high land price increases in
land compensation on counterpart funding availability (See section 2.2.). However, this was the first
urban project in Guangzhou financed by the Bank and      GDPMO had already successfully
implemented other RAPs linked to construction projects in a context of sharp land price increases, so
the task team's underestimation of those risks is understandable. Similarly, the procurement capacity
assessment indicated an "average" risk, overestimating the PIUs' familiarity with Bank procurement
7


﻿methods. Financial management risks were rated low to moderate, which again proved to be too soft
considering the weaknesses reported in Section 2.4. This, together with the institutional weaknesses
found in the hazardous waste sector, evidenced by the difficulties in producing the bidding
documents to contract the private operator, leads to the conclusion that institutional capacity was
over-assessed.
Another under-assessed risk was "provincial and city level governments will not support the
proposed shared infrastructure management, least cost solutions or location of wastewater
facilities. " This was rated "moderate", when it should have been rated "high". The risk assessment
related to implementation of reforms assessed at "modest". Some reforms were carried out, but
others are still pending, such as the cost recovery of GSTC depreciation and debt service costs'. This
last requirement was ambitious given how new the reforms in the sector were.
One risk that was not identified was delays due to the complexity of the construction of the sewerage
network and the corresponding resettlement and counterpart funding needs. Given the Bank's prior
experiences in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, this risk should have been "substantial". In fact, the
overall risk of the project should have been rated as "substantial" instead of "moderate".
Reach of the PDO/GEO, was too broad considering the size of the project and the scope of the
environmental problems in Guangdong (see Section 3.2). A better formulated PDO would have
aimed at reducing pollution loads due to domestic wastewater and reducing hazardous waste. Lastly,
as explained in Section 2.3, the results framework had many inconsistencies and the indicators
could have been better defined and aligned more closely with PDO and GEF objectives.
Sludge treatment. GSTC prepared a sludge management plan as covenanted in the Project
Agreement. Following the presentation of the plan, GSTC proposed to build a sludge drying facility
to be financed by the Bank, but the Bank was not convinced of the cost effectiveness of the solution
proposed, and it was recommended that it be financed with government funds. Given the expected
increase of sludge production, not only due to the wastewater treatment capacity expansion financed
by this project, but also by other new plants developed under GSTC's jurisdiction, it would have
been appropriate to include technical assistance to help GSTC identify an appropriate solution to this
issue, as today, this solution has not yet been fully developed. There is considerable space for
innovation in this field and GSTC has already indicated the need to improve sludge handling.
The Results Framework contained one indicator at the PDO level linked to the implementation of the
IPCAP, requiring 95% of the industries to comply with discharge standards and the relocation of
highly polluting industries. Even though this action was included as a covenant in the Project
Agreement, the project did not finance any directly related activity. Consequently, compliance was
not routinely monitored, and its usefulness as a mitigation strategy against the risk of "lax
enforcement of pollution control policies" is somewhat dubious.
The financial covenant required total revenues to be greater or equal than operating expenses (O&M and depreciation) and
the amount of debt service exceeding depreciation. The term "total revenues" is defined as the sum of total operating
revenues and net non-operating income.
8


﻿Therefore, although the project had a pioneering spirit and was aimed at the right sectors, the overall
Quality at Entry rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory due to the above shortcomings, which had a
lasting effect on implementation.
2.2   Implementation:
As reported in Section 1.7 above, the project was restructured three times, with closing date
extensions totaling two years. By December 31, 2011, all project activities were completed except
for the hazardous waste component and some unresolved resettlement issues.
Design changes. Regarding the construction of the sewerage network, detailed designs conducted
during implementation found that the initial objective of constructing 500 km of sewers as mainly a
separate system was both unrealistic, because of the construction and resettlement related challenges
implied, and unnecessary because it was possible to make use of the existing combined sewers as
part of the new network. The network was also re-designed since GSTC could use its own funding to
build new sewers, so the length of network constructed declined to 371 km.
The challenges of building a new sewerage network in densely populated and rapidly growing
urban and peri-urban areas became evident during implementation. Contractors often encountered
traffic disruptions and problems of not knowing the location of existing underground utilities in very
dense urban areas. Also, many villagers in one particular site refused to be relocated in 2006
because, in a context of sharp increases of land and house prices, they found cash compensation
insufficient. The need to pay market prices for cash compensation was continuously discussed with
the Borrower, but this issue remained unresolved for almost two years, when the Borrower finally
accepted to construct acceptable replacement housing (see Section 2.4 and Annex 7). Ultimately
delays in completing the sewer networks led to lower capacity utilization of the Dashadi WWTP.
The construction of the hazardous waste facilities also met with serious delays which resulted in
its not being completed at closing. The feasibility studies prepared during preparation failed to
properly identify the topographic characteristics of the selected construction site. This resulted in a
near doubling of the site capacity with a 65% increase in the required area. Consequently, the budget
for land acquisition failed to take into account the higher cost due to an increase in land
requirements. The result was insufficient counterpart funds, causing major implementation delays.
The Borrower's lack of full understanding of the institutional framework for private operation of the
hazardous waste plant - and the Bank's failure to recognize this -- caused further delays that
resulted in the plant's not having a private operator ready to start operations at closing. Water quality
monitoring activities were also significantly delayed due to a series of issues related to the GDEPB's
lack offamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures.
Fiduciary difficulties. During the mid-term review, the Bank rightly downgraded the rating for
implementation progress from marginally satisfactory to unsatisfactory, due to the lack of progress
on the construction of the sewer network and the suspension of work on the hazardous waste
facilities. There was also an urgent need to resolve pending fiduciary issues raised by the external
auditors in the 2007 and 2008, including the use of fraudulent documents to claim reimbursement
from the Bank loan, and overstatement and "improper" procurement. The need to refund the Bank
9


﻿for these ineligible expenditures, and to put in place stronger financial and contract management
systems to address these weaknesses, also contributed to implementation delays.
The Luoxi Island inter-municipal project was dropped because the procurement process for civil
works to construct river-crossing pipelines and pumping stations failed three times. With the Loan
Closing imminent, there was not enough time to complete a fourth bidding process and the works, so
the Grant allocation for Luoxi Island was reallocated to the Nangang WWTP.
Institutional difficulties. GSTC was not able to generate total revenues to cover operating expenses
(including depreciation) and debt service costs. Guangzhou Financial Bureau would not consider
raising tariffs to a sufficient level due to issues of social stability during an inflationary period. The
lack of progress on the project's regional sharing objectives was also found to be too politically
sensitive to be implemented.
During preparation it was agreed that the inter-municipal component would be fully defined during
implementation after a study of constraints to inter-municipal infrastructure development was carried
out and the regulatory framework was developed. Unfortunately that study devolved into a series of
study tours and workshops that were incapable of detecting locally specific problems in developing
shared environmental infrastructure projects. The regulatory framework seemed to overlook these
challenges too. At appraisal it was expected that a small proportion of the GEF funds would be
reserved to support operations in the early stages, but the amendment of 2006 allowed the use of all
the funds in the construction stage. As a result, there is no incentive to secure available operation
funds to support operational start-up due to complicated tariff allocation among different districts.
2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
Design. The Project's Results Framework was modeled on the Logframe, which defined a
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. The Logframe, however, lacked clarity
and specificity. Indicators were difficult to measure, and their baselines were nonexistent, inaccurate,
or had contradictory target values.
Evaluation of indicators. The GEO and the PDO were too global, making it difficult to isolate the
effect of project activities and to design appropriate indicators. The PDO indicators did not fully
reflect the objective itself as they did not incorporate any aspect about rationalization of
infrastructure or use of regional planning. GEO indicators (improved water quality monitoring and
increased collaboration) are actually more related to the PDO than to the GEO, as they included
rationalization of infrastructure and inter-municipal cooperation as an approach to regional planning.
PDO Indicator #2 focused on increasing pre-treatment of industrial wastewater and relocation of
highly polluting industries, but there is no mention of industrial pollution in the PDO and no
accompanying component. PDO Indicator #3, on increasing collection and treatment of hazardous
waste, referred to a baseline value of 45,000 tons/year. However, Guangzhou had no hazardous
waste treatment, so the baseline should have been zero. The understood target was 45,000 tons/year.
Intermediate Outcome Indicator #1, "percentage of river samples over Class III", measured broader
outcome level results rather than intermediate results. Even more problematic is that this indicator is
so global that it actually captures impacts not directly related to this project, such as domestic or
10


﻿industrial effluents from other areas or agricultural and non-point pollution. Intermediate Outcome
Indicator #4 measured the strengthening of the institutional arrangements for the wastewater sector
that aimed to achieve the corporatization (not well defined) of the regional wastewater company.
However, no similar indicator existed for the development and improvement of the institutional
framework of the hazardous waste facility. Hence, although the project devoted considerable effort
to developing the hazardous waste framework contributing to transformation in the sector, it cannot
be properly assessed. The project would have benefitted from an indicator such as "establishment of
a regulator and operator".
Additionally, the PAD states that inter-municipal components would pursue full cost recovery by
newly established separate utilities. Nevertheless, there were no indicators set up to evaluate this
achievement for the sustainability of the interventions; therefore no quantifiable evidence is
available.
Implementation of M&E. Despite these problems, project progress was regularly monitored and
reported in the periodic progress reports. The Bank kept track of progress of physical, financial,
environmental and resettlement and land acquisition aspects, which were reported in the semi-annual
progress reports. External resettlement monitoring reports were prepared and submitted periodically.
A constant flow of M&E information during implementation allowed the Bank team to assess the
performance of project components (except for the inter-municipal component as stated above) and
their potential sustainability. Monitoring data was assembled by the respective agencies, namely
GSTC, GEPB, GZPMO, GDPMO and GSWMC. Some indicators were updated and modified
several times during implementation, to improve specificity, but their inconsistent baselines and
target values remained from the design phase.
Utilization/sustainability of M&E arrangements. The water quality indicators are being used to
improve field inspections and to detect potential polluters, which facilitates the enforcement of
environmental regulations and provides valuable inputs to inform the design of new environmental
policies or update old ones. This data is also used to ensure the adequate functioning of the
wastewater treatment plants, as samples of the river at discharge points are regularly taken.
2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable):
Social safeguards. Resettlement was coordinated by the Guangzhou Project Management Office
(GZPMO), who began RAP implementation in 2004. Resettlement was undertaken in the wastewater
and hazardous waste components, where the main issues were permanent acquisition of 128 ha of
land and the temporary acquisition of 217 ha of land. The corresponding number of people to be
resettled was originally 44,641. However, the actual number of people resettled was only 6,780-an
85% decrease (see Annex 7). The number of Project Affected People (PAP) was lower because of
the use of effective construction techniques, such as pipe-jacking, pipeline layout modification, and
reductions in the extension of the network vis-d-vis the original design. All PAPs were compensated
prior to asset-taking and the compensation offered at least met RAP standards.
RAP Implementation. Implementation of the RAP was monitored by external consultants who
provided external monitoring reports regularly. Random investigations on the restoration of
livelihoods were conducted and they confirmed that the livelihoods of the PAPs have been fully
11


﻿restored. Land acquisition had a minimal effect on PAPs whose main sources of income were
wages, rentals or dividends. Regarding the hazardous waste facility, the two affected villages
distributed land compensation among the villagers through transparent procedures. The living
standards survey concluded that the livelihoods of the PAPs were fully restored.
Resettlement was almost entirely completed by the end of 2011, except for replacement housing
construction for Chebei Village (under the wastewater component). By 2009, a total of 154
households (550 people) at the village had been relocated, but replacement housing had not been
completed at Loan closing, which implies a need for continuing supervision from the Bank. GZPMO
is ensuring the completion of this activity.
Environmental safeguards. No unforeseen adverse environmental problems arose during
implementation. Effective mitigation measures were taken promptly to ensure that all environmental
indicators remained within acceptable levels. Public consultations and information disclosure were
carried out continuously. Semi-annual environmental monitoring reports and EMP implementation
reports were submitted to the Bank regularly. Guangzhou Environmental Protection Research
Academy was entrusted to conduct environmental monitoring during the construction phase, while
Guangzhou City Drainage Monitoring Station and Guangzhou Municipal Environmental Monitoring
Center conducted environmental monitoring during the operation stages. The monitoring results
showed that effluent, ambient air quality, odor, noise, and sludge complied with the relevant
environmental standards during the operation of the three WWTPs of the project.
Financial management. Several issues related to poor financial management performance arose
during implementation. The GZPMO was hosted by two different institutions which compromised
its financial management performance. The new PMO's internal controls and efficiency were quite
weak, as demonstrated by the fact that it delegated the owner's responsibility to a third entity and
hired an international consulting firm for supervision.
In several aspects, GSTC did not adequately fulfill its responsibilities as it failed to adequately
conduct supervision of project activities. As a result, some serious issues were disclosed by the
external auditors in their annual audit reports, such as the use of fraudulent documentation,
overstated completed activities and "improper" procurement. GSTC implemented the mitigating
measures required by the Bank. These consisted of implementing improved financial and contract
management measures to enhance its internal control system, which resulted in improvements that
were noted later in implementation.
In addition, project accounting was also weak, and some outstanding issues have still not been
resolved: the total project investment at completion is understated because the eligible documents for
resettlement expenditures could not be obtained by GSTC. The auditors raised this problem several
years ago, but it remained unresolved in August 2011.
The Bank monitored and supervised the project twice a year following these issues closely and
proactively. The project was required to refund the Bank ineligible expenditures equivalent to US$
284,180 from 2007 and $226,388.45 from 2008 and additional mitigation measures were put in
place, such as establishing a set of sound internal control systems to ensure all the completed
activities and the related document could be verified by qualified staff, hiring some staff with
12


﻿construction engineering background, and establishing frequent communications with external
auditors to better understand related regulations.
Procurement. Contract management by the PIU of GSTC experienced major issues of over-
measurement for civil works and non-compliance with prior review requirements stipulated in the
Loan Agreement. Procurement implemented by the PIU of Panyu District, where the Luoxi Island
works would have been located, failed several times and had to be repeated due to non-compliance
with the Bank's procurement guidelines which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of this activity.
Several gaps in the process justified this decision. These could be summarized as: publishing the
advertisement in inappropriate media; giving insufficient time to the bidders for preparation of the
bids; requiring bidders to participate in the bid opening; failing to adopt the standard bidding
document; rejecting all the bids on the grounds that the number of the bids was less than specified
numbers; and rejecting   the bids on the grounds of non-substantial deviation without any
clarifications sought from the bidders.
2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Wastewater sector. GSTC has adequate staff who have been trained to carry out their jobs
efficiently and effectively and are learning new skills to prepare themselves for future challenges.
They have comprehensive knowledge of relevant national and international best practices and can
apply them. An effective process for succession management is in place. Training carried out during
the project is listed in Annex 2 under Component 5. GSTC has prepared financial projections and
company performance is being monitored against the financial covenants used during
implementation. The company still needs to make adequate provisions to fully cover operational
expenses (O&M, depreciation and debt service). Key operational and financial indicators are
provided in Annex 3.
GSTC's main challenge is to increase the treatment capacity fast enough to stay one step ahead of
current economic and population growth, for which sound planning is key. GSTC needs to keep
expanding the separate network in order to improve the strength of the raw wastewater at the intake
and improve the efficiency at which its treatment plants operate. Its other technical challenge is the
handling and management of sludge. Currently, part of the sludge is deposited in a landfill and the
rest is incinerated or treated for composting, but neither option is optimal due to the amount of
energy used and the indirect health impacts caused by incineration.
Hazardous waste. Perhaps the most important post-completion challenge refers to the operation of
the hazardous waste facilities which, if done properly, will guarantee the sustainability of the
hazardous waste sector in Guangzhou. On April 27, 2012, the Guangzhou Solid Waste Management
Center (GSWMC) issued the bid document for outsourcing a private sector operator. The final
selection of a successful operator was still pending upon completion of this report. The selected
operator will be involved in testing the equipment and processing facility. In addition, there is a call
for continued strengthening the corporate capacity of the Guangzhou Environmental Technical
engineering Company (GETEC). Lastly, if the plant is operated adequately and the landfill fills at
expected rates, it could be exhausted in three to four years, meaning that it would be necessary to
start planning for a subsequent landfill right away.
13


﻿The inter-municipal project of Foshan depends on the finalization of the construction of the
sewerage network under the Second Guangdong PRD Urban Environment Project (PRD2, Loan
4856). Once works are completed, Foshan municipality will operate the system. Yet, there is
currently a dispute between Chancheng and Nanhai District on the tariff allocation, which was not
clearly defined under the cooperation agreement between the two districts, so they are still waiting
for resolution from Foshan Municipal Government. After discussions about sharing operating costs,
the Guangzhou Economic Development Zone (EDZ) assumed responsibility. Both inter-municipal
projects will still need to establish adequate tariff levels to recover at least O&M costs.
Last, the Province currently provides an annual budget of RMB 7.7 million as the operating budget
of the water quality monitoring network. Total staff engaged in water quality monitoring activities in
the PRD area reached 1,511 in 2010. GDEPB should continually budget for adequate O&M of the
network.
3.    Assessment of Outcomes
3.1   Relevance of Objectives
RATING: Satisfactory
The PDO and GEO remained relevant throughout implementation to completion. The PDO was
consistent with the two main CAS themes which were key development priorities, notably: (a)
strengthening environmental protection and natural resource management; and (b) improving urban
environmental management and public service provision. At completion, the PDO and GEO
remained relevant with the draft Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (to be discussed in early FY13),
whose first strategic theme is "supporting greener growth" by "enhancing urban environmental
services"; and "demonstrating pollution control measures". Some project activities were adapted to
the challenges that arose during implementation, such as the re-design of the sewerage network or
the design of the inter-municipal infrastructure, which was deliberately designed as an open pilot
activity to be fully defined during implementation. At completion, except for a few small sub-
components in the institutional strengthening component, all components remained relevant to
achieving the objectives of China, the Bank, Guangdong Province, and the project itself.
3.2    Achievement ofProject Development Objectives and Global Environmental Objectives
RATING: Moderately Satisfactory
Before assessing the achievement of the PDO and GEO, it is necessary to understand the size of the
PRD relative to the size of the project interventions. The project's service area is only 2.3% of the
total PRD area, and the population served by the project's new infrastructure represents only about
16% of the PRD total. Therefore the PDO/GEO of improving environmental conditions in the PRD
and the South China Sea was too high a reach for a project of this scope. A better PDO might have
focused on reducing pollution.
Environmental Improvement through Wastewater Infrastructure. Rating: Satisfactory
14


﻿The project financed wastewater treatment facilities and related investments in Guangzhou, domestic
wastewater being the biggest single source of water pollution in the PRD, accountable for 34% of
the organic pollution load. Under the wastewater and inter-municipal environmental infrastructure
components, the project financed the construction and/or expansion of 371km of sewerage
networks2, two pump stations and the construction/expansion of three WWTPs: (a) Dashadi WWTP
was constructed with a capacity of 200,000 m3/day; (b) Liede was expanded an extra 200,000
m3/day; and (c) the Nangang WWTP was expanded from 25,000 to 100,000 m3/day, for a total
capacity expansion of 475,000 m3/day. The Liede WWTP operates at 100% hydraulic capacity,
Dashadi operates at 75% hydraulic capacity and Nangang at 87% hydraulic capacity. Dashadi's
organic load of recipient influent is still low, with only 68 mg/l. For both Dashadi and Nangang, a
gradual increase of hydraulic and organic loads is expected with the ongoing expansion and
upgrading of the sewer network. For the GSTC catchment area, the total volume of domestic
wastewater treated has increased from 50% in 2003 to 97% in 2011 thanks in part to the project
interventions which account for 18% of Guangzhou's total treatment capacity.
The WWTPs' successes in removing key pollutants - COD, BOD, SS, T-P and NH3-N - are shown
in Annex 2 (see tables 3, 4 and 5). All three WWTPs are complying with effluent standards, and
are reducing pollution loads to the PRD and South China Sea, thereby improving the
environment. The quality of the PRD has improved in part thanks to the success of the project's
wastewater infrastructure, as shown by the percentage of samples from PRD rivers meeting
Chinese surface water quality standards (Class III+), which has increased from 57% in 2003 to
70.4% in 2011. This compares reasonably well to the appraisal estimate of 80%. However, this
indicator has a couple key flaws: (a) domestic wastewater is not the only pollution source in the
PRD; and (b) the sampling points are spread all around the PRD rather than being located near
project interventions, so attribution is somewhat problematic. Sampling downstream of WWTPs
would likely have shown more positive results.
On the institutional side, the operation and regulatory functions for the wastewater sector were
successfully separated, which is a significant step towards sustainability. The objective of
transforming GSTC from a municipal department to a corporatized wastewater utility - it is
now a public limited company - was achieved. The professionalization of its staff, translated in
improved technical and managerial skills, was also achieved through the project's institutional
strengthening activities. Project implementation also saw a significant improvement in the method of
revenue collection, which started as a service fee and switched to structured tariff Revenues are
now collected by the water utility and are transferred fully and directly to GSTC, giving the
company a predictable, uniform revenue stream that did not exist before. However the project's key
goal of cost recovery and financial viability was not fully achieved. To attain this goal, a
combination of (a) further capacity building in financial management and forecasting, coupled with
(b) political commitment to raise tariffs to necessary levels, are necessary. GSTC staff must be
officially transferred from government employment to GSTC employment and the municipal
government still needs to grant the Guangzhou Water Affairs Bureau more autonomy to set tariffs to
maintain GSTC's financial viability. (Annex 8 shows an organizational chart of the
water/wastewater sector.)
2 The project also financed 44 km of sewers in the Nangang and Foshan inter-municipal components.

﻿Environmental Improvement through Hazardous Waste. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The project originally was to finance a hazardous waste facility including a landfill capacity of
150,000 m3/day. However, as mentioned in Section 2.2 above, the landfill site was expanded by
93% to 290,000 m3/year, and also includes: (a) a waste receiving, sorting and transfer facility with a
capacity of 45,000 tons/year; (b) a physical/chemical treatment facility for 4,000 tons/year (double
the original design); (c) a stabilization and solidification facility of 20,000 tons/year; and (d) a trans-
shipment capacity of 21,000 tons/year. Unfortunately, due to design changes and long
implementation delays, construction of the facility was not quite complete at Loan closing, although
many of the remaining construction activities were supporting services (access roads, utility
supplies, site restoration and landscaping). Therefore, the indicator of treating 45,000 tons/year was
not met. The Guangzhou Solid Waste Management Center has launched the process of engaging a
private sector operator for the facility. The facility should be able to commence operations in the
latter half of 2012.
On the institutional side, the operation and regulatory functions have been successfully separated --
a significant step towards sustainability of the future service. Guangzhou EPB and GSWMC have
decided, using sound criteria, to retain the functions of management, oversight and billing collection
through a subordinate organization called Guangdong Environmental Technology and Engineering
Company (GETEC), and to outsource O&M to a private operator. The O&M contract will have a
duration of three years and will include a technical assistance and training component for GETEC.
This will provide GETEC the option to reassume O&M functions after termination of the O&M
contract. Other important regulatory reforms have been conducted, such as the development of an
annual reporting and registration program for hazardous waste generators or the issuing of permits
for hazardous waste transactions (see Annex 2 for more details).
Regional Planning Approach. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
To introduce a regional planning approach, the project was to implement two to three pilots to foster
inter-municipal cooperation in the planning and construction of shared wastewater facilities. Two
pilots were completed: (a) the construction of the Nangang WWTP, shared between Guangzhou
municipality and the EDZ, and (b) a sewerage network, shared between Chancheng and Nanhai
districts in Foshan. Both interventions showed savings in capital expenditures and land acquisition
compared with the alternative of having each district build its own system. However, the sharing of
responsibilities and operational costs in the operational phase still needs to be clarified as these
issues were not adequately defined in the regulatory framework created under this component. The
third pilot appraised, the Luoxi Island WWT System, was dropped in late 2011 for reasons explained
above.
This component also financed a study to update the PRD Wastewater Master Plan (PRDCP) to
increase functional efficiency, optimize the number and size of wastewater treatment facilities using
least-cost strategies, maximize environmental benefits and plan interventions without limiting
planning to jurisdictional boundaries. The document is supposed to offer a reference baseline and
guidelines to be followed in the PRD region. However, challenges in its implementation exist.
Generally, each municipality still continues to use locally developed municipal plans. These plans
16


﻿are supposed to follow the regional master plan, but there is no oversight authority to guarantee that
this happens, and sometimes local interests in developing environmental infrastructure prevail.
Another step in moving toward regional planning was to promote crucial improvements in water
quality monitoring and information dissemination to foster regional planning and data sharing.
GDEPB now has a modern GIS-based platform with real time monitoring of water quality in 57
stations across the PRD. This information is already being used to inform the environmental
enforcement department of the GDEPB of any possible anomaly or violation of discharge
regulations. Data on the water quality class of the different sections of the river is published online
and updated on a weekly basis. Yet, the detailed, parameter-wise water quality information is kept
internally in the GDEPB. GDEPB has shared data on air quality with other municipalities (Hong
Kong SAR, China, Macao SAR, China), but this is not the case for water quality data as intended
under the project. Explanations given by the Borrower3 about the justification for eliminating the
activity of a regional conference on water quality show the low priority given to this approach.
In summary, although the project was rightly designed to make key contributions in different
environmental areas (hazardous waste, wastewater, environmental monitoring), it concentrated
mostly   on the wastewater component (75%      of financing), whose desired outcomes were
successfully achieved and the PDO indicator (Indicator 1) was exceeded. Moreover, the project had
high institutional impact: Guangzhou now has a corporatized and independent utility whose capacity
has been strengthened and is now able to produce financial projections thanks to a secured income
from collected tariffs. Overall, this contributed to the solid progress made by Guangzhou in this
sector resulting in a project outcome rating of MS.
3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Economic. A cost-effectiveness approach was adopted in the analysis since it was difficult at
appraisal to value the benefits in monetary terms due to the limited data available, the complexity of
the causes of pollution, and uncertainties related to the linkage between pollution reduction in Pearl
River and the benefits such as the reduction in public health costs and the positive impact on
amenities, tourism, land values, agriculture, and fisheries. When the cost-effectiveness analysis was
conducted at appraisal, the selected interventions with clearly stated pollution reduction targets had
the least average incremental cost, a reasonable size of savings in the net present value (NPV) of
total investment cost, and acceptable financial internal rates of return (FIRR).
Due mainly to increased resettlement costs (which are not precisely known as stated earlier), the
total investment cost of the selected interventions increased from US$442.4 million to US$576.4
million at project completion despite the 85% drop in the number of PAPs. With the same treatment
capacities built, the investment in wastewater management component increased 5% of its cost at
appraisal. The investment in the hazardous waste management component also increased but the
built landfill capacity is 93% larger than appraisal.
Borrower's Completion Report states "Given the organization ofsuch a meeting being a long and complex process, and its
low relevance to the project, in order to avoid delays, it was agreed to drop the South China Sea conference from the
subcomponent and reallocate the financing to other tasks"
17


﻿At project completion, the actual monitoring data of influent and effluent of the Liede III and
Dashadi WWTPs shows that the wastewater treated and discharged into the Pearl River has met all
required effluent standards. However, as stated in Section 3.2 above, the size of the project is small
relative to the requirements of the much larger PRDCP, so it cannot be said that the water quality of
the Pearl River at project completion has improved quite as much as expected (see corresponding
indicator) due to factors beyond the control of the project.
The main investments in the hazardous waste management component were just finished before
Loan closing. The landfill built can treat all hazardous waste generated by industries in Guangzhou
and the surrounding cities, but because it is not yet in operation, it is not possible to evaluate the
benefits of this component.
Financial. At appraisal financial projections were carried out for GSTC to analyze its financial
viability. The revenues and expenditures of GSTC for wastewater collection and treatment were
projected and the financial covenants of cost recovery and debt service coverage ratio were set
leading to targeted wastewater tariff increases.
The wastewater tariff was increased to its current level in the first half of 2009. GSTC has conducted
financial projections every year since the 2009 increase. At closing the financial covenants had not
been met according to GSTC's own financial projections. The latest financial projections done by
GSTC indicated that GMG needed to increase the average wastewater tariff from the current RMB
1.07/M3 to RMB 2.94/M3 in 2012 in order to comply with financial covenants. However, due to the
necessity of maintaining social stability during an inflationary period, the GMG has been reluctant to
increase the wastewater tariff. Additional information on compliance with financial covenants is
provided in Annex 3.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Relevance of the PDO and GEO was satisfactory because they were well aligned with the
Borrower's strategy and with the CAS and CPS throughout the project's life cycle. The project relied
mostly on supporting the wastewater sector, and the activities under this component were mostly
successfully completed. However, the assessment of outcome and efficiency are rated moderately
satisfactory for reasons provided above, and therefore the overall rating is MS.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)   Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
This project did not specifically focus on improving the lives of particular target groups, but it is
well known that economically disadvantaged populations suffer disproportionately from a poor
living environment, so those groups are likely to have benefitted most from the project, although
there is no supporting data. With respect to the affordability of the wastewater treatment services, the
18


﻿economic analysis (Annex 3) concluded that both the previous and future expected increases in
wastewater tariffs are broadly affordable even for the bottom 1% of low-income families.
After a tour of Guangzhou city revealed a significant shortage of public sanitation facilities,
particularly for taxi drivers and low-income residents, the project did include a program to promote
public hygiene, but in the end, Guangzhou city officials launched a program with its own funds.
Nevertheless Bank support for the program likely had a catalytic effect in getting over 300 public
toilets installed during the project period.
(b) Institutional C/aigc'Strengthening: The project supported innovative institutional changes in the
two environmental sub-sectors. The foundations were laid for sustainable development, but work
remains in progress.
With respect to the wastewater sub-sector, the corporatization of GSTC and the professionalization
of its staff mark an important step towards improving the quality of the service and its future
sustainability. The separation of the capital investment function (Guangzhou Water Investment
Group) and the regulatory (Guangzhou Water Affairs Bureau), from the management and operation
of both the water and wastewater operations (GWSC and GSTC) set up a very solid institutional
framework with opportunities for expansion and improving performance. If GSTC is able to
implement its vision as an independent, self-financed professionalized utility, it will become a strong
service provider to Guangzhou and its model could be replicated in similar urban contexts in China.
Hazardous waste management services have traditionally been funded from the general revenues
of local governments. However, where individual users of the services have been identified, local
governments have, as a matter of policy, charged such users for the services provided. Local
governments expect to rely increasingly on user fees and charges to finance these services in the
future. The intent now is to gradually introduce charges for treating and disposing of hazardous
wastes  in order to encourage enterprises producing hazardous wastes to bring the wastes to the
facility rather than disposing of them in an environmentally unsafe manner.
The project's main contribution was in helping set up the institutional framework for hazardous
waste, a new sector where there were few precedents. Although the main activities were not fully
completed at Loan closing, the facility will soon be ready to begin operations. The key remaining
challenge is the successful hiring of the private sector operator.
Finally, other PSP models apart from BOTs should be tested. The assessment of BOTs found that
this kind of contract could be better designed, as there are now some clauses that are not suitable to
local conditions, and adequate supervision of BOT contracts by local governments is still missing.
4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
In the wastewater sector, it is necessary to continue making progress in the institutional trajectory
of the sector development, to continue implementing reforms that lead to the consolidation of a good
19


﻿quality service. Increasing the operating revenue through an increased tariff to cover the operation,
maintenance, depreciation and debt service costs is a crucial step in that direction. Rating:
Moderate.
Regarding the hazardous waste plant, if the private operator being selected currently is able to
mobilize in a timely manner and operates the plant and landfill adequately, and if industries
producing hazardous waste bring their waste for disposal as foreseen, the landfill could be exhausted
in three to four years, meaning that it would be necessary to start planning for a subsequent landfill
right away. Moreover, the incentive system for industries to send their hazardous waste to the
facility (a combination of affordable tariffs and sanctions for non compliance), still needs to be
proved. The oversight and regulatory functions of GETEC and GSWMC are also yet to be proven.
Rating: Substantial.
The introduction of a regional approach in planning and developing new wastewater infrastructure
has been only partially realized, and strong political leadership and commitment at the highest level
will be needed for this to become a reality. It is also necessary to investigate new strategies to
engage local governments by emphasizing the clear benefits of shared infrastructure. This will
require a better understanding of the administrative constraints of implementation and more creative
solutions to overcome them. The risk of continued inefficiency in the way environmental
infrastructure is built and managed is rated substantial if these measures are not undertaken.
The risks to successfully using the water monitoring system are negligible, as the GDEPB has
already allocated an adequate budget and staff have received sufficient training in its use. However,
in order to fully exploit the new system and maximize the benefits of the new monitoring network,
Guangdong Province should establish a collaborative partnership for sharing information among
the various municipalities and relevant institutions of the PRD, as was originally intended. A more
integrated water resource management approach is necessary to develop and improve water quality
modeling using a basin-wide approach, with sharing of data and resources. The PMO should
complete this approach as soon as possible, with Bank supervision under the ongoing PRD2.
Last, despite some good ongoing initiatives to increase the sludge treatment in the PRD area4, this
region, and more particularly the GSTC jurisdictional area, still faces a moderate environmental risk
derived from the lack of adequate treatment of sludge. Therefore there is a need to find a more
sustainable and integral solution to treat the sludge produced by GSTC, in terms of increasing energy
efficiency and minimizing environmental impact.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
4 For instance, the Bank funded PRD2 project includes the construction of a 400 tons/day capacity centralized sludge
treatment and disposal facility at Nanzhuang to treat sludge from five wastewater treatment plants in Foshan
20


﻿As already discussed in Section 2.1, the project was well justified, and its objectives were closely
aligned with the CAS of January 2003 and the Borrower's policy instruments such as the PRDCP
and the IPCAP to address the environmental deterioration of the PRD. A number of actions, such as
engaging a private operator for the hazardous waste facility, were quite innovative and carried
considerable leveraging power.
The Bank preparation team was managed by one very senior staff member and included a well-
rounded team comprising expertise in sanitary engineering, social and environmental safeguards,
procurement and financial management. The project was prepared over 24 months with a total
budget of US$548,490. The team was based in the Beijing office, which facilitated communications.
Nevertheless, there were some notable shortcomings. The project design over-emphasized the
"hardware" components and under-estimated the challenges posed by the development of new
institutional frameworks or the transformation of existing ones. The priority given to
institutional strengthening measures during design of these reforms and innovations, in terms of the
resources allocated to address them, was insufficient.
Another problem was the lack of clarity in defining the results framework and M&E indicators,
where there were inconsistencies between the objectives and the indicators and unclear baselines and
target values. The Bank should have devoted more time and resources to define a more precise and
effective results framework and monitoring system that would have facilitated monitoring during
implementation and evaluation of project achievements at completion.
Lastly, the Bank should have evaluated more realistically a number of project risks, particularly
those linked to the fiduciary management capacity of the implementing units, and allocated
necessary resources to provide better and more continuous training on Bank fiduciary procedures.
The challenges related to resettlement in densely populated urban areas could have also been better
anticipated given the Bank's long history of working in other mega cities in China and other East
Asian countries. Finally the institutional risks of moving toward an inter-municipal development
approach were underappreciated. Had the risks been more thoughtfully assessed, the risk rating
probably would have been "substantial" and the project might have received more than the usual
supervision coefficient budget, which QAG agreed was too low for a project of this scope and
complexity.
(b) Quality ofSupervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Early in implementation, project supervision was planned and carried out adequately. Supervision
teams were appropriately staffed to address and report on implementation issues as they emerged,
although it would have been more beneficial if all the team members had gone on mission together
once a year to discuss overlapping problem areas instead of employing a piecemeal approach where
a technical mission would be followed by a fiduciary mission, followed by a safeguards mission.
Although the project did not fund any activities geared toward complying with it, the IPCAP was
included in the results framework and was a covenant in the Project Agreement. The client
21


﻿communicated early during implementation that the IPCAP had been completed with the most
heavily polluting industries relocated. However, these assertions were never independently verified
by the task team.
In the latter half of 2007, when problems began to arise, the Bank team shifted its focus to resolving
issues causing delays such as procurement irregularities, financial management weaknesses,
counterpart funding shortages and resettlement problems. Technical experts keyed in on issues such
as reviewing new design proposals for the hazardous waste facility; financial experts focused on
GSTC's compliance with financial covenants. All these issues were on the critical path to successful
implementation during this period, and the issues are candidly reported in bi-annual Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs).
In light of the problems and subsequent delays cited above, it became obvious that the Loan closing
date of December 31, 2009 would not allow the PDO and GEO to be met, and the Borrower
requested a two year extension. However, with the project rated Unsatisfactory, granting the extra 24
months was ill-advised. Bank management wisely took a two-pronged approach. First it granted a
nine-month extension to enable the Borrower to carry out an Action Plan including: (a) refunding
ineligible disbursements from 2007 (US$284,180) and 2008 (US$226,338); (b) explaining
irregularities in procurement processing for domestic training; (c) implementing new regulations to
improve internal controls; (d) resolving all other accounting issues; and (e) completing land
acquisition and resolving counterpart funding issues for the hazardous waste component. Once the
Bank was satisfied with progress on the Action Plan, the second extension to December 31, 2011
was accorded. The Bank also extended the Grant closing date to keep the both closing dates in sync.
The Borrower requested another extension of the Grant closing date to December 31, 2012 in order
to complete the Luoxi Island WWS but it was rightly rejected by Bank management on the grounds
that the repeated procurement failures were mostly due to weak procurement capacity of the PIU,
and a fourth bidding was not likely to yield successful results.
Overall the Bank showed proactivity and flexibility by amending the legal agreements (four times)
and restructuring the project to increase its disbursement percentage for financing of works and to
extend the Loan/Grant closing dates to allow for the completion of project activities in order to meet
the PDO and GEO to the greatest extent possible. During the supervision, the Bank focus on solving
the implementation issues discussed above. Ideally, the PDO and results framework would have
been improved during a project restructuring; however, this was not possible because the Borrower
never formally requested the amendment needed for the Bank to pursue a Level I restructuring for
this purpose.
After the majority of these issues were resolved, the Bank continued to monitor the various technical
challenges related to quality of construction, installation, testing and commissioning of key works,
and kept close tabs on remedial actions taken by suppliers and contractors. In particular, for the
hazardous waste component, the team provided technical support at appropriate times for the
preparation of bid documents for public/private participation for the management and operation of
the facility and secured landfill, including the collection and transportation of hazardous wastes. It
also provided advice on the strategy and implementation plan for the plant's full cost recovery
objective, including the survey and registration of industries generating hazardous waste. However,
the expert consultant who helped prepare this component was not present during implementation.
22


﻿Such support might have provided the continuity necessary to overcome the difficulties that such a
new activity entailed.
The team's safeguards experts continuously followed up on implementation of the EMP and RAP,
with particular focus on implementation of the RAP for Chebei Village. The Bank conducted regular
supervision missions in this area twice a year. However, given the seriousness of the land
compensation and resettlement related challenges in this project, the Bank could have devoted more
supervision resources to work closer with the client in solving these issues.
Two other weaknesses detected during implementation were the lack of attention paid to the
institutional set-up for the operational phase of the inter-municipal subprojects and the Bank's
failure to convince the PRD municipalities of the importance of employing a regional approach to
planning, data-sharing and operation of shared infrastructure. However, it must also be noted that
with the project's already complex design involving five components, and with the serious fiduciary
issues starting in 2007, the team's supervision budget quickly came under pressure. The team was
able to obtain some extra resources while the project was in problem status, but still, the team was
forced to focus on key technical issues to ensure the achievement of the water quality improvement
objective, and on ensuring proper implementation of safeguards and fiduciary policies, unfortunately
at the expense of supporting the implementation of institutional challenges.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Bank's performance at quality at entry was moderately unsatisfactory, and its performance in
supervision is moderately satisfactory. Considering the project's moderately satisfactory overall
outcome, the overall moderately satisfactory rating is justified.
5.2   Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance (Guangdong Provincial Government and Guangzhou Municipal
Government):
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank prepared and designed this project because it saw the opportunity to support the PRD
government's ongoing solid initiatives, such as the PRDCP and the IPCAP, to address its serious
environmental problems. Regional and local authorities showed strong commitment and leadership by
making the necessary institutional reforms such as the establishment of GSTC as an autonomous
enterprise or allowing the hazardous waste facility to be operated by the private sector. The government
did provide counterpart funding estimated at $438.6 million or 144% above the appraisal estimate of
$304.4 million, in order to continue making sustainable progress in providing sound environmental
services. The government's good performance in these areas was compromised by its lack of success in
moving toward a more integrative regional approach, which was part of the PDO. This objective would
have met with greater success if the governments had displayed stronger commitment to: (a) forcing the
PRD municipalities to use the updated wastewater master plan as a planning tool, (b) encouraging
23


﻿shared operational responsibilities for the Nangang WWTP, and (c) disseminating data on water quality
monitoring. As noted, specific issues also arose regarding land compensation or lack of counterpart
funds to cover land acquisition that greatly exceeded initial estimates. These evidenced only moderately
satisfactory focus on resolution by regional and local activities.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. (GDPMO, GZPMO, GZEPB, Guangdong Provincial Department of
Construction, GDEIC, GZEDZ, Jiangmen and Foshan PIUs: Moderately Satisfactory. GSTC, GSWMC:
Moderately Unsatisfactory. PIU in Panyu District: Unsatisfactory)
In general, the performance of implementing agencies in completing detailed designs, conducting
design reviews, and implementing of environmental safeguards measures, is considered moderately
satisfactory. The quality of monitoring and reporting on the project outcomes and output indicators
was sometimes poor; however, many implementing agencies maintained strong commitment to
achieving the PDO despite their weak capacity, which led to delays in carrying out their respective
tasks and addressing obstacles as required, mainly for lengthy land acquisition.
The Bank detected several weaknesses in the PIUs that were causes of delays. First, the assignment
of GDPMO to the Finance Bureau was not the best choice and other institutions more closely related
to environmental infrastructure would have been a better candidate. Their staffs were not familiar
with Bank procedures and evident shortcomings were found in financial management and
procurement practices.
GSTC was responsible for the cases of improper fiduciary practices and pending resettlement issues
in Chebei village. The slow construction progress caused by the resettlement problems could have
been addressed had this institution been more proactive in requesting municipal government
intermediation with the PAPs or in promoting coordination among district government agencies in
realigning the collection pipelines in or nearer the streams and canals in order to reduce the impacts
of resettlement.
This PIU was also responsible for the procurement and financial management problems raised in
Section 2.4. The Bank had to provide extra training towards the end of the project to build capacity
in these areas. However, the efforts made by GSTC to become a corporatized utility, to train its
staff, to comply with the agreed covenants (except the financial ones which were somewhat out of its
control), and to overcome the afore-mentioned challenges in order to take the project to a successful
end, need to be recognized.
GSWMC under GZEPB, responsible for the implementation of the hazardous waste facility, were
not able to facilitate the resolution of the land compensation problem where the municipal
government took three years to purchase the land needed. Weaknesses were also found in the
supervision of the market study report and on understanding the proposed management framework,
resulting in delays in preparing the regulatory framework and hiring the private operator.
The PIUs in charge of the inter-municipal component (Foshan, GZEDZ and Panyu District),
proved to be considerably slow, with the exception of GZEDZ, and PIU in Panyu District is lack of
24


﻿adequate understanding of Bank procedures. This consequently caused delays in the preparation of
bidding documents and other management and supervision activities. In particular the PIU in Panyu
District failed three times in the bidding process for the main works of the Luoxi Island inter-
municipal component that was finally dropped.
The Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction, in charge of the review and update of
Wastewater Master Plan, started the task unconscionably late due to poor contract management of an
international firm who only completed the study more than one year later than the contracted
delivery schedule, leaving little time to prove its value during the life of the project.
GDEIC under GDEPB responsible for the implementation of the Water Quality Monitoring and
Information System component, with a slow start until 2009 due to lack of ownership, completed
the Water Quality Monitoring and Information System within two years.
Jiangmen, responsible for the implementation of the PSP study, selected the consultant only in 2009
after the drop-out of Dongguan, and completed the PSP study within two years.
(c) Justification ofRating for Overall Borrower Performance:
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
As the performance of the government and implementing agencies are both rated moderately
satisfactory and the project outcome is moderately satisfactory, the overall borrower performance is
also moderately satisfactory.
6.    Lessons Learned
1. PMO's functions should be delegated to an entity which is relatively robust and has the
capacity to coordinate with related government entities. The PMO should be well staffed and
provided with sufficient financial support. Whenever PIUs delegate their owners' responsibility
to other entities, they need to strengthen supervision on the work conducted by the delegated
entities. Hiring a well-known international firm does not mean that PIUs can abdicate
responsibility for overseeing their work. PIUs need to set up a solid internal control system to
ensure the performance of the consulting firms is supervised efficiently. Meanwhile, sanction
clauses should be carefully considered, added in the respective contracts and enforced to protect
the interests of project owners.
2. Two lessons learned arose from implementation of the hazardous waste component:
a) The cost of land acquisition and ability to mount adequate, timely counterpart funding should
be very realistically assessed during the site selection process in order to avoid lengthy,
costly delays. This lesson is widely applicable for similar projects in the waste management
sector.
b) The challenges of setting up a successful and effective institutional framework for the
management and operation of the new facilities depends on possessing a broad knowledge of
the market. To ascertain such knowledge, it is necessary to conduct a sound cost recovery
25


﻿analysis and to design realistic terms of reference for the private operator, if that route is
chosen.
3. In the wastewater sector, institutional changes take time, and the support provided needs
to adequately capture the local context. For instance, the introduction of PSP requires a careful
analysis of the various PSP modalities. In this context, pure BOT models might not be the
optimum solution for the wastewater sector due to the high tariff level needed to recover the
private operator investment; DBO/T-type solutions might prove to be more appropriate. Also,
mere corporatization of a public service like in the case of Guangzhou might work as well given
the establishment of performance management contracts to guarantee accountability in the
provision of the service, together with the right tariff policies to ensure cost recovery and
efficiency. It may be necessary to test some options in order to continue improving the quality of
the service in an efficient way.
4. From the technical point of view, it is important to carefully analyze influent wastewater
characteristics and conduct accurate flow projections in order to optimize the design and
technologies of WWTPs. Likewise, the selection of appropriate technologies to treat the
receiving wastewater from the outset of plant operations should be carefully analyzed.
Conducting basic loading-balance using the projected flows and wastewater characteristics is
critical at the design stage. For these purposes, a sound wastewater master plan is important
to capture all these factors to establish a sound basis for work during the feasibility study
stage.
5. When planning sewer networks construction, the budget, schedule and potential obstacles
need to be realistically assessed, to ensure the entire wastewater treatment system can be
completed in a timely manner. Being able to foresee and mitigate the main obstacles during
construction of a sewer network is necessary to minimize public objection to construction and to
secure temporary land use rights. Open-cut construction is most likely not a feasible option
for sewer construction in densely populated urban areas. Tunneling (including micro-
tunneling) construction should be considered, even though the associated engineering costs could
be high, as this method could have helped minimize the land acquisition problems and
consequent delays experienced in this project.
6. Sludge management strategies should be developed according to the influent wastewater
characteristics and potential reuse market or its final disposal method and locations. This
will not only provide the plant operation more flexibility but it will also reduce operating costs.
In doing so, adequate equipment selection and system operation including odor control should be
planned early in project design. Sludge digestion may not be a viable option for GSTC at this
stage, yet a long-term sludge management strategy should be considered when wastewater
characteristics eventually improve due to the construction of more separate sewer networks.
7. Sharing facilities between two or more local entities has proved to save money in terms of capital
expenditures. However, the viability and cost efficiency of such operation as a win-win situation
for both entities remains to be proven. Hence, it is essential to carefully evaluate the local
context for each specific case, as well as all the administrative constraints that may
influence the success of the operation, and to tailor solutions on a case by case basis.
26


﻿Moreover, as shown by the case of Nangang, strong political leadership at the right level is
required to overcome the specific difficulties that constrain the optimal operation strategy.
7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a)   Borrower/implementing agencies:
The Borrower raised the following issues:
*  Project Outcome Rating: The ICR should be written based on the comprehensive and fair
review of the project outcome and the overall project rating should be considered as
"Satisfactory".
*  Pending Resettlement Issues in Chebei Village: According to Chinese Contract Law,
Guangdong and Guangzhou have fulfilled all the related duties and obligations of the Chebei
Village resettlement issue, and the land acquisition has been completed, so there is no pending
resettlement issue. There is still serious dispute between two parties, and the assessment made by
the Bank solely from the Bank's perspective in the ICR is not fair and Guangdong PMO
requested to delete all the related Chebei Village resettlement issue from the ICR.
*  Project Implementation Arrangements: GDPMO considers the statement of "... GDPMO...
staff were not familiar with Bank procedures and evident shortcomings were found in financial
management and procurement practices" is not appropriate as GDPMO regard itself as the
supervising agency, not the implementing agency of the project, but GDPMO agrees with the
assessment that the assignment of GDPMO to the Finance Bureau was not the most appropriate.

﻿Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Wastewater Management
The project constructed two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and about 371
kilometers of sewer networks in Guangzhou, of which approximately 217 km were financed by the
Bank and about 154 km by the local government. Dashadi WWTP has a capacity of 200,000 m3/day
and Phase III of Liede WWTP also has a capacity of 200,000 m3/day and both are in operation.
Planned and actual facilities constructed for both WWTP systems are as follows:

km
As shown in table 1, branch sewers for both Liede III and Dashadi WWTPs were not constructed
mainly due to difficulties related to operating in dense urban environment and existing road
encroachment, longer schedule than planned, higher costs for construction and land acquisition and
temporary land requirements that were encountered during construction. It is expected that, in the
case of Dashadi, the development of the network will continue until the plant reaches 100% capacity.
Moreover, GSTC also has in mind to gradually continue upgrading the network, expanding the
extension of the separate network where possible.
The project also financed the extension of the network of other three catchment areas, based on the
Guangzhou Municipal Wastewater Treatment Master Plan and Guangzhou City "Blue Sky and
Clean Water" Action Plan, which required to increase the treatment rate. As for the networks of
Dashadi and Liede, the initial amounts included in the feasibility studies were reduced due to the
afore-mentioned problems. Table 2 below summarizes the work done.

(1) Dashadi WWTP:
Construction of the Dashadi WWTP, including interceptors, trunk sewers and two booster pumping
stations to convey the collected wastewater to the plant, was completed in 2009. The total service
area for Dashadi WWTP is about 55.5 km2. Its biological treatment process is the modified A 20
process which can provide nutrient removal for better results of phosphorus and nitrogen. Currently,
it is operating at 75% of hydraulic design capacity. Additional sewer networks need to be
constructed for it to meet its full capacity. In accordance with the Twelth Five-Year Plan of Dashadi
Wastewater Treatment System Construction Plan, more sewers will be constructed including
conversion of the combined sewers to separate sewers. These additional sewers will increase the
collection rate and improve influent wastewater strength as well. Dashadi WWTP has been in
service since late 2009 and has met all required effluent standards. Actual monitoring data of
influent and effluent for the Dashadi WWTP for 2011 are tabulated below:

(2) Liede WWTP Phase III:
Liede WWTP has been in service since 1999 and now has a total capacity of 1.2 million m3/day
including additional Phase III and IV expansion of 200,000 and 560,000 m3/day, respectively. It has
three different biological treatment processes: i) Phase I (A/B process); ii) Phase II (UNITANK);
and iii) Phase III and IV both use modified A20 process. The service area for Liede WWTP Phase
2
III is about 43.9 km . Liede WWTP Phase III was constructed in 2006 and has been operating at full
capacity treating mostly domestic wastewater. It has been in service since 2007 and has met all
required effluent standards. Actual monitoring data of influent and effluent for Liede WWTP Phase
III for 2011 are tabulated below:

Component 2: Hazardous Waste Management
Specific components of the completed Hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility include:
1. A waste receiving, sorting, and transfer facility with a design capacity of 45,000 tons per year,
consistent with the original design;
2. A physical/chemical treatment facility with a design capacity of 4,000 tons per year, doubling the
original design of 2,000 tons per year;
3. A stabilization and solidification facility with a design capacity of 20,000 tons per year, slightly
under the original design capacity of 21,000 tons per year;
4. A trans-shipment capacity of 21,000 tons per year, slight below the original estimate of 22,000
tons per year; and
5. A secure landfill site with a total capacity of 290,000 cubic meters in phase 1 development, as
opposed to the original design of 150,000 cubic meters. This significant increase of the secure
landfill capacity is primarily due to the realization during the detailed design phase that the
topographic setting of the site allowed for a significant increase in the landfill volume without an
increase of the area.
6. Total investment is US$ 46.78 million, as opposed to the original budget of US$24 million with
a Bank loan allocation of US$ 10 million. The primary causes for the cost increase are
significantly higher land acquisition and resettlement costs and the significant changes in the
RMB/US Dollar exchange rate.
The following technical assistance outputs were financed by the GEF Grant:
1. Hazardous Waste Market Survey and Assessment
2. Regulatory and Institutional Framework
3. Bid document for the selection of a private sector facility operator.
With the implementation of GEF supported projects, Guangzhou EPB and Guangzhou Solid Waste
Management Center (GSWMC) implemented the following specific regulatory reforms and capacity
development activities:
1. An annual reporting and registration program for hazardous waste generators was instituted to
allow Guangzhou EPB and GSWMC to gather and compile data on the amount of annual
hazardous waste generation, treatment and disposal.
2. Permits for hazardous waste transactions will be issued prior to shipment.
31


﻿3. Manifests will be used to control and monitor hazardous waste shipments, and conduct selective
inspections.
4. Permits and licenses will be issued for hazardous waste treatment and disposal companies, as
well as transportation companies and vehicles involved in hazardous waste shipments, including
the use of a GPS system on waste transport vehicles for enhanced monitoring.
5. Study tours were conducted to other cities (Shenzhen, Huizhou, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin,
Hangzhou and Suzhou) to gain a broader perspective and review experiences in hazardous waste
management.
Component 3: Inter-Municipal Environmental Infrastructure
As a pilot activity, two or more municipalities and districts were to construct shared environmental
infrastructure facilities using GEF funds. At Loan closing, two sub-projects had been completed:
Nangang WWTP and Foshan sewer networks.
Nangang WWTP
The project financed the capacity expansion of the Nangang WWTP from 25,000 m3/day to 75,000
m3/day including 22 km of sewer networks and one booster pumping station. The total service area
for Nangang WWTP is about 45 km2. Guangzhou Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center has
conducted monitoring of the influent and effluent of the WWTP and data present that Nangang
WWTP is meeting its discharge requirements. Nangang WWTP has been in service since mid 2010
and is meeting all required effluent standards. Actual monitoring data of influent and effluent of
Nangang WWTP are tabulated below:

Foshan Sewer Networks: The project financed the sewer networks and pumping facilities to convey
100, 000 m3/day wastewater to connect with the Foshan Zhen'an WWTP Phase III sewer network
system expansion being financed by PRD2. The system includes 11 km of sewer networks, two new
booster pumping stations, and one existing pumping station expansion.
Component 4: Water Quality
The project financed the development of the water quality database and information system in the
PRD region, while provincial and other local governments within the PRD financed automatic water
monitoring stations (AMS) along with water sampling and analytical equipment. By 2011, there were
a total of 57 automatic water quality monitoring stations in the PRD, of which 25 were located within
the City of Guangzhou. The Province provides an annual budget of RMB 7.7 million as the operating
budget of the water quality monitoring network. Total staff engaged in water quality monitoring
activities in the PRD area reached 1,511 in 2010.
32


﻿The water quality database and information system, developed under the project, contains monitoring
data from the 32 automatic monitoring stations in Guangdong Province, regular manual sampling
locations, as well as historic data from nine key areas of the PRD watershed, including river and
surface water bodies, water supply sources, water reservoirs and lakes, river discharge points to
ocean, direct discharges to oceans, etc. The water quality database has the capacity of supporting the
timely identification of potential pollution sources, based on real-time data, should pollution incidents
occur. Below is a summary of the water quality monitoring and information system.

Component 5: Institutional Strengthening and Training
This component was composed of four parts: (a) financial, institutional and project management
support; (b) public hygiene promotion; (c) strategic studies for regional planning and urban
development; and (d) training and study tours. The PAD did not provide any further detailed
information on the content of these technical assistance packages for comparison with actual.
33


﻿Under Part (a), the institutional strengthening activities focused on building the capacity of the
newly established GSTC. The GSTC Five Year Training (2006 to 2010) objectives and
accomplishments were:
-  GSTC staff have the skills to carry out their current jobs efficiently and effectively.
-  GSTC staff are actively learning new skills to prepare themselves both for future challenges in
their current jobs as well as for new roles and responsibilities within the Company.
-  GSTC staff have comprehensive knowledge of relevant national and international best practices
and know how to apply them in their day-to-day work.
-  An effective process for succession management is in place for all key positions in the Company.
The following key methods were used to deliver the necessary training: International Study Tour
(IST), domestic study tour (DST), on site training (OT), off site training (OST), and courses.
The scope of training included:
- Wastewater Sector Management: sector policy, planning, regulation, funding, tariff setting and
collection, construction management, technologies, and O&M practices.
- Corporate Management: strategic and business planning, performance management, life cycle
management including life cycle costing; demand forecasting, project appraisal, decision support,
communications, and time management.
- Project Management: managing project scope, scheduling and budgeting; value engineering;
project procurement; project accounting and cost control; construction management; and post
project audits.
- Financial Management: financial planning; budgeting; accounting; life cycle management
including life cycle costing; cost management; cash management; revenue forecasting; tariff setting
and collection; auditing; and financial reporting; risk analysis and management methods; scenario
analysis over a time cycle with varying conditions.
- Operations Management: operations planning and management; maintenance planning and
management; system monitoring; process control; laboratory services - sampling and analysis;
sludge management; stores and parts management; condition assessment; service life assessments;
safety management; and energy management.
- Business Support: information management; document management; human resources
management; purchasing, MIS, GIS, and office systems.
As part of the implementation of the training component, a formal M&E process was instituted
(training assessment, refinement and reporting) for feedback from participants on the quality and
relevance of specific training initiatives.
It should be noted that, by agreement between the consultancy firm MWH and GSTC at the end of
March 2008, and with the new Water Bureau in place, further work planned on the Dashadi
management contract was no longer required. The management contract for Dashadi WWTP
operations was not implemented.
34


﻿The remaining time for Dashadi was re-allocated to (i) supporting the requested sludge dewatering
studies, (ii) improving GSTC's O&M budgets, (iii) assisting GSTC with monitoring and refining the
training plan, and (iv) developing an HR-IS proposal to the World Bank and updating the GSTC's
HR strategy including updating priorities and key tasks.
Under Part (b) Hygiene promotion. The activity was to upgrade public toilets in Guangzhou city
which served many low-income neighborhoods in various parts of the city. Guangzhou ended up
launching its own program to upgrade public toilets and provided own funds, deciding to concentrate
on the institutional strengthening activities in building capacity for GSTC, promoting PSP and
updating the Wastewater Master Plan.
Under Part (c) the following activities were carried out.
Private Sector Participation in Jiangmen
A service contract was established between Jiangmen Municipality together with the Public Utilities
Bureau (now the Jiangmen Integrated Urban Management Bureau) and the consultant in July 2009 to
organize a study tour to three European countries and to prepare the bidding documents of Duran
WWTP (including the BOT contract documents).
Due to a variety of reasons, in March 2010, Jiangmen Municipal Government asked Jiangmen Urban
Development Group to invest in and develop the Duran WWTP, instead of entering into a BOT
contract for the construction and operation of the facility, as was originally planned. Therefore the
scope of this activity needed to be modified. After discussions among the PMO, the consultant and
the Bank, it was agreed that, instead, a mid-term review would be carried out on the existing BOTs
in other wastewater systems in Jiangmen, and to assist Jiangmen to develop a regulatory framework
on concessional operation.
Under the technical assistance, the regulatory framework, the content of the existing BOT contract
and the performance of the concession of wastewater services were reviewed. A regulatory manual
was developed on the basis of the concession agreement to facilitate institutional development and a
regulatory system for the concessional market of wastewater treatment services in Jiangmen.
Update of the Wastewater Master Plan
Deliverables of this subcomponent were divided into three main parts: (a) analysis of the current
situation, (b) hydrodynamic and water quality modeling, and (c) alternative/scenario analysis. The
reports respond to the TOR in terms of format and content. The existing analysis presented and
analyzed the water qualities of the PRD rivers, compared the pollution control targets proposed in the
master plan with the existing water pollution, raised water pollution issues in the PRD, and gaps in
the current plan. The report on hydrodynamic and water quality modeling developed proper
hydrodynamic and water quality models for the PRD, which are being used to forecast trends of
changes in hydrodynamic and water quality conditions, and how pollutants of the PRD would affect
water quality. The report on alternatives proposed guidance and suggestions to improve the PRD plan
based on cost-efficiency criteria.
35


﻿Part (d) Training and Study Tours
Field visits were made to a WWTP in Berne, Switzerland, wastewater facilities in Hungary, IZSU
(the water resources management committee) and its subsidiary WWTP in Izmir, Turkey, which
provided good references to Jiangmen on management issues of existing state-owned WWTPs,
financing for facility upgrading and other operation and sewer maintenance challenges. In the study
tour to Brazil (IPPUC Institute for Research and Urban Planning of Curitiba, and URBS of Curitiba,
and the Technical and Environmental Ministry of Brazil), discussions were held with the
management and technical staff, on applying centralized operation of quality assets to facilitate
development of state-owned enterprises; potential technical upgrading on existing WWTPs for better
environmental effects; and delegating sludge disposal to a contractor.
36


﻿Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Pearl River Delta Region
The PRD region is formed by Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, and Dong Jiang which are major branches of Pearl
River that discharges in to the South China Sea through eight provincial tributaries. PRD consists of
the cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Jiangmen, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Huizhou, and
Zhaoqing all in Guangdong Province.
Guangdong Province is one of the most developed provinces in China. In 2001, the provincial GDP
of Guangdong Province was RMB 1065 billion which was 11.3 % of the national GDP of China, while
the provincial GDP of Guangdong Province in 2010 was RMB4601 billion which accounted for
11.6% of the national GDP of China. Guangdong Province is the biggest contributor of the national
GDP of China.
The PRD region is the most important region in Guangdong Province. The PRD region is home to
half the total population of the province and produces about 80% of total provincial GDP of
Guangdong Province. The population and GDP of the PRD region are presented in the following
tables.

However, the economic development in PRD region had come at a heavy environment cost. In 2000,
the PRD region produced 4,197.5 million tons of wastewater. As investments in environmental
protection could not keep pace with the region's rapid economic development, the river's water
quality seriously deteriorated. In 2000, the wastewater treatment capacity in the PRD region was
only 2.6 million tons per day, equivalent to 22% of total wastewater generated. According to China's
2002 Environment Statement, the water quality at nine of 49 monitoring stations scattered along the
entire Pearl River was at Class IV or V and four others were even worse than Class V. Many urban
sections of the Pearl River were at Class V or worse. Realizing the serious water situation,
Guangdong Provincial Government decided to implement the PRD Clean-up Plan in November 2002.
GPG Environmental Programs - PRD Clean-up Plan
37


﻿The main objectives of the PRD Clean-up Plan were to achieve Class III for water quality in the Pearl
River by 2010, and the water quality of urban sections of the Pearl River should be better than Class
IV (See Annex 8 for Chinese water quality standards). During the PRDCP implementation period
(2002 to 2010), the local governments in the PRD invested over RMB55.7 billion to build
environmental protection facilities. These facilities included 138 wastewater treatment facilities,
seven solid waste treatment facilities, two ecological protection facilities, and they carried out four
capacity building activities for environmental management. There were eight additional facilities
under construction. The following table summarizes the information relating to PRD, adapted from
China's Environment Statements issued by the Ministry of Environmental Protection:

From the data and information listed in the above table, the water quality of PRD in 2010 was better
than that in 2002, or at least it did not worsen. This project undoubtedly contributed to these
improvements in PRD's water quality, although the investment of the project is only 2% of total
investment in PRD mobilized by local governments to implement the PRD Clean-up Plan.
Summary of Project Benefits and Costs
This project included five components:
*  Wastewater Management: Under this component, the project constructed a new treatment
plant at Dashadi with a capacity of 200,000 m3/d, expanded the existing Liede plant by 200,000
m3/d (Liede III), and constructed about 371 km of truck sewers to convey wastewater from the
drainage catchments of Dashadi, Liede III, and other four drainage catchments (i.e., Xilang,
Lijiao, Datansha, and Liede II), reducing about 129 km of sewers appraised.
*  Regional Hazardous Waste Management: Under this component, the project constructed a
secure landfill with capacity of 290,000 m3 which doubled the capacity appraised. This
component also constructed a transferring area, a physical and chemical workshop, stabilization
and solidification workshop. This facility is to serve Guangzhou and neighboring cities to treat
hazardous wastes and incinerator ash.
38


﻿*  Inter-municipal Environmental Infrastructure: Under this component, the project expanded
the capacity of the wastewater treatment facility in Nangang from 25,000 to 100,000 m3/d and a
wastewater collection system in Foshan for the Zhen'an III WWTP with capacity of 100,000
m3/d.
*  Water Quality Monitoring and Information System: Under this component, the project (a)
constructed three monitoring stations at provincial boundaries and four monitoring stations at
river estuaries, (b) updated three provincial automatic monitoring stations, (c) provided
equipment for the quality assurance of the automatic monitoring stations and vehicles, and (d)
constructed a MIS for the automatic monitoring system for water quality.
* Institutional Strengthening and Training.
The wastewater and hazardous waste management components are major investments financed by the
Bank loan. The other three components, partially financed by the GEF grant, are strong complements
to these two, and also crucial to the implementation and the success of the entire project.
The benefits of the project include reduction in water supply and public health costs, and results in
positive impacts on amenities, tourism, land values (especially those on the water front), agriculture,
and fisheries. However, since it was difficult at appraisal to value those benefits in monetary terms
due to the limited data available, the complexity of the causes of pollution, and uncertainties related
to the linkage between pollution reduction and the benefits, a cost-effectiveness approach was
adopted in the analysis.
At appraisal, the following factors were considered when the cost-effectiveness analysis was
conducted:
*  Pollution control targets;
*  Net present value of total investment cost (NPV);
*  Average incremental cost (AIC);
*  Financial internal rate of return (FIRR);
*  Tariffs; and
*  Affordability.
Cost-effectiveness Analysis
Wastewater Management Component
Project alternatives. At appraisal, there were three options (one base scheme and two alternatives)
analyzed. The selected option for funding under this project comprised: (a) construction of the Dashadi
WWTP with a capacity of 200,000 m3/d, (b) expansion of the existing Liede (Liede III) with a capacity
of 200,000 m3/d, and (c) construction of 500 km of trunk sewers in six drainage catchments of Dashadi,
Liede III, Xilang, Lijiao, Datansha, and Liede II. The total investment was estimated about RMB2,641.8
million.
39


﻿During implementation, the Dashadi and Liede III WWTPs were built following the selected option.
However construction of trunk sewers was optimized, and the final sewers built was 371 km. Total
expenditures for this component were about RMB2,777.4 million, or 5% higher than the cost estimate at
appraisal. The cost increase was mainly due to rising resettlement costs. The selected alternative is still
cost-effective because the alternatives at appraisal focused on the amalgamation of other WWTPs with
the Dashadi WWTP. The increased resettlement costs would have had the same impact on a different
alternative.
Water quality improvement and economic benefits. At appraisal, it was estimated that the dissolved
oxygen concentrations would increase, on average by 3.5 mg/1 over the section receiving discharges
from the Liede and Dashidi WWTPs. However, this target was not realized. According to data
provided by Changzhou AMS, the DO in the Guangzhou Section of the Pearl River was only 2.74 mg/1
representing Class IV water quality, much lower than 5 mg/1 which is the standard for Class III of water
quality. The actual monitoring data of influent and effluent of Liede III and Dashadi WWTPs for 2011
presented in Annex 2 shows that the wastewater treated and discharged into the Pearl River has met all
required effluent standards. The reasons for not improving the water quality as appraised are likely due
to factors external to the project. Compared to the average annual runoff of the Pearl River which is 336
billion cubic meters, the treatment capacities installed under this project are very limited.
The economic benefit of water quality improvement analyzed at appraisal to illustrate the magnitude of
the potential benefits was proxy of the amount of money Guangzhou residents spent on bottled water.
This is one of avoidable costs. At appraisal, it was concluded that about 31% of households in
Guangzhou consumed bottled water and the average expenditure per family using bottled drinking water
was RMB31 per month.
During implementation, a market survey on bottled water was conducted. The results of this survey
show that 86% of Guangzhou households were consuming bottled water. Assuming 60% of households
are middle income and above families which could consume bottled water, only 51% of Guangzhou
households would consume bottled water. Of that number, 64% of these households consumed one
bottle each week, 24% consumed half a bottle each week, and 12% consumed two bottles each week,
based on the results of that market survey. Therefore, in 2010 the average consumption of bottled water
per family in Guangzhou would be estimated at RMB63.83 per month, which doubles the expenditure of
bottled water per family consumed at appraisal. However, there are doubts about the extent to which
this survey should be used as an indicator to measure the economic benefit of water quality, since the
same market survey also indicated that the residents in Guangzhou, even in Beijing and Shanghai, select
bottled water for drinking, not only because bottled water is safer, but also because it is more
convenient.
As mentioned above, the water quality of Pearl River has not improved significantly due to various
reasons. Since 2008, Guangzhou Municipal Government has spent RMB9.8 billion to introduce water
from Xijiang Province to improve the quality of water supply to Guangzhou. This investment implies
from another angle that the water quality of the Pearl River has not materially improved and the
economic benefit of the project expected at appraisal - reducing expenditures on bottled water - has not
been realized.
40


﻿Tariff increase. The current average wastewater tariff is RMB1.06/M3 which was increased in July 2009
from RMBO.70/m3. At appraisal, it was forecasted that the wastewater tariff in Guangzhou should be
increased to RMB2.43/m3. However, in order to satisfy the financial covenants requiring covering
O&M and depreciation costs, the tariff should be raised to RMB 2.94 in 2012. The financial projections
carried out by GSTC considered raising the average wastewater tariff to higher levels, i.e., between
RMB3.6 and RMB 3.7. The current wastewater tariff cannot meet the requirements of operating the
wastewater facilities in Guangzhou.
Affordability. Before the wastewater tariff increase in 2009, a public hearing was held in Guangzhou.
There were 11 participants in the public hearing and they all in general supported the tariff increase.
According to statistical data, about 78% of households in Guangzhou consumed 22 tons of water per
month. The wastewater tariff for residents increased to RMBO.90/m3 from RMBO.70/m3. This increase
of wastewater tariff caused 78% of households in Guangzhou to pay about RMB4.00 more per month
for the wastewater they generated, which only accounted for 0.01% of the disposable income of each
family.
Due to the introduction of quality water from Xijiang to Guangzhou, a public hearing was held in
February 2012 for increasing the water tariff to compensate for the investment. According to the
analysis, the increased water tariff will account for 0.435% of the disposable income of each family.
Based on this analysis, if the wastewater tariff is increased to RMB2.94/m3 as projected in the Financial
Section below, the average wastewater tariff for each family will be RMB68.82 based on 90% of water
consumed, which accounts for 0.380% of disposable income. So the projected wastewater tariff
projected below is affordable.
Poverty aspects. In 2009, only 1% of the total population lived in low-income households. According
to Guangzhou Municipality's policy, these families have certificates issued by the government. The
families holding these low-income certificates are exempt from the wastewater tariff, so the increased
wastewater tariff in 2009 had no impact on them. This policy will be applicable to future tariff increases
as well.
Hazardous Waste Management
Project alternatives. At appraisal, there were three alternatives analyzed. The final alternative selected
for funding was to build a landfill in Liangtian with a capacity of 150,000 m3 and other auxiliary
facilities such as a physical-chemical treatment plant with a capacity of 5,000 tons per year, and a
stabilization and solidification plant with a capacity of 50,000 tons per year. The total investment was
estimated at appraisal about US$24 million. The unit cost of the proposed landfill was about US$160.
It took seven years (from November 2004 to December 2011) to finish construction of landfill with a
capacity of 290,000 m3 and its auxiliary facilities. The total expenditure for the landfill was US$46.78
million. The unit cost of the constructed landfill is about US$161, which means that the initial analysis
on alternatives remains valid.
Market analysis. This landfill can treat all hazardous waste generated by industries in Guangzhou, and
surrounding cities as well. In 2004, the total industrial solid waste generated in Guangzhou was 5.66
Including O&M and depreciation
41


﻿million tons including 0.23 million tons of hazardous waste. About 0.15 million tons of hazardous were
treated while the other 0.08 million tons were reused. In 2010, the total industrial solid waste increased
to 6.92 million tons including 0.25 million tons of hazardous waste. All hazardous waste generated in
2010 was treated. The average increase of hazardous waste from 2004 to 2010 was 1.4%. Therefore, it
is estimated that by 2020 the hazardous waste generated in Guangzhou will be about 0.29 million tons.
Hazardous waste treatment tariff The current hazardous waste treatment tariff was set by the
Guangdong Provincial Price Bureau:
*  RMBl,800 per ton for pH>=6; and
*  RMB2,000 per ton for pH<6.
Since landfill construction was just completed at the end of 2011, there are no records for operation. A
reasonable tariff cannot be determined.
B. Financial Analysis
A financial analysis was carried out for the wastewater management component and focused on the
financial viability of GSTC.
Guangzhou Sewage Treatment Company - GSTC
At project appraisal in 2003, wastewater collection, treatment and disposal were the responsibility of the
Guangzhou Municipal Gardens Bureau (GMGB). Budgetary allocations were made to fund the service.
During appraisal, as required by the Bank, Guangzhou Municipal Government (GMG) established
Guangzhou Sewage Treatment Company (GSTC) in November 2003.
During implementation, in line with the decision on investment and financing system reform for
Guangzhou urban construction, Guangzhou Water Investment Group Co., Ltd. (GWIC) was established
in August 2008. From then on, GSTC became a subsidiary of GWIC. Currently, GSTC materially
controls and operates nine wastewater treatment plants in Guangzhou City comprising Datansha I, II and
III, Liede I, II, III, and IV, Lijiao I and II, Dashadi, and Xilang and the total treatment capacity is about
2.98 million tons per day. It also runs 45 pumping stations and maintains 1,414 km of network.
Wastewater Tariff in Guangzhou City
Since 2003 GMG has adjusted the wastewater tariff applicable in Guangzhou City twice. The following
table lists the actual and projected wastewater tariff by GSTC over the project implementation period.

Currently, the wastewater tariff is collected by Guangzhou Water Supply Company (GWSC) based on
90% of water consumption and then passed to GSTC directly.
Financial Covenants
To ensure GSTC has a healthy financial situation, the Guangdong Provincial Government (GPG) and
the Bank agreed upon certain financial covenants which are stipulated in the Project Agreement dated
July 5, 2004. These financial covenants require GPG shall, through GMG, to cause GSTC to undertake,
commencing in 2005:
(a) To produce for each year total revenues equivalent to not less than the sum          of (i) its total
6
operating expenses (including for maintenance) and (ii) the amount by which debt service
requirements exceeds the provision for depreciation.
(b) Not to incur any debt unless a reasonable forecast of its revenues and expenditures shows that its
estimated net revenues for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least
1.3 times its estimated debt service requirements in such year on all of its debt including the debt
to be incurred;
(c) (i) To review by September 30 of each year, on the basis of forecasts prepared in a         manner
satisfactory to the Bank, whether it would meet the requirements set forth in sub-paragraphs (a)
and (b) above, in respect of such year and the next following year and furnish to the Bank the
results of such review upon its completion; and (ii) if any such review shows that it would not
meet such requirements for the years covered by such review, promptly take all necessary
measures (including, without limitation, adjustments of the structure or levels of its tariffs and
charges) in order to meet such requirements.
GSTC started reviewing compliance with financial covenants in 2009 and provided the Bank with its
results. The latest review was conducted in March 2012. The financial projection shows that GSTC
needs to require GMG to increase its wastewater tariff from      current RMBl.06/M3 to RMB2.94/m3 in
2012 so that the financial covenants can be complied with. The following table presents the results of
such reviews by comparing them with the projections made at project appraisal.
6 All expenses related to operations, including administration, adequate maintenance, taxes and payments in lieu of taxes, and
provision for depreciation but excluding interests and other charges on debt.

Since 2009 GMG has indicated no intention of adjusting the wastewater tariff due to social stability
concerns. Therefore GSTC is not able to comply with financial covenants although some measures were
taken to reduce debt service for the construction of pumping stations and networks.
Assumptions to Utility Financial Projections
There is about a 5%     increase for O&M      considered in the projections conducted by GSTC. This 5%
increase includes inflation and other contingencies.
Income Statement
The projected wastewater tariff revenue was calculated on the basis of volume of wastewater generation
and the projected wastewater tariff. The volume of wastewater used for the projections was calculated
based on the real volume of wastewater in 2011 and then increased 50% each year.
The projected operating costs include variable costs (chemicals, water, electricity, sludge treatment) and
fixed costs (salary, equipment and sewer maintenance, depreciation). Both costs were projected on the
basis of real costs in 2011 and then increased 5% each year. The depreciation was projected at 5.94% of
total original costs of fixed assets.
Balance Sheet
Inventories were projected on the basis of the volume of wastewater treated and then a 5% increase for
inflation and contingencies. There were about 41 days of turnover on average for expenditures for
chemicals. Accounts receivables were projected at 8% of total wastewater tariff revenues. There were
about 27 days of turnover of total wastewater tariff revenues.

﻿Annex 5.     Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
(i) Assessment of the operation's objective, implementation, and operational experience;
Assessment of PDO
The PDO was adequate as it supported the efforts to address the challenge of water pollution in the
PRD and is consistent with Guangdong's policies and planning on pollution prevention and control.
Guangdong had adopted a plan to accelerate wastewater management in the Pearl River Delta
through the PRD Cleanup Campaign, which sets out phased targets to meet water quality standards.
The PDO of this project well supported Guangdong's initiative. However, the PDO was too
ambitious in consideration of the project scope.
Assessment of the Implementation
The implementation of the project, in general, is satisfactory. The project has successfully finished
all project activities and achieved expected results.
At the very beginning of the project, PMOs and PIUs were established with designated staff to
manage the project. Due to the complexity of the project, there were 2 PMOs respectively at
provincial and municipal levels and 7 PIUs. Extra coordination was required for such a challenging
project.
The procurement, financial management, M&E and safeguards of the project were carried out in a
satisfactory manner.
For procurement, there were about 80 contracts in this project; expect for a few contracts, the
contracts were procured and implemented strictly according to the Bank's procedure and
procurement guidelines.
In terms of financial management, the Bank's proceeds were fully utilized and yield great results;
but a sum of about US$500,000 was refunded to the Bank due to overlook in the review of the
supporting document.
The resettlement of the project was finished in full compliance with Bank's involuntary resettlement
policy and regulations (OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement). During implementation, the designed
was improved to adopt advanced engineering techniques such as pipe-jacking, to reduce the
influence on the neighboring population. External and internal monitoring was conducted for the
resettlement.
Effective environmental mitigation measures were adopted during implementation to reduce the
adverse effects on the environment to the greatest extent. During construction, no complaint was
received.
Though the project was implemented with successful results, there are still some key implementation
issues:
47


﻿On the wastewater sector, the project financed the construction of 80 km in the Dashadi service
catchment area, 40 less than originally planned. The total length of the wastewater collection
network of the Liede WWTP (phase III) service catchment at design was 145km, of which finally 99
km were constructed. Also, 46 km of tertiary separated storm/sewage sewers were dropped.
The construction of the Nangang WWTP encountered several difficulties and consequently this
component suffered serious delays. One of the major issues was the difficulty in land acquisition.
Other challenges during the implementation of this component were the excessive delays in
finalizing contract arrangements and the low quality of the main suppliers. One of the causes of
these problems was the contract awarding mechanism of selecting the lowest cost bid.
In the Foshan sub-component, the design was modified to adapt the sewer network to the plant being
constructed under PRD2. These changes caused subsequent delays.
On the PSP Technical Assistance, delays were caused by modifications in the TORs by the PIU after
agreed with the Bank. Regardless of these changes, the component was back on track through
collaboration among all the parties. Savings derived from this change allowed the inclusion of
additional domestic study tours to four cities in east China and Beijing, which increased the value
added of this activity and provided good references to Jiangmen on PPP regulation and management
models.
(ii) Assessment of the outcomes
The outcomes of the project are satisfactory.
Wastewater component.
By supporting Guangdong Government's efforts to clean up the Pearl River, this project has
contributed an expanded and renewed network of sewers and new wastewater treatment facilities
that are able to match the demand for wastewater generation.
GSTC is now a corporate utility which strategy focuses on increasing wastewater interception and
COD reduction through improved catchment-based wastewater collection and modern treatment
systems that will allow increasing coverage of municipal wastewater sewerage network and
treatment.
An important step forward in strengthening the institutional wastewater management framework was
achieved after GSTC was restructured in March 2010 based on corporate management concepts. The
company's headquarter divisions and subsidiary entities were reorganized with clearly defined
authorities and responsibilities. A solid financial audit system is now in place, the company has a
robust HR structure and technical skills of key staff have been strengthened and incentives are based
on evaluated performances.
Training was carried out at the time that GSTC was preparing its institutional reforms. Training on
HR management, financial management and other aspects provided medium to high levels of
management staff with corporate management knowledge and familiarized them with commercial
48


﻿operation models, which improved GSTC's operation capacity and laid a foundation for
development and implementation of corporate development plans.
Hazardous waste component
A hazardous waste landfill of 290,000m3, a pre-processing center, a physical/chemical treatment
workshop, and stabilization and solidification workshop were built. These facilities will meet
Guangzhou's need of safety disposal of non-reusable hazardous waste. Hazardous waste from
industries in Guangzhou will be entirely treated at the new facility. Moreover, sufficient capacity is
available to provide services to surrounding towns in the PRD area. This new facility forms part of
the essential environmental infrastructure in Guangzhou and PRD region and will respond to the
rapid growth of the metropolitan area of Guangzhou, also providing the city with sufficient
emergency responsive capacity.
Inter-municipal component
This component broke the concept that environmental infrastructures have to be developed within
the district jurisdictional borders. This was achieved by promoting collaboration of neighbor districts
in developing environmental infrastructure. These pilots maximized the environmental and
economic benefits at minimum capital cost. The two facilities at Nangang and Foshan will reduce
pollution load in the receiving water bodies and reduce the stress to drinking water sources, and can
be considered to be a model to be replicated nation-wide.
In the case of Foshan, this intervention, together with the ones financed under phase two, will foster
investment, trade and tourism.
Water quality
With application of modern telecommunication technologies, a powerful professional information
network has been developed to monitor the environmental quality of the PRD. This was achieved by
upgrading and expanding the number of automatic monitoring stations and developing a platform for
data visualization and management.
Development and operation of the system will bring significant social and economic benefits. Real-
time and continuous water quality data of the river's critical sections will show the temporal and
spatial dynamics of the water quality in an accurate manner. The new system allows detecting illegal
water pollutant discharges, providing effective early warning and projection of affected waters.
The WQM information system is also providing data support for the adequate appraisal of future
environmental improvement projects at the Pearl River. Conservation of the drinking water sources
is strategic to the socioeconomic development of the river basin. Real time monitoring data
continuously available and periodically updated in the online monitoring platform is publically
available so citizens will improve their knowledge and awareness of environmental conditions of the
PRD.
Another expected positive impact of this component is the contribution to strengthening pollution
control at the South China Sea by helping to enforce the limitation of the amount of pollutants being
discharged in the Delta and otherwise entering the South China Sea.
Update ofPRD Wastewater Management Plan
49


﻿This exercise highlighted the main gaps of the former plan and allowed the comparison of different
pollution targets and means to achieve them under different development scenarios. This tool makes
now possible to forecast future trends of changes in water conditions, and to visualize how different
pollutant levels would affect recipient water bodies.
PSP study
This study produced a systematic analysis of BOT modalities applicable for developing WWT
facilities in Guangdong and China. It also analyzed associated PSP laws and proposed a regulatory
context, conducted a market analysis, investment and financing options, taxation issues,
implementation (building, operating, regulating and transferring), and resolution of disputes. The
report identified the main challenges in existing concessional operation agreements (Longquan
WWTP) that were inappropriate given the existing conditions and gaps in the regulatory system. It
provided good guidelines on regulations related to service improvement of the two WWTPs in
Jiangmen. The study provides sound references for developing and improving the regulatory system
of concession options in Jiangment. In particular it gives useful recommendations for the BOT
tender of the Jianghai WWTP which is to be started soon and for the operation of other state-owned
WWTPs in the near future.
(iii) Borrower's own performance during the preparation and implementation of the operation,
with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be helpful in the future
Borrower's own performance
The local government has showed strong commitment to address the serious environmental
problems. On one hand, the local government has provided necessary counterpart funding to the
project; the government also injected a great amount into the PRD Clean-up Champaign initiated on
its own. On the other hand, the local government adopts institutional reforms, including the
establishment of GSTC as an autonomous company and introduction of PSP into solid waste
management, to encourage marketization of the environmental infrastructure and ensure sustainable
development.
The implementing agencies were committed to successfully complete the project and achieve the
development objectives. A lot of efforts were made to overcome the difficulties during the
implementing, such as land requisition and insufficient funding. Despite some fiduciary issues in the
process, active response was made and the institutional capacity was constantly improved to avoid
future problems.
Lessons Learned
The PDO, though addressing to the urgent need of the province, is too ambitious for such a project
of this scope. The unrealistic PDO has affected the following assessment of the project.
The design of the project is very complex, with too many components and involving too many
institutions. The coordination under this project was overwhelming. Besides, the inter-municipal
component was not sufficiently assessed, which led to the delay of implementation. Adequate
consideration during project design is very critical.
The procurement plan initially prepared was not rational in terms of packaging. Being a highly
difficult and technically challenging project, if alternate procurement method could have been
50


﻿approached for the development, the entire project progress would have been facilitated with lower
risks of procurement, execution and supervision.
More attention should have been paid to the design and preparation of bidding documents to prevent
irregularities in the competition process and to improve the cost efficiency of the investment. The
commercial, technical parts and bills of quantities of the bidding documents should have been better
tailored to the project characteristics, and carefully defined. Special contract conditions should have
been refined according to project characteristics, where rights and obligations of the parties should
have been defined to minimize disputes during execution.
Communication problems between the international consultant firm and the project owner and the
consultant team were frequent during the implementation. This firm could not provide the best
services and assistance to the project owner despite its familiarity with the Bank procurement
guidelines and requirement. This was because it had no local office and knew little of local situation
and conditions. Local consultant firms should have been encouraged and supported to improve its
familiarity with Bank-financed projects to gain local experience and perform better.
(iv) Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co financiers, or of other partners during the
preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of their
relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned
The Bank provided great support to the implementing agencies, enabling the assimilation of the new
procedures. The Bank has played a very positive role in facilitating institutional innovations.
However, attentions must be drawn to the following aspects:
The stability of the task team needs to be maintained. The task team leader and members were
changed frequently under this project, which had to some extent led to the low efficiency in
communications and somewhat affected the project progress.
The supervision mission was not well planned. In some years, there were 4-5missions yearly,
including 2 supervision mission, a technical mission, a fiduciary mission, and a safeguards mission.
The frequent missions placed heavy burden on the implementing agencies.

﻿Annex 7. Resettlement
The Project triggered OP 4.12 and so a RAP was prepared as part of project preparation. RAP
implementation started in 2004 and was mostly completed, with except for one village, by the end of
2011. RAP implementation was coordinated by GZPMO, and with external monitoring carried out by
three external resettlement consultants. A summary report of resettlement implementation was
completed by the PMO.
A. Resettlement Implementation
Resettlement  occurred under three components: Wastewater, Solid Waste and Inter-municipal
Infrastructure.
a. Wastewater: Guangzhou municipal sewage treatment project comprised: i) Dashadi Wastewater
Treatment System; ii) Guangzhou Liede Wastewater Treatment System; iii) Reconstruction of
Four Sewage Network Systems. Permanentland acquisition of 27 mu of state owned land and
1,180 mu of collective land was required, together with temporary occupation of state-owned
land of 287 mu and collective land of 1,107 mu. The land acquisition affected 481 households
(1,685 people). Housing demolition of 238,868 m2 of housing also took place. In total 643
households with 6,780 people were relocated.
b. Solid Waste: The component took only collective land, totaling 500 mu of non-cultivated
mountainous and hilly land collectively owned by two villages and contracted to local people for
fruit trees. Demolition of about 23,865 m2 of simple structures used for poultry and pig-raising
that concerned seven local operators also took place.
c. Inter-municipal Infrastructure: The component permanently acquired 11 mu of collective land
and temporarily used 24 mu of collective land. No resettlement was involved.
Compared to the RAP, the actual resettlement impacts were much reduced especially in the Wastewater
component. The resettlement impacts in the wastewater component in the RAP include relocation of
6,030 households or 24,342 people, but the actual resettlement was reduced to 5,387 households or
17,562 persons. The number of PAPs was greatly reduced because effective construction measures,
such as pipe jacking, pipeline layout modification, etc. were employed and more accurate surveys and
investigations were prepared following RAP preparation.
Total permanent land acquisition decreased from 1,929 mu as planned in RAP to an actual of 1,180
while temporary land acquisition decreased from 3,253 mu to 1,478 mu. As showed in the table below,
except for Liede 3 WWTP and the Hazardou Waste Center, the actual permanent land acquisition was
reduced especially in reconstruction of the four sewage network systems. Compared with the RAP, the
actual amount of building demolition decreased greatly from 958,565 m2 to 262,733 m2 or 73%.

* According to the PMO, implementation of both Liede 1-2 and Xilang were not Bank supported
components.
B. Resettlement Fund Disbursement
At present, a total of RMB 2,039 million was used for resettlement implementation under the
wastewater component; RMB 83 million for the Solid Waste Component; and RMB 6.4 million for the
Inter-municipal component. All assets affected by the project were compensated according to
contracts/agreements, not less than specified in the RAP, and prior to asset-taking.
C. Resettlement Monitoring
Resettlement implementation in the wastewater component was monitored by Zhongshan University
from 2004 to March 2010 and by Hohai University from April 2010 to December 2011. The solid waste
component was monitored by the Guangdong Provincial Social Science Institute. The inter-municipal
component was monitored by the Shenzhen Kexin Company. All the external monitoring reports were
provided regularly.
D. Evaluation of Livelihood Restoration
Hohai University's monitoring team conducted random investigations on livelihood restoration with 67
households over the last two years. The investigations concluded the livelihoods of the PAPs have been
fully restored and their average annual income has actually increased from RMB 28,382 in 2010 to
33,544 in 2011. Their living environment, including provision of public facilities and services, has
improved significantly.

The PAPs focused on improvements in their standard of living after becoming familiar with their new
living environment. Since Guangzhou Municipality is located in coastal areas, its employment
opportunities are abundant and few local residents owned land, so their main income came from
enterprise pay, wage income, rental income and dividends or other sources of income; therefore, land
acquisition had minimal impact on them. With the development of a market economy, more
employment opportunities are available, making it easier for local residents tofind employment. As
there is a significant floating population in Guangzhou, rental income is a major source of income for
suburban PAPs.
Under the solid waste component, all land compensation was disbursed to the two villages and the
seven investors received compensation for their structures  through transparent procedures. The
monitoring agency conducted surveys on living standards and concluded that the PAPs' livelihoods
were restored. The 500 mu of land taken was collective land and compensation that the seven operators
received was for orchards and simple structures for poultry and pig-raising. The monitor suggested that
management of the compensation for the collective land under the village authorities should be more
effective and transparent with clearer and more reasonable regulations.
The inter-municipal infrastructure component had little impact on PAPs, due to very small portion of
land required. The two monitors concluded that the PAPs had  their livelihoods restored, with full
compensation.
E. Pending Issue
Chebei village under the wastewater component has not yet completed its construction of replacement
housing for 154 households (550 people). The GZPMO is responsible for ensuring its completion as
soon as possible; the Bank will supervise this work through satisfactory completion.

1. Number of relocated HHs was significantly reduced mainly because i) project scope was narrowed, from more than about 400
km pipeline to about 200 km; ii) advanced construction techniques were applied, like pipe jacking, to reduce structure
demolition / household relocation.
2. Resettlement cost is much higher than planned, if it is considered that resettlement is much reduced. The reason is real estate
prices increased significantly over the project period.
