(1) to reduce the acute\n            power shortages and foster integrated development of the\n            power system of Henan Province in the most cost-effective\n            and environmentally sound manner; (2) to support adequate\n            implementation of power sector and power enterprise reforms\n            and accelerate the transition of the Electric Power of Henan\n            to a legally and financially autonomous and\n            business-oriented company; (3) to assist in transfering new\n            power technologies and in applying modern power\n            operation/maintenance methods; (4) to support improvements\n            in the efficiency of electricity use; and (5) to contribute\n            to the rationalization of power tariffs. The project\n            components will include the construction of new coal-fired\n            thermal power units and an online performance monitoring\n            system to increase plant performance; the erection of\n            transmission lines to connect the power plant to the\n            existing power transmission network; a technical assistance\n            package to support the implementation of a power sector\n            reform action plan; an electricity conservation component;\n            and training to build capabilities in power system operation\n            and management practices."}, "docdt": "1996-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
