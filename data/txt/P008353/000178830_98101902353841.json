lines, together with\n            associated substation equipment and transformers; (ii) nine\n            66 kV substation lines and transformer bays and eight 66/11\n            kV substation transformers; (iii) 156 miles of 11 kV\n            overhead distribution lines and underground cables; (iv) 285\n            miles of low voltage distribution lines and cables; (v) 585\n            distribution transformers; and (vi) associated consultancy\n            services. The proposed project will enable EAC to meet the\n            substantially increased demand stemming from heavy ongoing\n            investment in tourism, industry and agriculture, especially\n            in the Moni-Limassol and Paphos areas, besides meeting\n            additional demand in Nicosia and Larnaca. In addition, it\n            will reinforce and expand distribution in several hundred\n            villages scattered throughout south Cyprus. Major\n            beneficiaries would be existing consumers, especially\n            industrial consumers who will benefit from the availability\n            of additional power, and about 51,000 new consumers,\n            including about 20,000 rural consumers."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
