PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CYPRUS: FIFTH POWER PROJECT - LOAN 1873-CY
PREFACE
This project, supported by Loan 1873-CY for $16.0 million, consisted
of most of the transmission and distribution systems expansion and improvement
to be undertaken by the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) during the
period 1981-1983. The loan was closed on the original closing date of
June 30, 1984. Final disbursement was made on January 11, 1985, raising the
total disbursements to $15.0 million. The amount of $1.0 million remaining
undisbursed was cancelled and the account was closed on January 14, 1985.
This Project Completion Report (iCR) was prepared by the Europe, Middle East
and North Africa Regional Office based on the Bank's appraisal report,
supervision reports and other documents in the Bank's files, a completion
report prepared by EAC in March 1985 and on the findings of a project
completion mission which visited Cyprus in March-April 1985.
The PCR summarizes the main points of interest. The loan was the
fifth of a continuing series of Bank loans to EAC, begun in 1963, which have
helped develop EAC into an efficient and financially viable national public
utility.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of the draft report to
the Government and EAC. Comments received from the Government are reproduced
as Attachment A; EAC has no comments to offer (Attachment B).

FIFTH POWER PROJECT - LOAM 1873-CY
HIGHLIGHTS
The purpose of the project was to enable EAC to meet adequately and
with reliability the increased power needs of Cyprus arising from the
multi-faceted development particularly of the Government-controlled southern
part of the island following the events of 1974 and to continue the
institution-building efforts started under the earlier Bank Group lending
operations. The project, as finally implemented, consisted of most of the
transmission and distribution systems expansion and improvement to be
undertaken during the period of 1981-1983.
The project fully accomplished its objectives (paras 3.06 and 3.07)
and achieved a re-estimated economic return of 12X (para 4.01), as against 13%
estimated on the same basis at appraisal. The project helped upgrade the
skills of EAC's staff and significantly contributed to the development of EAC
as a financially viable public utility (paras 3.07 and 3.09). Whereas before
the project EAC had negative cash generation, its finances so improved during
the project period that in 1984, it was able to finance internally about 38%
of its expansion requirements (par? 3.07). This was achieved despite the
burden of supplying to the north 11 about 20Z of its entire generation
without obtaining any payment.
Because of a substantial increase in the project scope, the cost of
the project in C£ was 49% more than the appraisal estimate although only 1%
more in US$ because of the appreciation of that currency. A 28% drop in the
cost of the transmission system from a postponement of many substation
extensions and a one-third reduction in the length of the transmission lines
was more than offset by a 108% increase in the cost of the distribution system
arising from a significant increase in its scope (para 3.04). The
distribution works were completed by the original estimated date of December
31, 1983, but the transmission lines and substations were completed, except
for erection of some minor components, about 12 months late due to delays in
(a) obtaining right-of-way for the lines, (b) authorization for shipment by
the Government of the supplier's country, and (c) replacement by the supplier
of defective/damaged equipment.
One item of particular interest is the problem of supplying to the
north 2! about 20% of EAC's entire generation without obtaining any payment
(para. 1.01).
A lesson that can be drawn from this lending operation is that a
utility can make great progress under c strong management despite intractable
problems such as the unbilled consumption in the north

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIFTH POWER PROJECT - Loan 1873-CY
1. INTRODUCTION
Background
1.01     Prior to 1952, the power subsector in Cyprus was highly fragmented
and electricity was only available in the major centers supplied by 17 private
companies, municipal undertakings and industrial plants. In 1952, the
Electricity Adthority of Cyprus (EAC) was established under law by the
integration of these separate local power enterprises and since then has
acquired all public power systems, constructed two steam generating stations,
and as of 1979, established a nation-wide transmission and distribution system
serving all major population centers including all villages in the
Government-controlled southern part of the island. Following the events of
1974 that resulted in the de facto division of the island EAC has had no
access to the power facilities in the north 11. Still EAC has continued to
supply power to the north 2! (about 202 of its annual generation from 1975
to date) even though it is unable to obtain payment for it. This unbilled
consumption is EAC's most serious, and apparently intractable, operational
problem and has continued to bleed it badly (Total value of unbilled
consumption in 1980 - 1984: CE 46.37 million, nearly two and a half times
EAC's total net operating income during these years, or to put it in another
way, about 95% of EAC's total long-term debt as of the end of 1984). This
problem is apparently part of the broader political problem arising from the
events of 1974 which remains unresolved 1Y. The unbilled consumption
coupled with the 1973 and 1979 oil price increases so eroded EAC's earnings
during 1974-1979 forcing it to resort to more and more borrowings that it had
become financially crippled on the eve of the subject Project, as evidenced by
its negative net internal cash generation in 1976-79.
Bank Participation in the Power Subsector
1.02     The Bank has been closely involved in EAC's development since the
early 1960's, having made a total of four loans through 1979 to assist in
financing the construction and expansion of the Moni Power station and related
transmission and distribution facilities, Loan 335-CY in 1963 for $21.0
million, Loan 494-CY in 1967 for $2.8 million, Loan 649-CY in 1969 for $5.0
million, and Loan 831-CY in 1972 for $9.0 million. All the projects were
completed satisfactorily. Through these four loans, the Bank was able to help
EAC develop into a modern and sophisticated (though small) utility. The Bank
intLoduced international competitive bidding to EAC and thereby effected
substantial savings on the early projects (about $5.1 million savings in the
first two), as a result of which this procedure is now followed by EAC for
most of its procurement. Project Performance Audit Report No. 2259 covering
the Fourth Power Project of 1972 was circulated to the Executive Directors on
November 9, 1978.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Appraisal, Negotiations and Effectiveness
2.01     The project replaced an earlier project which was appraised prior to
the division of the country in 1974, but which was dropped due to the then
prevailing unsettled political and economic situation. The only major issue
at the time of field appraisal related to the scope of the project i.e.
whether agreement could be reached on: (i) a small component located in the
north "! to be included in the project; and (ii) at least some partial
payments being made to EAC by the Turkish Cypriots for the unbilled
consumption in the north l/. Despite intensive efforts by the Bank
involving three missions during the period September 1979 to February 1980,
such an agreement proved unattainable and the Bank therefore decided to
proceed with a project loccted only in the Government-controlled southern part
of the island.
2.02     During the negotiations in April--May 1980, no substantive changes
were made. However, the following additional matters were agreed:
(a) The financing for EAC's investment program in 1980-84;
Cb) The quantum of tariff increases required during each of the
years from 1980 through 1984;
ic) To ease EAC's debt service burden in 1980, EAC would not draw
down in 1980 any amount from the Euro-currency loan already
arranged but instead, Government would provide EAC with a
"bridging loan" of C£4.8 million (¢13.9 million equivalent), the
expected draw-down amount of the Euro-currency loan in 1980, by
no later than July 31, 1980 at a maximum rate of 8.52 p.a.; and
Cd)  EAC would revalue its assets by August 31, 1980 and in
subsequent fiscal years in accordance with the agreed principles
and procedures.
2.03     The loan was signed on June 25, 1980 and was made effective on
November 10, 1980, about two months later than originally anticipated, to
allow Government ample time to complete tariff action.
Project Description
2.04     As originally appraised, the Project covered all the transmission and
distribution systems expansion and improvements to be undertaken during the
three year period 1981-1983, except for the 132 kV Dhekelia-Athalassa overhead
line and substation modifications associated with Dhekelia 'B' power station.
It also included related consulting engineering services. Specifically, the
Project comprised the following;
1/ For Government's views, see Attachment A.



3
A. Transmission Facilities
(a) 28 miles of 132/66-kV double circuit overhead lines serving
three substations;
(b) Ten 132-kV line and transformer bays at substations;
(c) Four 132/11-kV transformers totalling 90 MVA amd associated
svitchgear at two substations;
(d) Nine 66-kV transformers totalling 95 MVA at five substations.
B. Distribution Facilities
(a) 135 ground mounted distribution transformers totalling about 54
MVA and 450 pole mounted distribution transformers totalling
about 45 MVA;
(b) 120 miles of 11 kV overhead lines and 36 miles of 11 kV
underground cables; and
Cc) 270 miles of low voltage lines and 15 miles of low voltage
cables.
Changes in Project Scope
2.05     A number of substation extensions were postponed and the length of
the transmission lines was reduced about a third owing mainly to
slower-than-expected load growth, resulting in a reduction in costs of 132 and
66 kV system extensions of about CE 1.6 million (28Z of original estimate).
At the same time, the scope of distribution extensions had to be significantly
increased by the increased construction of 11 kV and LV lines and the larger
than expected customer growth (though not of growth of sales). A stm-ary of
these changes, which were implemented in agreement with the Bank, is given in
Annex 1.
Project Objectives
2.06     The main objectives of the Project were:
(a) to enable EAC to meet adequately and with reliability the
increased demand resulting from the multi-faceted development in
the Government-controlled southern part of the island comprising
mainly tourism, industrial and agricultural development,
domestic water supply and irrigation, refugee housing
development, and domestic load growth; and
(b) to continue the institution-building effort started under the
previous loans especially to strengthen the financially crippled
EAC.
Overall, the Project has fully achieved the above objectives.



-4-
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Project Implementation
3.01     Although no major problems affected project implementation, there
were delays in the completion of transmission lines due to:
(i)  difficulties in obtaining right-of-way for the lines from the
land owners and delays in government approval resulting in the
rerouting of lines in three cases;
(ii) authorization for shipment by the Government of the supplier's
country;
(iii) technical problems associated with tower foundation design; and
(iv)  time lost by the suLpplier in replacing defective equipment or
equipment damaged in transit.
The project was essentially completed about a year late.
Training
3.02     The project gave a very good exposure to EAC's engineering staff in
preparation of bid documents, bid evaluation, and design and installation of
transmission lines and substations. Almost all the installation and
supervision of the project was carried out by EAC's staff.
Procurement
3.03     EAC followed the Bank's procurement guidelines for procurement of
materials and equipment funded by the Bank. EAC efficiently carried out the
activities of bid preparation, bid invitation, and bid evaluation and had no
problems in obtaining payments from the Bank.
Project Cost
3.04     Annex 2 gives a comparison of the actual and estimated costs of the
Project. The actual Project cost in CE was 49% more than the appraisal
estimate. A 28% drop in the cost of the transmission system from a
postponement of many substation extensions and a one-third reduction in the
length of the transmission lines (para 2.05) was more than offset by a 108%
increase in the cost of the distribution system arising from a significant
increase in its scope (para. 2.05). In both transmission and distribution
systems, local inflation significantly increased local costs. Expressed in
US$, the actual Project cost ($40.06 million) was very close to the appraisal
estimate ($39.56 million) mainly because of the impact of the large variation
in the rate of exchange of the CE vis-a-vis the US$ (CE 1.00 = USS1.55 at
December 31, 1984 as against the appraisal rate of $2.90, a 47% decline).



Disbursements
3.05     Annex 3 compares the actual disbursements with the '.ppraisal
estimates. The actual disbursements were significantly slower than expected,
especially in the period through March 31, 1983 when t.key were only about a
third of the estimate for most of the period and were not more than 47Z of the
estimate at any time. The disbursements were slow primarily because of delays
in award of contracts for transmission line materials arising from delays in
Government approvals for construction of new lines and substations, delayed
supplies of materials by most transmission line and substation contractors and
te'esipt of defective and damaged equipment from the substation and switchgear
contractor. However, disbursements picked up after March 1983 and were 881 of
the loan amount at June 30, 1984, the initial (and final) loan closing date.
Even though the books were kept open to permit further disbursements beyond
June 30, 1984, an undisbursed rinount of $1.0 million had to be cancelled on
January 14, 1985.
Operating Performance
3.06     Some minor components of the Project as originally envisaged (about
1% of total project cost) have not yet been commissioned although the required
materials have been obtained. The facilities that have already been
constructed under the Project have operated satisfactorily during the short
period since their commissioning. Annex 4 gives the estimated and actual
sales of EAC for the period 1980-84. In all the years, the actual billed sales
were less than the appraisal estimates, the decrease ranging from 3.9% in 1980
to 16.5% in 1984. The fall in sales was mainly due to the effects of recession
and of the high tariffs on all consumers especially industrial consumers, and
the success of the many energy conservation campaigns.
Financial P erformance
3.07     During the appraisal of the subject Project, it was recognized that
if EAC were to regain the strong financial position it had prior to 1978, it
had to maximize internal cash generation, restrain borrowings to the minimum
and maintain at all times a fine balance between internal cash generation and
borrowings. Accordingly the loan covenants required EAC: ti) to achieve
minimum rates of return on revalued assets of 3% in 1980, 4% in 1981, 5% in
1982 and 6% thereafter; and (ii) not to incur any long-term debt without the
Bank's agreement if the debt service on a yearly basis was not covered at
least 1.3 times by net income before depreciation for the years 1980 through
1982 and 1.5 times thereafter. The problem was how to achieve the above
targets and maintain reasonable load growth, with the burden of supplying 20%
of its generation to the north 12 free of charge at a time when the average
tariffs were already around the long-run marginal costs. Under Loan 2287-CY
of June 1983, the required return from 1983 onwards was reduced from 62 to 5X
and the threshold of debt service coverage for borrowing without the Bank's
approval was reduced from 1.5 to 1.4 also from 1983, in order to make the
targets more realistic. It is to the credit of the Government and EAC that
although EAC badly failed to achieve the 1980 target because of a delay in

raising tariffs (rate of return of only 0.4% vs. the required 3% and debt
service coverage of 0.9 vs the threshold of 1.3 for free borrowing), three
tariff increases were resolutely implemented during 1980-83 (an average 9%
from Nov. 1, 1980, 2% from June 1, 1981 and 10.8% from September 16, 1983
raising average tariffs to about 10% over Long-Run Marginal Costs) enabling
EAC to substantially achieve the rate of return targets from 1981 onwards as
seen from the following:
% Rate of Return                         1981      1982       1983     1984

1/ Based on unaudited accounts.
Despite the. above tariff increases, however, EAC's ability to service its
debts was often severely strained because of the rise in the interest rates on
a substantial part of its debt (the interest rate on the Eurocurrency loan was
20% in July 1981 as against 8.5% at the time of negotiations in June 1980).
EAC's debt servicing difficulties were most acute in 1980 when there was a
serious shortfall in the Government's bridging loan agreed with the Bank
(actual loan of CE 1.22 million vs. the agreed CE 4.8 million). In mid-1982,
EAC's debt service burden was eased to some extent by the conversion of
Government loans of CE 9.1 million into equity.  Iin 1983 and 1984, EAC's
finances improved substantially due mainly to the 19.8% tariff increase of
September 1983. In fact in 1984, EAC was able to finance internally 38% of
its expansion requirements.
3.08     Annex 5 gives the estimated (appraisal) and actual Income Statements
of EAC for the period 1980-1984 showing the estimated and actual rates of
return for each year during the period.
Institutional Developm,:t
3.09     On the eve of the subject project, EAC had already developed into an
efficient utility, but with one glaring weakness, namely poor finances.
Through the impetus provided by the subject project it has upgraded the
various skills of its staff and significantly improved the efficiency of its
operations. Its staff of 1,534 (December 1984) are increasingly capable of
undertaking all its functions, thus lessening its dependence on outside
consultants for feasibility studies, and design and supervision of projects.
In the subject project, EAC's engineering staff were extensively involved in
the engineering and design of all works, and contrary to expectations, were
solely responsible for the installation and comissioning of the project
facilities. Outside consultants were emploucd only for the design of high
voltage substations and lines and for the preparation of specification and
tenders. Despite the burden imposed by the unbilled consumption, EAC has also



overcome its financial weakness and developed into a financially viable
entity. Whereas before the project it had negative cash generation, in 1984 it
was able to finance internally about 38% of its expansion requirements, which
speaks eloquently of its sound financial management and the great strides it
has made during the project period.
IV. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
4.01     The rate of return was re-estimated at 12% following the methodology
used in the appraisal report but updating the costs and benefits on the basis
of the available data. The revised rate of return is lower than the appraisal
estimate of 13% due to;
(i) lesser incremental sales compared to the appraisal forecast and
hence lesser revenues; and
(ii) higher fuel oil costs "ranging from CE 70.84/ton to 73.77/ton in
constant terms) compared to the appraisal estimates
(Cf 62.1/ton).
The appraisal estimate, however, had an element of double counting in
estimating the benefits from the substitution of electricity for kerosene.
Therefore, in order to avoid the double counting and to determine the rate of
return more accurately, a separate calculation was made which considered only
the incremental kerosene benefit, excluding the revenue from units for
lighting used by incremental domestic consumers. The rate of return on this
basis is 10% compared to 12% mentioned above. Annex 6 gives the cost and
benefit streams and the assumptions made in calculating the rate of return
(10%) with reduced kerosene benefits.
V. CONCLUSIONS
5.01     The project provided the facilities required for the development of
the power system of the country and helped EAC to develop into an efficient,
semi-autonomous and financially viable utility. It thus fully achieved its
objectives. The one lesson that can be drawn from this lending operation is
how a strong management, with the help of a sympathetic and understanding
Government, can overcome even such a severe handicap as the unbilled
consumption in the north,l/ mobilize the resources needed for its investment
program and guide the utility through financial troubles to a sound financial
condition. Clearly, the problem of unbilled consumption in the north l/
would continue to dog EAC in the foreseeable future.
