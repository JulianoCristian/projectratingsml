coffee plantings; and (iii) provide incentives to\n            smallholder farmers. Within the implementation period, the\n            target of the project would be the active participation of\n            approximately 70,000 registered coffee growers through the\n            provision and coordination of essential services to the\n            cooperative coffee sector. Components would include: (a)\n            rehabilitation of 400 existing factories, the construction\n            of 14 new factories, construction of 50 mechanical drying\n            units, and provision of improved training facilities for\n            factory staff; (b) provision of medium-term development\n            loans to farmers for the rehabilitation of their holdings;\n            (c) strengthening of CRF; (d) development of improved coffee\n            extension services and training; and (e) strengthening of\n            MOCD services, and improved training facilities for staff."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
