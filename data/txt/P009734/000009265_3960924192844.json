The basic objective of the two projects was therefore\n            to continue to ensure that the availability of High Yield\n            Variety (HYV) seed nationwide will not be a constraint to\n            agricultural development, by further developing the\n            institutional structure of the seed industry and adding to\n            the existing seed processing capacity. Lessons learned are\n            as follows: (a) It is clear that in order to stimulate\n            and/or maintain demand seeds of the self-pollinated\n            varieties, new varieties meeting farmer's requirements,\n            should become available on a frequent basis. (b) It is also\n            clear that seed replacement rates used to calculate seed\n            demand have been overly optimistic, resulting in excessive\n            investment in seed processing capacity. It should be\n            recognized most of the production of seed of self-pollinated\n            varieties will continue to be produced by the farmer's\n            themselves or transferred between farmers. (c) The\n            implementation experience also suggests that in order to\n            develop an effective and efficient industry it is necessary\n            to conceptualize and clearly define the roles of public and\n            private sector involvement in the industry given its special\n            characteristics. Conclusions drawn from the projects are as\n            follows: The Projects have created infrastructure and ample\n            capacity to meet likely seed demand over the next few years.\n            However pits' is likely that some of the processing\n            plants are not satisfactorily located geographically\n            ecologically. Also the existing spare capacity is under the\n            control of State agencies that may not always be aware of or\n            able to fulfill national requirements. While the projects\n            have not succeeded in generating the economic returns\n            forecast at appraisal they have helped GOI identify a number\n            of key issues in the definition of the policies and\n            institutional frame work governing public sector performance\n            in India's important seed industry."}, "docdt": "1987-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
