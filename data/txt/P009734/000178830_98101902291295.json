The first phase project covered four states. The\n            project extends the coverage to five more states--Bihar,\n            Karnataka, Orissa, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. This\n            project, like the first, will be concerned mainly with major\n            cereal crops and will increase seed output by about 125,000\n            tons. Project components will include: establishment of\n            State Seeds Corporations (SSC) in each of the participating\n            states for the coordination of production and for processing\n            and marketing of certified seed grown by farmers who will be\n            shareholders of SSC; assistance to the state agricultural\n            universities for seed technology research and for the\n            production and processing of breeder and foundation seeds;\n            farm development for State Farms Corporation of India;\n            development of quality control facilities; technical\n            assistance; and training."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
