reform its primary education system, whose objectives are to\n            improve education quality, expand school access, and\n            increase school retention at the primary level. Project\n            objectives aim at increased resource availability, and\n            improved resource allocation, and utilization to improve\n            educational inputs, and strengthen institutional\n            arrangements for primary education delivery. To this end,\n            development grants for primary schools will be introduced,\n            in addition to institutional capacity building at the\n            central, district, and school levels for an efficient\n            operation of primary education. Although the overall program\n            risk rating is not high given the Government's\n            long-term commitment to the sector, and to institutional\n            development, major risks include however, a weak\n            coordination between the Ministry of Education and Culture,\n            and the Regional Administration and Local Governments; the\n            potential primary school enrollment which may exceed program\n            estimates, and system capacity in the first year; and,\n            insufficient capacity to manage primary education delivery\n            at the district level, including weak financial management.\n            Nonetheless, the establishment of a solid foundation for a\n            much strengthened labor force supporting the country's\n            development efforts, and the decentralized education\n            management will benefit an effective educational service delivery."}, "docdt": "2001-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
