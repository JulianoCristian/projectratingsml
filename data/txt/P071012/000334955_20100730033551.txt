                 IEGWB Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.

About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the expected
results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons
drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Banks lending operations
through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or
complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank
management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and
other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local
offices as appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the
document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the
Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their
project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is
available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance
of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are
consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance
strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies,
Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is
consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are
expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project
achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost
compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings
for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,
Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation
and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition
arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loankredit closing, toward the achievement of
development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for
Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency
or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward
the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and
implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covering three education projects
in Tanzania. The first operation, the Human Resources Development Pilot Project ( U S 2 4
million equivalent), was financed through IDA Credit No. 299 1-TA in the amount of US$2 1
million equivalent with planned government contribution of US$3 million equivalent. The
credit was approved on October 7, 1997, became effective on February 18, 1998 and was
closed on schedule December 3 1, 2005. An undisbursed amount of US$467,500 equivalent
was cancelled after project closing.

The second operation, the Primary Education Development Program (US$200 million
equivalent), was financed through IDA Credit No.3570-TA in the amount of US$l50 million
equivalent. The credit was approved on October 9,2001, became effective January 2,2002
and closed on schedule with full disbursement on October 3 1, 2004. The Government of
Netherlands also provided a Grant of US$50 million which was administered by IDA.

The third operation, the Secondary Education Development Program (US$250 million        .

equivalent), was financed through IDA Credit No. 32 15-TA in the amount of US$124
million equivalent and an IDA grant of US$26 million equivalent. The credit was approved
on June 8,2004, became effective September 30, 2004 and was closed with full disbursement
on December 3 1, 2007, six months later than planned.

This PPAR was prepared by Maurice Boissiere, IEG consultant, and will serve as an input to
the planned IEG evaluation of post-primary education. The findings are largely based on a
three-week mission to Tanzania from January 18 to February 6, 201 0. The mission met with
education authorities in Tanzania as well as civil society organizations and private business
people. The mission visited project sites in Kibaha district of the Coast region and in Mtwara
Rural district of Mtwara region in southern Tanzania, a relatively poor area. A list of persons
met is given in Annex C. The mission also examined: (a) World Bank project files; (b)
project related reporting and evaluation; and (c) education studies by government, other
Development Partners, and Civil Society Organizations, as well as the relevant research
literature.

The IEG team gratefully acknowledges the logistical assistance and support of many resident
mission staff, especially Ms. Rest Lasway (Senior Education Specialist) and Anne Muuna
(Team Assistant) for expediting the work of the mission. A special acknowledgement is due
to those government officials, especially the district officials and school personnel, who
organized arrangements for productive visits to project sites. Civil society organizations and
private sector business people were generous with their time and provided valuable insights
for this assessment.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and feedback. No response was received.

Summary
The purpose of this report is to assess the development effectiveness of and lessons of three
Bank-supported education projects in mainland Tanzania implemented over a decade (1997-
2007) - the Human Resources Development Pilot Project (1997-2005), the Primary
Education Development Program (200 1-2004), and the Secondary Education Development
Program (2004-2007). These three projects were selected because they represent a coherent
policy response to the economic and education needs of Tanzania and could provide valuable
lessons in that context. Further, two of the projects involved support for secondary
education; this assessment will therefore provide important evidence and lessons for the
planned IEG evaluation of post-primary education.

Although still very poor (US$440 gross national income per capita, 2008), Tanzania has
been a stable and cohesive nation since its independence in 1961 under President Julius
Nyerere. Attempts to implement African socialism did not succeed and left the economy in
dire need of reforms by the time President Nyerere stepped down voluntarily in 1985.
Successive governments undertook economic reform programs supported by the Bank and
the International Monetary Fund, which led to a resumption of growth in the range of 6 to 8
percent annually since the mid-1 990s.

The Bank has been supporting projects at all levels of education in Tanzania since 1963. Up
to 1980 there were seven Bank supported education projects, followed by a pause in lending
during the 1980s while economic reforms were being negotiated. Bank lending resumed in
1990 with the Education Planning and Rehabilitation Project. This was followed by the three
education projects that are the subject of this assessment. Government education policy and
Bank support for education entered a new phase with the introduction of the government's
Education Sector Development Program (formulated in 1997, revised 200 1 to run from 200 1-
2008) and the preparation of the Primary Education Development Program (2001). This new
phase involved close collaboration among all stakeholders-government (central and local),
the major donor partners, and civil society organizations.

The $24.0 million Human Resources Development Pilot Project (HRDP) was approved on
October 7, 1997 and became effective on February 18, 1998. The project closed on schedule
December 3 1,2005, and was financed by a $20.9 million IDA credit with a government
counterpart contribution of $3.16 million. The objective of the project was to enhance
Tanzania's education sector through: (a) raising enrollments in primary education and
improving its quality/learning outcomes; (b) expanding educational opportunities and
improving quality at the secondary level, particularly for girls from economically
disadvantaged households; (c) building capacity at the district and community levels; and (d)
improving policy development, planning, and research in the education sector. Notably, the
HRDP was financed as a pilot for two interventions - Community Education Funds, which
provided school grants based upon school based management and Girls' Secondary
Education Support, which provided scholarships to poor girls who `could not attend
secondary school for financial reasons. The project also provided support to policy and
planning in the Ministry of Education (MOE) which produced background studies for the
Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP) and provided the basis for the primary
education project below.

The US$200 million Primary Education Development Program (PEDP) was approved on
October 9,2001 and became effective on January 2,2002. It was financed by a $150 million
3-tranche IDA sector adjustment credit and a $50 million grant from the Government of
Netherlands, administered by the Bank and also released in three tranches. The objective of
the project was to support the Government of Tanzania to reform the delivery of primary
education. Specifically, the objectives of the PEDP were to: (1) expand school access, (2)
improve education quality, and (3) increase school retention at the primary level. These
objectives would be achieved through improved resource allocation and utilization, improved
educational inputs, and strengthened institutional arrangements for effective primary
education delivery. The PEDP introduced, among other reforms, Capitation and
Development Grants for direct disbursement to primary schools.

The follow-on $150 million Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP), was
approved on June 8,2004 and became effective on September 30,2004. It was financed by a
$123.6 million IDA credit and a $26.4 million IDA grant. The credit was in the form of a
sector adjustment credit, released in three tranches, and the IDA grant was released as part of
the tranche disbursement. The need for SEDP was recognized as a result of increasing
numbers of primary school leavers, largely a result of the success of PEDP. As part of the
ESDP, the long term aim of the SEDP was to build a productive and adaptable labor force
and supply better quality students for the post-secondary education and training system. The
specific objectives were to: (i) increase the proportion of the relevant age group completing
lower and upper secondary education, especially underserved groups who are now getting
better opportunities to complete primary education through the PEDP; (ii) improve learning
outcomes of students, especially girls, and at the lower secondary level; and (iii) enable the
public administration to manage secondary education more effectively, through the
devolution of authority to lower levels, and strengthening of management capacities.

Human Resources Development Pilot Project

The outcome of this project is rated satisfactory. All of the objectives were substantially
relevant to the current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the one at the time of approval
and the project design was substantially relevant. The efficacy of the project in terms of
achieving objectives is also substantial. The pilots for school-based grants (managed by the
schools) involving 16 districts and over 1,600 schools and secondary education scholarships
for over 4,700 poor girls were implemented successfully and provided the basis for similar
activities in the follow on PEDP. Capacity building through training and technical assistance
at both the local level and the Ministry of Education and Culture was also successful. Given
the effectiveness of the project at a relatively modest cost, efficiency is also rated as
substantial. The risk to development outcome, given the demonstration that schools could
take on the grants and the local community can carry out selection of scholarship recipients,
is negligible to low.

The performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Although the Borrower?s
implementation team got off to a slow start, careful supervision from the Bank team helped
to accelerate implementation. At the local level, the training and commitment of
communities resulted in school management committees being able to open and operate bank
accounts, carry out small-scale procurement and undertake school-based planning. The
                                               ...
                                              Xlll



monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements were not implemented as planned. The
M&E design was thought to be too sophisticated by the new task team after effectiveness for
MOEC capacity and could not be implemented in the Tanzanian context. However, impact
studies done by local researchers were commissioned and valuable M&E information was
collected.

Primary Education Development Program

The outcome of this project is rated satisfactory. The objectives are substantially relevant to
latest joint CAS (2007) and the design is substantially relevant to those objectives. The
efficacy of the project in terms of achieving enrollment expansion (from about 4.9 million in
2001 to about 7.0 million in 2004) and improved learning (from primary exam pass rate of 22
percent in 2000 to 49 percent in 2004) is substantial.

Bank performance is rated satisfactory and Borrower performance is rated moderately
satisfactory. The Bank supervision teams provided assistance to the Borrower in activities
needed to complete tranche conditions. The Borrower showed both ownership and
leadership in implementing the sector wide approach initiated with this project, coordinating
with all of the major donors on annual sector reviews. However, in some areas the quality of
local construction was inadequate. The Bank credit closed on time in October 2004, but the
PEDP continues with financial support from domestic budget and DPs pooled funding. The
risk to development outcome is moderate.

Secondary Education Development Program

The outcome of this project is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The objectives are
substantially relevant to the 2007 joint CAS, although relevance of design is modest: the
choice of instrument was conducive to large expansion of education in the short run but not
the longer-run objectives of improved quality and learning, or of capacity building. Efficacy
of the project in terms of achieving objectives is modest. Although secondary enrollment
increased from about 432,600 in 2004 to over 1,400,000 in 2009 (even more than the target),
the shortfall in providing teachers and learning resources resulted in declines in learning
achievement, with the passing rate needed for completing secondary education on Form 4
exams declining from 92 percent in 2004 to 72 percent in 2009. However, due to the large
increase in the numbers of Form 4 students taking the exams, the actual number of students
completing secondary rose dramatically from about 55,000 (2004) to about 246,000 (2009).
Risk to development outcome is significant due to rapid expansion putting pressure on the
education budget and shortages of qualified teachers.

Bank and Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank assisted the
Borrower in many technical ways and also played a prominent role in the donor group that
provided pooled funding that fed into general budget support for education. The Borrower
took an active leadership role in coordinating the Annual Education Sector Review, including
nongovernmental and civil society organizations. However, due to the rapid increase in
enrollment beyond the medium growth scenario specified in the Program Document, the
Borrower faced fiscal pressures and could not maintain the capitation grant at the level
agreed in the Letter of Development Policy. Although the Bank team advised the Borrower
                                              xiv


against too rapid expansion, upon request by the Borrower, Bank management and the IDA
Board granted a waiver on that particular condition, based upon good overall progress, and
the third and final tranche of US$50 million was released almost a year late. The credit was
closed 6 months later than planned, in December 2007.

Lessons and Perspectives

Looking back over education policy in the Education Sector Development Plan and its
implementation, a coherent policy framework was provided for these three projects. The aim
of achieving universal primary education while maintaining standards was largely successful.
While universal secondary education was recognized as out of reach at this time, a significant
expansion of the relatively small sub-sector was achieved, but learning achievement suffered
from too rapid expansion of enrollment. Looking forward, the new ESDP 2008-20 17 takes
stock of achievements and challenges, while putting forth an ambitious and comprehensive
program at all levels of education. It was formulated before the current global financial crisis
and its fiscal sustainability needs more analysis.

This experience has produced a number of.lessons, among them:

   Fiscal sustainability of rapid expansion of secondary education needs to be re-
   assessed carefully within the realistic context of limited fiscal resources and
   competing needs of other education subsectors. The unprecedented rate of expansion
   of community secondary schools is putting extreme pressure on the education budget. In
   recent years the government responded by reducing per unit resources which in turn
   compromises the quality of secondary education. Finding the financial resources to
   complete the job of building quality into the expanded system is an enormous challenge
   to be resolved by the government and development partners.

   Rapid expansion of secondary education is more complex and difficult than rapidly
   expanding primary education. Secondary education systems have subject specialties
   requiring efficient matching of student class streams and teachers; teacher shortages and
   lack of capacity limit the ability to increase the number of teachers of appropriate
   qualifications rapidly; curriculum, textbooks, and examinations need to be reformed
   simultaneously; and the management challenge inherent in rapid expansion and reform
   simultaneously would tax even the most capable systems of education.

   Decentralization with schooYcommunity based management under the overall
   government decentralization pursued in Tanzania appears to have had a beneficial
   impact on community enthusiasm and participation, but further evaluation is
   needed about impact efficacy and efficiency. A set of clear and relevant hypotheses
   needs to be formulated for testing so as to try to link improvement in learning with
   important attributes of decentralization.

   The labor market situation warrants closer and careful monitoring as the supply of
   secondary school leavers is increasing. There is a risk of creating an increasing pool of
   unemployed secondary graduates as a consequence of the overly rapid expansion of
   relatively low quality community secondary schools.
                                          xv


Expansion of secondary education needs to be accompanied by attention to quality
of education. Research studies show that quality secondary education is critical to obtain
the economic benefits of growth and poverty reduction. Even with significant increases
in domestic budget and development partner support in Tanzania, there will not be
enough finance for all of the worthwhile goals in the new ESDP. The challenge will be
maintaining the political and fiscal discipline to focus on quality while addressing
community demand for expansion with limited fiscal resources.

1. Background and Context
1.1     The objective of this report is to assess the development effectiveness and lessons
arising from World Bank support for three primary and secondary education projects
spanning a decade in mainland Tanzania. These projects were not simply a sequence of
individual education projects but supported a coherent and ambitious reform agenda for
education in Tanzania. This reform agenda was led by the Government in collaboration with
donors, leading up to harmonization of donor support as called for in recent years (such as
the Paris Declaration on harmonizing aid) and innovative use of development policy
instruments for the education sector. Lessons learned from the implementation experience of
these projects can be of use for future Bank education support in Tanzania and elsewhere.
Support for secondary education in Africa has been increasing in recent years, but IEG has
not done assessment of this area, providing another rationale for IEG to learn lessons from
the secondary education parts of these projects.' A timeline of Tanzania's education policies
and the World Bank's engagement is in Annex C.

General Country Background

1.2      In1 96 1 Tanzania (Tanganyika at that time) peacefully achieved its independence
under the leadership of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, who became the first President. Mwalimu,
which means teacher in Kiswahili and is a title of respect, was the founder of TANU
(Tanganyika African National Union), the political movement and party that achieved
independence from the United Kingdom. As a result of the political union with Zanzibar
after a revolution there in 1964, Tanganyika became Tanzania. The former Tanganyika is
now referred to as mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar, though part of the union, has
considerable autonomy in many areas. Since then, Tanzania has enjoyed political stability,
becoming a cohesive nation in contrast to the experience of some other African countries.

1.3      In 1967 the Arusha declaration was promulgated with the stated goal of Ujamaa-the
transformation of Tanzania into an African socialist economy and society.* This was
motivated by the aim of overcoming the emerging inequalities during the early years of
independence. The socialist policy did not succeed in its stated goals and by 1980 the
economy was in dire need of revitalization. President Nyerere stepped down voluntarily in
1985, thereby setting a precedent of peaceful political transitions. The new leadership
undertook a series of economic restructuring initiatives in conjunction with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank that led to improvements in the economic situation.
Since then, Tanzania has experienced economic growth, which has been especially robust
since the start of this decade with annual growth averaging 6-7 percent3 The Government of
Tanzania (GOT) published "The Tanzania Development Vision 2025" in 1999 as a set of
basic principles that would guide its economic and social policies, including a prominent role
for education. Nonetheless, Tanzania is still a poor country with per capita gross national

resources needed to finance an ambitious education expansion and reform.

Government Education Policy

1.4     Tanzanian Government commitment to education as an integral part of its social and
economic development goes back to those early years of independence. During colonial
times education access was very restricted despite the desire of Tanzanian society for more
educational opportunity. The Arusha Declaration was soon followed in 1967 by the policy
document "Education for Self-Reliance," in which education was assigned a seminal role in
the transformation of Tanzania to an African socialist society.

1.5     The overall structure of the education system has remained relatively unchanged over
the years, despite legal changes in curricula, exams and administration. The primary cycle
                                                              )
now consists of Standards 1 to 7 (previously up to standard S, the official ages being 7 years
old to 14 years old. This is followed by lower secondary with Forms 1 to 4 and upper
secondary with Forms 5 and 6. University consists of 3 years for most specializations, but
some may take longer. Teacher training colleges offer courses after Form 4 (for primary
school teachers) or Form 6 (for secondary school teachers), while a degree in education can
be taken at university (the preferred qualification for secondary school teachers). This can be
summarized as being a 7-4-2-3 structure, amounting to 13 years of primary and secondary
schooling prior to university. Kiswahili is the language of instruction in primary schools,
with English being taught as a subject. English becomes the language of instruction in
secondary schools. National examinations play a large role at the end of each cycle for the
purpose of selection to the next one. However, significant adult and non-formal education
and vocational training features have been added over the years.

1.6     Some current features of education have their roots in the aspirations of these policies
during the early years of African socialism. Universal Primary Education (UPE) was
emphasized in the Musoma Declaration (1974) as a way of transforming rural society and
agriculture, from which it was acknowledged the vast majority of the population would
derive their li~elihood.~ Expansion of secondary and tertiary education access was restricted
to the projected manpower needs of the modern sector, reflecting the manpower planning
methods that were popular among international aid agencies in the 1960s and early 1970s.
This manpower planning approach also fit in with the planning methods of a socialist
economy. As a result, Tanzania throughout the 1980s and 1990s had one of the lowest
enrollment rates in secondary education in Africa as well as globally.

1.7    By the early 1980s external shocks (oil crises, coffee prices, drought, and war with
Uganda) and endogenous deficiencies of economic policy resulted in an economic crisis that
needed to be resolved by a program of economic restructuring and recovery. Tanzania's
dialogue with the Bank and IMF went through a phase of tension in the early 1980s due to

 This is the equivalent of $1,230 per capita, taking into account purchasing power parity.
 The Musoma Declaration was promulgated by the political party and together with the"Education for Self
Reliance" set the stage for UPE, mass literacy and adulthonformal education campaigns in which illiteracy was
almost eliminated. For more background see Mushi 2009.
                                         3


differing perspectives on the root causes of the economic crisis and how to handle it. The
Tanzania Country Assistance Evaluation (IEG 200 1) relates how Tanzanian policy makers
attributed the crisis to exogenous shocks, while the Bank and IMF stressed deficiencies of
economic policies and institutions as the root cause. For the education sector this period of
economic crisis and subsequent structural adjustment programs meant a huge reduction in
resources that lead to a reversal of progress made towards universal primary education (UPE)
during the 1970s and declining quantity and quality at all levels of education. Due to scarcity
of public budgetary resources to meet the rising demand for secondary school, the
government allowed a small private secondary school sector to develop.

1.8      Despite the progress resulting from the economic reform efforts of the late 1980s and
1 9 9 0 social indicators were stagnating, including progress towards UPE and other levels of
        ~~
education. At the same time, the Government had committed to the Jomtien Education for
All goals. In 1995 the Government and Ministry of Education prepared an Education and
Training Master Plan. This was updated and further elaborated in a new phase of
Government policy embodied in the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP 1997,
revised 200 l), a program formulated to run from 1998 to 2007 and to have large scale impact
that would accelerate progress on stagnating education indicators. Within the larger ESDP ,
the Government, together with civil society stakeholders and donors, formulated a Primary
Education Development Program to run from 2001 to 2009. This was followed by the
Secondary Education Development Program in 2004. The Government's National Strategy
for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (2005) included a focus on education as part of its
second cluster that deals with social well being and quality of life. The other two clusters
relate to economic growth with poverty reduction and to governance and accountability.

Bank Support for the Education Sector

 1.9    The first education loan of the International Development Association (IDA) was to
Tanganyika in 1963, the standard kind of "bricks and mortar" typical of early IDA education
projects. During the early days of independence and the socialist period up to 1980 there
were seven Bank supported education projects in Tanzania, most of them dealing with
primary and secondary education and teacher and vocational training While none of these
were especially large in US dollar amounts, they were all Specific Investment Credits (SICS)
with a record of slow disbursements. During the 1980s there was a hiatus in education
lending due to the tensions in the dialogue referred to above, although some donors,
especially the socialist ones of Scandinavia, continued external support for education. Bank
support for education resumed in 1990 with the Education Planning and Rehabilitation
Project (EPRP), the name of which suggests that the sector had suffered serious deterioration
during the 1980s. The EPRP developed planning and research capacity that also helped in
the preparation of the Human Resources Development Pilot Project (HRDP, 1998), which
was conceived with the purpose of piloting solutions to the problem of expanding education
rapidly, especially primary education in the light of the Jomtien EFA goals. The project
piloted a scheme of matching grants to poor communities (Community Education Fund) and
scholarships for poor girls to attend secondary school, as well building capacity in policy and
planning within the MOE.
                                               4


1.10 A new phase of Bank support began with the Sector Adjustment Credit of US$150
million in 200 1 for the Primary Education Development Program, to which the Dutch
Government also contributed an additional US$50 million. This was followed by another
Sector Adjustment Credit of US$124 million and an IDA grant of US$24 million to support
the Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP, 2004). These two credits are large
in comparison to previous projects and also the first to use a quick disbursing policy
approach in the education sector in Tanzania. The Bank support for PEDP closed in 2004
and that for SEDP in 2007, but these GOT programs continue with mainly public budget
support supplemented by other donors as well as substantial contributions from local
communities. It should also be noted that the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) 4
through 7 , which have been providing substantial general budget support (GBS), have
significant education policy content and thus provide some support to the education sector.
More than 2,500 additional classrooms have also been built under the recent Tanzania Social
Action Fund. The Bank is also supporting the Science and Technology Higher Education
Program with an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) in two phases, the first started in 2008 and
the second is anticipated in 20 1 1. The project supports the development of high level
professionals in science and technology for the knowledge economy as well as improved
training for teachers of science and technology subjects in secondary education.

1.11 The contribution of Bank Economic and Sector Work (ESW) has added to the
understanding of education sector issues and their relation to broader economic and social
development. The Country Economic Memorandum (World Bank 2007) is comprehensive
and relevant to the needs of the education sector. Special chapters are devoted to the role of
education in manufacturing, tourism, and technology development, as well as internal
problems of the education sector. Also of relevance to secondary education in Tanzania is
the Bank's Africa-wide study of secondary education launched in 2003 that resulted in a
series of workshops/papers and a final comprehensive report in 2008.6 Now the Bank is
using shorter and more focused analytic work to deliver quicker topical reports, such as the
recent one analyzing the implications of expansion of secondary e d ~ c a t i o n . ~

Other Donor Support

1.12 The education sector budget, as is true for the government budget overall, is highly
dependent upon donor support for its investment component. According to the PRSC4
(2006) donor assistance in FY05 was about 12 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and
amounted to almost half 4 of the Government budget This pattern was projected to continue
over the next few years and this aid dependence was cited as a risk if donor sentiment should
shift. In recent years, harmonization of donor support has improved with regular meetings to
share information and plan collaboration. There is now a Pooled Fund Partners group
comprising 14 major donors for education and other sectors of the economy. A total of
US$627 million was committed as GBS by the partners for FY07 (see PRSC4), including the
US$200 million credit of the Bank. After the Bank, the United Kingdom is by far the largest
donor with an amount of US$l58 million equivalent during that same year. In 2005 the Joint

Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST) report was produced that formulated the
harmonization process under the leadership of the GOT. It is not possible to allocate how
much of the GBS went to education sector.

1.13 The high point of donor harmonization for the education sector came with the PEDP
in 2001. The pooling of funding from the Netherlands and others showed what is possible in
this area. Under this approach donor aid is disbursed in tranches, after satisfaction of
conditions, to a single account that is used by the government following its own procedures.
The practice of annual Education Sector Reviews was introduced under PEDP and continues
up to now. Coordinated by the GOT, all stakeholders, including civil society and non-
government organizations, participate in this organized review of progress and issues to be
addressed. The CSO's have developed significant capacity to do education policy analysis
over the past decade and submit their contributions to the sector reviews as a network (see
Tanzania Education Network Report 2009). Completion of satisfactory Education Sector
Reviews are now among the conditions of the PRSCs for providing budget support.


2. Human Resource Development Project, 1997-2005
Objectives and Design
2.1     Objectives, The $24.0 million Human Resources Development Project (HRDP) was
approved on October 7, 1997 and became effective on February 18, 1998. The project was
scheduled to close December 3 1, 2005, and was financed by a $20.9 million equivalent IDA
credit with a government counterpart contribution of $3.16 million. The objective of the
project according to the SAR was to strengthen Tanzania's education sector through: (a)
raising enrollments in primary education and improving its quality and learning outcomes
through increased parental participation and financing, school-based planning and
management of resources, school-based quality enhancement initiatives, and improved
support for schools at the district level; (b) expanding educational opportunities and
improving quality at the secondary level, particularly for girls from economically
disadvantaged households; (c) building capacity at the district and community levels; and (d)
improving policy development, planning, and research in the education sector.'

2.2      Components. Corresponding to the four objectives there were four components:

      (1) Community Education Pilot (US$5.0 million), which included a pilot program of
         matching grants from the Community Education Fund (CEF) for school improvement
         in the pilot districts that agreed to match the government contribution and promote
         parental participation in school-based management. This required parental
         participation in school planning and implementation of the grant.

* The Development Credit Agreement formulates the objectives slightly differently, resulting in 5 objectives
rather than 4 (improving school-based management is treated as a separate objective, while in the SAR it is
treated as the means to the end of increased enrollments, quality, and learning outcomes). Otherwise the
objectives of the two sources have essentially the same elements.
                                               6



   (2) Girls' Secondary Education Support Pilot (GSES, US$6.9 million), which
       included a pilot program of financial support for selected girls (academically
       qualified from poor households) to enroll and complete four years of lower secondary
       with top 20 percent continuing to upper secondary.

   ( 3 ) Capacity Building for SchooldComrnunity (US$2.2 million), which provided the
         training and TA needed for schools/communities to implement their respective parts
         of the CEF and GSES as well as some training for Ministry of Education and Culture
         (MOEC) staff who were involved in the implementation of the CEF and GSES.

   (4) Policy Development, Planning and Research (US$4.5 million), which provided
       support to the MOEC to improve the collection and computer processing of
       education statistics and to the National Examination Council of Tanzania to improve
       the quality and computer processing of the exams. Advanced training was also
       provided to selected staff to support the capacity to carry out high priority policy
       studies in support of the Education Sector Development Program. Support for
       Monitoring and Evaluation of CEF and GSES was included along with quick pilot
       communityhousehold surveys to gauge community welfare.

2.3     It should be noted for background that the previous Education Planning and
Rehabilitation Project (US$38.3 million, approved in 1990, closed 1998), although not the
subject of this assessment, provided some of the resources and activities leading up to the
CEF and GSES pilots. The government requested a modification of the EPR project design
to do some preliminary testing of the concepts. A few respondents who recall that period of
time mentioned that the concept of providing school grants was new in Tanzania, and thus
the project included activities, starting with pre-testing of pilots in 1996 and refinements in
1997, to develop the capacity at the school and district levels to implement the grants
program. Thus HRDP was designed before the ESDP was finalized. The pilots for the CEF
ran from 1998 to 2001, The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) for the HRDP did not present any
explicit theories of how or why school grants or girls' scholarships might result in achieving
project objectives, but at this time school grants and school based management were
becoming more popular with donors. There was also ample research evidence cited in the
SAR concerning the high rate of return to girls' schooling. In a general sense, this was the
underlying rationale for the two pilot components.

2.4    The SAR mentions that the aid agencies of the United Kingdom, Netherlands,
Sweden, and European Union were expected to provide support for complementary activities
under the last component with coordination by the MOEC. This donor support would relate
to education statistics, pilot monitoring and evaluation, and pilot surveys. However, the
amount of support and details were not specified.

2.5     Monitoring and evaluation design. The first two components were pilot programs to
be implemented in five districts while the last two components were central programs for the
MOEC and NECTA to build up their capacity in the specific areas listed above. Monitoring
indicators were established for the last two central programs. The pilot districts were
selected by the MOEC project team according to poverty and welfare index based upon
                                          7


survey data available at the time. The SAR stressed the importance of Monitoring and
Evaluation (M/E), especially for the evaluation of the impact of the pilot programs. A
detailed M/E design was included in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) that called for
sample surveys (baseline and end of pilot) of both schools and households in such a way as
to establish control groups for pilot and non-pilot participants.

2.6     Implementation arrangements. A Project Support Group (PSG) acted as the
implementation and coordination group in the MOEC. It was formed by appointing the
relevant officials from various departments to oversee implementation. The PSG was a
standard project implementation unit, and other donors at that time had similar
implementation units for their separate projects. The PSG staff were in effect consultants
paid at a higher rate than the usual salary scale, a practice widespread in other Bank and DP
projects at that time. The idea behind project implementation units was to augment limited
MOEC implementation capacity, though it meant in the end that ownership for the project in
the MOEC was mainly in the PSG.

Implementation
2.7      Planned vs. actual disbursements. The actual disbursement tracked the planned
disbursement at appraisal, except for some difference in the CEF component (Table 2-1).
It is unusual for the actual to track so closely to the planned disbursement in such a project.
Moreover, actual contingencies are usually absorbed into the components by close of a           .
project. Despite these relative minor discrepancies, the data appear to approximate the
project costs fairly accurately.

2.8      Implementation experience. The project got off to slow start because the PSG was
not completely formed and settled in the ministry at the time of effectiveness. The project
staff also needed time to familiarize themselves with the design. The initial response of the
local community was hesitant, as this was new and they unsure of how the grants might work
and how the community might benefit. However, after the initial supervision missions, the
pace of implementation picked up and the CEF and GSES pilots became fully active by
1999. The PSG did not manage to mainstream the CEF and GSES into the overall Ministry
                                                8


and local government structures; the project activities were not well known outside of the
project implementation unit. .

2.9      In 1999, the MOEC decided to expand the CEF from five to 16 districts (out of 114
districts nationwide at that time). According the Mid-Term Report prepared by the MOEC in
2000, the reason was to test the impact of the CEF on medium-level welfare index districts.
Still, many of the schools in the new districts were relatively poor in the economic context of
Tanzania. This gave rise to an equity issue in that the CEF provided matching grants, and
poor districts, which could not raise much money as the rich ones, wound up getting much
less funding than the rich districts. Therefore, the matching formula was changed so that the
poorer districts received matches in the ratio of 1:2 or 1:3. When the MOEC started to
implement the new PEDP in July 2001, the matching criteria were dropped and all schools
received capitation and development grants.

2.10 The selection process for the GSES that was worked out during the initial testing
phase proved feasible during implementation. The first step was to identify girls from poor
households who are academically capable, based upon primary exam scores and head teacher
recommendations. Usually, one girl per school was chosen. The school/community
committee and village council were also involved to make the selection more transparent
locally. The Final Evaluation Report of the HRDP Project (Omari et a1 2003) confirmed that
poor households were well known to the teachers and village council. Based upon their
examination results, twenty percent of the poor girls who completed Form 4 were selected
for an additional 2 years of scholarship for upper secondary. Allowing time for this process
to be completed meant a project of seven years i997-2005), even though most of the non-
GSES activities were completed well before 2005.

2.1 1 Implementation of monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The initial M/E design
done early during implementation was considered to be too sophisticated by MOEC and new
task manager and not practical for lack of appropriate data. . Discussions with Bank team
staff and supervision reports point out that this problem was discussed during the mid-term
review in 2000 and it was decided a new more practical evaluation of the pilots was needed.
As a result, a the Final Evaluation Report (see Omari et a1 2003 above) was commissioned by
the MOEC and some useful data, although not as rigorous at the original design, was
collected comparing CEF districts with national averages. This report is called final because
the CEF and GSES pilots were completed by 2003, but time was needed until 2005 for the
girls in the GSES to complete their secondary schooling.

Achievement of the Objectives
ENROLLMENT LEARNING
        AND

2.12 The first objective was to raise enrollments and improve quality/learning outcomes in
primary education. Given the pilot nature of this project, this objective must be interpreted
to apply only to the pilot districts. By the end of the project over 1,600 schools, representing
all of the schools in the 16 districts, were participating in the pilot. They had active school
committees that developed school plans and made decisions on how to allocate the school
grants. School committees were created in 1978 legislation that states the membership (head
                                          9


teacher, parents and, village council representatives (elected by parents). They have no
power over personnel hiringkring, but with the advent of school grants have decision
making authority over how to spend for recurrent and construction items as part of the school
plan process. The Final Evaluation (2003) presents survey evidence that CEF district school
committees are more active, meeting 3-4 times per year versus the mandated minimum of
twice yearly.

2.13 The enrollments at CEF schools increased by 32 percent from 518,861 (1998) to
658,119 (2001, the last year available for the 2003 Final Evaluation). Over the same period
the NER increased in CEF districts from 54 to 78 percent, an increase larger than that of the
national average NER of 56 to 66 percent over the same period. How much of this to
attribute to the CEF component is difficult to decide since other DPs were supporting similar
initiatives in some of the CEF districts, such as the District Based Support Project.

2.14 CEF districts also performed better on the PSLE compared to the national pass rate.
CEF district pass rates increased from 21 percent to 35 percent (1998-2001) which was better
than the increase at the national level of 21 percent to 29 percent over the same period. [
Final Evaluation Report 20031 Discussions with observers attributed this in part to the
improvements due to CEF, but rigorous attribution is hard to determine given the lack of
more rigorous M&E.

2.15 Despite some deficiencies in the evaluation design and possible contamination of the
comparison districts (which would result in understating the impact), the available evidence
suggests that this objective was substantially achieved, particularly taking into account the
fact that the initially selected districts were among the poorest. The improvements registered
in a number of indicators comparing CEF to nation-wide averages are striking and likely not
just the result of random variation. NERs, primary exam scores, average spending per
student and participation of the school committee were all higher for the CEF districts.
Qualitative interviews with participants also lend support to the positive impact of the CEF
pilot.

EDUCATION
       OPPORTUNITIES FOR POOR GIRLS

2.16 The GSES pilot provided scholarships (covering almost all expenses) to over 4,700
girls between 1996 (the year of pre-testing) and 2001 (last year of data for 2003 Final
Evaluation), which was about 4 percent of all girls in secondary schools in 2001. This pilot
program was instrumental in increasing general awareness of the importance of girls'
education as there was not that much gender awareness in Tanzania at that time according to
one administrator. The Final Evaluation Report (2003) found that the NER for girls in lower
secondary in the GSES districts increased from 5 percent (1996) to 15 percent (2003). The
mission found a primary school in one district where an older teacher recalled proudly that
the 15 girls from his village all completed the program. The concept of scholarships for
students from poor households was new and provided the ground work for the scholarship for
boys and girls from poor households under SEDP.

2.17 Based upon the Final Evaluation Report (2003), the academic performance of the
girls in this pilot was on par with the general population of girl students with a passing rate of
                                              10


62 percent on the Form 4 exam. However, the majority of GSES girls scored a Division 4,
the lowest passing score, which is comparable to the national average for girls. While this is
not a high score, this was an achievement in light of the fact they were from underprivileged
households. Still, a small percentage qualified to continue on to upper secondary. From
2000 to 2004,409 girls scored high enough to enter Form 5,266 to enter teacher training and
50 for further vocational training. Moreover, their dropout rate in lower secondary actually
declined from 4.1 percent (1998) to 1.2 percent (2004). This objective was substantially
achieved, given that the target for scholarships was basically reached and the survival rate of
poor girls in the program was substantial.

       CAPACITY AT COMMUNITY LEVELS
BUILDING

2.18 As a result of the numerous training activities and written manuals, schools and
communities felt more empowered to make decisions relevant to their special circumstances.
While the Final Evaluation Report (2003) for HRDP did not provide for a rigorous
assessment of community empowerment, the qualitative evaluations, despite their limitations,
confirmed to a strong degree that school committees in rural areas were capable of such
responsibilities as school planning, procurement, and managing school bank accounts. The
Final Evaluation Report estimated that over three million people were reached via sensitizing
meetings and over 68,000 actually received training. This experience was reportedly a
valuable precursor to setting up the capitation and development grants under PEDP. This
objective was substantially achieved as it was demonstrated the schools and local
communities could be trained to manage grants for non-salary inputs and civil works.

IMPROVEMENT IN POLICY, PLANNING, AND RESEARCH

2.19 Interviews indicated that much was achieved in building up capacity in the above
areas. The department was lacking in up to date computers and software in the late 1990s
and the project filled that gap. More important was the training and attitude changes
introduced. Thus, the staff was much more capable of participating in and supporting the
studies , such as the Country Education Status Report (1999), that fed into the formulation of
the Education Sector Development Plans of the government that led up to the preparation of
PEDP. The project also provided support to the National Examinations Council of Tanzania
(NECTA), which was established in 1973 to replace the Cambridge Examinations Syndicate
that was responsible for national exams during the colonial period. Together with support
also received under the previous Education Planning and Rehabilitation (1990- 1998) in the
form of computers and technical assistance, the capacity of NECTA was significantly
upgraded by adding more up to date equipment such as optical scanners for reading exam
forms and faster computers and networking to process results faster. However, one issue not
addressed was the connectivity between MOEC and NECTA computer systems to allow
faster sharing and analysis of exam results. Thus the overall result of this component is
substantial.

3. Primary Education Development Program, 2001-2005
Objectives and Design
3.1     Objectives. The $200 million Primary Education Development Program (PEDP) was
approved on October 9,2001 and became effective on January 2,2002. It was financed by a
$150 million 3-tranche IDA sector adjustment credit and a $50 million grant from the
Government of Netherlands, administered by the Bank and also released in three tranches.
According to the President?s Report, the objective of the project was to support the
Government of Tanzania to reform the delivery of primary education. PEDP is part of the
government?s overall Education Sector Development Plan and is supported by the larger
Donor Partner group. Specifically, the objectives of the PEDP were to: (1) expand school
access, (2) improve education quality, and (3) increase school retention at the primary level.
These objectives would be achieved through improved resource allocation and utilization,
improved educational inputs, and strengthened institutional arrangements for effective
primary education delivery. The PEDP introduced, among other reforms, Capitation and
Development Grants for direct disbursement to primary schools. The Capitation Grant
(estimated to be about US$ 10 per pupil) was for non-salary items such as books, learning
materials, etc while the Development Grant (amount to be based upon school development
plan) was for construction and rehabilitation.

3.2     Design. Given that the instrument was a sector adjustment credit, there were no
components but rather a set of conditions for release of each of the three tranches. The
policy matrix of the program document groups these according to: general education,
expanding enrollment, improving teaching and learning, building capacity within the
education system, strengthening institutional arrangements that support planning and delivery
of education, and financing the PEDP. The activities required to meet tranche release
conditions constituted a major reform effort on the part of GOT and MOEC. The tranche
conditions, mapped into their objectives, are listed in Table 3-1.

3.3     Monitoring and evaluation. The EMIS was specified to be the main source of
information for monitoring program outputs and outcomes on an annual basis. Indicators to
monitored included enrollment rates, attendance rates, dropout rates, and PSLE scores. No
special sample surveys were to be used as was done in the case of the HRDP Project. A joint
GOT-donors comprehensive mid-term evaluation was also planned, the main purpose being
to determine whether satisfactory progress was being made towards the original project
objectives.

3.4    Implementation arrangements. Given the problems with the stand-alone project
implementation units in previous projects, the Government let the Bank and other donors
know that it wished a more coordinated approach. The overall coordination responsibility for
this complex and wide ranging program for primary education was given to the Prime
Minister?s Office for Regional Administration and Local Government.

Implementation
3.5     Implementation of PEDP went more or less as planned. There were challenges to
deal with so many schools, but they were addressed. Over 12,000 bank accounts were
opened by primary schools across the country as part of the effort to get them ready to
receive grant funds. About 12,000 schools received training over the years of the program so
that they could carry out procurement and make payments to suppliers from their bank
account. Procurement policy regulations were issued by the MOEC to all schools. They
procured basic materials, but there was the usual negative list of goods that are not allowed
under adjustment programs.

3.6    The Dutch grant ($50 million), which was executed by the Bank under a separate
grant agreement, was also divided into 3 tranches. The first tranche was disbursed January 1,
2002 (effectiveness), and the other two in June 2003 and November 2004. However, the
development partners continued support for primary education through the Pooled Funding
Partnership and a series of IDA-financed Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs 4
through 8) provided general budget support for the government, which in turn is a source of
funding for primary education, though how much of this went to primary education is not
available as it is mingled with Government budget. The conditions of the PRSCs for
education stated that a satisfactory annual education review should be carried out by the GOT
and DPs. To give an idea of the size of the DP funding pool, US$427 million was
committed by donors overall to all sectors in FY07 (see PRCS 4,2006). Compared to this,
the US$200 million for primary education from PEDP was substantial.

3.7    The activities related to meeting conditions and implementing other aspects of the
program were conceptually grouped around four main themes.

3.8     Expansion o Primary Enrollment. This component aimed to enroll 7 to 10 year
                     f
olds, introduce Development Grants to expand facilities, introduce the practice of regular
school maintenance, recruit and train the teachers needed, and introduce double shifting to
accommodate the surge in enrollment as a result of eliminating school fees. The purpose was
to build in a culture of maintaining quality.

3.9                   f
        Improvement o Primary Education Quality. Capitation Grants were introduced here
to compensate for loss of tuition fees and to provide for non-salary inputs. The grants were
set at US$l 0 equivalent, $4 of which was set for textbooks and the remainder for other non-
salary resources. Training was to be provided to upgrade teacher professional skills as well
as decentralization and choice in procurement of textbooks.

                                                  f
3-10 Capacity Building for Effective Delivery o Primary Education. This component
provided training of various players to ensure effective implementation of Development and
Capitation Grants, disseminated information about PEDP to communities, schools and
stakeholder.

3.1 1 Institutional Reform to Support Planning and Delivery o Primary Education.
Institutional arrangements were to be strengthened by reforming the overall structure of
planning and delivery of primary education. The MOEC's role was reoriented to that of
making policy, setting standards and assuring quality. The Prime Minister's Office for
Regional Administration and Local Government was given responsibility for delivery and
direct oversight of schools through Regional Secretariats and Local Government Authorities.
School/community committees were given more responsibility and participated more directly
in the management of their individual schools.

     ACCESS

3.12 Enrollment expanded rapidly both in terms of absolute numbers and enrollment rates.
The number of seven year olds (the official entry age) in government schools increased from
181,783 (2000) to 926,305 (2004 according to Education Sector Performance Report
2008/2009), implying that these numbers doubled twice over the course of 4 years. The
enrollment rate of seven year olds went from 18 to 84 percent over the same time period. For
primary education as whole the net enrollment rate increased from 59 to 91 percent between
2001 and 2004. The rapid increase in demand as a result of abolition of school fees in 2001
was accommodated through classroom construction (29,922 new classrooms were built in
2002-2004) and also through a plan of double shifting to help accommodate the surge.
Teacher training programs were also shortened, from 2 years of academics to one year of
academics plus one year of practice teaching and professional development All in all, this
was an impressive quantitative achievement. Since the completion of Bank support with the
last tranche in December 2004, expansion of enrollment has continued with domestic
resources and the support of other development partners. The latest years available from
BEST (2008) and ESPR 2009 show primary enrollment level of 8,410,094 in 2009 and a net
primary enrollment rate of 97 percent. Figure 1 shows the recent increases in the context of a
long-term enrollment trend.

3.13 However, there is an issue around the true value of the NER. Recently analyzed
household survey data (Demographic and Health Survey 2004/05) suggest a substantially
lower rate (73 percent) than does the school-based EMIS data base (93 percent). The
capitation grant is based upon the number of children officially enrolled, giving some
                                              15


incentive to overstate the enrollment. However, there is no evidence that the overstatement
of enrollment is so large. It is not clear why there is such a big divergence, but it appears that
the household survey is closer to the true value, implying there is still some way to go in
achieving UPE for poor households and hard to reach populations (Hoogeveen 2008).
Nevertheless, there clearly was a dramatic increase in access to primary education over the
life of the project which continues to the present that can be linked to the policies supported
under the PEDP, indicating substantial achievement of this objective.

IMPROVE QUALITY EDUCATION
              OF

3.14 The Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), administered by the National
Examinations Council, is given at the end of the primary cycle (standard 7) and is used for
selection of students to continue on to secondary school. Thus, the PSLE is a high-stakes
exam and is not ideal for the purpose of gauging learning achievement as compared to a true
national assessment of learning achievement that is calibrated to measure the same standards
from year to year. However, NECTA has many years of experience and received Bank
support from prior projects, developing along the way a professional reputation for its
competence in maintaining the academic standards of the tests. With those caveats in mind,
prior to PEDP, the PSLE pass rate was 21 percent in 1998 and 19 percent in 1999, according
to the Education Country Status Report (2001). The pass rate increased from 27 percent
(2002) to 62 percent in 2005 at the end of the PEDP IDA credit. It continued to rise up to 70
percent (2006) and then declined precipitously to 54 percent (2007) and to 49 percent (2009)
(Table 3-2).

3.15 Initially, the improving results were cited as evidence that PEDP was having the
desired impact on quality of education. There appeared to be a clear connection of inputs
(funding) to outputs (enrollment, textbooks) to outcomes (exam result as proxy). Although
some skepticism was voiced about increasing the weights given to Kiswahili (and less to
English and mathematics) in computing the total exam score in 2003. English and
mathematics have been the weakest subject areas for many years, so this should give an on-
off increase to the PSLE scores. However, the exams results did seem to validate the positive
impact of more resources on the system. Thus, the sharp decline in 2007came as a shock and
was widely reported and debated in the Tanzanian media. There is still no compelling
explanation, although the Education Sector Performance Review (ESPR 2008/2009) did a
preliminary investigation. The reasons identified were: 1) shortage of qualified teachers; 2)
shortage of materials; 3) lack of regular in-service training and school supervision. Another
factor could be the large enrollment increases, especially among children from poorer
households, since 2007 would be the first year that the large cohort that entered after school
fee abolition would have reached standard 7 and taken the PSLE. More analysis is needed
here, though it should be remarked that the pass rate of 49 percent (2009) is still much higher
than the than the 22 percent (2000) used as the benchmark by ESPR (2008/09), even with the
much larger population enrolled that included more poor households.

3.16 Improvement in quality of inputs may be a factor behind the achievement of test
scores remaining above baseline even after massive expansion. The pupil to textbook ratio
went from 20: 1 (2000) to 3: 1 (2009). The pupil to teacher ratio worsened a bit, from 46: 1
(2000) to 54: 1 (2008), which is not ideal, but still manageable. The capitation and
development grants improved spending on non-teacher inputs. It appears that Tanzanian
primary education managed to at least maintain, if not improve, learning achievement and
quality of inputs despite the massive expansion of the system. Other countries in Africa have
found it difficult to achieve this.'

3.17 A more skeptical view on quality improvement is voiced in the Dutch cofinancier's
comments in the ICR for PEDP (June 2005, see Annex 11). They point to the absence of
learning assessment systems (other than PSLE) and the many other factors and processes
affecting quality. Some light could be shed on this when the most recent round of the
UNESCO sponsored Southern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Quality in Education
program (SACMEQ) results are reported. SACMEQ is designed to be an assessment of
learning achievement discussed earlier. Tanzania participated in the second round of
SACMEQ in 2003, but not in round 1 that took place around 1998. Thus the SACMEQ 3
results for Tanzania are needed to get some comparison of results over time (from 2003 to
2007). By way of comparison with other countries, the SACMEQ2 results reported
Tanzanian primary school pupils scoring on par with its East African peers on reading and
further behind Kenya in mathematics, ranking fifth out of the fourteen countries (Table 3-3).

Note: 14 countries from the region participated. Standard 6 was the grade tested and the language of the test
was the language of instruction, Kiswahili in the case of Tanzania, but English for Kenya.

3.1 8 Since the SACMEQ program also collects data on regional and household income
variations, researchers are eagerly awaiting this rich data set for Tanzania and the other
countries which is due to be released late in 2010 (September 2009 was the original release
date). Thus, the distributional aspects of quality could also be addressed. There are
independent assessments of learning planned for this year by some CSOs in East Africa,
which should contribute to a more complete picture of learning achievement over time.

3,19 This objective of improving quality of primary education was substantially achieved,
given that the PSLE scores were more two times higher than at the beginning, and this is
after the system taking in many more rural poor students.

   IEG's primary education evaluation stresses the importance of this issue of maintaining learning achievement
as the drive for EFA proceeds (IEG 2006).

INCREASE RETENTION AT THE PRIMARY LEVEL

3.20 In much of the documentation, this objective is treated in less detail, partly because it
is viewed as following from the first two objectives. According to the latest ESPR (2009),
drop-out rates were fluctuating a bit in the range of 3.2 percent in 2003 to 3.7 percent in
2008, and repetition rates declined a bit from 5.3 percent to 4.9 percent. However, the drop-
out rate from standard 4 to 5 showed significant decline, from 13 percent (2001) to 5 percent
(2004), compared to the target of 10 percent. This used to be a selection point, with a
standard 4 exam determining those who would continue. The standard 4 exam is still given,
but only for the purpose of assessment. However, students who perform poorly may have to
repeat the year. With the greater availability of classrooms, almost all pupils can continue.
The percent of the cohort completing Standard 7 was 70 percent in 2000 and has gone down
to about 65 percent in 2008. Perhaps the transition to a mass primary system with increased
numbers from low-income households is a factor here, with those not performing well in
school dropping out to join the wage labor force or work on the family farm. Another factor
to consider is pregnancy of girls in the upper grades of primary, who usually then drop out.
More analysis is needed to understand this overall downward trend.

3.21 As in the case of exam scores, even after taking in many more poor rural students,
retention rates improved, substantially achieving the objective.


4. Secondary Education Development Program, 2004-2007
Objectives and Design
4.1     Objectives. The follow-on $150 million Secondary Education Development Program
(SEDP), was approved on June 8,2004 and became effective on September 30,2004. It was
financed by a $123.6 million IDA credit and a $26.4 million IDA grant; the credit was in the
form of a sector adjustment credit, released in three tranches, and the IDA grant was released
as part of the tranche disbursement. The long-term aim of the SEDP was to build a
productive and adaptable labor force and supply better quality students for the post-
secondary education and training system. According to the Program Document , the specific
objectives were to: (i) increase the proportion of the relevant age group completing lower and
upper secondary education, especially underserved groups who are now getting better
opportunities to complete primary education through the PEDP; (ii) improve learning
outcomes of students, especially girls, and at the lower secondary level; and (iii) enable the
public administration to manage secondary education more effectively, through the
devolution of authority to lower levels, and strengthening of management capacities.

4.2     Design. Since this project was financed by a development policy loan, there were no
cost tables organized around components describing activities within the components. The
three tranches were planned to be released each year for three years and the program credit
would close June 30,2007. Each tranche was subject to a number of conditions that involved
actions critical to the success of the overall SEDP. Table 4-1 lists those conditions during
each tranche showing how they map into the program objectives. The PRSCs also specified
                                                                     18


the generic condition that satisfactory annual education sector reviews be carried out by the
GOT and DPs.

4.3     Monitoring and evaluation. The main text of the Program Document did not specify
indicators to be used, but the LogFrame, which specified a number of target indicators, in the
annexes specified that gross secondary enrollment rates (GSERs) would be used for objective
 1 and Form 4 examination scores would be used for objective 2. Since objective 1 pertains to
completion of secondary schooling, completion rates might be a better indicator. However,
that information is more difficult to obtain, so the GSER was used, and subsequently net
secondary enrollment rate (NSER) was also sometimes used (see para. 4.17 for a partial
analysis of completion rates). With respect to objective 2, as was mentioned in the case of
primary leaving exams, a true national assessment of learning achievement would be better,
but Tanzania does not have one yet (perhaps in the follow on project to this one). Thus, the
Form 4 examination results are used as a proxy (see below for more discussion). With
respect to objective 3, consultants Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) prepared a baseline
assessment of administrative capacity against which annual review processes could judge
progress. The annual education sector reviews mentioned above are also an important part of
the M/E processes. The long-term labor force goal is listed in the LogFrame, along with
youth unemployment indicator, but it was stated that no impact was anticipated in the short-
term (to 2006).

4.4     Implementation arrangements. Similar to PEDP, a decentralized approach was to
be followed during implementation. A high growth and medium growth of enrollment was
analyzed, and the medium scenario was selected for implementation, which was deemed to
be compatible with the growth rate of the economy and public resources at that time. As in
PEDP school grants would be administered by the secondary school/community committees.
                                          19


There were three kinds of grants under SEDP: capitation, development and scholarship for
poor students (girls and boys). However, the RALGs played a larger role in SEDP since
secondary schools cover a larger catchment area than primary schools. The MOEC was to
continue in its central role of standards, curricula reform and issued guidelines for schools to
follow in the implementation of the grants. Teachers continued to be hired and provided by
the Government and school committees were not involved in personnel hiring and firing. As
in PEDP , school committees formulated school plans and made decisions about non-salary
teaching resources and constructionhehabilitation of facilities.

Implementation
4.5     During supervision of this DPL, there was no grouping of activities as was done in
the case of PEDP. Here the emphasis was on the three objectives listed above and the
conditions of tranche release, which were designed to achieve them. The first tranche of $US
50 million was released in November 2004 after meeting the first set of conditions of
effectiveness listed in Table 4-1, This first tranche was just in time for the new school year
starting in January 2005, the first full year of SEDP implementation.

4.6      Starting in 2005 the government reduced tuition fees for government secondary
school from Tshs 40,000 to Tshs 20,000, with the capitation grant making up for the loss of
revenue to the schools. This action was one of the second tranche release conditions.
Moreover, there was a vigorous campaign mounted by the ruling political party to encourage
parents and students. In July 2006, partly to fulfill the ruling party manifesto issued in the
2005 election campaign, the Prime Minister proclaimed that there would be a community
secondary school in every ward, which is a political/administrative subdivision below that of
districts. Thus, community secondary schools are sometimes referred to as ward secondary
schools. Even the SEDP Program Document (2004) mentions this target in relation to the
government's poverty reduction strategy, but does not commit to it as an explicit objective of
the SEDP operation. There was also a genuine bottom-up community-driven demand for
secondary education, given the success of PEDP in increasing primary enrollments and also
reflecting the historically low enrollment rates of Tanzanian secondary education. However,
Bank supervision missions cautioned the Government about the fiscal dangers of too rapid
expansion beyond the medium growth scenario of the SEDP Program Document and its
impact on quality. As result of rapid expansion of enrollment, the grants were not released to
schools at the full levels.

4.7      The second tranche release was in April 2006, 6 months later than anticipated due to
delay in the submission of the government report detailing the fulfillment of tranche release
conditions. Although this came with some delay, the tranche release was in time for
utilization during the 2006 school year, which begins in late January each calendar year.

4.8     The third tranche release was delayed more seriously and this caused a delay in
resource flows to the schools. The third tranche conditions were met except for the first,
since the proposed capitation grant was Tshs16,960 versus the Tshs 25,000 per student as
agreed in the LDP. The expansion of the system was so rapid by that point that the
government budget had difficulties in maintaining the resources per student of the prior
years. However, a waiver was granted by the IDA Board and the third tranche was released
                                                 20


in August 2007 versus the anticipated September 2006. This made it difficult for schools to
utilize these funds during the 2007 school year. The credit closed on December 3 1,2007, 6
months later than planned, and SEDP continued under GOT budget and GBS provided
through the PRSCs and other DPs.

4.9      The implementation of the M&E arrangements followed Annex H of the Program
Document. The focus was more on monitoring indicators such as enrollment rates and exam
performance as opposed to impact evaluation. Annual reviews by the GOT and DPs based
upon the collected monitoring indicators played a significant part of the M/E approach. The
Program Document indicated that in a short term DPL of only 3 years, it was not realistic to
see any impact on exams results or completion rates.

4.10 There has been an unprecedented expansion of secondary schools constructed since
the start of SEDP in 2004. Part of this came from increased demand due to tuition reduction
in 2005 and part of it from the increased government financing under SEDP. The number of
government-supported secondary schools increased from 828 in 2004 to 3,039 in 2008, most
of which was due to the community school movement (Table 4-2). Although the distribution
of schools by wards is not published, given that there are about 2,500 wards, it is likely that
most wards would now have at least one secondary school. There are two distinct types of
secondary schools supported by the government. Community schools are government
supported, but are built by local communities with both cash and in-kind contributions; the
government is expected to provide teachers and help with capitation and development grants
under SEDP. These are in contrast to fully government-owned schools like those built in the
early days of independence, with almost total government budget support. In order to be
clear about the distinction, this report will refer to "government-owned schools" and
"government-supported community schools." It is clear in Table 4-2 that the majority of new
schools are the latter type, encouraged under SEDP.

Note: The SEDP Program Document reported the 101 full government-owned schools in 2004. The BEST
reported the 91 in 2007. There was no explanation for the discrepancy.

4.1 1 In addition to government schools of both types reported above there are two types of
non-government schools allowed by official policy: seminaries (sponsored by various
religious denominations) and private schools. These seminaries are not just for training
students for religious vocations, but are registered academic secondary schools sponsored by
religious groups. The private secondary schools are their secular counterparts, and both
                                           21


charge fees that could be considered high by local standards. These non-government schools
numbered 759 in 2008 making for a total of 3,798 secondary schools during that year. There
has been an increase in non-government secondary schools over the years, but it has been
more gradual as shown in Table 4-3 below.

4.12 Between 2004 and 2008, enrollment in all secondary schools has more than doubled
from 432,599 to 1,222,403 (Table 4-3). Thus, enrollment growth has exceeded the high
growth scenario which was discussed as an option only if sufficient resources would be
available. Instead, the SEDP Program Document recommended the medium growth option
as more prudent, and supervision missions cautioned the government about the rapid pace of
expansion. However, community driven demands and the pressure of previous political
manifestos led to a much faster pace of classroom construction. The construction and
equipment for science and computer labs and libraries lagged behind. Completing this critical
infrastructure is on the agenda for future developments (a follow up secondary project is
under preparation). Shortage of qualified teaching staff is the most pressing problem.

4.13 This rapid growth of enrollment has led to an increase in lower secondary GER from
about 10 percent in 2003 to 30.5 percent in 2007 (World Bank 2008). The Bank's Program
Document in its LogFrame set a medium-term growth scenario with a lower secondary GER
of 30 percent by 2010, which has been met early, based upon the above data. However, the
government's LDP preferred a more ambitious NER target of 50 percent in lower secondary
by 201 0, but stated it would follow the medium growth scenario in view of the current
growth of the economy. In the end, enrollment grew much faster than the medium growth
scenario.

4.14 SEDP continued after the three Bank tranches (2004-2007) with support from the DPs
(also including Bank support under the PRSCs) and domestic budget resources. The initial
Bank support was important in giving the start up of SEDP a strong lift. The impact of
SEDP over a longer time period can seen in the graph below showing the sharp acceleration
in secondary enrollment.

4.15 With respect to upper secondary (Forms 5 and 6), there has been less dramatic
enrollment increase. For all government schools the number of students entering Form 5
increased from 25,240 (2007) to 31,301 (2008), an increase of 16 percent (from ESPR 2009).
Including all upper secondary schools, the increase was from 37,s 16 to 43,052 for the same
years, or an increase of almost 14 percent. The NER for upper secondary increased from the
low level of 0.4 percent (2002) to 1.4 percent (2008), still low for upper secondary. The
target set by the LDP was 25 percent for the NER in upper secondary by 2010. The ESPR
2009 considers this target at risk.

4.16 Enrollment data show progress on equal access to secondary education for girls by
2015. The gender ratio (girls to boys) rose from 84 percent in 2003 to 88 percent in 2007,
just short of the target of 90 percent. Access to secondary school in rural areas has increased
as a result of reduced tuition and of the school construction program. Almost every ward (the
next smaller subdivision of a district) has a secondary school as promised in the Ruling Party
Manifesto during the 2005 election. Coupled with the scholarship grant program, the third
type of grant given to schools and targeted at poor families who still cannot afford the
reduced tuition and other costs (uniforms, etc), access for the poor and rural areas is being
addressed, even if in a relatively small way. The initial target was to grant such scholarships
to 12,000 standard 7 leavers each year or 48,000 pupils for all four years. The MOEC issues
a circular to schools and village committees on transparent procedures to be followed, based
in part upon what was learned in the girls' scholarship component of the HRDP Project. The
value of the scholarship covered almost the total cost of secondary, including tuition.
According to the ESPR (2008/2009) the problem has arisen that declining budgets have
reduced the number of scholarships to 11,895 in 2009 from 42,211 (2008) and 34,012 (2007).

4.17 Just as important as progress in enrollment is the completion of secondary school,
especially at the lower secondary level. The objective statement of the Program Document
does not give a definition of completion, but it seems reasonable to define it as obtaining the
Certificate of Secondary Education (CSEE), which requires passing the Form 4 examination
with a Division 4 or higher passing score. The exam scores are ranked into Divisions 1 to 4,
below which is a failing score (see below for more detail about strong passing scores versus
weak passing scores). If the pass rate is multiplied by the number of candidate, then the
number of students completing Form 4 is obtained (Table 4-4).

Table 4-4: Number of Students Completing Form 4 (CSEE or Division 1-4 pass)
     Year            Pass Rate      Number of Candidates     Number of Completers
     2003               88                 62,359                  54,875
     2004              91.5               63,487                   58,090
     2005              89.3                85,292                  76,165
    2006t              89.1                85,865                  76,505
     2007              90.3               125,288                  113,135
     2008              83.5              231,813                  190,087)
     2009              72.5               339,925                 246,446
Source: BEST 2008; NECTA 2009

4.18 The number completing secondary by this definition increased from 54,875(2003)to
246,446 (2009),a factor of 4.5or 28.4percent annualized. Even though the pass rate
declined from 88 percent to 72.5percent, the number of candidates increased rapidly. The
Form4 completion rate, defined as the number of completers over the number in the relevant
population age group (usually 17- 8 year olds), must have increased dramatically as well
                                     1
since the numerator increased dramatically but the denominator only gradually. Without
having the exact value of the relevant population age group, which is difficult to define in
Tanzania with so many overage students, the relevant population age group likely did not
grow much more than 2 to 4 percent annualized (the range of overall population growth
during this time period). Thus, there was a dramatic rise in the secondary school completion
rate, albeit from a low initial rate. More analysis like this can be done for Form 6
completers, but the results are not as dramatic. In terms of efficacy, whether from enrollment
or completion perspective, this objective was substantially achieved.

      LEARNING
IMPROVE      OUTCOMES
4.19 While unprecedented progress has been made on increasing enrollment, the objective
of improving learning outcomes has faced serious challenges. Given that there is no national
assessment of achievement at the secondary level, the Program Document cited National
Form 4 exams as a proxy indicator. These exams are also administered by the NECTA.
However, they are high-stakes exams used for selection to the Form 5 or upper secondary
and other post-Form 4 programs such as teacher training and health and agriculture training.
Although not ideal from the viewpoint of national assessment, they have been in place for
many years and maintain standards against which progress can be judged. The SEDP
Program Document indicated that positive results in National Form 4 pass rates could not be
expected realistically within the three year lifetime of the credit, although results would
continue to be monitored. During that time not only were schools expected to be
constructed, but also teachers, textbooks and other materials were expected to be supplied.
                                                  24


However, teachedpupil ratios worsened from 22: 1 (2004) to 50: 1 (2007) and the capitation
grant as mentioned before declined from Tsh25,OOO to Tshl6,400, implying less non-salary
resources for instruction. No figures were available for textbooks, but reports of shortages
were widespread.

4.20 NECTA recently released the results of the latest Form 4 exams, for which students
sat in November 2009. The exams are scored according to Division 1 (the highest) to
Division 4 (lowest pass level below which is failure). As mentioned above, this pass rate fell
from 88 percent (2003) to 72.5 percent (2009). To qualify for further study a student must
score Division 3 or higher, with Division 4 being so weak a pass, most observers regard it as
a de facto failure. By this definition, the pass rate on Form 4 was about 18 percent in 2009,
11 percent lower than in 2008 and 20 percentage points lower than in 2003 (Table 4-5).
More students (about 50 percent or more) are scoring in the Division 4 category over the past
few years. Not only was the low level of passing a matter of concern, but also the declining
trend. Part of this second objective was to improve learning outcomes for girls. The exam
scores of girls lag seriously behind those for boy. While the lower secondary GER for boys
and girls is roughly the same, girls scored much lower than boys in 2009 with a pass rate of
12 percent versus that of 22 percent for boys. This gap, which was typical of exam results
for the past few years, indicates much more progress is needed on learning outcomes for girls
in lower secondary.

press release (the Citizen, Feb. 10,2010).

4.2 1 What was also of concern was the poor performance in mathematics, science, and
English, subject areas that are being emphasized for future technology development and
economic growth. Community schools, which are the main secondary schools in rural areas,
showed a much worse performance on these exams (3 1 percent pass rate) than Government
schools (5 1 percent). Almost all of the major newspapers carried articles and letters from
concerned citizens about the Form 4 exam scores, showing that education quality is an issue
that is the concern of wider society. The general feeling was that shortages of teachers, low
competence of new teachers from shortened training programs, lack of books and learning
materials, etc. were all factors behind the decline, in part due to the reduced capitation grants
mentioned earlier. In contrast to PEDP, where quality of education relative to the baseline
appeared to be maintained while undergoing massive expansion, large scale expansion of
secondary education resulted in declining exam scores of the new cohorts.

4.22 Some observers question whether the Form 4 exams actually measure quality of
learning. The objection is that they are based upon old methods of rote learning and not upon
critical and creative thinking, as promoted by international best practice in modern
curriculum and assessment. For that reason, school-based continuous assessment of student
performance is also supposed to count for half of the points needed to qualify for transition to
the next level of study. Many observers believe that the exam score in practice still
dominates that decision.
                                         25


4.23 The new competency -based curriculum introduced under SEDP was intended to
address that critique of the exams. The new curriculum was sent to schools in 2005 and the
first exams based upon the new curriculum scheduled to be October 2008. The IEG mission
examined the mathematics textbooks during school visits, and these seemed quite
comparable to international standards (when available at schools). It is likely that the actual
curriculum delivered by most schools is not yet the new one, given that in most school
systems it would take time to train teachers and assure all schools have the new materials.
Moreover, the new curriculum would require teachers with an even deeper understanding of
their subject specialties and mastery of pedagogy, since they are required to entertain more
questions from students and also pose critical questions and problems to engage their
students. This is not likely to happen under the crash training programs that were necessary
over the past few years. These programs have not been properly evaluated except for
tabulating numbers of teachers trained. Thus, more detailed evaluation of the exam scores
and implementation of the new curriculum, including teacher training, is warranted. lo

4.24 While the Form 4 Exam pass rates are an imperfect proxy for learning, the downward
trend is not suggestive of improvement; achievement of the objective of improved learning is
particularly weak among girls. On the other hand, many more students from much poorer
backgrounds in rural areas were taking the Form 4 Exam for the first time. The Program
Document did not expect any change in exam scores over the short three year time frame of
the Bank credit. Some decline could be expected as weaker students enter the pool of exam
takers, even if there were the same level of quality inputs, such as teacher class load and
learning materials. It should also be noted that the 2009 exam scores reflect the cohort who
started Form1 in January/February 2006 after two years of sharp increases in enrollment.
However, in this case there was also a clear deterioration in education quality inputs, in terms
of qualified teachers and other materials. All of these factors taken together suggest that
efficacy of this objective is negligible.

4.25 Given the typical situation of community secondary schools observed by the IEG
mission, the relatively poor performance of these schools on the Form 4 examination results
(whether old or revised) should not be surprising. Most of the stakeholders interviewed felt
that these poor learning outcomes were the result of expanding community secondary schools
too fast without supplying the resources per student needed for improving or maintaining
learning outcomes. On the other hand, some officials interviewed expressed the view that it
is better to lay down a basic infrastructure foundation now to provide some opportunity to
young people who otherwise might be somewhat aimless. Then resources to improve that
infrastructure and other dimensions of quality could be provided over time. This issue will
be taken up again in the lessons section.

4.26 The twin objectives of quantitative expansion and improvement of quality are
intended to contribute to the long term aim of developing an adaptable labor force. The Log
Frame mentions that long term monitoring of the labor market to monitor any unemployment
problems of secondary leavers that might develop. There is not much evidence that the
Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MOEVT) has done much in the way of this


lo   Kina 2004.
                                              26


monitoring. However, a few studies of the informal sector have been done by the Bank."
The fact that many secondary leavers must resort to the informal sector for employment
shows that the formal labor market is no longer growing fast enough to absorb the new
supply or that the quality of the new supply may not fit the needs of the formal labor market.
This will also be taken up in the lessons section.

STRENGTHEN MANAGEMENT SECONDARY EDUCATION
                   OF

4.27 Devolution of management and delivery of secondary education to lower levels of
authority is a key part of government strategy. The MOEVT is supposed to play the role of
policy and quality assurance at the national level, while also providing and paying teachers.
The Regional Secretariat, which has a Regional Education Officer, has important oversight
functions, within which school management boards have flexibility in allocating school
grants to resolve local problems.

4.28 The mission in its visits to secondary schools was struck by the variation in the nature
of local problems and how flexibility of school heads and management boards was essential.
For some schools shortage of water was the problem, for others it long distance from towns
or shortage of teachers in mathematics. One head teacher reported that he used Form 6
graduates from the village to tutor Form 4 students for their mathematics exam because he
had no mathematics teachers. To help secondary schools resolve such problems a District
Secondary Education Coordinator was appointed in 2006. Whereas before only one
coordinator covered both primary and secondary schools, there is now a district coordinator
for each one.

4.29 A great deal of training of key players at all levels was necessary for this devolution
strategy to work. The ESPR (2008/2009) and the annual reviews give a list of training
statistics. Over 700 administrators were trained by the Agency for Development of
Educational Management. More than 1,300 school heads and senior academic staff were
trained. But, apart from a Price Waterhouse Coopers' sampling of some regional needs,
there did not appear to be any systematic analysis of training needs and no monitoring or
evaluation of training efficacy or impact. While the training did take place, in the absence of
evidence of its efficacy, achievement of the objective of strengthening management of
secondary education is rated modest.

5. Ratings
Human Resource Development Project
OUTCOME

5.1     Overall, the outcome for this project is satisfactory. This is based on substantial
relevance of the project's objectives and design, substantial efficacy in achieving the project
objectives and substantial efficiency.

5.2     All four objectives of this project were relevant to the current as well as prior CAS
documents. The first two objectives, raising enrollment and quality of primary education and
expanding access to secondary school for poor girls, relate directly to reducing poverty and
improving social well being as emphasized in the recent JCAS (2007) and National Strategy
for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (2005). The last two objectives concerning capacity
building at the local school/community level and the MOEC central level are also necessary
to achieving the first two objectives as well as contributing directly to growth and poverty
reduction through improved delivery of public services. These objectives remained relevant
over the course of the project and relevance of obiectives is rated as substantial.

5.3     The two pilots were relevant to the objectives of testing out ways of increasing
enrollment/learning and expanding opportunity for poor girls. The M&E design in the PIP
was also relevant to the design, even though it might have been too sophisticated. The
school/community capacity building activities were essential to implementing the pilots
effectively, given that these kinds of grant administration activities were new to the schools
and communities. The central capacity building for MOEC and NECTA were relevant to
data collection and analysis. The relevance of design is rated substantial.

5.4      The efficacy of the project in terms of achieving all four objectives was substantial
as well. Concerning the first objective of improving enrollment and quality in primary
schools, comparison of pilot and non-pilot districts showed that the pilot districts performed
better. Although the attribution of this to the project in those districts cannot be made with
certainty, the judgment of most observers is that this is highly likely. Based upon the results
listed in the achievement section for this project, a similar conclusion can be made with
respect to the efficacy of the GSES in achieving the objective of assisting poor girls to attend
and complete secondary school. The two capacity building sections provided a great deal of
training and equipment that translated, based upon much anecdotal evidence, into capacity to
deliver the relevant services. Efficacy is thus rated as substantial.

5.5     Given that this was a relatively small scale pilot project with the necessary capacity
building added to it, the benefits of achieving objectives at a modest cost gives the project an
efficiency rating of substantial. The size and costs of the pilot projects were adequate for
the purpose of establishing the benefits of the approaches being piloted. Local firms and
professors were used in testing instruments and evaluation, which helped to contain costs.
                                               28


RISK TO DEVELOPMENT
                 OUTCOME

5.6     The risk to development outcome for this project is rated negligible to low. The two
pilot schemes have already been scaled up successfully in both PEDP and SEDP. The
capacity building objectives at the school/community level and also at the policy level of
MOEVT were successfully implemented and this capacity is still being utilized. No doubt
more capacity in certain areas is still needed, but what this project, as a pilot scheme, aimed
achieving was done so satisfactorily and can be sustained fiscally in coming years, if the
economic growth and budget situation is maintained.

BANKPERFORMANCE
5.7     Bank quality at entrv was satisfactory. The preparation team was thorough and
participatory. The Bank responded flexibly to the government request to modify the
Education Planning and Rehabilitation Project so as to finance pretesting, design, and
consultation with beneficiaries as part of preparation of the two pilots for this project. The
quality at entry was rated highly satisfactory by the Bank's internal Quality Assurance Group
(QAG). Among the eight dimensions rated by QAG, three were satisfactory and the others
highly satisfactory. However according to the ICR, monitoring and evaluation, was not rated
by QAG. Nonetheless, the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) did have an M/E plan with
sample surveys that was regarded as too sophisticated for the MOEC capacity and was
replaced with a simpler design.

5.8     Bank supervision was satisfactory throughout implementation. There were changes
of Bank task team leaders (seven according to the Borrower's report contained in the ICR for
the project), which would have been preferable to avoid in the interest of efficiency
according to some respondents. However, there is no evidence of this having a negative
impact with the Borrower expressing appreciation for the problem solving nature of
supervision missions.

       PERFORMANCE
BORROWER
5.9     The government performance was satisfactory. During implementation of the
previous project the Government recognized the need to find ways to promote local
community/school involvement and requested funds be reallocated to allow for pre-testing of
the pilot design. The Government provision of counterpart funds and staffing was
forthcoming when needed.

5.10      Performance of the MOEC as implementing agency was satisfactory. After a slow
start, due to the Project Support Group not being in place, the pace of implementation picked
up. The credit was almost fully disbursed with only a small amount of US$467,500
remaining at closing, which was cancelled. The pilot CEF and GSES were implemented
satisfactorily and sustainably. The key implementation team was stable throughout the seven
years, something unusual in many Bank supported projects that experience losses of key
implementation personnel. At the local level, district and school personnel who were local
coordinators for CEF/GSES showed interest and commitment that was critical to satisfactory
performance. However, senior local officials were often not conversant with the pilot
                                          29


schemes of the project. Thus, the HRDP did not become well integrated into the
Government structure. In the one district (a poor one) where the IEG mission was able to
find teachers who were present that far back, the teachers showed evident pride in their
achievements and in being pioneers in the pilot, especially the GSES. This was at a time
when talk of gender equity was relatively new.

MONITORING EVALUATION
         AND

5.1 1 Overall M&E is rated modest. The design of M&E is modest. The project aimed to
pilot and evaluate two distinct interventions, but there was no evaluation design in the SAR
other than the LogFrame, which was lacking in precision with respect to indicators. An
evaluation design was developed during the early stages of implementation in the PIP. That
design had some efforts to set up control groups for the pilots, including baseline data
collection and sample surveys of households and schools. However, it was regarded as too
sophisticated for the MOEC by the new task team that took over after effectiveness.

5.12 Implementation of M&E is also modest. After encountering the above problems with
the M&E, another Impact Evaluation was commissioned by the MOEC. This was done by
local university researchers and was able to obtain some useful results, even if not as rigorous
as the original design. Household and school based sample surveys were done with a few
non-CEF districts included, and data comparisons were made with national level statistics
and CEF districts. Qualitative interviews of participants were also included.

5.13 Utilization of the data generated by the monitoring and evaluation that was
implemented was substantial. The results of the two pilots were incorporated into the
design of the PEPD grants and SEDP grants and scholarships. There was time to do so
before PEDP started because the pre-testing of the CEF school grants started in 1995. The
official pilot for school grants under CEF ran from 1998 to 200 1.

Primary Education Development Program
OUTCOME
5.14 The overall outcome of PEDP is rated satisfactory. Relevance of objectives and
design and achievement of all three objectives are rated substantial; efficiency is not rated for
development policy operations.

5.15 All 3 program objectives-expanding school access, improving quality and
increasing retention-- are relevant to the most recent JAST (2007) and poverty reduction
strategy (2005), as well as strategies at the time of PEDP preparation in 200 1. Virtually all
similar policy and vision statements over the past decade or more have emphasized
expanding primary enrollment to the point of achieving UPE with quality. Thus, the
relevance of the obiecrives is rated substantial.

5.16 The design was intended to be the first phase of the overall Education Sector
Development Plan (ESDP 2001). PEDP was designed to be decentralized in keeping with
the overall government policy of decentralization. The school capitation and development
                                                30


grants, piloted under the CEF component of the HRDP project, provided background
experience in the development of guidelines to school committees on how to implement
grants. The choice of a DPL allowed flexibility and a rapid infusion of resources. The
relevance of design is rated substantial.

5.17 Despite some uncertainty about NER data based upon the results of household with
school based data, the quantitative objective of significantly expanding enrollments was
substantially achieved. Achievement of the quality objective was also substantial; although
pass rates on primary exams declined after the initial large increases, the primary pass rate is
still above that of 2001 at the start of PEDP (49 percent versus 22 percent). This is all the
more remarkable given the huge expansion of enrollment drawing in pupils from poorer
households. Retention rates of pupils in schools have not declined with the larger pool of
poor rural students. Thus efficacy of PEDP is substantial.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT
                 OUTCOME

5.18 The risk to development outcomes of PEDP is moderate. The quantitative indicators
of enrollment increases have shown good progress. Despite the evidence that NER may be
overstated by the school based data sources, prospects for continued progress in enrolling
children in primary school look promising. The declining PSLE pass rates are cause for
concern, but it seems plausible that a package of inputs to enhance quality can be managed
from both a fiscal and technical perspective. The MOEVT and RALG education officers
have been brainstorming on an emergency basis about this problem over the past few weeks
as the President himself has directed that attention be paid to this situation.

BANKPERFORMANCE

5.19 The Bank?s performance is rated satisfactory. The Bank?s quality at entry is rated
satisfactory. The Bank responded positively to the Government?s request for support to
reform the delivery of primary education. The design was ambitious, but it was based upon
on-going reforms, such as local government decentralization, and extensive analytical work
undertaken in the Country Education Status report. This was financed by the proceeds of the
HRDP credit and conducted in collaboration with the Government, Development Partners
and other stakeholders.

5.20 Bank performance during supervision was satisfactory. Supervision missions were
carried out on a timely basis to provide technical support and to assure that activities to fulfill
conditions were on track. The borrower also needed some analytical and policy support as
this was the first development policy operation for the education sector.

       PERFORMANCE
BORROWER
5.21 Based upon the actions of government, especially Prime Minister?s office, and the
MOEC and local governments as described below, the overall borrower performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

5.22 The government?s performance was satisfactory. The Prime Minister?s Office for
Regional Administration and Local Government (PMO-RALG) was in charge of overall
                                         31


coordination of PEDP, which was a complex and far reaching reform program. In contrast to
the PSG in the HRDP, which was not integrated into Government structures, the PMO-
RALG performed well in this role, also coordinating with DPs and civil society stakeholders.
Annual sector reviews with DPs and stakeholders were conducted so that problems could be
discussed and resolved along the way. This helped foster wide ownership of PEDP.

5.23 The performance of MOEC and PMO-RALG as implementing agencies was
moderately satisfactory. Some problems arose in selected areas, but overall performance
showed a high level of commitment. For the most part, roles were clear under the
decentralized delivery arrangements and training in these roles was adequate. The
borrower's impact assessment team found a few anomalies in use of grants, but they were
still within the education purposes. There were areas where quality of local construction was
not adequate. A public expenditure tracking survey on behalf of government and DPs was
undertaken and results will be released soon. Despite some instances of delays in
disbursement at the beginning of implementation, schools received their grants through the
budget system and received guidelines and training on proper use of grants.

MONITORING EVALUATION
         AND

5.24 Overall quality of M&E is modest. The design of M&E is modest, as there was no
design methodology specified apart from the standard LogFrame of the Program Document.
The LogFrame specified the indicators to be used for each of the project objectives and how
the data were to be collected.

5.25 Implementation of M&E as envisioned in the LogFrame was modest. This was
mainly monitoring indicators and collecting statistics, as opposed to analysis and evaluation.
However, a review of PEPD was commissioned by the Government at the end of the project
in 2004 and even later in 2008, The Evaluation of the Impact of the Primary Education
Development Plan 2002-2006 was commissioned, covering the period of the whole program
in addition to the three years of the Bank credit. The consultant team in 2008 made extensive
field visits and had useful recommendations, especially for the sustainability of PEDP and
the preparation of PEDP2, currently under implementation. In the course of their field visits,
the consultant team also found that the full capitation grant of US$lO sent via local councils
did not reach many schools in their sample (87 percent of the full amount reached schools), a
lesson that could be rectified in PEDP2.

5.26 Utilization of M&E data was substantial. Through the process ofjoint annual
reviews, the M&E results that collected were shared and discussed. This led to
recommendations for the following year with respect to program implementation. The
evaluation of PEDP referred to above was used as an input into the second phase of the
Education Sector Development Plan, from 2008 to 201 7.

Secondary Education Development Program
OUTCOME

5.27 The outcome of this project overall is rated moderately unsatisfactory. There were
significant shortcomings in the operation's achievement of its objectives, particularly in
terms of learning outcomes; achievement of the capacity building objective was modest, as
was the relevance of design. Efficiency is not rated for development policy operations.

5.28 All of the objectives are relevant to the current JAST and the current growth and
poverty reduction strategy. The long-term aim of an adaptable labor force and improved
supply of students entering the post-secondary education system is especially relevant to the
aim of technology development to promote economic growth. The first of the specific
objectives-increasing the proportion of the age group in secondary, especially for
underserved groups-while not aiming at universal secondary, does aim to expand
opportunity in a way that reduces poverty and improves income distribution. The second
specific objective of better learning outcomes is aimed directly at the productivity aspects of
the growth and poverty reduction strategy. The specific objective of improved management
is critical to improve service delivery as stated in the JAST and many related policy
statements. The relevance of obiectives is thus rated substantial.

5.29 The tranche conditions were relevant to the achievement of the objectives. The use of
a DPL instrument provided some flexibility and was relevant to the situation in which a
quick and large infusion of resources was needed to expand secondary enrollment, following
the rapid increase in primary enrollment. However, it is much more difficult to rapidly
expand secondary education, given its complexity, and while maintaining quality. Hence, the
instrument was not conducive to improving and sustaining learning outcomes or to building
capacity. And it did not ensure financial sustainability. The relevance of design is rated
modest.

5.30 With respect to efficacy, substantial progress was made, on average, in increased
completion rates, defined as CSEE certificates awarded at the end of Form 4. There is no
specific information on completion rates among underserved groups; it is presumed that,
given the very large increase in enrollment, these groups' completion rates also likely
increased, though it is not clear whether their completion rates would have improved relative
to the rates of the less underserved and non-poor. On balance, the first objective was
substantially achieved. With respect to the second objective of improving learning
achievement, the rapid expansion severely challenged the quality of education; there remain
shortcomings in infrastructure and the number of qualified teachers. This has shown up in
declining exam scores of Division 3 or higher, especially in English, science, and
mathematics, which have been identified as subjects of priority. The exam scores of girls
and poor rural areas lag seriously behind those for boys and urban areas. Thus, the
achievement of the second objective is negligible. The third objective of improving
administration of secondary education through devolution to regional and local authorities
has made progress, but the extent of this progress is modest. More training is needed and the
training to date has not been sufficiently evaluated.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT
                 OUTCOME

5.3 1 The risk to development outcomes of SEDP is rated significant. Although indicators
of quantitative objectives show great progress, expansion took place so rapidly that perhaps it
was done too fast. Much incomplete infrastructure in terms of classrooms only was put up,
but the fiscal sustainability in terms of completing infrastructure is now being called into
question. The most serious risk to development outcome has to do with improving learning
achievement. The shortages of qualified teachers and those inputs associated with improved
learning, as evidenced by the declining scores in national secondary exams, means that an
enormous fiscal and managerial effort is needed to reverse these trends. These risks were
identified in the SEDP Program and, indeed, have materialized. However, there is still strong
commitment and ownership by the government and wider society, in addition to expressions
of future support from DPs. These problems are widely recognized but it will take time to
turn them around. Thus, the recently approved (May 2010) Adaptable Program Loan in
support of SEDP2 will attempt to address many of the risk factors that could undermine the
quality of secondary education, especially in underserved areas where expansion of
enrollment has been most rapid.

BANKPERFORMANCE
5.32 Overall Bank performance was moderately satisfactory. The response to the
Borrower's request to follow up on PEDP with a secondary education project was quick and
flexible on the part of the Bank. The project was prepared rapidly, but still the Bank
attempted to harmonize this program with all donors and CSO priorities. The conditions
agreed upon for tranche release were relevant to the program objectives. The M&E
specification of results (unemployment and exam scores) in the LogFrame that could not be
achieved during time period of the three tranches raises questions about the appropriateness
of a DPL, which is oriented to the short term. Otherwise, the quality at entry was thus
satisfactory.

5.33 Bank performance during supervision was moderately satisfactory. The Bank
assisted the government team during implementation to meet the conditions of tranche
release. The Bank was flexible in the final tranche release in August 2007, which was
delayed by the release of the Government report and fiscal difficulty in maintaining the level
of capitation grant. Some in the Bank argued that the condition on the adequate size of the
capitation grant should not have been waived, because it was the result of allowing
enrollments to expand beyond the agreed medium term scenario, which the Bank supervision
team warned against. However, the Bank decided in the end to support the request for
waiver and argued in the Memorandum to the Board that the Government had made progress
on all other conditions except for the capitation grant, which turned out to be about 68
percent of the agreed amount. The IDA Board agreed by granting the waiver of that
condition. This raises the question of maintaining elements of policy after tranches are
released since enrollment continued to rise faster than the medium term scenario in 2007 and
2008. However, all other conditions were met and supervision was also well coordinated
with other DPs and stakeholders and the Bank participated in the annual education sector
reviews.

       PERFORMANCE
BORROWER

5.34 Overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Government
performance was moderately satisfactory. Realizing the need to provide more secondary
education access after the success of PEDP, there was a strong commitment to proceed
quickly on the part of the Government. However, near the end of SEDP the Government
found it difficult to fully fund the secondary school capitation grants due to the rapid
expansion of enrollment. There was also a delay in preparing the third tranche release report.
On the whole, the Government met almost all of the conditions of tranche release, a partial
waiver being granted by the IDA board for the third tranche.

5.35 The performance of the MOEC and RALG as implementing agencies was
moderately satisfactory. Due to this strong commitment and vigorous promotion by
national and regional ruling party officials, the medium scenario quantitative targets agreed
in the LDP were exceeded as the promotion campaign and community driven demand led to
rapid construction of classrooms and expansion of enrollment. The MOEC prepared
guidelines for school to carry manage grants and carry out their new responsibilities.
However, the commitment of the MOEC to provide teachers and textbooks was not able to
keep up with the pace of infrastructure expansion.

MONITORING EVALUATION
         AND

5.36 M&E quality is rated modest. The design of M&E is modest as there was no
specific activity other than monitoring the indicators of the LogFrame. The Program
Document indicated that the Form 4 exam score indicators dealing with quality were longer
term and no impact was expected within the three years of the IDA credits. More attention
could have been paid as to how national exam scores could be used in conjunction with
measurement of quality of outputs and inputs.

5.37 Implementation of M&E was modest. Indicators with respect to enrollment and
learning were tracked every year. The LogFrame mentions that the MOEC would monitor the
unemployment situation of secondary school leaven, acknowledging this as a long term
indicator. The mission did not find evidence that unemployment or the labor market in
general was monitored in a systematic way. The Letter of Development Policy also
committed the Government to monitoring long-term indicators in the labor market.

5.38 Utilization of M&E results was substantial. Enrollment and learning data were
shared and widely discussed at the annual reviews of performance with all stakeholders.
These discussions contributed to ownership of SEDP by all stakeholders. The Government
and MOEVT have been slow to respond to issues of declining quality as a result of rapid
expansion, although now they are putting attention on that problem.

6. Lessons and Perspectives
6.1      Looking back over education policy, in content and implementation, it can be seen
how the Education Sector Development Program (200 1) has provided a coherent policy
framework for these three education projects in Tanzania. The Human Resources
Development Project successfully piloted school grants and scholarships for girls, but also
demonstrated that traditional project implementation units remain isolated in their overall
impact on government structures. A broader programmatic approach involving Government
and DP cooperation was needed to make rapid progress in primary education. With respect
to primary education, the ESDP aimed at rapidly expanding primary education to the point of
achieving universal primary education while maintaining standards of learning achievement.
This policy objective was largely successful, but maintaining it will still take both fiscal and
managerial effort. With respect to secondary education, the policy aim was to expand the
relatively small sub-sector substantially (from 10 percent GSER in 2003 to 30 percent in
2007), although it was acknowledged that universal secondary education was not feasible.
As in the case of primary education, the aim was to improve quality of learning via
investments, such as the capitation and development grants to be managed by the schools.
These policies, as well as the development policy lending instruments used by the Bank,
were appropriate and supported the overall country assistance strategy, especially the third
pillar regarding quality of life and delivery of social services. The secondary policy aims
exceeded their quantitative targets of enrollment, resulting in fiscal pressure that reduced
investment in quality. Reforms of curricula, examinations, governance and management
were key features of both primary and secondary education policy, in particular, promoting
decentralization and more school/community participation in school management.

6.2      Looking forward, a new Education Sector Development Program 2008-2017 was
prepared in August 2008 to provide future policy guidance. The new ESDP continues the
former policy priorities, which were along the right lines and received donor support. The
new ESDP examines the remaining major challenges, particularly upgrading infrastructure to
facilitate expansion of enrollment without lowering academic standards. More emphasis is
given to performance-oriented outcomes. The new ESDP is also ambitious and
comprehensive in that it covers from pre-school to university as well as non-formal adult and
folk education.

6.3     Financing this comprehensive policy is recognized in the new ESDP as a major
challenge and is based upon five fiscal assumptions: (1) low inflation (3.5 to 4.5 percent); (2)
continued real economic growth of 6 to 8 percent; (3) government budget allocation to
education of about 22 percent; (4) government revenue collection averaging about 16 percent
of GDP; and (5) increased donor support of about 20 percent above 2006/07 levels in real
terms. These assumptions were drawn up prior to the current global financial crisis and their
realism needs to be analyzed again. Fiscal sustainability is thus a major issue for education
policy and is an appropriate place to begin lessons from these projects.

6.4    Fiscal sustainability of rapid expansion of secondary education needs to be re-
assessed carefully within the realistic economic context of limited fiscal resources and
competing needs of other education sub-sectors, The unprecedented rate of expansion of
                                                        36


community secondary schools is putting extreme pressure on the education and overall
budget, especially if per student resources are to be maintained at the level of the original
SEDP design. In recent years the government responded by reducing the per student
resources, which in turn compromises the quality objectives of SEDP (although a better job
was done in PEDP with respect to fiscal sustainability and maintaining basic quality). This
was recognized as a risk in the SEDP Program Document, even under the less ambitious
medium growth scenario for enrollment expansion. Thus, although the unit cost of
secondary education is relatively low in Tanzania, the rapid expansion of enrollment has
caused a corresponding rapid increase in public spending on education, from 4 percent of
GDP in 2006 to 5.4 percent in 2007. Given the rapid rise in the numbers of teachers and
need for learning materials, the education share of recurrent expenditure has increased from
18 to 27 percent from 2006-2008.

6.5     Taking primary and secondary expansion together presents an even more daunting
fiscal challenge. The usual education projection models based upon demographic
projections, pupil-teacher ratios, derived teacher demands, average teacher salaries, and
pupil-textbook ratios were used in the preparation of PDEP and SEDP and can be used with
some updating and further refinement. Pupil-teacher ratios are still relatively high (roughly
50: 1 for primary and approaching 40: 1 for secondary) and quality enhancement calls for their
reduction, increasing unit cost further. Adding the results for each subsector, in 20 10 the
education sector is projected to absorb an estimated 7.2 percent of GDP or 40 percent of the
total recurrent budget. This scenario is clearly untenable and thus more trade-offs must be
considered.12 Finding the financial resources to complete the job of building quality into this
expanded system is an enormous challenge to be resolved by the government and
development partners.

6.6     A mix of lending instruments can be used in a complementary and mutually
reinforcing way to support sector objectives. PEDP was the Bank's first policy adjustment
credit used in the education sector in Tanzania; the previous projects being standard
investment credits with a record of slow disbursement. After getting used to the new quick
disbursement of DPLs in tranches, most people interviewed, especially in the government,
expressed a marked preference for this approach. However, the issue of sustainability with
quick disbursing policy instruments comes to the fore in long-run education programs that
take time to mature and evaluate. For example, in SEDP the rapid expansion of enrollment
continued after the last tranche and the Bank had less influence in terms of conditionality.
On the other hand, some officials felt that support spanning a longer term than what is typical
of short term of policy credits is needed, which would argue for something like an APL
spanning ten years or so. That would give time to see if exam scores or other assessments of
quality show results and provide TA if needed. It is essential also that this longer term
commitment of support be associated with a long-term vision for the sector agreed upon by

l 2 See Jones, Gershberg, and Kweka 2008. Verspoor and others (2008) also takes up these issues in an Africa
wide context. Interestingly, SEDP was cited by the latter as an interesting example of a DPL approach in
support of secondary education (see Verspoor and others 2008, BoxlO.1). However, given the evidence thus
far, SEDP went off track when it failed to control the rate of expansion. A follow-up secondary education
project is likely to focus on consolidating the quantitative gains with measures to improve quality, particularly
teachers, textbooks, and affordable science labs.
                                          37


the government and DPs, which was the case during the past decade but needs to be updated.
Finding the proper balance among DPLs, APLs, and SICS is a critical issue for the Bank,
other DPs and the government, requiring an open and frank dialogue on the pros and cons of
various lending instruments vis-a-vis the long term vision for the education sector. No
matter what instrument is chosen, the lesson of isolated project implementation units that
have limited institutional impact and experienced slow disbursement should be taken into
account in the design of implementation arrangements.

6.7     Rapid expansion of secondary education is more complex and difficult than
rapidly expanding primary education. A rapid expansion of secondary education is
much more complex than a similar reform for primary education. One reason is that
secondary education systems are more complex with subject specialties requiring efficient
matching of student class streams and teachers. Simple pupil-teacher ratios cannot be used in
planning secondary expansion in the way they are for primary. As one head teacher
remarked to the mission, "They keep sending me arts teachers when it is science and
mathematics that I need." Secondly, this expansion is undertaken in an environment of
teacher shortages and lack of capacity to develop teachers of appropriate qualifications
rapidly. Hence, the system is forced to resort to crash programs such as licensing Form 6
leavers and relying heavily on in-service teacher development, which is not always adequate.
The third complexity is that curriculum, textbooks, and examinations are being reformed
simultaneously. Even teachers of appropriate university qualification would be hard pressed
to adapt to the new curriculum requiring competency-based pedagogy after years of working
in an environment of old-style rote methods. Fourthly, the management challenge inherent in
such a rapid expansion and reform simultaneously would tax even the most capable systems
of education.

6.8      Perhaps it is time to slow down the rate of expansion and consolidate what has been
achieved quantitatively in the way of infrastructure. Teachers are the key resource at the
front line of education delivery. Resources and management of the system need to focus on
their professional development and provision of complementary teaching/learning resources
to go with that. In the end, it is the development of the students that form the purpose of the
education enterprise, but professional teachers and administrators are distinguished by their
deep understanding of that truth.

6.9      Decentralization with schoolkommunity based management under the overall
government decentralization pursued in Tanzania appears to have had a beneficial
impact on community enthusiasm and participation, but further evaluation is needed
about impact on efficacy and efficiency. There is much room for improvement and further
research and evaluation to study what dimensions would most benefit from improvements. A
design study comparing districts, or some other form of control groups among districts, could
shed light upon improvements, especially if the evaluation results are factored into further
training and capacity building. A set of clear and relevant hypotheses needs to be formulated
for testing so as to try to link improvement in learning with important attributes of
decentralization. For example, is it the school/community participation itself that could
improve.learning or is it the additional resources via the grants managed by the
school/community?
                                               38


6.10 The labor market situation warrants closer and careful monitoring as the supply               .
of secondary school leavers is increasing. One of the over-arching objectives of SEDP is
the development of an adaptable labor force needed for economic growth and technological
progress. Given Tanzania's very low rate of enrollment of secondary school-age population
the expansion of primary enrollment at the time of preparation of SEDP, expansion of
secondary education seemed warranted. Unemployment of secondary school leavers was not
considered to be a major risk. However, many observers, especially those in the private
sector, now view this as a potentially serious problem, in light of the rapid expansion of
relatively low quality community secondary schools. A number of recent studies indicate
that secondary school leavers increasingly must find employment in the informal sector (see
Kondylis and Manacorda 2006 and Ruggeri 2009).

6.1 1 In the past, secondary school leavers did not remain in agriculture or the non-
agriculture rural economy. They usually migrated to the towns and pursued modern wage
sector jobs. Now many of them are forced to also pursue informal urban self-employment, or
many remain at home until they can find a job. Some may be forced to remain in the rural
economy, which may offer the potential for increasedproductiviv there ifthe quality of
cognitive skills from secondary education is improved and other complementary economic
and labor market policies are pursued. A few people interviewed believed that expansion of
secondary education also would help transform traditional agriculture. While research has
shown that primary school level cognitive skills increase agricultural productivity, there is
not a great deal of research on what added value comes from secondary education in
agriculture in developing co~ntries'~. Thus, careful monitoring of the labor market for
secondary school leavers is needed to detect shifts in conditions that may require rapid and
effective policy response.

6.12 Careful consideration needs to be given to English language issues and
improving its teaching at both primary and secondary levels in its relation to jobs and
the economy. Related to academic achievement and the labor market is the sensitive
question of English in the secondary school curriculum. Most private sector employers see
English as a practical communications skill needed in business. Some even report that
Tanzanians lose out on job opportunities due to lack of fluency in English communication,
even though the secondary school curriculum is officially taught in English. While
recognizing that Kiswahili is the national language and has priority in the cultural heritage of
the nation, private employers assert that English can still be taught well if given sufficient
resources and qualified teachers. In theory, students start studying English in the early
grades of primary and even get an intensive foundation course in the first semester of Form
1, so that they should be ready to study in English. In practice, this does not happen often
enough. On the other side of this issue are those who call for teaching and learning in
Kiswahili in secondary schools. These advocates believe that students would master the
curriculum better if it is taught in the language they know best. However, since English is
the language of instruction at the university level, this approach would also have to decide
about the transition there. Other countries have faced this issue of balancing national
language versus international ones, and the key to resolving it is providing sufficient

                                             39


resources under a well-managed language program to train teachers so that both languages
are mastered at the required level.

6.13 Given Tanzania's resource situation as a low income country, difficult tradeoffs
need to be examined. Expansion of secondary education needs to be accompanied with
attention to quality of education. As noted in paragraph 4.12, much of the rapid expansion
in secondary education is due to strong community demand. Nonetheless, the theme of
setting priorities to focus on quality runs through much of the above. IEG's Primary
Education Evaluation (2006) pointed out the importance of education quality as the basis for
improving learning achievement in primary education. While there has been no comparable
evaluation of secondary education, a number of research studies in recent years present
evidence from various countries that quality of secondary education is critical to obtain the
                                                             ~
economic benefits of growth and poverty r e d ~ c t i o n . 'Based on interviews and review of
recent documents such as the Education Sector Performance reports, Tanzanian policymakers
recognize this. In fact, the new Education Sector Development Program (2008-2017)
actually projects reducing the rate of growth of Form 1 intake from 32 percent in 2009 to 2
percent by 2014 (see new Education Sector Development Program 2008-201 7, Annex F,
p.66). This would allow the lower secondary system to allocate more resources to quality
while expanding the size of the system at a moderate rate. The recently approved Adaptable
Program Loan (May 2010) in support of SEDP2 also recognizes these issues and aims to
provide a minimum package of quality inputs. Even with significant increases in domestic
budget and DP support, there will not be enough finance for all of the worthwhile goals in the
new ESDP. The challenge will be maintaining the political and fiscal discipline to focus on
quality while also satisfying strong community demand for expansion with limited fiscal
resources.

Note: Except for CEF component, appraisals and actual are identical. The note in the ICR attributes this to
exchange rate movements within the basket of currencies comprising SDRs. This does not seem plausible since
only CEF is affected. The ICR also reported a cancellation of a small undisbursed amount after closure.
Despite these small anomalies, the above table is likely a reasonable estimate of the financial inputs for the
project.
