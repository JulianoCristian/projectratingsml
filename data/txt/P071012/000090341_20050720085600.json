Lessons learned: budget\n            support in a SWAp for a sub-education sector can be\n            effective in enabling the government to develop and take\n            charge of the consultative process for ongoing policy\n            making, system reform, planning, and budgeting in the\n            education sector. Too many varied requirements for pooled\n            fund disbursements can cause delay. Tranche releases should\n            be aligned to Government's fiscal year and appropriate\n            timing in disbursements. Phased-out approach in expanding\n            primary enrollment can mitigate risks in over loading\n            capacity and declining quality. Decentralization of delivery\n            of primary education services to the local authority and\n            school committees is the way to go. Closer and stronger\n            linkages among various education academic institutions are needed."}, "docdt": "2005-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
