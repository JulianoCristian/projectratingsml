Country and Sector Background
Over the past four years, the United Republic of Tanzania (Tanzania)
intensified macroeconomic policy reforms with the aim of creating a more



stable macroeconomic environment. As a result, Tanzania has progressed
significantly in reestablishing macroeconomic stability. Inflation has fallen
from levels in excess of 30 percent in 1995 to single digits at 5.0 percent
in 2001; the exchange rate remained reasonably stable for the 18 months prior
to the recent 15-percent depreciation. Official external reserves increased
from about 1.6 months of imports of goods and non-factor services in 1995 to
5.1 months of goods and non-factor services in 2001. The overall fiscal
balance, including grants, has had a surplus of between 0.2 percent and 1.6
percent of GDP from 1998 to 2000. The deficit to GDP outturn (excluding
grants) was 2.6 to 5.8 percent between 1998 to 2000. In the medium term,
however, this improvement will need to be grounded in a strong fiscal system
to ensure sustained macro-stability.
Overall, the education system in Tanzania performs far below what is required
to meet its development needs. Poor education quality, low access and
retention in primary schools are primarily due to insufficient school inputs,
resulting in low graduation rates from the system. These issues are further
linked to inadequate public funding of the sector, thus high and unaffordable
costs imposed on households. At the secondary level, limited public
provision, together with increased demand results in expanded private
provision and high costs. Increasing public financing of the education
sector is therefore essential for improving sector performance to enhance
education quality and to expand enrollment coverage.
Objectives and description
The proposed credit is to support Tanzania to reform its primary education
system through the Primary Education Development Program (PEDP). The
objectives of the PEDP are: to improve education quality, expand school
access, and increase school retention at the primary level. The objectives
would be achieved through measures to increase and improve resource
availability, allocation and utilization; to improve educational inputs; and
to strengthen institutional arrangements for effective primary education
delivery. The PEDP would include (a) introduction of capitation and
development grants for primary schools; (b) further development of
educational inputs; and (c) institutional capacity building at central,
district, and school levels for efficient operation of primary education
system.
Financing                        ( US$ million):
Proposed IDA Credit      150
Total Program Cost:      977
An adequate amount of Tanzanian funds to finance the program in 2002 has been
included in the recently approved government budget. The budgetary increases
particularly reflect the priorities given to the improvement of primary
education delivery by local authorities. Total PEDP cost is estimated at 977
million US dollars for fiscal year 2002 to 2004. The projections indicate
that external resource requirements would be reduced to zero in 2012 as
domestic revenue grows mainly due to economic growth. However, 427 million
US dollars of external resources would be needed between FY2005 and 2012.
The Bank would provide some of these resources through the proposed IDA
Credit of US$ 150 million. Other donors such as DfID, EU, Netherlands, SIDA,
JICA, Ireland Aid, CIDA, have contributed to an adequate resource pool for
PEDP for FY 2002. Given the Government's and donor commitments to the
development of primary education, adequate resources to ensure a sustainable
path for further development of the sub-sector is assured till 2012.

Implementation arrangements
A program Coordination Committee will spearhead and coordinate the
implementation of PEDP. The Permanent Secretary, Prime Minister's Office
(PMO), chairs the Committee. A Basic Education Development Committee (BEDC),
which will be co-chaired by the Permanent Secretaries of MoEC and PO-RALG,
and will include a representative of the Permanent Secretary of MoF; the ESDP
Coordinators at MoEC and PO-RALG; and the representatives of all ESDP donors,
NGOs other stakeholders that are active in education, will oversee and
coordinate the mobilization, disbursement, use and accountability of
programme funds. This institutional mechanism will be reinforced by an annual
joint stakeholders (Government-donors-NGOs) review of the ESDP
implementation.
Benefits and risks
The major benefit of the operation is to produce more and better qualified
primary school graduates, to establish a solid foundation for building a much
strengthened labor force to support the overall development efforts of
Tanzania. In addition, decentralized education management will lead to more
effective service delivery with greater involvement of schools and
communities.
The overall program risk rating is not high given the government's long-term
commitment to the sector and institutional development, particularly with the
Prime Minister's Office's oversight of the program. Major risks include: (a)
Weak coordination between Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) and
Regional Administration and Local Governments (PO-RALG); (b) Primary school
enrollment may exceed program estimates and system capacity in the first
year; and (c) Insufficient capacity to manage primary education delivery at
the district level. In addition, although Tanzania is in the process of
establishing a sound system of formal rules for financial management, issues
of non compliance, limited execution, inadequate monitoring, insufficient
capacity and lack of enforcement constitute major risks in financial
accountability and management.
Poverty Reduction Intervention: Y
Environment category: C
The proposed IDA credit will support, among other things, increased access to
primary education on an equitable basis. This will require rehabilitation and
construction of schools and classrooms, as well as provision of water supply
and sanitary facilities. Public school places would especially be expanded
in rural areas and in poor or remote communities unable to provide their own
schools or attract private schools. In order to ensure that the construction
of these schools and related facilities under PEDP will not incur negative
environmental and social impacts, environmental guidelines will be included
in the project operational manual. In addition, terms of reference
incorporating these guidelines will be provided to each district,
school/community and executing agency if applicable before construction
begins.
