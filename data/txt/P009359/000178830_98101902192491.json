Following appraisal and acceptance of a project,\n            BSIC also insures, in conjunction with a consortium of local\n            commercial banks, long-term finance of up to 70 percent of\n            total project cost and gives advice in design, procurement,\n            installation and start-up. BSIC does not borrow and relend\n            the proceeds of the credit. The credit provides the foreign\n            exchange required to import equipment for the projects and\n            to finance the services of a consultant who assists BSIC in\n            carrying out the program."}, "docdt": "1972-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
