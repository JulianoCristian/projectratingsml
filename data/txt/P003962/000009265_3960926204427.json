Government during 1987, and to assist in bringing about an\n            early recovery in economic activity consistent with external\n            and domestic financial stability. The project also plans to\n            maintain the policy dialogue on further reforms, including\n            the preparation of a medium term plan for tariff\n            rationalization. The loan intends to finance general imports\n            of goods to meet part of the country's near term\n            foreign exchange requirements, while supporting the\n            Government's commitment to promote the efficiency and\n            long term viability of the economy."}, "docdt": "1988-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
