MEMORANDUM AND NECOMENDATIOI
OF TEE PRESIDENT OF
TEE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PIOPOSED CRSDIT
TO THE REPUIC 0  MALAW
FOR AN ENERGY I PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Malawi for SDR 34.8 million (US$46.7
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity. It would help finance a
project to expand Malawi's electricity supply system and to foster
sustainable exploitation of the country's wood energy resources. The
project would be cofinanced by the Austrian Government through a US$17.6
million loan (235 million Austrian Schillings).
2.        Background.  Malawi had a population of 8.0 million and a per
capita GDP of US$170 in 1987. The economy is predominantly rural, with
some 89Z of the population living in rural areas. Per capita energy
consumption was 0.36 toe equivalent, which is one of the lowest in Africa.
The predomninant source of energy is fuelwood, which together with
agricultural residue accounts for 93.7? of total final energy consumption.
Imported petroleum accounts for 3.9?, electricity 1.41, coal 0.8? and
ethanol 0.2?. Almost all electricity supply is from hydro plants, but only
about 16? of the nation's-estimated hydro potential has been tapped so far.
Maximum power demand in 1987 was 97.2MW.  Access to electricity is low at
about 2?. Malawi's relatively high forestrr.cover of about 382 is
dwindling at about 3.52 per year. The main energy issues facing Malawi
ares the high investment cost of meeting growing power demands the
instability of petroleum supplies because of constraints on Malawi's main
transport routest and the depletion of forestry resources in the south of
the country due to heavy demands from households (including an estimated
600,000 refugees) and industry. Weaknesses in Government planning
capability is a further problem, compounded by institutional weaknesses
particularly in the Department of Forestry. Whereas pricing policies for
petroleum fuels and power have generally been sound, relative pricing of
fuels such as ethanol, coal and charcoal warrant further scrutiny. The
Government's strategy to deal with these problems includes (i) undertaking
an economic study of future power supply options (completed); (2)
introducing energy conservation measures in the tobacco industry and
household sector; (3) developing commercial charcoaling operation based on
forest thinnings; and (4) making further use of domestic coal resources.
The Bank/IDA has helped finance three power projects in Malawi and has a
good and constructive relationship with the Electricity Supply Commission
of Malawi (ESCOM). Assistance to the sector has been complemented by two
projects in wood energy as well as through technical assistance and
studies. However, in view of the deterioration in Malawi's external debt
situation, the Government is no longer able to continue financing the Wood
Energy II Project (Loan 2670-WI) under IBRD terms, and withdrawals from
the loan have ceased. At the Government's request the IBRD loan has been
cancelled and the balance of the project will be financed under the IDA
Credit for Energy I.
3         Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project will make a
significant contribution to achieving greater efficiency in the supply and
utilization of energy, which is an imr rtant element of the overall
structural adjustment program that Maldwi is implementing with IMP and Bank
support. By helping to finance this project IDA can seek to ensure that a



comprehensive and least cost approach is used for the development of the
energy sector and that the actions of several other donors involved in the
sector are adequately coordinated. In addition, by building on the results
of recent IDA projects and pilot programs, continued IDA involvement can
facilitate more efficient utilization of Malawi's wood energy resources,
the strengthening of energy planning and the building up of institutions
sector wide.
4.        ProJect Objectives.  The purpose of the proposed project is to
assist the Government of Malawi to formulate and implement an integrated
program to make efficient use of domestic and imported energy resources.
Specific aims are to: (i) help implement several high priority components
of the least cost power development plan; (ii) help implement a
comprehensive strategy for the exploitation of wood fuels on a cost
effective and environmentally sustainable basis; (iii) ensure prices of
energy fuels reflect full economic costs of supply; and (iv) strengthen
institutions involved in energy planning and management and improve liaison
and coordination between them.
5.        Project Description.  The power component of the project
(US$61.8 million) would comprise: (i) civil works and equipment for
constructing a 50 MW hydroelectric power plant at Tedzani using an existing
dam; (ii) rehabilitating existing generating capacity to maintain system
efficiency; and (iii) providing consultancy services for studies and
technical supervision. The energy component (US$16.5) will take over and
extend the wood fuel program started under the Wood Energy II project
which comprises nurseries, tree plantations. forest management and woodfuel
conservation. The project activities have been reappraised and some
changes introduced in the light of experience. Some 3000 hectares of
Government plantation have been deleted from the project and greater
emphasis given to smallholder treeplanting. The component also includes
provision of consultancy and acquisition of vehicles and equipment to
expand charcoal production and stimulate private :ector involvement in
charcoal distribution and marketing. It also includes technical assistance
and training to upgrade the capabilities of the principal Government
departments and institutions concerned with the energy sector.  The total
project cost is estimated at US$78.3 million equivalent (excluding interest
during construction), with a foreign exchange component of US$59.9 million.
For the power component the Government would on-lend to ESCOM US$31.9
million from the Credit for a period of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace, at 7.651 (current IBRD interest rate). The remaining US$14.8
million would be used by the Government for the woodfuel subcomponents,
technical assistance and training and energy pricing studies. A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts, methods
of procurement, and the allocation and disbursement of the IDA Credit are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Malawi are shown in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7476-MAI
is also attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following main
actions: (i) Government and ESCOM will take tariff and other measures to
enable ESCOM to generate sufficient revenues to be able to finance at least
301 of its investment program; (ii) ESCOM will maintain a debt-service
coverage ratio of at least 1.5; (iii) Government and ESCOM will review
annually with IDA ESCOM's updated power sector investment p..ogram and will
conclude an agreement for financing a 132kV transmission line from Nkula



- 3 -
power plant to Lilongwe by December 31, 1989; (iv) Government will make
regular increases in stumpage rates so as to reach a full recovery stumpage
rate by the December 31, 1994; (v) Government will enable the Forestry
Department to make suitable incentive payments to smallholders to encourage
them to plant small woodlots; (vi) Government and IDA will undertake a
joint review of the wood energy component half way through the projected
implementation period.
7.        Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (a) meeting growing power demand at minimum cost through
investments in rehabilitation and new generating capacity; (b) increases in
private wood production; (c) conversion of forest thinnings (now waste) to
charcoal ior commercial sale; (d) introduction of improved charcoal
production and marketing techniques and more fuel efficient methods in
tobacco curing. The project would also strengthen energy planning and
management and would help make the pricing of alternative fuels better
reflect economic supply costs. The economic rate of return for the power
component is estimated at about 11Z. The charcoal and wood production
components have rates of return of 18? and 142 - 19.5Z respectively.
8.        Risks.  The Tedzani civil works involve construction of a short
tunnel. To minimize risk, confirmatory drillings would be carried out to
suspected fault zones of the tunnel route and at the power house site.
There would be no significant effect on the quantity or the quality of
water discharged from Tedzani power plant into the Shire river which flows
into Mozambique, and the Government of Mozambique has communicated its no
objection to the development of Tedzani. Because of the long gestation
period of hydroelectric power investments there is risk that new capacity
could be brought on stream too early or too late if demand forecasts prove
inaccurate.  Both such eventualities can be costly,  In the case of Malawi,
forecasting uncertainties have been increased by the situation in Southern
Africa. Accordingly, the power development program is being designed to
permit flexibility to respond to demand through phasing of generators. The
risk of energy deficits following probable prolonged consecutive dry years
would be mitigated through the contingent plan of.dredging the entry
channel from Lake Malawi to the Shire river. The wood energy component
involves simultaneous implementation of a wide array of policy measures and
programs and will pose some implementation difficulties for the Forestry
Department. These difficulties would be overcome through strengthening of
the Forestry Department and the Energy Planning Unit which, together with
IDA supervision missions, would review progress and provide timely advice
on corrective measures.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
