This\n            project has three components their are Power, Charcoal and\n            Wood Energy to Strengthening the planning, monitoring and\n            evaluation capabilities of the Forestry Department,\n            encouraging commercialization and privatisation of softwood\n            charcoal operations, and supporting extension services to\n            disseminate knowhow and best practices, are essential to put\n            into effect."}, "docdt": "1996-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
