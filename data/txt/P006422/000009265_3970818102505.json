The project is rated satisfactory overall\n            because it achieved most of its objectives. This project has\n            produced many important lessons that should be directly\n            applicable to the design of similar environmental protection\n            and natural resource management projects in other states of\n            Brazil as well as in other Latin American countries. Key\n            lessons learned includes: 1) Predicting the demand for\n            credit proved difficult under the project, largely because\n            of economic uncertainty; 2) Concerning the development of\n            new protected areas, the project has clearly demonstrated\n            the importance of: (i) prioritizing area development, taking\n            into account local interest and participation, as well as\n            biodiversity/ecosystem representation; (ii) having fallback\n            options in the phasing of developments in new protected\n            areas so as not to be hamstrung by the inevitable\n            bureaucratic delays to the legal transfer of the land to the\n            state, required for works to begin; and (iii) preparing and\n            updating participatory management plans prior to initiating\n            developments in new parks; 3) This project clearly\n            demonstrates the value of mid-term reviews; 4) The\n            project's credit line suffered from an\n            over-concentration of borrowers; 5) The project has\n            demonstrated that project performance is highly dependent on\n            the quality of local management and the political weight it\n            carries; 6) The project has shown that high quality\n            technical assistance contributed greatly to implementation performance."}, "docdt": "1997-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
