all references to Cruzados shall be references to Cruzados Novos accordingly.
Paragraph (o) in its present form shall be deleted and replaced by the following 
new paragraph (o):
"IPC" means the official, monthly index of inflation as reflected by the 
Consumer Prices 
Index, Indice de Precos so Consumidor, currently published 
by Fundacao Instituto Brasileiro de 
Geografia e Estatistica;
 
Section 3.01 (c)
In Section 3.01 (c) paragraph (i) the words "the OTN value" shall ba deleted and
