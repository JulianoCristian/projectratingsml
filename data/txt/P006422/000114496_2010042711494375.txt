Dear Sirs:
Re:
BRAZIL - Minas Gerais Forestry Development Project -
(Loan 2895-BR)
Amendment to the Loan and Project Agreements
We refer to the Loan, Guarantee and Project Agreements dated September 30, 1988 
for the above-referenced Project entered into between the State of Minas Gerais (the 
Borrower) and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), the Federative 
Republic of Brazil (the Guarantor) and the Bank; and the Bank and the Banco de 
Desenvolvimento de Minas Gerais (BDMG), respectively.
In accordance with the request by the Secretary of Planning of the Borrower in a 
letter dated May 22, 1992, we are pleased to inform you that the Bank has agreed to 
amend the Loan and Project Agreements as follows:
1
Reduction of Physical Targets of Forest Plantation
 
The physical targets of forest plantations for industrial purposes will be 
lowered from 165,000 hectares to 87,000 hectares.  In consequence, in the Loan 
Agreement, Schedule 2, Part A "Credit", the
number 165,000 will be replaced by 87,000.
2
Sub-Borrowers' Audit Requirements
 
Concerning the Investment Enterprises, the audit of the accounts by an external 
auditor will be required only on a random basis for sub-borrowers receiving less than 
US$300,000 equivalent as of the
date of signing of the Sub-loan contract.  Consequently, in the Project Agreement, 
Schedule 1, Paragraph 5 (g) (iii), the words: ", except as provided in paragraph (iv) 
below," shall be added immediately following "The Investment Enterprise shall"; and 
immediately after Schedule 1, Paragraph 5 (g) (iii), the following shall be added:
"(iv)
Investment Enterprises which have received Sub-loans in an 
aggregate amount not 
exceeding the equivalent of US$300,000 
will be selected by the independent auditors 
referred to in Section 
Page  2
3.01 (b) (i) of and Paragraph 2(i) of Schedule 2 to this 
Agreement, in each fiscal year, on a random basis, to (A) have their separate 
records and accounts for the Investment Project for such fiscal year 
audited, in 
accordance with appropriate auditing principles 
consistently applied, by 
independent auditors acceptable 
to the Bank; and (B) furnish to BDMG or the 
Participating Bank, 
as the case may be, not later than six months after the end of 
each 
year, certified copies of such accounts as so audited and the report of such 
audits by such auditors."
3
Inflation Index
 
Other monetary correction indices acceptable to the Bank may be substituted by 
the Guarantor for the present Taxa Referential. Paragraph (o) of Section 1.02 and 
paragraph (c) of Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement and paragraphs 1 (d) and 2 of 
Schedule 1 of the Project Agreement shall read, respectively, as follows:
Loan Agreement
Section 1.02 "(o) "TR" means Taxa Referencial the rate of interest established 
by Law No.8.177, dated March 1, 1991, calculated in accordance with criteria 
determined by the Central Bank, from time
to time, or any other rate to be established by the Guarantor to substitute the TR, 
acceptable to the Bank;"
Section 3.01(c)
"(i) that the amounts made available to BDMG will be denominated in 
cruzeiros and adjusted 
in accordance with the variations of the TR; "the 
TR."
Project Agreement
Schedule 1
"(d) Adjustment of principal
The outstanding principal amount of each Sub-loan will be adjusted monthly on 
the basis of the variations of the TR to provide for full monetary correction of such 
principal amounts."  
"2. BDMG shall, not later than October 30 each year, review with the Bank 
the onlending
terms and conditions referred to in paragraph 1 above, including the application 
of the 
variations of the TR value as the basis for adjustment for 
full monetary correction.  If, by 
November 30 of such year, the Bank, the 
Borrower and BDMG shall not have reached an agreement on 
the onlending terms to be 
applied to new Sub-loans, the Bank may refrain from approving or 
authorizing 
new Sub-loans pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Schedule."
4
Financing by the Bank of Vehicles and Computer Equipment
 
In the Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, Category (2) "Goods", the words: "other than 
vehicles and micro-computers" which are in parentheses are deleted; and,
5
Reallocation of Loan Proceeds
 
The priority which will be given to small-scale reforestation, training by 
consultants, and rehabilitation of State parks, will require an increase in the 
amounts allocated to Category 2 "Goods"
(from US$1,400,000 to US$1,700,000), Category 4 "Consultants Services" (from 
US$200,000 to US$500,000) and Category 5 "Civil Works" (from US$100,000 to 
US$1,500,000), totalling US$2,000,000, all of which will be transferred from Category 
6 "Unallocated," which will be reduced to US$2,800,000.  Consequently, the table set 
forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement will be amended to read as 
follows:

                                              of $5,000,000; and (c)
