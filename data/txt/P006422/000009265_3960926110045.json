Minas Gerais Forestry Development\n            Project aims to increase industrial wood production, reduce\n            degradation of the native forests, and improve environmental\n            protection.  To that end, the project aims to finance:  (a)\n            the establishment of up to 165,000 ha of forest plantations\n            and the building of charcoal manufacturing kilns and related\n            infrastructure through a line of credit; (b) the planting of\n            about 40,000 ha of woodlots on small and medium-sized farms;\n            and (c) staff, equipment and consulting services for\n            forestry conservation.  Finally, the project seeks to\n            provide (d) institutional development to strengthen the\n            State Forestry Institute (IEC); and (e) project evaluation."}, "docdt": "1987-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
