SCHEDULE 1 
1.
Terms and conditions of lending operations:
 
(a)
Amount of Sub-loans
 
Each Sub-loan may finance up to 80% of the estimated cost (including planting 
and maintenance costs and excluding the cost of land) of  the Investment Project, 
provided, however, that the percentage of the estimated cost of the Investment Project 
to be financed by any given Sub-loan shall be lower than 80 if such reduction is 
necessary to ensure that the aggregate amount of Sub-loans (including the Sub-loan in 
question) for which BDMG and the Participating Banks have entered into contracts shall 
not exceed, on the date of entering into the contract for the Sub-loan in question, 
50% of the estimated aggregate cost of the corresponding Investment Projects. The 
balance between the amount of the Sub-loan and the cost of the Investment Project, 
shall be financed by the Investment Enterprise from other sources, including an amount 
of not less than 20% from its own resources. The 20% amount to be financed by the 
Investment Enterprise shall not include any FISET funds and in no event the percentage  
of FISET funds in the financing of an Investment Project shall exceed 30% of the cost 
of such Investment Project.
(b)
Repayment Period
 
The repayment period will not exceed: (i) fourteen years, including a  grace 
period not to exceed seven years, for the financing of forest  plantations for the 
production of fuelwood, charcoal, pulp wood and other  wood products; and (ii) four 
years, including a grace period not to exceed one year, for the financing of charcoal 
production equipment and related facilities.
(c)
Interest Rate
 
(i)
The Investment Enterprise shall pay interest on the principal 
amount of the 
Sub-loan withdrawn and outstanding at a rate 
per annum equal to up to two 
percentage points above 
the interest rate specified in Section 2.05 of the Loan 
Agreement.
(ii)
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) above, the actual 
interest 
applicable to Sub-loans shall not exceed: (A) 
10% per annum for Sub-loans made by 
BDMG or a Participating 
Bank before October 2, 1989; and (B) 11% per annum for 
Sub-loans made thereafter.
(d)
Adjustment of principal
 
The outstanding principal amount of each Sub-loan will be adjusted monthly on 
the basis of the variations of the OTN value, to provide for full monetary correction 
of such principal amounts.
Page  6
(e)
BDMG and the Participating Banks will appraise the Investment Enterprises 
and the Investment Project in accordance with the BDMG Criteria.
2.
BDMG shall, not later than October 30 each year, review with the Bank  the 
onlending terms and conditions referred to in paragraph 1 above,  Including the 
application of the variations of the OTN value as the basis  for adjustment for full 
monetary correction. If, by November 30 of such  year, the Bank, the Borrower and BDMG 
shall not have reached an agreement on the onlending terms to be applied to new 
Sub-loans, the Bank may refrain from approving or authorizing new Sub-loans pursuant 
to paragraph 3 of this Schedule.
3.
Approval of Sub-loans:
 
No expenditures for goods or services required for an Investment Project shall 
be eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan unless:
(a)
the Sub-loan for such Investment Project shall have been approved by the 
Bank and such expenditures shall have been made not earlier than ninety days prior to 
the date on which the Bank shall have received the application and information 
required under paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule in respect of such Sub-loan; or
(b)
the Sub-loan is a free-limit Sub-loan for which the Bank has  authorized 
withdrawals from the Loan Account and such expenditures shall have been made not 
earlier than ninety days prior to the date on which the  Bank shall have received the 
request and information required under  paragraph 3 (b) of this Schedule in respect of 
such free-limit Sub-loan.
For the purposes of this Agreement, a free-limit Sub-loan shall be a Sub-loan 
for an Investment Project in an amount to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan 
which shall not exceed the sum of $4,000,000  equivalent, when added to any other 
outstanding amounts financed or proposed to be financed out of the proceeds of: (i) 
the Loan or (ii) any other loan, provided for in any outstanding loan agreement 
between the Bank and the Borrower or the Guarantor, which have been or are being used 
for financing goods and services directly and materially related to such Investment 
Project; provided, however, that the first two Sub-loans made under the  Project shall 
not be free-limit Sub-loans regardless of their amount.
