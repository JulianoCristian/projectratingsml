SUI.@ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Third Power Project of
Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE), an autonomous Government corpora-
tion responsible for electricity generation and transmission in Bolivia.
The Bolivian Government has applied for an IDA Credit of US$6.0 million to
meet the foreign exchange cost of the ENDE Project and also the cost of
consulting services for Direcci6n Nacional de Electricidad (DINE).
ii.       The main suppliers of electricity in Bolivia are ENDE, Bolivian
Power Company (BPC) and Corporaci6n Minera de Bolivia (COMIBOL), which
together supply.the bulk of all electric power in the country. During the
last decade, electricity generation in Bolivia grew at about 6.5% annually,
exceeding the rate of GDP growth; investment in the sector averaged US$11 million
per annum in 1965-1971.  Despite the considerable investment effort, average
annual per capita consumption of electricity remains very low at about 155 klW
which is the second lowest in South America.
iii.      The estimated cost of the ENDE Project is US$7.2 million equivalent,
with a foreign currency component of about US$5.9 million, which would be
financed from proceeds of the proposed Credit. The local cost will be
financed by internal cash generation. The ENDE III Project, which will be
completed by the end of 1975, includes two 8 Kg gas turbine units, 66 kV and
115 kV transmission lines, an office building, and consulting services for
interconnection and feasibility studies.
iv.       Procurement for the Project will be on the basis of international
competitive bidding for all equipment and work to be financed from the
proceeds of the proposed Credit. A domestic supplier of cables would
compete for orders and would be allowed a 15% margin of preference.
v.        Consultants would carry out the design and construction supervision
of the Project.
vi.       ENDE's current and forecast financial position and earnings are
satisfactory.
vii.      The Project is a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$6.0 million
equivalent to the Government of Bolivia, which will relend US$5.92 million
to ENDE at 7-1AL%, with a term of twenty years including three years of grace,
and will make available us$80,000 to DINE.

APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE EIECTRICIDAD
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of the Third Power Project of
the Empresa Nacional de Electricidad, S. A. (ENDE), an autonomous Govern-
ment corporation responsible for electricity generation and transmission
in Bolivia, except for La Paz.
1.02      In 1964, the Association made two simultaneous IDA Credits,
totaling US$15 million, to the Republic of Bolivia to help finance power
projects.  The first Credit of US$10.0 million, 61-30, was made available
by the Government as an equity contribution to the newly created ENDE to
help finance the Corani 27 MW hydroelectric plant and extension of other
facilities. The other Credit of US$5 million, 62-30, was relent by the
Government to the privately owned Bolivian Power Company (BPC) for the
construction of the 11 MW Chururaqui hydroelectric plant and system
improvements in La Paz and Oruro. Both projects have been completed
satisfactorily.
1.03      In 1969, the Association made a US$74. million Credit to Bolivia,
148-BO, the proceeds of which were relent by the Government to ENDE to
help finance the 36 MW Santa Isabel hydroelectric plant, extension of
other facilities, and consulting services. The project was completed in
August 1973, eighteen months late. The revised cost estimates show a
project cost of US$12.4 million as compared with the original estimate
of US$10.4 million.  The causes for the overruns are adverse geological
conditions in tunnelling and substantial wage increases which were granted
by the previous Government. ENDE will cover the Santa Isabel cost over-
runs with its own funds. With the present estimate the Santa Isabel
project is still the least cost alternative for meeting the load forecast
for discount rates up to about 18T; this compares favorably with the op-
portunity cost of capital in Bolivia.
1.04      The Bolivian Government has now applied for an IDA Credit of
US$6.00 million equivalent, US$5.92 million of which it would relend to
ENDE to meet the foreign exchange cost of the ENDE III power project
which is described below. The balance of US$80,000 would be made
available to DINE.   The local cost of the project will be financed by
internal cash generation.
1.05      The ENDE III Project will comprise two 8 MW gas turbines in
Santa Cruz, extension of transmission and substation facilities in Santa
Cruz and central_systems, an office building, and consulting services.
The estimated cost is US$7.2 million equivalent



-2-
1.06      The Government expects to request IDA's assistance in financing
a transmission and distribution project in La Paz after it has completed
arrangements for the purchase, by a Bolivian entity, of the Bolivian Power
Company. A credit for this project is expected to be presented to the
Executive Directors after the La Paz tariffs have been adjusted. The
Government has indicated that it will resolve the tariff issue no later
than August 31, 1974.
1.07      This report is based on the findings of a mission consisting
of Messrs. V. Nercissiantz and J. Cavallotti who visited Bolivia in June
and December of 1972 to prepare and appraise the above project.



2.  THE P0-VER SECTOR
General
2.01      Bolivia is a country of 1.1 million km2 and has an estimated popula-
tion of 5 million. About 70% of the population lives on the Altiplano, a high
and unhospitable plateau situated between the main and secondary chains of the
Andes mountains. Bolivia is the least developed country in South America. The
vast majority of its population is engaged in low-productive traditional agri-
culture. Only a small fraction of the labor force participates in enclave type
export activities in the fields of mining, petroleum, and more recently, cotton.
The economic and social infrastracture is still modest.
2.02      Since 1965, when the Bolivian economy  had fully recovered from the
disruptions which followed the 1952 revolution, economic performance has been
moderately satisfactory - with GDP growth in real terms averaging 4.6%
annually. A deterioration of the investment climate because of political
uncertainty contributed to a reduction in output growth to an average annual
rate of 2.8% in 1969-1971. Economic growth accelerated again in 1972 when
GDP increased by 6.4% in real terms.
2.03      To enhance future growth prospects, on October 27, 1972, the
Government launched a stabilization and development plan which included
devaluation of the peso from 12 to 20 pesos per US dollar. The plan's
objective is to strengthen public finances, to increase resource avail-
ability for public investment, and decrease unemployment, while preserving
internal stability and balance of payment viability.
The SectorL/
2.04      During the last decade, electricity generation grew at 6.5% annually,
exceeding the rate of GDP growth. Investment in the sector averaged US$11 million
per annum in 1965-71. Despite the considerable investment effort, average
annual per capita consumption of electricity remains at 155 kWh which is the
second lowest in South America.
2.05      There are approximately 170,000 connected consumers in Bolivia of
which 85% are residential consumers; more than two thirds of the Bolivian
population have no access to electricity. Distribution of electricity
consumption by consumer category in 1972 was as follows:
Category               Sales GWi            Percentage of Total
Mining                    331                          43

2.06      The country's three major producers of electricity are BPC, ENDE,
and the Corporacion Yinera de Bolivia (COMIBOL). The first two companies
supply to the public while COMIBOL generates electricity mainly to meet the
needs of its own mining operations. In addition to the three main producers,
there are some small private, municipal and cooperative utilities. Further-
more, other enterprises such as Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos
(YPFB), sugar mills, and some mining companies generate their own power. In
1972 installed capacity and annual generation were as follows:

2.07      BPC, a subsidiary of the Canadian International Power Company,
supplies eiTetricity to the city of La Paz and surrounding area from eight
hydroelectric plants in the Zongo Valley with an installed capacity of
88 MW (Annex 2).  In addition, the Cahua power plant with 26 MW capacity is
under construction and will be commissioned during the first quarter of 1974.
The transmission system between power plants and the La Paz area is presently
at 66 kV, part of which will be increased to 115 kV before 1977.
2.08      BPC also supplies bulk power to Oruro and its outskirts in the
central region through ELFE, the Oruro distribution company, from four
hydroelectric plants with an installed capacity of 20 MW located in the
Choquetanga Valley; power is transmitted at 66 kV. Since 1968, however,
ENDE has been responsible for all future expansion of generating facilities
in this area.
2.09      ENDE owns and operates the Corani hydroelectric plant (installed
capacity, 27 MW) in the central region and sells power in bulk to the
Empresa de Luz y Fuerza de Cochabamba (ELFEC), the Cochabamba distributing
Company, for distribution. ENDE also supplies some of COMIBOL's needs in
its mines at Oruro and Catavi. During the present year, ENDE's generating
capacity in the central region will be more than doubled when the 36 MW
Santa Isabel hydroelectric plant is commissioned in September.
g/ Includes generation for SEPSA in Potosi.



-5-
2.10      ENDE also has two diesel power plant in Santa Cruz: a newer one
with 13.2 MW installed that urgently needs additional capacity (paragraph 4.10)
and an older one (El Pari) containing several small diesel units totalling
3.3 MW. The El Pari diesel units are not presently in operation, but some
of the units (2.5 MW) will be reactivated this year. ENDE sells all of the
energy it generates in Santa Cruz to the Cooperativa Rural de Electrificacion
(CRE) for distribution in the area. Beginning in 1974 ENDE will serve Sucre
and Potosi in southern Bolivia where a 9 MW diesel power plant is presently
under construction together with a 100 kam single circuit 66 kV transmission
line to link the two cities.
2.11      COMIBOL, a Government-owned mining corporation, is the third major
producer of electric power and the principal Bolivian consumer which generates
its own electricity. It has hydroelectric and thermal generating installations
in the Oruro and Potosi areas with a combined installed capacity of 40 MW.
Some of the power needed by COMIBOL mines at Qruro and Catavi is supplied by
BPC and ENDE through a network which interconnects the three companies.
Similarly, COMIBOL supplies electricity to the public in Potosi through the
Servicios Electricos Potosi S.A. (SEPSA) until ENDE's generating facilities
for this region are commissioned in 1974.
Interconnection
2.12      At present, all of the various regional electrical systems described
above operate separately. Government plans, however, call for future inter-
connection of all regions with the connection between the La Paz and Central
systems scheduled for 1977. Prefeasibility studies carried out by Motor
Columbus of Switzerland and by ENDE in conjunction with the Empresa Nacional
de Electricidad of Chile (ENDESA), have shown that this interconnection would
be technically and economically justified. As a result of these studies, the
Direcci6n Nacional de Electricidad (DINE) by Resolution No. 010/72 of June 16,
1972, has required ENDE and BPC to proceed with the connection. DINE, ENDE
and BPC have agreed that ENDE would be responsible for planning, financing,
construction and operation of the interconnection (Annex 3).
2.13      The consultants who would be engaged under the proposed Credit (see
paragraph 4.02) to carry out the final study and design for the Interconnection,
should be required to investigate and propose appropriate arrangements for
pricing of interchanged electricity via the interconnection including a
satisfactory electricity supply contract between ENDE and BPC covering the
terms, conditions and arrangements for determining prices of interchanged
electricity.
Future Development
2.14      Selection of energy sources for future power development requires
attention. Although some progress has been made in identifying the abundant
hydroelectric reserves of the country, the use of this potential has not been
fully investigated. For the short run, the existing installations on the
Zongo and Corani rivers can be expanded. In addition, studies are being made



-6-
of other sites for future development, the most promising of which are:
(a) Molineros Project, located upstream on the Caine and Molineros river,
about 100 km southeast of Cochabamba, for a capacity of 104 MW and 490 GWh
of annual generation; and (b) Miguillas Project, on the Miguillas river,
downstream from BPC's Carabuco power plant in the Choquetanga valley, for
a capacity of 60 MW and 250 GWh of annual generation. The UNDP is consider-
ing a grant of about US$620,000 to ENDE to finance studies for the expansion
of the Bolivian power system between 1981 and 1990, and for an inventory of
Bolivia's hydroelectric resources.
2.15       In the long run, after the interconnection of the different
regions, fossil sources such as gatural gas (which could be supplied at
low prices, e.g., US$0.15 per 10° Btu in Santa Cruz) should be seriously
considered as an al.ternative for the production of electric energy.  The
country appears to have large deposits of petroleum and natural gas. Proven
reserves of crude are estimated at 181 million barrels or roughly 10 year's
production at current rates (18 million barrels per annum) and of natural
gas at 2.6 trillion cubic feet, roughly equivalent to fifty years output at
prevailing production levels (55 billion cubic feet p.a.). Moreover, it is
estimated that there are additional petroleum reserves approximately treble
of current proven reserves.  With the funds, made available to it under the
Credit, DINE will carry out a comparative study of the different energy
resources.
Rural Electrification
2.16       To assist Bolivia with. a program of rural electrification, USAID
is about to lend US$10.8 million to the Government for construction of
transmission and distribution facilities in the Departments of Cochabamba
and Santa Cruz. The loan as now proposed would cover both foreign and
local costs of the program. Proceeds of the proposed loan would be made
available through sub-loans to ELFEC and CRE, the distribution companies
servlng the Cochabamba and Santa Cruz areas respectively.  ENDE will provide
administrative assistance in coordination and supervision of the rural
electrification program during construction.
Tariffs
2.17       Electricity tariffs in Bolivia are regulated by DINE which admin-
isters the 1968 Electricity Code. The Code stipulates that electric utili-
ties shall earn a return of 9( calculated as an average for a period of
three to five years. The rate base is defined as average net fixed assets
in operation plus working capital (1/8 of the annual operating revenues)
and inventories (up to 3% of the gross fixed assets). The adequacy of tar-
iffs is reviewed annually by DINE and if the return expected for the fore-
cast period drops below 8.5% or exceeds 9.59%, tariffs have to be adjusted.
2.18       The average price of electricity to all consumers is about USA1.7
per kwlh, which is lower than in most other Latin American countries, but the
cost of electricity still represents about 4% of the average residential
consumers' income.



-7-
2.19       Except in Santa Cruz where the tariff to CRE is based on flat
energy charge, ENDE's tariffs to other bulk consumers are based on demand
and energy charges. DINE has indicated that it will revise ENDE's tariff
to CRE in Santa Cruz on the basis of separate charges for contracted
demand and for energy, in the near future. BPC's tariffs for industrial
and large commercial consumers are on the basis of energy and demand
charges but flat energy charges are applied to the rest of the consumers.
2.20       According to the Electricity Code, all taxes are to be recovered
by tariffs. ENDE is exempt from paying income taxes; it is subject to some
miscellaneous taxes such as generation taxes ($bO.0035 per kilowatt hour
of electricity generated). The October 1972 devaluation decree imposed a
national tax of 5% on the revaluation of net fixed assets, and a 20% tax
on revaluation of the foreign exchange holdings of public and private
enterprises. However, the Government has advised the Association that
the power companies would be exempted from these taxes.

3. THE BENEFICIARIES
ENDE
3.01      ENDE was established by the Bolivian Government in 1965 as an
autonomous Government utility.  ENDE's Articles of Incorporation fix its
authorized capital at us$40 million, divided into 40,000 shares with a
nominal value of US$1,000 each. The Articles authorize two types of shares:
(i) type "All non-dividend paying voting shares, and (ii) type "B" non-voting
shares on which dividends can be paid. Of this authorized capital, 15,000
"A" shares were subscribed in 1965 - one share each by COMIBOL and YPFB,
and the remainder by CBF. By 1970 all of the 15,000 "A" shares were fully
paid. Thereafter, the annual increases of capital have been made in "B"
shares; this capital is mainly held by CBF.
3.02      ENDE has a six-man Board of Directors.  The Minister of Energy
is ex-oficio the Chairman of the Board. Of the other five members who
are elected by the shareholders, three directors represent CBF, and one
director each represents COMIBOL and YPFB. All Board members serve four
years and are eligible for reelection.
3.03      The General Manager, the chief executive of the company, is
appointed by the Board and can only be removed for cause.  The present
General Manager who was appointed in 1972 is an experienced engineer and
competent executive.
3.04      According to Article 80 of Decreto Ley No. 10460 of September 15,
1972, the appointment of the General Managers of public enterprises such
as ENDE, would be made by the Ministers responsible for the respective
sectors with the approval of the President of the Republic. This conflicts
with ENDE's Estatutos, which leaves appointment of ENDE's General Manager
to ENDE's Board.  During the negotiations, the Government agreed that the
General Manager of ENDE would be appointed in accordance with the provisions
of_the Estatutos.
3.05      Since its establishment in 1965, the process of rapid growth
has caused the structuna of ENDE's organization to become distorted from
its initial plan. Moreover, continued growth will require basic modifications
in the structuxe t.o Plow ENDE to conduct its operations more efficiently.
Until recently, for example, the accounting and financial planning and
analysis furnctions were dispersed amongst several departments (with poor
inter-departmental communication) which resulted in a rather weak financial
management. Personnel management has also been deficient and needs to be
strengthened, particularly in defining job descriptions, operating procedures,
manpower planning, and wage/salary administration.
3.06      The company is aware of these problems. In fact, the present
General Manager has already introduced some organizational improvements.
Accounting and financial forecasting functions were recently reorganized
under one department, the new head of which is experienced both in



-9-
engineering and finance. In addition, ENDE has engaged a management
consulting firm, Middle West of Chicago, which has identified weaknesses
in ENDE's operating procedures and reporting practices, and has proposed
improvements. To assist ENDE further, the proposed Credit will also
include consulting services for implementation of improvements; IDA
approval of the Consultant's terms of reference should be required.
3.07      Despite the weaknesses mentioned in above paragraphs, ENDE
should be able to carry out the proposed project successfully, and at
the same time continue to serve its customers satisfactorily, as long
as a competent General Manager is in office. To assure this, an under-
taking similar to the one given under Credit 148-BO was obtained during
the negotiations to the effect that IDA would be consulted before appoint-
ments are made to the position of General Manager.
3.08      The staff of ENDE in December 1972 numbered 247 of whom 75
are professional staff. Installed capacity per employee is about 192 kW
rising to 394 kW by 1975. This is acceptable for ENDE which is primarily
a generating company.
3.09      ENDE's generating plant is well run and properly maintained,
and the quality of service is good.
DINE
3.10      DINE, a Government agency created by Supreme Decree No. 08283 in
February 1968, is responsible for regulating, auditing and coordinating
the activities of the electric power industry. An Electricity Code to
regulate the Bolivian power sector was prepared by DINE and promulgated
by Supreme Decree No. 08438 in July 1968. The regulations to the Elec-
tricity Code will be put into effect this year after consulting with the
Association.
3.11      DINE is now operating satisfactorily in coordinating the acti-
vities of the power sector and in preparing statistical data.  However,
it has shown some weakness in enforcing the Electricity Code, particularly
when the setting of new tariffs has been required.

4. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
ENDE's Five-Year Expansion Program
4.01      ENDE's 1973-1977 expansion program, estimated to cost $b672
million (US$33.6 million), (see Annex 4) consists of:
(a) completion of the Santa Isabel hydro power project
(Credit 148-BO) described in Appraisal Report No. PU-3a
dated April 8, 1969;
(b)  the proposed Third Power Project, described below;
(c) additions to generating capacity of one 8 MW gas
turbine at Santa Cruz (after the Third Power Project),
two 3.0 MW diesel units at Sucre and one 13.5 MW unit
at Corani hydro power plant;
(d) about 345 km of 115 kV interconnection line between
Sacaba, Oruro (central system) and La Paz (northern
system) scheduled for completion by 1977; and,
(e) addition of subtransmission lines in the central and
southern systems.
The Proposed Project
4.02      ENDE's Third Power Project (1973-1975), a detailed description
of which is given in Annex 5, would comprise the following:
(a) two 8 MW gas turbine units to be installed at the
Santa Cruz diesel power plant;
(b) extension of the 66 kV transmission line from Warnes
to Montero (22 km) and substation expansions, in the
Santa Cruz area;
(c) a 40 km single-circuit 115 kV transmission line between
the Santa Isabel hydro power plant and the Sacaba sub-
station and expansion of substations, including shunt
capacitor compensation at Catavi, Huanani, Machacamarca
and Oruro in the central system;
(d) a 45 km single-circuit 66 kV transmission line between
Miguillas substation and Viloco mines, in the central
system;
(e) construction of an office building in Cochabamba; and,
(f) consulting services for the interconnection study of the
central and northern systems, engineering studies for the
expansion of Corani hydro power plant, feasibility studies
for new generation, and mianagement consultant services.



- Jll -
4.03       DINE's part of the Project would consist of:
(a)  studies of the present and future availability, prices
and consumption of energy by sources;
(b) studies of the present and future organization of the
power sector; and
(c)  the improvement of DINE's administrative and regulatory
procedures and practices.
Cost of the ENDE III Project
4.04       The estimated cost of the ENDE's part of the Project is $b144.2
million (US$7.2 million) with a foreign currency component of US$5.9 million
and represents about 21% of ENDE's five-year program. Details of the cost
estimates are given in Annex 6 and summarized below:

The proposed Credit would cover 1001 of the foreign cost of the ENDE III
Project.
4.05       The cost estimates for the Project (except for the office build-
ing estimated to cost US$100/m2 which seems reasonable) were made by the
appraisal mission in the field in June of 1972, and are based on recent
experience with similar works in other Latin American countries. The feasi-
bility report of the Santa Cruz plant, prepared by Harza Engineering, USA,
in August 1972, included recommendations of unit type and size and estimated
costs practically identical to those of the mission. The cost estimates
were revised in March 1973 because of the October 27, 1972 devaluation of
the Bolivian peso and the realignment of the currencies last February.
4.06       To cover increases arising from unforeseen circumstances a physical
contingency allowance of about 6.5% has been included for all project costs



- 12 -
except for the costs of the engineering studies. Average escalation
contingencies of 8! of foreign currency has been allowed for price infla-
tion, since most of the equipment would be procured in 1973 and early 1974
on a firm price basis. For the local costs, price escalation is estimated
at 7.5 .-
Cost of DlIE's part of the Project
4.07       The foreign exchange cost of consultant services for the studies
and management improvement of DINE has been estimated at US$80,000.
Engineering and Construction
4.08       Specifications for the Santa Cruz plant have been prepared by
an acceptable consultant and approved by the Association. The consultant
will also make the bid evaluation.  ENDE's engineer who would be respon'sible
for the operation and maintenance of the plant would be sent abroad for
about six months of training before the erection of the plant, to observe
the operation and maintenance of similar units.
4.09       ENDE's staff would prepare the bidding documents and supervise
the construction of the short transmission lines and substations, with the
assistance of one or more individual engineering consultants who woild
advise on all phases of the work.  The new transmission lines would have
technical characteristics and component parts identical to those at present
in operation.  ENDE should agree to IDA's aonroval before appointing the
expert or experts.
Construction Schedule
4.10       The ENDE III project would be constructed during 1973-1975.  To
avoid serio.us deficit of energy in Santa Cruz, the first gas turbine unit
should be installed by September 1974, and the second unit by the end of
1974. Bids for this equipment were invited in May this year, and offers
are  expected in the middle of September.  The procedures followed have
been satisfactory to IDA. Preparatory works for the construction of the
Viloco line were started in the middle of this year and the line should
be commissioned by the middle of 1974. The construction of the transmis-
sion lines and substations in the Santa Cruz area and central system
should be completed in the last quarter of 1975.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.11       All equipment and materials financed under the Credit would be
procured, and the contracts for their erection would be awarded, through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA Guidelines.
During negotiations ENDE has requested and the Association has agreed to
a margin of preference for a domestic supplier of cables equal to 15% of
CIF price or to the prevailing import duty, whichever is lower. Orders
for cables, if awarded to the domestic supplier, are expected to amount
to a total of about US$250,000 equivalent, of which about 50< would be
the foreign component.



- 13-
4.12       Separate contracts for the supply of the materials and equip-
ment and for the construction would be let for the transmission lines and
the substations. Only one contract would be let for the sunply and instal-
lation of the gas turbine units and civil worTk for the entire Santa Cruz
plant addition because of the low cost of the civil works (about US$90,000
equivalent). The contract for the office building would also be awarded
through international competitive bidding.  However, in view of the rela-
tive small amount involved (about US$270,000 equivalent) it is likely
that only local contractors will be interested in bidding for this contract.
To complete the Santa Cruz plant in 1974, a consultant has been engaged
who has prepared the bidding documents. Retroactive financing of about
US$50,000 would be required for the Santa Cruz studies and the management
consultant services.
4.13       Disbursements from the proposed Credit would be for the foreign
cost of engineering, equipment and materials (except for the cables if
procured locally), contractor's erection work and consultant's services.
The project is expected to be completed at the end of 1975 and the closing
date would be December 31, 1976 (see Annex 7).
Environment
4.1-4      The gas turbine units will be installed in the Santa Cruz diesel
plant, which is located outside the city away from the heavily populated
area.  Natural gas will be used as fuel and no devices for cleaning exhaust
gases would be necessary. No noise problems are expected.

5. JTUSTIFICATION
Load Forecasts
5.01      Santa Cruz System - Actual figures and estimates for energy
generation and sales, maximum demand, and installed and required capa-
city in the Santa Cruz area up to 1982 as made by the Association, are
given in Annex 8. Energy generated increased 306% during the period
1°67-1972, with a cumulative annual growth rate of 58% during the last
two years. This unusual increase was largely due to the completion of
the Santa Cruz diesel electric plant in 1970 (before then the market
had been inadequately supplied), and to the changeover by a number of
small industries from self-generation to the new distribution network
of CRE.  The growth trend for power will continue to be substantial over
the next six years - at around the 22% level - with the addition of a
number of sizable clients, the development of CRE's rural electrification
plan and the zone's heavy population growth (6% per annum). The maximum
demand, which was 10.7 MW in 1972, is expected to rise to 28 MW in 1977.
5.02      Central System -  Annex 9 shows actual figures and estimates
of demand and energy for the Central Grid System up to 1977. Energy
generated increased from 221 GWh in 1967 to 300 GWh in 1972 and the peak
demand at plant level rose from 40 MW to 56 MW in the same period.  Due
to ENDE's starting to supply COIrBOL's new power requirements, following
the coming on stream of the Corani hydroelectric plant, power sales of
BPC's Oraro Division showed only a slight increase between 1967 (92 GAh)
and 1972 (106 GWh).
5.03      ENDE's sales forecasts for 1973-1977 were prepared after dis-
cussions with ENDE, COMIBOL, BPC and DINE. The average annual growth
rate of ENDE's sales is expected to be 12.5% for the period 1973-1977.
BPC's power generation (108 GWh) and sales (101 GWh) would be practi-
cally constant during the period 1973-1977 as generation would be limited
by the capacity of the existing hydroelectric plants. Neither COMIBOL
nor ELFEC would increase energy generation from 1973-1977; annual production
during this period would be about 38 GWh for COMIBOL and 15 GTWh for ELFEC.
The coincident maximum demand in the system would increase from 56 NW in
1972 to 77 MW in 1977 with an annual load factor of 61%. Energy generation
in the same period would increase from 300 GWh to 412 GWh.
Gas Turbine Units at Santa Cruz
Gas turbines or diesel units would be the only possible solution
for the supply of Santa Cruz's power needs in 1974. Steam thermal
plants or hydroelectric plants would not be economical, in view of the
size of the units involved, and would take longer to construct. Twelve
alternative programs were examined, six of these for a nomal rate of
power growth (22%, see paragraph 5.01) and the remaining six for a rapid
rate of growth (30%), with 6 YW, 8 MW and 10 MW gas turbines and dual-fuel
diesel motors. The 8 MW units proved to be the most economic size.



- 15 -
5.05      In Annex 10 the economic comparison between gas turbines and
diesel units of 8 MW is shown; the installation of gas turbines would
provide the least cost solution for discount rates up to 59%. Even at
a unit cost of about US$259/kW (10% higher than the proposed units) gas
turbines would continue to provide the most advantageous solution for
discount rates up to 18%. Since the price of gas at Santa Cruz is
approximately one-eighth of diesel oil, variations in the price of gas
would have an insignificant effect on the results of the study.
5.06      The return on the gas turbines investment is estimated at 9%
as shown in Annex 11. The low return on this part of the project reflects.
the low load factor of the system, which started its operation only
two years ago. The only alternative to the proposed project would be to
impose stringent rationing on consumers, which would seriously damage
the economy of the zone and encourage additional installation of captive
plant (currently some 18 MW, including the sugar mills).
Warnes - Montero Transmission Line
5.07      The economic comparison of the two practical transmission al-
ternatives for the supply of electric power to the rural zone north of
Santa Cruz is given in Annex 12. The 66 kV alternative would be the least
cost solution for discount rates up to 30%, due to lower transmission
losses, although construction costs would be some 37% higher than for the
2h.9 kV alternative. The return on the investment would be 29% (see
Annex 13).
Central System Transmission
5.08      To improve voltage regulation on the 115 kV long-distance
transmission line between the Santa Isabel-Corani hydroelectric plants
and the Catavi substation (180 km) and to reduce transmission losses to
acceptable levels, the following two alternatives were examined:
(a) installation of a voltage regulator at the Sacaba sub-
station (Cochabamba) with a regulated power output of
40 M4VA; or
(b) bringing forward by two years the construction of the 40 Ian
stretch of the 115 kV line between the Santa Isabel hydro-
electric plant and the Sacaba substation, which will be
used in the future interconnection project (1977).
The second of these alternatives is more advantageous for the following
reasons:
(a) it ensures greater continuity and higher quality of
service in the Cochabamba area;
(b) transmission losses will be smaller; and,



_ 16 -
(c)  bringing forward construction of the line is equivalent
to the cost of the voltage regulator at discount rates
of 15%; and once the Northern (La Paz) and Central
Systems are linked, there would be no further use for
the voltage regulator.
Office Building
5.09      The new ENDE office building will centralize activities
which, due to lack of adequate space, are now congested in three small
buildings located in widely separated parts of the city of Cochabamba.
There are no office buildings in that city of the size and with the
facilities required by ENDE. Centralization of activities in the proposed
office building will considerably improve efficiency of ENDE's staff.

6. FINANCE
Capital Structure and Financial Position of ENDE
6.01      Balance sheets as of December 31, 1967 through December 31, 1972.
are shown in Annex 14. The Assets are shown revalued in 1972 by the
Governmentts indices in accordance with the provisions of the October 1972
devaluation. The average life of ENDE's fixed assets is only about five
years and thus revaluation by the Government's indices, i.e. 60% on the
imported component (as compared to 67% devaluation) and 20% on the local
component (as compared to 4% average annual inflation during 1967-1972) is
acceptable. On this basis, gross fixed assets and work in progress as of
December 31, 1972 totaled $b552.6 million (US$27.6 million equivalent);
accumulated depreciation was $b46.1 million, and net fixed assets were
$b276.8 million (US$13.8 million equivalent). Straight line depreciation
has been charged on each group of assets at percentages based on their useful
lives; the resulting overall rate of depreciation has generally averaged
around 2.8%, which is acceptable.
6.02      ENDE's capitalization as of December 31, 1972 can be sumniarized
as follows:
In Millions       In Millions      Percentage
of $b             of US$        of Total
Equity                             322.6             16.1              50.2
Long-term Debt:
IDA Credit (148-BO)            119.6              6.o              18.7
Other Loans                    199.9             10.0               31.1
Total Long-term Debt               319.5             16.0              49.8
Total Capitalization               642.1             32.1             100.0
6.03      The long-term debt other than the IDA Credit 148-BO, which was
relent by the Government to ENDE for the Santa Isabel Project, was provided
from proceeds of three IDB loans totaling $bo4.8 million, three USAID loans
totaling $b109.1 million, and $b6.0 million from CBF and the Comite de
Obras Publicas of Santa Cruz. The foreign loans are shown revalued in 1972
to reflect the new rate of exchange. The anrnal interest in 1972 on long-
term debt was 3.2% of the average total long-term debt outstanding during
the year. Average repaymient period of ENDE's long-term debt is about 20 years.
6.o4      ENDE's equity includes the assets of the power division of CBF
which was taken over in 1965, along with earned surplus and reserves. The
equity also includes the proceeds of the US$10 million IDA Credit 61-BO
which was contributed by the Government to ENDEts capital. Moreover, ENDE
receives, as equity contributions fronm the Government, all debt service
payments made by BPC to the Government under Credit 62-BO.  The equity is
shown adjusted in 1972 after revaluation of the assets and liabilities in
accordance with the provisions of the 1972 devaluation Decree.

Earnings Record
6.05      Income statements for the fiscal years ending December 31, 1967
through December 31, 1972, are shown in Annex 15. The annual growth rate
of sales during the above period averaged about 21.7% and earnings were
satisfactory. Net operating income increased by an average of 43.6%
annually from 1967 through 1972, resulting in a 61 average annual return
as compared to the 91 return permitted by the Electricity Code. The lower
return was not unduly alarming because ENDE started its operations only
six years ago and therefore its assets, which are mainly hydro facilities,
increased faster than could be expected for revenues. ENDE reached a
9.49 rate of return in 1972.
6.06      An unfavorable aspect of ENDE's operations has been accumulation
of excessive accounts receivable. As of early December 1972, the total
outstanding receivables on the account of billings for electrical service
were $bl2.5 million, equivalent to about four months billings, of which
$b4.7 million were current billings.. The situation has improved in the
middle of 1973 and ENDE expects to reduce the receivables to two months
billings by the end of the third quarter of 1973.
6.07      Corporaci6n T3oliviana de Fomento (CBF), the Government-owned
development corporation which holds nearly all of ENDE's capital stock,
has created considerable difficulties for ENDE. In 1970, ENDE was forced
to make two interest free loans of three months terms (one US$250,000 and
the other $b3,000,000) to CBF. The Government has now arranged for CBF
to pay back the dollar loan and a part of the local money obligation.
The balance will be totally repaid before the end of March 1974.
6.08      ENDE's accounts conform with generally accepted accounting
principles and public utility practices.  They are audited annually by
Arthur Young and Company in accordance with arrangements acceptable to
the Association. It has been agreed that the present arrangement for
annual audits by independent outside auditors would be continued.

6.10      The forecast of internal cash generation is based on forecast
sales of ENDE in the Central, Santa Cruz, and Southern systems at existing
tariffs (Annex 17).  On this basis, about US$5.9 million or 29% of the
total requirement of funds (including Santa Isabel cost overruns carried
over from the previous year) would be financed by internal cash genera-
tion (after debt service) during the 1973-1975 period. About US$2.0
million or 10% of the balance will be covered by contributions and other
sources leaving US$12.3 million to be financed by long-term debt.
6.11      Government contributions would mainly come from the debt service
payment to be made by BPC under Credit 62-30. Contributions would also
include US$620,000 from a UNDP grant to cover studies referred to in
paragraph 2.14.
6.12      The forecast long-term debt of ENDE includes:  (i) US$5.4 mil-
lion equivalent in existing loans (Annex 18); (ii) the proceeds of the
proposed IDA Credit (the Credit is assumed to be signed in October 1973
and its proceeds would be relent to ENDE at an interest rate of 7.25%
and a term of 20 years including a grace period of about three years);
and, (iii) a future loan of about US$10.6 million to cover the foreign
cost of further extension of facilities for the 1975-1977 period (of
which about US$1.0 million would be disbursed in 1975).
Future Earnings
6.13      ENDE's tariffs were increased following the 67% devaluation of
October 1972. ENDE's forecast income statemehts, on the basis of present
tariffs, for the next five years are shown in Annex 19, and a statement of
financial ratios is given in Annex 20. Net operating income would increase
from $b22.8 million in 1972 to $b57.h million in 1975, resulting in an
average annual return of about 9.0% which is satisfactory.
6.14      Rate covenants in the 148-BO Credit and Project Agreements re-
quire (a) the Government to cause ENDE to be granted, and (b) ENDE to take
all necessary steps to obtain and maintain tariffs designed to produce
revenues sufficient to earn a 95 return in accordance with the provisions
of the 1968 Electricity Code.  It has been agreed that these covenants
will be continued in the Agreements for the proposed Credit.
6.15      Net income is expected to increase from $b21.1 million in 1972
to $b34.8 million in 1975.  Total net income during the construction period
of the Project, 1973-1975, is estimated at about $b99.8 million (US$5.0
million equivalent).  Since the financing plan is based on the reinvestment
of all internally generated funds, ENDE has agreed to retain all such funds
for reinvestment and not to pay cash dividends until the project is completed.
Future Financial Position
6.16      Forecast balance sheets for the next five years are shown in
Annex 21. Assets are shown revalued by the Government's indices in accord-
ance with the provisions of the October 1972 devaluation Decree, which is



- 21 -
acceptable. Since the Electricity Code does not have an adequate provi-
sion for revaluation of assets, it has been agreed that if in the opinion
of the Association and DINE the book value of assets became unrealistic
because of currency devaluations or changes in prices, or other factors,
ENDE will revalue its assets in accordance with methods satisfactory to
the Association and DINE.
6.17      Although long-term debt (after revaluation of all foreign debt)
will increase by 20! from 1973 to 1975, the debt/equity ratio will remain
unchanged at around 54/46 mainly because of large annual retained earn-
ings and the equity contributions from the Government (see 6.03). During
the negotiations for the past two Credits, a debt limitation covenant was
agreed upon in the form of an earnings test which allows ENDE to incur
debt as long as its earnings before provision for depreciation and inter-
est charges for a past 12-month period would cover maximum future debt
service 1.5 times.  It has been agreed that this covenant would be con-
tinued in the proposed Credit.
6.18      ENDE's cash position will be satisfactory during construction
of the project; adequate cash, equivalent to at least four weeks require-
ments, will be in hand at all times for day-to-day operations.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01       During negotiations,
(a) ENDE agreed:
i. to employ management consultants satisfactory to the
Association (paragraph 3.06);
to continue to consult with the Association before
appointment of any future General Manager (paragraph 3.07);
iii. to employ engineering consultants satisfactory to the
Association to advise on all phases of the project
(paragraphs 4.08 and 4.09);
iv.  to continue to have its accounts audited annually by
independent auditors (paragraph 6.08);
v.  to take all necessary steps to obtain and maintain
tariffs to produce revenues sufficient to provide a
90 return in accordance with the provisions of the
Electricity Code (paragraph 6.14);
vi. to retain all internally generated funds for reinvest-
ment and not to pay cash dividens until the completion
of the project (paragraph 6.15);
vii. to revalue its assets in accordance with methods satis-
factory to the Association and DINE if the book value of assets
become unrealistic because of future currency devaluation,
changes in prices or other factors;
viii. to continue with the debt service coverage test of 1.5
times (paragraph 6.17).
(b)  The Bolivian Government agreed:
i. that ENDE's General Manager would be appointed in accord-
ance with the provisions of the ENDE's statutes (para-
graph 3.04);
Li.  ;hat ENiDE would be permitted to earn a 9% return (para-
graph 6.14).
7.02       The project forms a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$6.0
million equivalent to the Government of 3olivia, which will relend US$5.92
million to ErJDE for a term of 20 years including a three-year grace at 7-1/4%
interest, and will make available US$80,000 to DINE.

ANNEX 1
BOLIVIA
APPRAISAL uF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ELECTRICIDAD
REORGANIZATION OF TBE POWER SECTOR
Prior to 1964, when the Government entered into the electrical
power industry, BPC had supplied practically all public electricity require-
ments in Bolivia. Due to the severe inflation in the country and lack of
authorization for tariff adjustments, BPCts financial position had deterio-
rated to a point where the necessary expansion of facilities could no longer
be made.
The Association in its first lending to the Bolivian power sector
in 1964 agreed that ENDE be established as a Government-owned autonomous
electric utility to construct, operate and manage electrical installations
where needed except in the area served by BPC (see paragraphs 2.07 and 2.08).
Direccion Nacional de Electricidad (DINE) was also          established as an
autonomous regulating agency to formulate policies and regulations governing
the power sector and to approve tariffs for the electrical utilities opera-
ting in the country.
In due course ENDE was set up and has been operating satisfactorily
since 1967. DINE was created in February 1968 with the assistance of consult-
ants, Motor Columbus of Switzerland. An Electricity Code to regulate the
power sector was prepared by DINE and promulgated by Supreme Decree No. 08430
in July of 1968.
Since it appeared highly doubtful that DINE without assistance of
qualified consultants, could overcome all the difficulties of a fledgling
regulatory agency, an agreement was reached during negotiations of the 1969
Credit that consultants be employed by DINE for at least another two years
to assist it in the preparation of the various regulations pertaining to
the Electricity Code and in the administration of the Code. An amount of
US$60,000 to meet the foreign exchange part of the cost of the consulting
services was included in the 1969 Credit. Agreement was reached with the
Government that the Electricity Code would be presented for enactment by
Congress not later than September 30, 1971, and that material amendments
to the Code would require prior agreement by the Association. The Regulations
for the Electricity Code will be put into effect this year after consulting
with the Association, but the Code itself has not yet been ratified because
the Congress which was dissolved in 1968 has not reconvened.

WHIEREAS:
The electric potrer policy established by the Ministry of Power and
Hydrocarbons requires the interconnection of the major systems installed in
order to achieve rational operation of these systems, thereby forming a
national network which will ultimately link all existing electric systems.
This interconnection will result in optimum use being made of all
presently installed generating capaci-ty, with the consequent advantages of
economies of scale from the installa-tion of large interconnected plants,
guaranteed and constant supply and the general improvement of electric power
services.
Studies carried out by Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE) confirm
both the technical and the economic feasibility of interconnecting the major
generating plants.
Article 97 of the Electricity Code states that concessionaires or permit-
holders are obliged to interconnect their systems, if' this is found to be necessary
for rational opera-tion.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
1. ENDE
1.1 Santa Cruz Gas Turbines Power Plant
The proposed project includes supply and erection of two package
gas turbine units with a unit generating capacity of approximately 8 MWT
at an ambient temperature of 300C and an altitude of 460 meters above sea
level, which be installed on a site adjoining the present diesel plant.
The units will include their auxiliary services, dual fuel (gas/diesel-oil),
cooling and starting systems, and will be designed to operate in parallel
with the present plant or as a separate and independent power plant. The
units will be provided with manual controls and with automatic equipment
for operation by remote control from a cold start up to predetermined load
limits.  Gas will be supplied through a eisting pipeline with a diameter
of 15.2 cm at a pressure of 21 kg/cm2 and the existing diesel oil storage
capacity will be expanded for the operation of the units with liquid fuel.
The units will be connected to the 10 kv bus bars of the outdoor substation
annexed to the power plant. With the commissioning of these units in the
course of 1974, the power requirements of the Santa Cruz system can be
satisfactorily met up to 1977.
1.2 Santa Cruz Transmission System
The expansion of the transmission system involves:
(a) installation of a 66 kv one circuit line between the Warnes and
Montero substations over a distance of 22 kn, concrete poles,
pin insulators, 397.5 MCM ACSR conductors and a steel 5/16" ground
wire;
(b) remodeling of the Santa Cruz substation next to the power plant
including the installation of a second power transformer of
1C/69 kv, 5/7.5 MVA and extensions of 66 kv and 10 kv bays;
(c)  installation at the Montero substation of a 66/24.9 kv, 5/7.5 EVA
transformer and a 66 kv line bay; and
(d) connections to the Warnes substation and installation of the
control systems.
1.3 Central System
The expansion of the transmission system will include:



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 3 pages
(a) a 115 kv single circuit line between the Santa Isabel hydro-
electric plant and the Sacaba substation over a distance of
approximately 40 km., with galvanized steel towers, 397.5 MCM,
ACSR conductors and a ground wire, and including the wiring
in the second circuit of the existing double circuit towers
between Santa Isabel and Corani hydroelectric plants (4 km).
The line will complete the ring linking the generating plants
and the Sacaba substation, providing high quality service in
the supply of power to the Cochabamba city, and will form an
integral part of the future interconnecting facilities with
the Northern power supply system;
(b)  a 66 kv single circuit line between Miguillas substation, next
to the Miguillas hydroelectric plant on the Miguillas river and
Viloco substation, 45 km in length, galvanized steel towers,
151.7 MCM, ACSR conductors, to supply power to a COMIBCL mine
and to a private mine near Viloco;
(c) extension of Catavi substation incorporating an autotransformer
of 25 MVA, 115/66 kv, and a circuit breaker in the incoming
transmission line; and the modification of the protective and
control systems;
(d)  extension of one 115 kv line bay each in the Santa Isabel and Sacaba
substations; and
(e) installation of shunt capacitors in the following substations:
Catavi (5 MVAr), Huanani (2.5 MvAr), Machacamarca (2.5 MVAr)
and Oruro (10 MVAr).
1.4 Office Building
Construction of a building adjoining the present offices covering
an area of approximately 2.712 sq m in two stories.
1.5 Studies
ENDE will engage the professional services of consultants to
undertake the following studies:
(a)  study of the interconnection between the Central and Northern
electric power systems;
(b) preparation of the Interconnection Contract;
(c) feasibility studies on new generating capacity; and
(d) assistance to implement the recommendations of the study
made by its consultants, International Middle West Service
Company regarding improvements in operating procedures and
reporting practices.
