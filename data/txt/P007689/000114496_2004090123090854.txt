                Re:   Second Basic Health Care Project - (Loan No. 3943-ME)
  Amendment to the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
Dear Sirs: 
We refer to the Loan Agreement between International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank) and Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (the Borrower), and the 
Guarantee Agreement between United Mexican States (the Guarantor) and the Bank, both 
dated October 8, 1995.  We are pleased to inform you of our agreement to amend the 
Loan and Guarantee Agreements, as follows:
I.
Amendments to the Loan Agreement
1.
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 is hereby amended by replacing the 
figure “87%”, wherever it appears in the “% of Expenditures to be Financed” column of 
Categories (2) (a), (2) (b), (2) (c), (2) (d) and (5), with the figure “86%”.
2.
Paragraph 2 (a) of Schedule 1 is hereby amended to read as follows in its 
entirety:  ““incremental staff and operating costs” means costs that would not have 
been incurred absent the Project and which are covered by the following SSA budget 
line-item classification codes (“clasificadores”) in effect as of August 1, 1995 (as 
the coverage of such codes’ scope is limited, if at all, by the parentheticals set 
forth below and by the last sentence of this paragraph):
1200 (salaries);
1300 (personnel non-salary benefits);
2100 (office supplies and other non-medical consumable materials);
2200 (only with respect to a nutritional supplement formula for babies under six 
years of age and for pregnant or lactating women, as part of Part A.1 (a) (ii) of the 
Project);
2300 (spare parts and small tools);
2400 (construction materials for community-built latrines);
2600 (fuel);
2700 (uniforms for field personnel);
3100 (utilities and postage);
3200 (Project office space rental);
3400 (commercial, banking and customs services, excluding insurance services);
Page  2
3500 (maintenance of equipment, vehicles and buildings obtained or constructed 
pursuant to the Project);
3700 (travel expenses only for TAPs and midwives selected for purposes of 
carrying out Part A of the Project);
3800 (expenses for conventions/congresses); and
4100 (fellowships only for said TAPs  and midwives).
In no case may any of such costs include salaries or other staff remuneration or 
benefits other than with respect to:  (i) hardship post incentives for doctors, nurses 
and paramedics under Part A.2 (b) of the Project; (ii) SSA and SHA technical-level 
temporary fixed-term staff hired for purposes of carrying out Parts A and C of the 
Project; (iii) temporary fixed-term PCU and SPCU staff hired for purposes of the 
Project; and (iv) TAPs and midwives selected for purposes of carrying out Part A of 
the Project;”.
3.
Paragraph 4 (i) of Schedule 1 is hereby amended to read as follows in its 
entirety:  “under Categories (3) and (5);”.
II.
Amendments to the Guarantee Agreement
4.
Part B.1 of Section I of Schedule 1 is hereby amended by replacing the 
word “Vehicles” with the words “Except as otherwise provided in Part C of this 
Section, goods, works and printing and distribution services”.
5.
Part B.2 of Section I of Schedule 1 is hereby amended to read as follows 
in its entirety:  “The provisions of paragraphs 2.54 and 2.55 of the Guidelines and 
Appendix 2 thereto shall apply to goods manufactured in the territory of the Guarantor 
and to works and services to be carried out by domestic contractors, if such goods, 
works or services are to be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph 1 of this Part B.”.
6.
Part C.1 of Section I of Schedule 1 is hereby deliberately left blank.
7.
Part C.2 (b) of Section I of Schedule 1 is hereby amended to read as 
follows in its entirety:  “Goods (including vehicles as defined in paragraph 2 (e) of 
Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement) estimated to cost $350,000 equivalent or less per 
contract or per bid package, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to $99,300,000.”.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating 
both originals of this letter in the space provided below, and returning one to us.  
This amendment letter shall enter into effect as of its date on the first page hereof 
upon receipt by the Bank of one original of this letter signed by you.  Once this 
amendment has entered into effect, it shall apply retroactively from the Loan and 
Guarantee Agreements’ signing date of October 8, 1995 onward (and therefore shall also 
apply with respect to items covered by the retroactive financing provisions of 
paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement).
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
  RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
