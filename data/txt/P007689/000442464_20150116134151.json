A\n            Mexican government initiative, the expansion of basic health\n            services program, has sought to reach these people. The\n            program is backed by a 660 million dollars loan from the\n            World Bank. An unprecedented collaboration between the\n            federal and local governments created hundreds of mobile\n            health units that deliver a basic health care package\n            including: basic sanitation, diarrhea control, family\n            planning, prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases,\n            health and nutrition information, immunizations, child\n            delivery, and prevention and control of tuberculosis and\n            cervical cancer."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
