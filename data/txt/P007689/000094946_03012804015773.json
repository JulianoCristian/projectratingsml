satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was highly likely, the institutional\n            development impact was high, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both highly satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicated that the objectives were set by the\n            country and the Bank's flexible approach allowed timely\n            achievement of development objectives. The Bank agreed on a\n            financial package but not on a five-year blueprint detailing\n            how to spend the money. The country was politically\n            committed to raising the health status of the poorest, to\n            decentralizing health services delivery, and to modernizing\n            its operations for serving the uninsured population better.\n            It was also recognized that reaching the poor in highly\n            dispersed geographical locations require substantial amount\n            of resources. While the project strengthened the supply of\n            basic health services, the Education, Health and Nutrition\n            Program (PROGRESA) combined a traditional cash transfer\n            program with financial incentives for families to invest in\n            human capital of children. The Government's full\n            commitment to decentralization of health services, and to\n            redefining and improving the Federal Secretariat of Health\n            policy-making, and stewardship roles within a decentralized\n            context were fundamental for the Government's ability\n            to provide successfully basic health care services in\n            dispersed rural areas."}, "docdt": "2002-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
