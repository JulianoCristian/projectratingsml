PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This project completion report (PCR) presents a review of the first
Bank loan made to PISO Development Bank (formerly, Philippine Investments
Systems Organization) for US$15.0 million approved in April 1978. After ran-
cellation of US$0.506 million, the loan was fully disbursed in April 1984.
This PCR was prepared by the Bank's East Asia and Pacific Regional
Office on the basis of a mission to the Philippines, and a draft PCR and
additional information furnished by PISO Development Bank. Comments received
from PISO Bank and the Government have been taken into account in finalizing
the report and are reproduced as Attachments A and 3, respectively, to the
PCR.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PHILIPPINES
PISO DEVELOPMENT BANK (LOAN 1555-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        This report covers experience under Loan 1555-PH for US$15.0 million
made by the Bank to PISO Development Bank (formerly, the Philippine Invest-
ments Systems Organization) through the Philippine National Bank (PNB). The
objectives of the loan were (i) to transfer foreign exchange resources to
promote mainly industrial projects undertaken by private enterprises, and
(Hi) to develop the capacity of PISO, a private firiancial institution, to
initiate and expand its medium- and long-term lending operations.
2.        The loan had mixed success in achieving its objectives.  Over 90% of
loan funds were disbursed one year before the original closing date. Subproj-
ect performance was below what had been expected; while six of the twelve
subprojects financed under the loan were operating satisfactorily, four werc
not in operation anq two w-re operating poorly with major difficulties (paras.
5.05-5.07 of PCR).1   PISO Bank, however, was successful in adapting its
institutional/corporate structure to the changing regulatory environment
(para. 3.01 of PCR), expanding its medium- and long-term lending activities,
and in mobilizing domestic currency resources (paras. 7.01 And 7.02 of PCR).
3.        The major institutional development under Loan 1555-PH was ihe
conversion of the Philippine Investments Systems Organization (PISO) fromt a
privately-owned Philippine investment house to a thrift bank - in December
1981 PISO merged with PISO Development Bank, a private development bank tPara.
3.01 of PCR). PISCs conversion into a thrift bank increased its capability
to mobilize domestic currency resources and its ability to provide a fv11eJ-
range of financial services to its clients.
4.        The quality of PISO Bank's portfolio has been steadily deteriGra -ng
since 1979 when the total arrears represented less than 0.1% of outstaudi-ng
loan portfolio; as of September 30, 1983, the corresponding figure was 9.3%.
Cash collections on PISO Bank's medium- and long-term loans have also dropped
precipitously - from 98% in 1979 to 69% In 1983.  While the woridw'de econo  ce
recession and the Philippines internal financial di_ficulties have resulted
in a number of PISO Bank's clients facing liquidity problems, thus contribut-
ing to its deteriorating collection performance and rising arrearages, part of
this decline could be attributed to certain institutional deficIencies, i.e.,
in particular, unrealistic operational performance expectations based on
1/   See Attac.iment A, page 1.



- iv --
optimist.tc apprafsals,.i! and weak/inadequate project supervision and
monitoring. Recently initiated improvements and strengthening of PISO Bank-s
Development and Corporate Banking Group (for appraisal) and Project Management
Department (for supervision) are intended to correct these deficiencies
(paras. 6.09 and 6.11 of PCR).
.5.       Regarding lessons learned tinder Loan 1555-PH, it is difficult to
generalize given the economic and political conditions which have prevailed
during project implementaLlon. The recession since 1979 certainly has had an
adverse impact, not only on the subprojects financed under Loan 1555-PH, but
on all of PISO Bank's operational lending activities; such problans are
widespread in the Philippine financial sector. PISO Bank's experience under
Loan 1555-LH sugge ts the need to strike a better balance  between rapid
portfolio growth h3 and tighter risk control in order to ensure an
institution's continued and lasting financial soundness. At the same time,
however, it also needs to be recognized that small and medium-sized financial
ft,LItUtIOfnS such as PISO Bank are severely affected by major economic and
fUnancial developments (such as those which occurred in the Philippines) over
which they have no control. A positive lesson learned is that under such
circumstances, an institution like PISO Bank must adapt Itself quickly and
decisively if it is to survive.
2!   PISC sank, however, feels that this conclusion may be undulv Influenced
iy b½insight, and thaL at the time appraisals were made, the adverse
economic niLtuation' which later developed could not be fereseen
(Attachment AF page 2).

PISO DEVELOPMENT BANK (LOAN 1555-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This project completion report reviews Loan 1555-PH, the first loan
made by the Bank to the PISO Develo9ment Bank (formerly, the Philippine
Investments Systems Orga;ization) ..1In addition to the $15.0 million under
Loan 1555-PH, PISO Bank .:L has received a subsidiary loan of $40.0 million
(including $24.0 million of Bans funds) under Loan 1984-PH which was made to
the Central Bank (CB) of the Philippines in 1981.
1.02      Basic data on Loan 1555-PH is given below.
4/   The Bank loan to PISO Development Bank was through the Philippine
National Bank (PNB). Under Philippine law, the Government could
guarantee a loan to a public entity only.
5/   In December 1981, the Philippine Investments Systems Organization (PISO),
a privately-owned Philippine corporation, merged with the PISO
Development Bank, Inc. (formerly Market Savings and Loan Association), a
private development bank. On March 31, 1983, the Bank authorized that
all reference to PISO in the Loan Agreement, Project Agreement and
Guarantee Agreement for Loan 1555-PH shall be reference to the PISO
Development Bank, Inc. (PISO Bank). However, in this PCR, reference to
PISO refers to the pre-merger investment house.

2. ENVIRONMENT
2.01      During the 1970s, the Philippines followed a m-ch more dynamic
growth-oriented development strategy than in the past. The growth rate of GNP
was raised from 5% in the 1960s to almost 7% at the end of the 1970s.
Recently, however, the world recession has been reflected in the domestic eco-
nomy. The second round of oil price increases and the resulting upsurge in
inflation, together with declining commodity prices and export demand, explain
the recessionary conditions which have recently prevailed in the Philippines
and which have severely curtailed industrial investment for the past few
years. Real GNP fell from almost 7% in 1977 through 1979, to an estimated
2.5% in 1982.
2.02      During the 1970s, manufacturing industr' as a whole grew only at
about the same rate as GNP; manufactured exports, nowever, grew dramatically
during the decade in response to various export promotion measures introduced
in the early 1970s. Towards the end of the 1970s and through the early 1980s,
as industrial sector growth deteriorated markedly, it was increasingly recog-
nized that the industrial sector was facing some major structural problems.
Past trade, financial and industrial policies geared to support import substi-
tution and capital intensive industries resulted in low efficiency and misal-
location of investment. Such export growth as did occur took place largely
outside the main policy regime through export processing zones and bonded
warehouses. In order to correct the import substitution and capital-intensive
biases of previous industrial and trade policies and to promote those indus-
tries having a comparative advantage, the Government developed a ohased policy
reform program to be implemented over a five-year period. The first phase,
which was started in 1980, has focused on a major tariff reform/trade liber-
alization program and export promotion measures. The second phase, currently



being implemented, includes: a fundamen'val reform of industrial incentives
and promotion policy; further measures for the ongoing trm-e policy reform;
and policy reforms for the energy vector and public resource management. To
support the Government in its first phase of policy reform, the Bank 6pproved
in September 1980 a $200 million Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL I).6
Support by the Bank of the second phase y} reforms was provided tinder a
$302.3 million SAL II, approved in 1983._
2.03      In conjunction with the trade and industrial policy reforms, in
19P0-81, the Government introduced a comprehensive set of banking anid finan-
cias sector reforms. These reforms included: liberalizing banking regula-
tions to allow different types of financial institutions to undertake expanded
activities, thereby increasing competition within the financial sector; and
lifting interest rate ceilings for loans over two years maturity, resulting in
positive real interest rates for the first time since 1978. These reforms
aimed at increasing savings and the availability of term-finance, and reducing
fragmentation and Inefficiency in financial Institutions. The reforms were
supported by the Bank-s Industrial Finance Project (Loan 1984-PH), approved in
May 1981.
2.04      In retrospect, the 1978-83 period during which the project was
implemented was both a turbulent time for PISO Bank and a period of basic
structural adjustment in the economy. The financial sector reforms hastened
PIS0 to pursue the conversion into a private development bank in order to
enhance its competitive posture. The decline in the economy, starting in 1979
following the second round of oil price increases and the ensuing interna-
tional recession, had a major impact on the corporate sector as a weak demand
depressed domestic, and subsequently foreign, sales and borrowing costs rose
sharply as a result of higher interest rates and exposure to foreign exchange
risk during a period of substantial devaluation of the peso. The corporate
sector was rendered even more vulnerable by the previous macroeconomic policy
regime which had encouraged the growth of many inefficient firms which could
not survive the general economic deterioration and the increasing competition
from foreign firms permitted by even the gradual liberalization of the trade
regime. The severe financial distress in the corporate sector has, in turn,
seriously weakened Philippine financial institutions, Including PISO Bank,
which have also been affected greatly by the effects of devaluation and
general instability in the financial system.

3. PISO DEVELOPMENT BANK
3.01      Background and Role of PISO Bank.  PISO was incorporated on March 1,
1974, as a privately-owned Philippine corporation, one of the few Investment
houses which was nnt dominated by the interests of any particular shareholding
group. The ba;tking and financial sector reforms of 1980/81 (para. 2.03),
which encouraged the evolution of more viable financial institutions with
larger capital bases through mergers/consolidations/additional capital infu-
sion, resulted in increased competition among financial institutions. These
developments led to PISO's decisicn to convert into a thrift bank which would
make it more competitive and expand its orientation towards long-term develop-
ment financing. On December 14, 1981, PISO merged with PISO Development Bank,
Inc. (PISO Bank), a private developtent bank _   This legal change in
corporate character, from an investmeut house to a private development bank,
resulted in foregoing certain investment house functions such as guarantees,
firm underwritings, and equfty investments in non-allied undertakilg".
However, PISO Bank assumed PISO-s long-term operations, syndications and
underwriting/private placements, mergers/acquiAitions, consultancy, insurance
business, standby domestic t/Cs (in lieu of guarantees) and trust operations
(in lieu of investment management). At the same time, PISO benefitted from
activities attendant to a development bank such as raising peso resources
through checling accounts, savings and time deposits, and normal bank lending
operations.
3.02      In terms of resources, PISO Bank ranks as the largest private devel-
opment bank (PDB) in the country. As of September 30, 1983, its total resour-
ces of P 853.2 million and equity of P 87.2 million accounted for 17.82 and
14.1% of the total resources and equity, respe.-tively, of all PDBs in the
Philippines. PISO Bank remains committed (as was PISO prsir to the merger) to
the development of productive ventures and income-generating projects under-
taken by privately-controlled business enterprises in the various sectors of
economic activity, and, ds a result of the merger, is able to provide a fuller
range of financial services to its clients.
3.03     'Background to Bank's Relations with PISO Bank.  At the time of
appraisal, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Private
Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) were the main providers of
long-term financing in the country. Given the likely rate of growth of indus-
trial investment at that time, and the need to diversify long-term sources of
8/   PISO Development Bank was originally established in 1968 under the name
of Orient Savings and Loan Association and was later renamed Market
Savings and Loan Association (MSLA). In July 1980, MSLA shareholders
entered into an Investment Agreement with PISO and other institutional
investors to increase MSLA capitalization to P 25 million, broaden owuer-
ship, professionalize management and expand operations as a first step
towards the conversion of MSLA into a development bank. On November 6,
1981, MSLA was renamed PISO Development Bank. In this PCR, reference to
PISO refers to the pre-merger investment house.



funds so as to establish a more competitive financial market, the Government
was encouraging the diversification of such sources in both the public and
private sectors. Special emphasis was placed on building up the long-term
development financing capability of investment houses. As PDCP had so far
been the sole private financial institution to receive development assistance
from either the Bank or the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Government felt
it was opportune for the Bank to assist an additional institution in the
private sector. The choice of PISO was based on the assessment of: (a) its
willingness to develop its long-term financing capabilities furthier; (b) its
ownership pattern, which, unlike all other investments houses in the
Philippines, did not reflect 'captivity" to a single family-dominated business
group; (c) its present sixe and stage of growth; (d) capable management and
staff; (e) Institutional emphasis on corporate client services; and (f) PISO's
generally good record of responsible corporate behavior and prudent financial
management.
4. LO-N OBJECTIVES
4.01      Bank Loan 1555-PH to PISO addressed two basic objectives:
(a) transfer of resources for the development of the industrial sector; and
(b) development of PISO's capacity to mobilize and allocate long-term funds to
a wide range of development-oriented investments. PISO's performance in
utilizing Loan 1555-PH is discussed in Chapter 5. The specific institution-
building objectives under the Loan are listed in para. 6.01 and PISO-s
performance in achieving these objectives is reviewed in Chapters 6 and 7.
5. TJTILIZATION OF LOAN 1555-PH
Resource Transfer
5.01      Rate of Utilization.  Annex 1 compares actual and estimated dis-
bursements for Loan 1555-PH. PISO Bank committed the Bank loan unexpectedly
fast, within 15 months af;er effectiveness, compared to the original
projection of 24 months.2'/ Ninety-two percent of the loan was disbursed by
year-end 1981, and 932 by the original closing date of December 31, 1982.
However, delays in three subprojects resulted in an extension of the closing
date to December 31, 1983. One subborrover eventually cancelled US$500,000 of
its subloan. With this cancellation, Loan 1555-PH was fully disbursed on
April 4, 1984.
5.02      Fund Allocation.  As summarized in Annex 2, Loan 1555-PH was used to
finance four "A" subprojects ($11.0 million) above the free limit of $750,000
and eight "B" subprojects ($4.0 million) below the free limit. The average
subloan size for the twelve subprojects was $1.25 million, with the corre-
sponding figure for the four "A' subloans and the eight "B" subloans being
9/   The National Economic and Develepment Authority attributes this
performance in part to PISO's modular organization which encouraged
competition in the marketing of PISO's services (Attachment B, page 1).
Also refer para. 6.04.



$2.75 million and $500,000, respectively. The Bank reviewed in detail all
four of the "A" subprojects. Although the four "A" subloans exceeded PISO's
normal single enterprise investment exposure limit (an amount equivalent to
25% of its net worth), three were approved as PISO had secured adequate
counterguarantees and one was treated as an exception for justifiable
reasons. With the exception of one subloan of US$2.0 million for financing
permanent working capital, all loan proceeds were used for financing fixed
assets acquisition.

Loan 1555-PH, while Annexes 3, 4, 6 and 7 present detailed information on the
characteristics of these subprojects.

5.04      Sectoral and Regional Distribution (Annex 3).  Of the twelve sub-
projects financed under Loan 1555-PH, two involved telecommunications (45X of
disbursements), nine involved manufacturing (52% of disbursements), and one
involved shipping (3% of disbursements).  The nine manufacturing subprojects
represented eight different subsectors. Eight of the subloan approvals (for
$5.75 million) were for subprojects located in Metro Manila, two (for $6.5
million) were for telecommunications operations which, while based in Metro
Manila, operate on a nationwide basis, and the remaining two (for $2.75 mil-
lion) were for subprojects located in Northern Mindanao. Thus, almost 82% of
subproject financing provided under Loan 1555-PH was concentrated in Metro
Manila. The substantial exposure in telecommunications reflected in great
part PISO's recognition of the lower borrower risks involved-L  - telecom-
munication companies in the Philippines charge their customers on a cost-plus
basis regulated by the Government, providing in effect a guaranteed return.
In addition, investment in the two telecommunication subprojects was seen as
proimoting regional development and the dispersal of industry by making avail-
able a faster and more efficient telecommunications system between remote
areas and the traditional commercial and industrial centers of the country.
Operational and Economic Performance of Subprojects
5.05      Operational Results.  Operational data on the subprojects financed
under Loan 1555-PH are provided in Annexes 4, 6 and 7.  Total cost of the ten
subprojects implemented was P 473.7 million compared against an original esti-
mate of P 372.8 million (Annex 4). H-ever, this overall cost overrun is
attributable to two subprojects with cost overruns of 41X (f 91.4 million) and
40% (f 10.0 million), respectively. Both subprojects encountered delays in
completion of over twenty months causing substantial cost escalations. The
remaining eight subprojects were completed with negligible variance in project
cost. Only four subprojects were completed on schedule, and six subprojects
experienced delays ranging from five to thirty months. The primary reasons
for these delays (Annex 5) can be summarized as follows: changes in specifi-
cations (two projects), technical difficulties (one), change in location (one)
and overoptimistic schedules (two). Two subprojects never commenced
operations due to management and financial problems of the subborrowers.
5.06      As of September 30, 1983, eight of the ten subprojects implemented
as originally planned were stiil in operation (Annex 6). Of these eight sub-
projects, two had exceeded (or nearly achieved) their respective sales targets
during the first two-years of operation and were operating profitably; the two
telecommunication subprojects, while performing reasonably well, had not yet
operated for two full years; another two had operated with some difficulty
during the first two-years; the remaining two had operated poorly with major
difficulties. Of the two subprojects which were not in operation, one was
being foreclosed and another was managing to service its financial obligations
with the assistance of its sister companies (and was studying the viability of
recommencing operations). Data on actual sales for the first and second year
of operations are available for six of the ten completed projects. Actual
10/ For PISO Bank's comments see Attachment A, page 4.



-9-
aggregate sales for the first year of operations exceeded PISO's appraisal
estimates, thanks to one large subproject whose actual sales exceeded by two
times estimated sales because of further expansion undertaken without PISO
financial assistance. For the second year of operations, actual aggregate
sales were 12X below estimated sales. Four of the six subprojects showed a
profit in their second year of operations. On an aggregated basis, however,
the six subprojects showed a second-year operating loss of P 10.5 million, due
to two subprojects whose losses amounted to P 13.5 million. In sum, of the
twelve subprojects financed, six were either not in operation or facing severe
financial problems.
5.07      Economic Performance.  Details of the economic performance of the
subprojects financed under Loan 1555-PH are presented in Annex 7. Of the four
subprojects which included an export component when originally appraised,
three are operating with actual export sales comparing favorably with original
estimates (P 41.9 million actual compared to P 36.6 million estimated for the
first full year of operation, and P 38.7 million compared to P 49.7 for the
second year). Total export sales for the first two years of operations
accounted for 19.5% of total sales, only slightly below the projected 23.9%.
Based on the data available for the eight projects completed and operating, a
total of 2,250 jobs (or 94.1% of appraisal estimates) were created at an
average cost per job of P 207,000, or US$22,574.L11 This relatively low
average cost per job .2/ under Loan 1555-PH is reduced further - to US$6,104 -
if the two capital-intensive communications subprojects are not included in
the computation. Ex-post ERRs were calculated for five of the subprojects.
One had a negative rate of return with the other four ranging from 14% to
67%. The ex-post weighted average ERR for the four was 26.1%, compared to an
ex-ante weighted average of 46.6%. Ex-post FRRs were calculated for seven of
the eight subprojects currently in operation. While the FRR for one of the
subprojects was negative, the remaining six subprojects had FRRs ranging from
11% to 45%, with a weighted average of 13.3% (compared to an ex ante weighted
average of 19%).
Status of Subloans
5.08      As of September 30, 1983, nine of the twelve subloans were in
arrears (Annex 8), reflecting poor operational and financial performance of
several of the subprojects discussed in para. 5.06. Total arrears of prin-
cipal and Interest amounted to P 21.4 million, representing 16.9% of the total
outstanding subloans under Loan 1555-PH. One major account in arrears offered
to prepay the whole subloan (but current Central Bank regulations precluded
any prepayment), four were making arrangements for settlement of arrears, two
were being studied for possible restructuring/rehabilitation, and two were
under foreclosure proceedings.
11/ Based on 1982 exchange rate of P 9.17 = US$1.00.
12/ Under Loan 998-PH, the average cost per job created was P 273,000 (or
US$32,000); under Loan 1190-PH, P 253,000 (or US$29,800).

6. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Institutional Aspects
6.01      The institution-building objectives under Loan 1555-PH focussed
on: (a) the strengthening of capitalization and the broadening of owneiship
(more specifically: (i) an increase in PISO's net worth by P 10 million before
loan effectiveness; (ii) a reduction in foreign ownership to 30% or less;
(iii) the maintenance of the maximum holding of a single domestic investor to
15% or less of PISO's total share capital; (iv) public listing of PISO's
shares on the stock exchange; and (v) the divestment of the Land Bank of the
Philippines' (LBP) holdings of PISO shares); (b) the revamping of PISO's
organization along functional lines; (c) an increase in staff; (d) the for-
mulation and adoption of a Policy Statement and a Corporate Strategy
Statement; (e) improvement in economic evaluation of projects; and (f) adop-
tion of liquidity and debt-servicing policies. Viewed against the above
institution-building objective of supporting PISO's strategy of gradually
becoming an institution financing a wide range of development-oriented proj-
ects set out under the Loan, accomplishments and shortcomings are discussed in
paras. 6.02 through 7.17.
6.02      Capitalization and Ownership.  Prior to loan effectiveness in 1978,
PISO increased its paid-in capital by P 8.0 million, with a paid-in surplus of
P 2.0 million. Consequently, PISO's paid-in capital together with paid-in
surplus increased to P 33.6 million by the end of 1978. With additional
increases in paid-in capital in 1980 (by P 3 million), 1981 (by P 30 million),
and 1982 (by P 10 million), PISO Bank's paid-in capital as of September 30,
1983, was reported to be P 76.4 million consi7ting of P 51 million of common
shares, P  3.6 million of preferred shares,13  and P 11.8 million of paid-in
surplus ...   However, the above reported 'paid-in" capital included
subscriptions receivable on common shares of P 10.3 million. Thus, PISO
Bank's paid-in capital increased, in effect, to P 66.1 million (net of subscriptions
receivable), up from P23.6 million at end-1977 when Loan 1555-PH was
appraised. While the increase in share capital has been substantial, the need
for further strengthening of its equity base still remains (para. 7.10).
6.03      The diversification of PISO Bank's ownership, discussed during
negotiations, has been pursued (as reflected in the number of shareholders -
see Annex 9), but without much success. Due largely to the depressed con-
dition of the Philippines' capital market, neither the public listing of PISO
Bank's shares on the stock exchange nor the divestment of Land Bank of the
Philippines' equity interests in PISO Bank has materialized. The single
13/ Consisting of P 3.6 million to be redeemed in 1986 and P 10 million,
subscribed and paid by DBP, which is redeemable by P 1 million annually
starting in 1993.
141  The bulk of this resulted from the reduction of par value of common
shares outstanding at the time of merger.



- 11 -
shareholder ownership ceilings of 15% and 30% (as % of total share capital)
for domestic and foreign shareholders, respectively, have been adhered to with
the exception of the Develoiment Bank of the Philippines which holds PISO
Bank's preferred shares representing 15.5% of PISO Bank's total share capi-
tal. PIS0 Bank remains committed to dispersal of ownership under its policy
statement and corporate strategy statement; however, it is unlikely that any
major breakthrough will be achieved until the condition of the Philippine
economy and stock market significantly improves.
6.04      Organization, Management and Staff.  Prior to its conversion into a
private development bank, PIS0 instituted certain organizational changes. The
most significant of these was the installation in 1979 of a modular organiza-
tion consisting of five operational centers (also called modules and managed
as profit centers) and three support units. Each of the five modules covered
almost the entire spectrum of PISO's operational functions and operated
independently. Thus, this system encouraged competition among the five
modules for the marketing of PISO's services, including long-term project
lending, for basically the same group of targetted clients. While these
organizational arrangements seem to have reflected PISO's efforts to achieve
the operational targets incorporated in its Corporate Strategy Statement, this
system ran counter to the revamping of PISO's organization along functional
lines suggested at the time of appraisal of Loan 1555-PH. Moreover, this
system of emphasizing and rewarding the marketing of loans was partly, if not
mainly, responsible for the uneven quality of PISO's appraisal reports and the
lack of rigorous analysis of and critical judgment on clients' project
proposals (para. 6.09). PISO operated under this organizational setup until
the 1981 merger (paras. 3.01 and 3.02) which required certain adjustments in
the organization resulting from the Introduction of new functions and
activities and the realignment of some responsibilities. In December 1982,
PISO Bank reorganized itself on a functional basis. Further adjustments were
introduced in 1983 to deal with managerial positions vacated by six key senior
officers who left PISO Bank; the impact of these resignations on PIS0 Bank is
discussed below.
6.05      The Chairman/President of PISO Bank succeeded in building up a core
of experienced senior officers by 1982. However, in 1983, the Executive Vice
President (EVP) - a second line-of-command below President but above Executive
Directors - left PISO Bank to assume the presidency of a commercial bank.
Five other senior officers also left PISO Bank to join la;ger institutions:
two Executive Directors (in charge of the Finance and Control Group and the
Branch Banking Division); one Vice President (in charge of the Treasury
Division); and two Assistant Vice Presidents (in charge of the Controllership
Division and the Strategic Planning and Development Group). The departure of
these six key officers made PISO Bank-s middle management somewhat thin. PISO
Bank instituted the following interim arrangements to ensure continuity of
operations: (a) the functions of the EVP were to be discharged by an



- 12 -
Operations and Finance Committee (OFC) chaired by an Officer-in-Charge ;15/
(b) the Executive Director position in charge of the Finance and Control Group
was to be abolished and its functions were to be distributed among the
remaining groups while the Controllership and the Treasury were to report
directly to the OFC; (c) the Branch Banking Group was to be directly super-
vised by the officer mentioned in (a) above; and (d) one Assistant Vice
President was transferred to the Strategic Planning and Development Group.
6.06      The above interim arrangements, although appropriate as a temp 'rary
measure, have not been entirely satisfactory, particularly in view of t   ieed
for a senior financial officer. Given PISO Bank's perception that a leaner
management structure is more appropriate for the time being and its intention
to fill most of the managerial vacancies through internal promotion, as and
when lower-level staff developed the requisite capabilities, the interim
organizational arrangements could be prolonged even at the expense of its
overall organizational efficiency. The Bank should continue to closely
monitor the devel rpl ents on PISO Bank's management situation and its organiza-
tional structure.
6.07      Staffing.  Between 1977 and the time of its merger with PISO Bank in
December 1981, PISO's staff increased from 55 (38 of whom were professionals)
to 95 (80 professionals). As of September 30, 1983, PISO Bank's total staff
numbered 239, 105 of whom were professional. The Branch Banking Group (which
includes the staff of PISO Bank's 11 branches, all of which are located in
Metro Manila) accounted for almost 51% of all bank employees. Twelve
professional staff (including the two division heads) were involved in project
appraisal, although only one was an engineer by training (para. 6.09). The
Project Management Department is responsible for project supervision; however,
with only seven professional staff (including the department head), the unit
was understaffed and requires strengthening (para. 6.11). Management has
indicated its intention to expand the technical expertise of its appraisal
group and to iucrease its supervision manpower (para. 6.09 and 6.11). As
indicated in Annex 10, the rate of turnover among professional staff continues
to be a problem. While there was steady improvement between 1978 and 1980
(with the annual turnover rate falling from 31% to 7%), the turnover rate
increased to 19% in 1983 (as of September 30). With higher positions and
better salaries being offercd to experienced and qualified PISO Bank staff
(the primary reason for staff resignations), PISO Bank management feels that
turnover is an extremely complicated situation not likely to be readily
resolved.
15/ Thls officer was also in charge of the Development and Corporate Banking
Group as well as the Branch Banking Group. He was promoted to the EVP in
late 1984.
16/ The interim arrangements have since been regularized and filled.

Standards and Procedures
6.08      Operating Policies and Corporate Strategy.  PISO Bank's Policy
Statement and Statement of Corporate Strategy, both adopted in March 1978,
were last amended January 8, 1982 and February 25, 1982, respectively, to
reflect the change in its status from an investment house to a private devel-
opment bank. PISO agreed, during negotia ions of Loan 1555-PH, to use as a
guideline a 10% margin for the current,2A' debt-service and interest coverage
ratios. PISO (pre-merger) and FISO Bank have generally complied with the pro-
visions of its Policy Statement. There were, however, transactions where
PISO's Board decided, as exceptions, to exceed the single enterprise exposure
limit (25% of its net worth) in view of the back-to-back bank guarantees that
wiere available for the amounts in excess of the limit. PISO was generally
successful in pursuing its corporate strategy for 1978-80 under Loan 1555-PH,
particularly its operational strategy (paras. 7.01, 7.08 and 7.09) and its
financial strategy (paras. 7.08 and 7.12), with significant effort made in
implementing its promotional strategy, mainly through active participation in
the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) program.
6.09      Project Appraisal.  Plans for improving PISO's economic evaluation
of subprojects, discussed and agreed upon during negotiations, were subse-
quently implemented. However, the methodology used for ERR analysis was found
Inappropriate in some cases. For instance, PISO s appraisal reports on two
expansion subprojects financed under Loan 1555-PH did not contain incremental
analyses of the expansions proposed. Moreover, the poor actual performance of
subprojects discussed In paras. 5.05 to 5.08 suggests that PISO-s appraisal of
subprojects tended to be optimistic (particularly about estimates/evaluation
of project implementation timetables, contingency provisions for possible cost
overruns, and market prospects), although subproject performance was also
adversely affected by the poor economic conditions prevailing when the
projects were completed or being implemented. Although PISO's appraisal
standards have been generally satisfactory, the quality of subproject
appraisal reports under Loan 1555-PH varied. The uneven quality of the
appraisal work might be attributed to several factors: (a) the system of
encouraging competition among the five modules noted for the marketing of
loans as discussed in para. 6.04, apparently without adequate safeguards for
ensuring project appraisal quality; (b) the consequent lack of industry
specialization among appraisal staff (the internal competition for expanding
clientele did not offer adequate opportunities for appraisal staff to deepen
their knowledge of specific industries through industry specialization);
(e) the lack of engineering expertise for undertaking in-depth technical
analysis; and (d) an inadequate feedback mechanism between the project super-
vision units and the project appraisal units. In an attempt to ensure and
improve the quality of its project appraisal, several steps have been taken.
In 1981, PISO established a Credit Review Section which provides an indepen-
dent review of the appraisal report for each project proposal and brings out
17/ The minimum current ratio of 1.1:1 requirement was substituted by the
Central Bank's minimum reserve requirements after PISO's conversion into
a thirft bank (para. 7.11).

issues of concern involved in the project proposal. The appraisal report,
together with the Credit Review Section's comments on it, are then submitted
to the Management Credit Committee for consideration. PISO Bank has recently
moved towards industry specialization by virtue of the backgrounds of the
division heads and their respective staff. In addition, PISO Bank introduced,
in 1983, the concept of penalizing 'he various profit centers for their non-
earning assets with a view to motivating them to ensure that their earning
assets keep on earning. PISO Bank has very recently established a Technical
Evaluation Department (para. 7.16). To foster closer interaction between the
project appraisal units and the supervision units, PISO Bank has also recently
expanded the membership of the Receivables Management Committee to include the
head of the project appraisal group (para, 6.11).
6.10      It should be noted that in a number of projects which PISO Bank has
financed (especially those large projects registered with the Board of
Investments), project design had already been formulated and/or procurement
arrangements already made with suppliers, prior to the client's loan applica-
tion with PISO Bank. Therefore, there was, in fact, little or no chance for
PISO Bank to influence the choice of project design, i.e., machinery and
equipment, process and technology, suppliers, etc. There is a need for PISO
Bank to beco-.e involved earlier in the project cycle if it is to be able to
influence project design.
6.11      Project Supervision.  Alon   ith the increase in PISO's term loan
portfolio, it was recognized in l980'!_1 that PISO should:  (i) prepare a
detailed project supervision manual; (ii) prepare and adopt a comprehensive
project supervision plan; and (iii) appoint qualified staff in adequate num-
bers for prcject supervision work. Progress made by PISO on the above aspects
was ,eviewed at negotiations of Loan 1984-PH in early 1981 and was found
satisfactory. Subsequently, however, implementation of items (ii) and (iii),
which need to be reviewed and modified continuously in the light of the
portfolio situation, does not seem to have received adequate attention from
PISO-s management due, apparently, to management's preoccupation with the
delicate negotiations and implementation of PISO s merger into PISO Bank.
This matter was raised by the Development Finance Unit (DFU) of the Central
Bank of the Philippines during its performance evaluation of PIS0 Bank in
1982. By 1983, when a joint IBRD/ADB/DFU mission visited PISO Bank, it became
more apparent that PISO Bank, handicapped by inadequate staff strength in its
project supervision unit, was not able to fully follow the supervision proce-
dures (e.g., monitoring cf clients, compliance with reporting requirements,
regular project visits, regular internal reporting) as prescribed in its own
supervision manual. To improve its supervision work, PISO Bank has recentl':
(i) increased the staff strength of the supervision unit by four to a total of
elevent (ii) established a problem project management group ("Curative Grovp")
with four professional staff within the supervision unit; (iii) formed a
Receivables Management Committee to enable immediate action on various issues
concerning its borrowers; and (iv) encouraged the participation of appraisal

Industrial Finance Project (page 97).

units in collection and supervision efforts to somewhat alleviate the
supervision unit-s workload through the introduction of a reward/penalty
system (para. 6.09). These are steps in the right direction. However, It is
unlikely that any major improvements in collection performance and porttolio
quality will be achieved until the country's economic situation significantly
improves.
Resource Mobilization
6.12      Domestic Currency.  Until 1981, PISO relied essentially on its
equity (about P 70 million) and funds from the Central Bank's IGLF (about
P 24 million, net of repayments) to meet its long-term domestic currency
requirements. Following the December 1981 conversion Into a thrift bank,
retail deposits became a main source of domestic currency r sources, growing
from only e 13 million at year-end 1981 to P 290 million   / as of
September 30, 1983. The retail deposit level represented over 55% of total
domestic currency resources, or 38% of PIS0 Bank's total liabilities and
shareholders equity, at end September 1983. In addition, PIS0 Bank's trust
fund (off-balance sheet) operations have steadily increased from P 65 million
in 1981 to P 261 million as of September 30, 1983. Funds raised from trust
funds and retail deposits have largely been used for working capital
financing. PISO Bank's achievement in deposit mobilization is commendable,
although its deposit level has subsequently fluctuated widely for reasons
beyond PIS0 Bank's control.
6.13      Foreign Currency.  With the exception of two medium-term lines of
credit ($500,000 each) from the Continental Bank International (Pacific) and
Rainer National Bank in 1975 and 1976, PISO Bank's foreign currency resources
came from official sources, i.e. the Bank ($15 million under Loan 1555-PH and
$40 million through the Central Bank under Loan 1984-PH), ADB ($15 million in
1979 and $25 million in 1981), and US Eximbank ($1 million in 1975). It
should be noted that the $40 million allocation for PISO Bank under Loan
1984-PH includes $16 million representing that portion allocated from the
Central Bank's own commercial borrowings. During the appraisal of Loan
1984-PH, it was determined that thi Central Bank would be able to command
better terms and conditions for borrowing from foreign markets than would the
private institutions on their own. Since this proved to be particularly true
in the Philippines, and as long as this approach continues, the e is no strong
incentive for PISO Bank to try tapping the international financial market.
Also, given PIS0 Bank-s financial condition and the country-s overall debt
situation, it is, at best, doubtful that institutions like PISO Bank will be
able to raise resources from the markeL at reasonable cost. In addition, PISO
Bank was active in managing/arranging syndications for financing development
projects costing about $23 million during 1979 through 1983, thereby
indirectly mobilizing foreign currency resources of about $21 million for
these projects.

7. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PISO BANK
Operational Performance
7.01      Overall Operations.  PISO's actual level of overall operations for
the period 1978-81 compared to projections at the time of approval of
Loan 1555-PH are presented in Annex 11. In 1978 and 1979, total approvals,
commitments and disbursements for all operations closely matched appraisal
estimates. In 1980, total approvals reached P 398 million, in large part due
to the sharp increase in syndication operations totalling P 295 million.
Thus, PISO's operational objective, as incorporated in Its Statement of
Corporate Strategy for 1978-30, to provide aggregate long-term financing
assistance totaling over P 350 million annually (on an approval basis) by 1980
was achieved. However, its strategy to achieve a balance between direct long-
term loans and other iorms of term financing during .he period 1978-80 was
realized only in subsequent years along with the decrease in syndication
operations. In 1981, however, total approvals, commitments and disbursements
fell far below appraisal projections - in most instances, by half, due to the
generally deteriorating economic/investmeut climate. Regarding PISO's foreign
exchange lending operations during 1978-81, actual approvals and commitments,
except in 1978, were considerably below projections. Actual foreign currency
disbursements never exceeded projections; total disbursements during 1978-81
amounted to only 45% of the original estimate (P 158.6 million against P 354.3
equivalent).
7.02      PISO Banlks operations for the six-year period 1978-1983 (as of
September 30) are summarized in Annex 12. After its conversion into a thrift
bank in December 1981, lending operations increased significantly. Total loan
approvals in 1982 amounted to P 385.7 million, compared to P 129.8 million in
1981. Most of this increase was attributable to local currency lending
resulting from PISO Bank's ability, as a thrift bank, to mobilize domestic
currency resources through its deposit-taking function. In the first nine
months of 1983, local currency loan approvals totalled P 160.9 million. While
1982 foreign exchange loan approvals of P 124.3 million showed a slight
improvement over 1981 (P 100.9 million), only one such approval (for P 12.3
million) was made during the first nine months of 1983, reflecting the growing
aversion of creditworthy subborrowers to assume the foreign exchange risk in
the face of continuing peso depreciation. Syndications by PISO Bank totalled
P 119.2 million in 1982 and P 52.0 million in the first nine months of 1983 -
somewhat below the P 191.0 million average for the period 1978-81. In July
1982, PISO Bank was granted authority to also undertake trust operations which
amounted to e 261 million as of September 30, 1983.
7.03      Equity Investments.  With only one equity invesvment of P 2.25 mil-
lion outstanding as of September 30, 1983, PISO Bank's direct equity invest-
ment operatioas account for only a very small proportion of its total opera-
tions. PISO took the lead in establishing PISO Leasing Corporation (PLC) in
1979, taking a 27.3% equity interest in the corporation. (The International
Finance Corporation has participated in PLC in the form of equity totalling
$210,000 and loans totalling $10.0 million - $5.0 million of which is undis-
bursed.) PLC was organized primarily to provide lease financing for indus-
trial, agricultural and business equipment, machinery and plant facilities,



- 17 -
and related auxiliary services. PLC's operations seem to have been satis-
factory with adequate profits of P1.3 mlllion In 1980, P 1.4 million in 1981,
and P 1.6 million In 1982 and 1983.  As a thrift bank, PISO Bank is now
allowed to make equity Investments only in allied .ketivities.
7.04      Guarantee Operations.  PISO extended four guarantees for P 46.2 mil-
lion in 1979 and three for P 18.7 million in 1981, mostly in conjunction with
its syndication operations. PTSO Bank's four remaining outstanding guarantees
as of September 30, 1983, amounted to P 15.0 million. These accounts were
assumed by PIS0 Bank at the time of the December 1981 merger; as a thrift
bank, PISO Bank is no longer authorized to extend guarantees.
7.05      Syndications and Underwriti    per ttions.  Through Its syndication
operations, which PISO Bank has undertaken since 1975, it is able to maximize
its assistance to clients with viable projects given its exposure limits for a
single borrower as established in its Policy Statement. Although PISO Bank
has been successful in syndicating loans, the number and amounts have fluctua-
ted from year to year (ranging from two in 1981 to six in 1978; from an aggre-
gated total of P 74.2 mil'ion in 1981 to P 295.1 million in 1980). This
decline largely reflected the depressed investment climate in the country.
While syndications remain an important operational activity, they have, over
the years, played a smaller role in PISO Bank's overall operations. Durilng
the period 1975-77, syndications comprised 90% (by amount) of total approvals;
for the period 1978-81, 46X; and for the period 1982 - September 1983, 23%.
Except for 1979, firm underwritings and private placements have not been a
major operational activity. Since the December 1981 merger, PISO Bank is no
longer authorized to undertake either of these functions.
7.06      Loan Characteristics.  A detailed summary of the characteristics of
term loans approved by PI50 Bank during the period 1978-S7ptember 1983 is
provided in Annex 13. Loans to the manufacturing sector have dominated PISO
Banks lending operation over the past six years, accounting for 56.0% of
total approvals (by amount). Subsectoral emphasis, however, has changed over
the years: between 1978-80, more than half of loan approvals (by amount) went
to the paper, rubber, chemical and metal subsectors; since 1981, the food
processing subsector received the largest share. Public utilities and ser-
vices have accounted for another 32.0% of total approvals over the past six
years, with miuing activities utilizing the remaining 12.0%. Over 70% of
loans ap,roved (by number and amount) i'n 1982 and 1983 (through September)
went to 4lients located in Metro Manila, with more than 95.0% of the loans
approved'(by amount) being allocated to expansion projects. This represents a
reversal in the trend set during the 1979-81 period towards greater regional
dispersal and participation in new projects, which may be explained by PISO
Bank's deteriorating profitability (para. 7.12) and portfolio quality (para.
7.14) which have resulted in efforts to minimize risks, especially those
lnherent in undertaking both new project financing and project activities
outside Metro Manila.
7.07      Over the 1978-80 period, the size of the average project loan
decreased steadily from P 4.8 million to P 2.6 million; since 1981, however,
that average has steadily increased to P 6.0 million for the first nine month
of 1983. While inflation and depreciation of the peso have contributed to the



- 18 -
Increase in average loan size, PIS0 Bank has gradually shifted to making
larger-size loans. During 1978-80, the number of loans of over P 7.0 million
accounted for only 11% of all loans approved; in 1981, the respective figure
was 24.5%; in 1982, it was 30%; and for the first nine months of 1983, it had
reached 38%. Before PISO0s conversion into-a private development bank,
foreign currency loans (by amount) accounted for almost 90% of all loans
approved. After the conversion, with PISO Bank able to mobilize domestic
resources through its deposit-taking function, foreign exchange loans, as a
percentage of all loans approved, dropped to 32% in 1982 and to only 7% for
the first nine months of 1983. This precipitous drop was marked by an
increasing reluctance on the part of enterpreneurs to undertake projects
requiring substantial foreign exchange in light of the successive deprecia-
tions of the peso which began in 1982, the risk of which is passed on to the
borrower by PIS Bank. The maturity structure of loans approved by PISO Bank
has substantially changed, reflecting the increase in working capital
financing funded by deposits: for 1978 and 1979, all but two of the fifty
loans (or 96%) approved by PISO had a maturity of five years or more; in
contrast, of the 99 loans approved from January 1, 1982 through September
1983, only 38 (or 38.0%) did.
Financial Performance
7.08      Financial Position.  PISO's projected and actual balance sheets for
the period 1978-81 are presented in Annex 14; audited balance sheets for the
period 1978-82 are given in Annex 15. As an investment house (1978-
December 13, 1981), PISO achieved a significant growth in total assets of
approximately 35% per annum, although this vas less than the 50% per annum
originally projected. While overall growth was less than anticipated, PISO
did achieve its objective of placing increased emphasis on long-term
lending. By December 13, 1981, its proportion of long-term loans to total
assets had increased from 2% in 1976 to 48%. Since 1977, PISO's level of
short-term investments had remained relatively constant; as a proportion of
total assets, however, short-term investments declined from 74% in 1977 to
24%. By December-1981, 59% of PISO's assets were financed by long-term debt
and equity compared tc only 25% in 1977.
7.09      After PISO's conversion into a thrift bank in 1981, its total assets
increased by 61% in 1982. For the first nine months of 1983, total assets
increased by a moderate 23% (annualized). The considerable slowdown in
growth, in most part, was attributable to the rising economic and financial
crises besetting the Philippines. The series of peso devaluations during the
year made foreign currency loans especially unattractive to investors. The
change from an investment house into a development bank did not result in any
major change in the composition of PIS0 Bank's assets. As of September 30,
1983, PISO Bank-s long-term assets accounted for 53% of total assets; short-
term investments accounted for 20% (well-below the 35% maximum embodied in its
Corporate Strategy for 1982-86). It is worth noting that, both as an invest-
ment house and a thrift bank (after the merger), PIS0 Bankos total asset size
has doubled every two years, largely reflecting the dynamic management team of
PIS0 and its corporate strategy emphasizing growth. However, while the record
of asset growth has been impressive, one may argue, with the benefit of hind-
sight, that a more conservative growth strategy might have resulted in better



- 19 -
control of portfolio quality. Such an argument, to an extent, makes sense
given the need for strengthening PISO Bank's project supervision unit and its
activities. On the other hand, in defense of PISO Bank, one can argue that
PISO Bank could not afford to ignore the opportunity for significant growth
during 1978-82 gizen an environment of uncertainty which has adversely
affected the banking system since 1983.
7.10      The bulk of the increase in PISO Bank's assets were funded by
deposits and long-term borrowings. PISO Bank-s performance in mobilizing
deposits has been remarkable. The deposit level rose from a mere e 19 million
just after the merger in 1981 to P 318 million at end-1982. However, PISO
Bank's deposit level fluctuated widely during the first three quarters of
1983, reflecting the unstable environment which developed that year. Due to heavy
withdrawals by institutional depositors, total deposits fell to P290 million
(net of interbank borrowing of P 58 million) by end-September 1983 and PISO
Bank became a net borrower in the interbank market that month.
7.11      Capital Structure and Liquidity.  PISO Bank's paid-in capital as of
September 30, 1983, was P 66.1 million (para. 6.02) compared to P 31.6 million
in 1978- total equity increased from P 40.1 million in 1978 to P 76.9 mil-
lion. 2u   Notwithstanding these almost two-fold increases, total equity as a
percentage of t tal assets fell from 20.1% to 9.0%.  PISO Bank's total debt/
equity ratio  -  increased steadily from 4.2:1 in 1978 to 10.2:1 as of Septem-
ber 30, 1983, as against the contractual limit of 10:1 agreed to with the Bank
under Loan 1555-PH. PISO Bank's long-term debt/equity ratio stood at 5.4:1 as
of September 30, 1983, as against the contractual limit of 6.0:1 under the
subsidiary Loan Agreement for Loan 1984-PH. As a result of the peso devalu-
ation of October 4, 1983 (to P 14.00:$1.00 from the previous P 11.00:$1.00),
and with its projected increase in volume of operations, PISO Bank needs to
increase its equity substantially to comply with these contractual limits.
PISO Bank recognizes this situation and is exploring a number of ways to
expand its equity base. As recorded in the agreed minutes of negotiations for
Loan 1555-PH, a minimum current ratio of 1.1:1 was accepted. As an investment
house, PISO maintained this ratio. Upon its conversion into a thrift bank,
the Bank agreed to substitute the minimum current ratio with the Central
Bank's minimum reserve requirements - particularly in view of the term-
transformation being promoted by the Philippine authority and IBRD. However,
during September 1983, PISO Bank experienced a liquidity problem - as of
September 30, 1983, net borrowings in the interbank market amounted to P 34
million, implying that it was relying on borrowing from the interbank market
in order to meet reserve requirements imposed by the CB. Three factors have
contributed to this situation: (a) the withdrawal of institutional deposits;
(b) the sudden curtailment of rediscounting facilities under the Central Bank
and the Development Bank of the Philippines (while PISO Bank had already
advanced its own funds); and (c) the deterioration in PISO Bank's collection

Annex 15, which included subscriptions receivable of P 10.3 million.

- 20 -
performance (see para. 7.14). PISO Bank is exploring a number of ways to
increase its equity base and to improve its liquidity position (para. 7.16).
7.12      Profitability.  PIS(-s projected and actual income statements for
the period 1978-81, and audited income statements for the period 1978-82 are
found in Annexes 16 and 17, respectively. While actual financial results were
far below appraisal expectations, they were still reasonable during the period
1978-80. Since 1981, however, PIS0 Bank has experienced a serious decline in
profitability. Net income for 1981 (premerger, i.e., as of December 13), 1982
and 1983 (as of September 30) was below 1978, 1979 and 1980 levels. The
annual return on average equity for the years 1978-1980 averaged almost 15.0%;
for the period 1981-September 1983, the corresponding figure was only around
5.0%. Low profitability was due mainly to (a) the increase in financial
expenses as a result of costly short-term borrowings, (b) the increasing level
of accounts in arrears on which interest could not be accrued, and (c) nega-
tive interest spreads on certain loans the Central Bank or Development Bank of
the Philippinres was unable to refinance. In addition, as PISO Bank has
emphasized in its draft PCR on Loan 1555-PH, 1981 and 1982 was 'the time when
considerable corporate energy had to be spent realizing the organization and
operation of the two independent entities (PISO and PIS0 Bank) and thrashing
out...certain transitional merger issues." PISO Bank has also conceded that
organizational changes and branch expansion after the merger were sometimes
implemented at the sacrifice of its short-term profitability. PISO Bank has
not paid op3t any dividends since 1980 in an effort to weather the recession
and the impact of the merger. PIS0 Bank's action plan includes certain
measures to improve its profitability (para. 7.16).
7.13      Audit.  Sycip, Gorres, Velayo and Co. (SGV) have been the external
auditor of both PISO and PISO Bank. Their reports on the 1978-1982 financial
statements were without qualification.
7.14      Quality of Portfolio.  As shown in Annex 18, PISO Bank's loan
collection performance since 1979 has steadily deteriorated. Cash collections
on PISO Bank's medium/long-term loans declined from 98% in 1979 to 68% in
1982. For the first three quarters of 1983, collections amounted to only 62%
of amounts falling due. Annexes 19 and 20 summarize the status of PIS0 Bank's
total loan portfolio for the period 1979-September 1983. Due to the deterior-
ation in collection performance, arrears, which represented less than 0.1% (or
P 0.1 million) of PISO's outstanding loan portfolio in 1979, rose to 9.3% (or
P 49.7 million) of outstanding loan portfolio as of September 30, 1983.
Principal affected by arrears also increased: from less than 0.2% of total
principal outstanding in 1979 to 18.3Z as of September 30, 1983. Moreover,
as of September 30, 1983, 50% of all arrears were those of more than twelve
months; of the P 97.6 million principal outstanding affected by arrears, 87%
of that amount was affected by arrears of mure than twelve months. The world-
wide economic recession and the country's internal financial difficulties have
resulted In a number of PIS0 Bank's clients facing liquidity problems, thus
contributing to PISO Bank's deteriorating collection performance and increas-
ing level of arrearages. Also, inadequacies in project appraisal and super-
vision discussed in paras. 6.09 and 6.11 seem to have contributed to this
problem.



- 21 -
7.15      As of December 31, 1983, total provisions for doubtful accounts
amounted to P 44.9 million or 8.4% of total loan portfolio. The Central Bank
and PISO Bank's auditor (SGV) considered the accumulated provisions adequate.
7.16      PISO Bank's Action Program.  Since 1983, the Philippines has
continued to suffer a severe economic recession. The industrial investment
climate remains poor and the corporate sector continues to experience serious
financial difficulties, the impact of which has had a continued adverse effect
on PISO Bank. Following a joint IBRD/ADB/Central Bank DFU supervision mission
in 1984 and a series of discussions between the Bank and PISO Bank, PISO Bank
formulated an action program for dealing with a number of key issues.
Measures already taken or being taken under this program are briefly outlined
below. On Organization and Staffing, PISO Bank has recently established a
Technical Evaluation Department with five staff (three of whom are engineers -
an additional engineer is to be added) to strengthen its capability of
evaluating the technical aspects of projects, and appointed three
divisional/group managers. It is actively considering the desirability of
reinstating the position of Chief Financial Officer. PISO Bank is also
closely monitoring staff movement and is intensifying manpower training. (The
staff turnover rate dropped from 11% in 1983 to 9% in 1984.) On procedures,
PISO Bank, in addition to the establishment of the Technical Evaluation
Department, has decided to assume a highly-selective lending stance as well as
improve the quality of security on existing loans. It is reviewing and
updating its existing project supervision manual to reinforce supervision
activities, and has organized a task force to review the various systems
bankwide for streamlining operations and facilitating computerization of the
preparation of financial reports. Measures for improvement of portfolio
quality, liquidity and profitgbk,lity include: (a) aggressive collection
efforts (the collection ratia!_ has reportedly improved slightly from 69Z in
1983 to 72% in 1984 despite harsh economic conditions); (b) adoption of a
policy requiring that term loans be made only with matching funds (such as
ADB, Central Bank/Apex, IBRD and IGLF funds) and not with deposits; (c) sale
of some deposit-funded loans, if necessary, to other financial institutions;
(d) emphasis on mobilizing collateral banking business, including compensating
balances on the part of borrowers; and (e) introduction of new product lines
for increasing income and deposits (PISO Bank's deposits have increased from P
280 million at end-1983 to P 309 million at end-1984; its net profit increased
from Y 6.5 million in 1983 to about P 7.4 million in 1984).  Regarding equity
build-up, PISO Bank is actively exploring (a) a further issuance of preferred
shares (P 6 million redeemable preferred shares were issued in 1984), and
(b) raising of long-term subordinated loans (from either a bilateral or
multilateral institution).
7.17      Under the above action program, PISO Bank has been exploring the
possibility of prepaying foreign currency loans that have been foreclosed and
foreign currency loans of certain clients who wish to prepay. PISO Bank has
repeatedly requested of its major creditors (including IBRD) either substitu-
tion of the debt/equity ratios with the statutory risk assets ratio or certain
22/ For amounts falling due during the year.

changes in the definition of debt. This request has not been accepted on the
grounds that the current ceilings remain appropriate for an institution of
PISO Bank-s size and age, particularly given the current unstable financial
sector conditions in the Philippines. For this and other reasons, PISO Bank
is now actively pursuing a strategy of consolidation.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      Despite the problems currently facing PISO Bank, it has proved to be
a reasonable choice as an institution with which the Bank to be associated.
It has been capable of adapting itself quickly to a changing environment, as
reflected in the significant institutional and organizational changes
introduced during the recent past (para. 3.01 and 6.04-6.06). It has been
successful in achieving remarkable portfolio and asset growth during the
period 1978-83. Its total asset size doubled every two years and reached
P 853 million as of September 30, 1983; its loan portfolio grew from P 14 mil-
lion in 1978 to P 535 million (83% of which was medium and long-term loans).
Since its conversion into a thrift bank in December 1981, it has been able to
mobilize deiosits totalling P 290 million as of September 1983. Perhaps most
importantly, PISO Bank has so far survived a series of crises of confidence
which have shaken the financial sector in the Philippines since 1981. This
demonstrated resiliency, which reflects the quality of PISO Bank's management
and PISO Bauk's serious efforts to implement the action program attacking the
current difficulties and weaknesses, justifies past and continued Bank support
to the institution.
8.02      PISO Bank's present difficulty in meeting the covenanted debt/equity
ratios discussed in para. 7.11 was l3rgely caused by a series of depreciations/
devaluations of the peso (from f 8 = $1 in 1981, to P 14 = $1 in 1983, and to
P 20 = $1 in 1984) and the unsettling impact of a series of crises in the
financial system since 1981 which have made it difficult for PISO Bank to
raise the substantial amount of additional equity needed to match the increas-
ing level of liabilities resulting from the peso devaluations. PISO Bank-s
less-than-satisfactory liquidity situation was partly caused by developments
outside of PISO Bank's control, as discussed in para. 7.11, but also by low
loan collections. In retrospect, the deteriorating trend of portfolio quality
and the resulting weak profitability since 1981 (discussed in paras. 7.12 and
7.14) might have been arrested, to some extent, had PISO Bank more rigorously
evaluated the projects it financed during the earlier years of rapid growth
and spent more corporate resources (in terms of manpower and top management's
attention) on project supervision. It appears that the Bank also could have
reviewed subprojects more critically, with a view to improving PISO's project
appraisal standards, and drawn to PISO's attention, in stronger terms, the
need for strengthening project supervision.
8.03      Specific steps for institutional improvements sought under Loan
1555-PH (para. 6.01) have been largely implemented with one exception. PISO
Bank made some progress in increasing its share capital, though the need for a
further strengthenir,g of its equity base still remains an important issue.
The diversification of ownership has been pursued but without much success,
due largely to the depressed condition of the Philippines capital market.



- 23 -
The most important and positive institutional development during the
implementation of Loan 1555-PH was the conversion of PISO (an investment
house) into PISO Bank (a thrift bank), given its success in deposit
mobilization. Without this conversion, the institution might have been in
worse shape financially, since all loan collection shortfalls would have had
to be met with costly short-term borrowings instead of less costly deposit6.
If PIS0 Bank can be blamed for inadequately managing its rapid portfolio
growth, particularly during the transitional period of merger, it should be
given credit for having initiated and completed the conversion into a thrift
bank. In fact, PISO Bank has already become a model for other investment
houses in the Philippines to seriously consider following, though the
viability of small/medium size banks in the country has yet to be fully
tested.
8.04      The performance of PISO Bank in achieving the objective of resource
transfer under Loan 1555-PH has been mixed. While over ninety percent of the
loan was disbursed one year before the original closing date, the performance
of the twelve subprojects financed was below what had been expected. Four
subprojects were never implemented or ceased operations shortly after
implementation. Of the eight subprojects presently in operation, six are
operating without any serious difficulties and with reasonable prospects for
the future. The remaining two subprojects are currently operating with very
serious problems. While this less-than-expected performance can in large part
be attributed to the adverse economic conditions prevailing in the country
since 1979, optimistic appraisal assumptions and projections coupled with
weak supervision are also contributing factors. PISO Bank has recently taken
several steps to improve its project appraisal, and recent efforts to
strengthen its supervision unit are a positive development (paras. 6.09, 6.11,
and 7.16).
8.05      The lessons learned from the Bank's experience with PISO Bank during
the period under review are:
(a) striking a balance between rapid portfolio growth and tighter risk
control is an esential element for ensuring/maintaining an
institution's lasting financial soundness. While PIS0 Bank was
successful in achieving its growth objective, it could have done
better in the area of risk control through more rigorous project
appraisal and supervision. The Bank could have been more critical in
reviewing subprojects with a view to improving PISO's project
appraisal standards, and drawn to PISO's attention, in stronger
terms, the need for strengthening project supervision;
(b) a small/medium size financial institution such as PISO Bank is
vitally affected by changes in its environment. Although PISO
Bank's competitive position and its resiliency to weather a series
of external shocks have been enhanced through its conversion into a
thrift bank, its liquidity situation, portfolio quality, and its
ability to raise additional capital were severely affected by
developments outside of its control; and



- 24 -
(c)  small/specialized financial institutions such as pre-merger PISO
(investment house), which tend to have more difficulty than larger
and diversified financial institutions in effectively competing
during periods of economic distress and in an environment of
increasing competition, must adapt themselves quickly and decisively
to such conditions if they are to survive.

ANNEX 5
PHILIPPINES
PISO DEVELOPMENT BANK (LOAN 1555-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Reasons for Delays in Completion of Subprojects
A-1 Philippine Telephone and Telegraph Corp. - The two-year delay in the com-
pletion of the project was brought about by overoptimistic evaluation of
the project implementation schedule as acknowledged by the firm. No
extraordinary delays were encountered to pinpoint areas of fault as the
procurement and installation of the equipment were considered normal in
the business.
A-2 Republic Telephone Co. - Evaluation of the schedule of the expansion
project was overly optimistic. Delays were primarily caused by the pro-
longed contract negotiations between Retelco and the supplier, causing
delays in the opening of the LICs and the staggered delivery of the
equipment. The delivery of the balance of the equipment was also delayed
due to the firm's delay in payment for the first shipment of equipment
(the contract stated that payment should be made one year after the
equipment has performed satisfactorily). The merger of Retelco with PLDT
caused further delays as PLDT was reluctant to certify the satisfactory
performance of the equipment Retelco acquired. Completion of the project
was attained in January 1983.
A-4 Ferro Chemicals, Inc. - Delay in the procurement of equipment was brought
about by delay in the opening of the L/Cs. Furthermore, when the equip-
ment arrived, it was the start of the rainy season which hampered the
construction of the furnace. Even upon completion, commercial operations
could not be initiated as a new law was passed which imposed stricter
standards on antipollution devices. The project was delayed for
20 months.
B-1 Eastern Paper Mills, Inc. - Although the project was physically completed
as scheduled, commercial operations did not start until ten months after
the projected date due to technical problems encountered in the produc-
tion of linerboard. Commercial production of linerboard was short-lived
due to stiff competition, price undercutting and the availability of
cheaper, imported linerboard.
B-4 Floro Enterprises, Inc. - While acquisition and installation of the fixed
asset component of the project proceeded as scheduled, the expansion pro-
ject never started commercial operations due to marketing and financial
difficulties.
B-5  Filipinas Eslon Manufacturing, Inc. - Completion of the project was
delayed by eight months as brought about by the firm's decision to relo-
cate the expansion project in Mindanao (in lieu of Metro Manila) where
its existing operations and source of raw materials were located.
B-6 Transpacific Towage, Inc. - Changes in the specifications of the tugboat
to make it adaptable to island shipping delayed the delivery of the
vessel from Japan to the Philippines by five months.
B-9 Superior Pharmacraft, Inc. - Like Floro Enterprises, the fixed asset com-
ponents of the project proceeded as scheduled. However, the expansion
project never started commercial operations due to management and
financial problems.

PISO DEVELOPMENT BANK (LOAN 1555-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Status and History of the 'Ielve Subprojects
A-1 Philippine Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (PT&T) - PTUT's completion of its
expansion project was delayed for two years. However, segments of the
project were made operational as soon as they were delivered and ins-
talled. In the last two years of operations, the firm's consolidated
statements showed gains of P 241,000 in 1981 and P 6.5 million in 1982.
The corporation's lower than expected profit in 1981 was attributed to
the acquisition of a small telecommunication firm-operating nationwide.
Said acquisition was part of management's plan to penetrate further out-
lying areas of the country.
A-2 Republic Telephone Company (Retelco) - Although the completion of
Retelco's expansion project was delayed by 30 months, it is wortlwhile to
note that some segments of the project were operational as far back as
1980 and 1981. The firm, however, has been up to date in the servicing
of its loan account.  Retelco's merger with Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co. (PLDT), the largest telephone company in the Philippines,
on February 14, 1981, not only beefed up the company's contribution to
the socioeconomic development of the country but was also in accordance
with the Government's efforts in rationalizing the telecommunications
industry. The merger minimizes cutthroat intraindustry competition and
rationalizes the nationwide development/dispersion of telephone facil4
ties. As a public utility, the firm is ensured modest margins In its
operations and continued survival through Government assistance and
incentives.
A-3  Rubberworld Philippines, Inc. - The firm is maintaining its leadership in
the country's footwear industry. This company has remained in PISO
Bank's list of prime accounts since its availment of the IBRD facility.
As of end-1982, the firm's current ratio stood at 1.33x while total lia-
bilities to total net worth was at 2.5x. Sales have grown at an annual
rate of over 12X; gross and net margins for 1982 were 31X and 4.3X, res-
pectively.
A-4 Ferro Chemicals, Inc. - Due to its linkage to the steel industry, the
project suffered as a result of the prolonged recession. Further, fre-
quent power interruptions in the Mindanao region affected the company's
operations. However, as of September 1983, the firm managed to reach
breakeven sales and the rest of the year was expected to show brighter
prospects. It is expected that with the revival of the steel industry,
the company will fare as was originally projected. The proponent has
offered to prepay its loan, but CBP approval seemed remote. As such,
Ferro Chemicals, Inc. agreed to update its loan account before the end of
November .1983.

B-1 Eastern Paper Mills, Inc. - Due to the prevailing depressed market for
kraft paper, the firm suspended operations in December 1982. However, it
has managed to service its obligations, including the IBRD loan, through
the assistance of its sister companies. With the Government's strict
clampdown on importations, it is expected that the firm will once again
regain its competitiveness since its raw materials are all available
locally. The firm is currently evaluating the situation, in consultation
with its creditors, to ascertain the continued viability of its opera-
tions. The firm plans to resume operations in 1984 upon the exhaustion
of its finished goods inventory and the expected stabilization of the
market.
B-2 Pacific Rayon Manufacturing, Inc. - The company's cash flow has been cri-
tically affected due to difficulties encountered in the collection of its
receivables. This was further compounded by the depletion of the firm's
working capital, as it temporarily used its own funds to acquire machin-
ery and equipment for its second expansion project which is to be funded
through PISO Bank's ADB facility, disbursements of which have been
delayed. The firm, however, has been paying its arrearages on a monthly
basis. With the disbursement of the ADB funds expected before the end of
November 1983, the firm's cash flow was expected to normalize. Further-
more, with the brightening prospects for garment exports, collection of
the firm's receivables was expected to normalize.
B-3 Analu Manufacturing, Inc. - The untimely demise of the firm's president
and founder created succession problems in that the children were ill-
prepared to take over the management of the firm. Furthermore, the ram-
pant smuggling of designer shoes from Hongkong and Taiwan, coupled with
the proliferation of cheap imitations of designer shoes, spelled disaster
to what was considered to be a good market for name-brand ladies shoes.
The real estate mortgages have been foreclosed while the chattel mortga-
ges had already been scheduled for legal action sometime in November or
December 1983.
B-4 Floro Enterprises, Inc. - The project was never implemented. Primary
reasons which lead to the dissipation of the firm's working capital were
the unprofitable performance of three of its operating divisions
(opthalmic, computer and photographic/sunglass divisions) and the hiring
of expatriates as required by their licenses which resulted in oppressive
overheads. Furthermore, the firm's decision to hasten its inventory
buildup of computers as a hedge against price increases and the peso
devaluation backfired when computer sales slumped and it was left with
costly, nonmoving finished goods inventory. Also, stiff competition from
imported brands affected the project's viability. Some real estate -
mortgages have been foreclosed, to be followed by the balance which are
still under legal proceedings.

B-5  Filipinas Eslon Mfg., Inc. - Malversption by the firm's key operating
officers affected the firm's competitive advantage and working capital
position. Rehabilitation plans are presently being studied by the credi-
tors.
B-6 Transpacific Towage, Inc. - The firm has performed better than expected
in the past few years with trends indicating further positive growth.
The firm's rapid growth has been brought about by the increase in both
domestic and international shipping activities in the country. Since
interisland shipping is still undoubtably the cheapest means to transport
food, raw materials and finished products in the archipelago, any
increase in shipping activities favorably affects the firm. To cope with
the increasing demand for towage and salvaging operations, the firm has,
in the past four years, acquired five new tugboats, a floating crane and
several barges. These acquisitions were funded tbrough PISO Bank's ADB
relending facility, a lease facility with PISO Leasing Corp., another
private development finance institution, and internally generated
funds. Increases in oil prices are not expected to adversely affect the
firm, as cost escalations are passed on directly to its customers.
B-7 Delta Motors Corp. - Overextended borrowings and unhealthy intercompany
transactions jeopardized the firm's financial position. This was further
aggravated by the failure of the Government's PTMP (Progressive Truck
Manufacturer's Program) of which the firm was a member. While said pro-
gram was supposed to provide an incentive for truck manufacturers in
terms of high tariffs on imported, brand-new and rebuilt trucks and
buses, this was not the case. The firm i8 presently being operated by a
management committee composed of PNB (the major creditor), the proponents
and their Japanese partners. Arrangements regarding the payment of the
firm'r arrearages and continued servicing of the firm's loan with PISO
had been finalized and were in the documentation stage.
B-9 Superior Pharmacraft, Inc. - Internal strife (between the major officers/
shareholders) destroyed what was once a profitable pharmaceutical opera-
tion. The result was a siphoning of company funds for personal gain and
the appointment of personal representatives in the management of the cor-
poration which, in turn, led to overlapping and conflicting interests.
The assets of the firm have since been foreclosed.

Gentlemen:
We read with interest tne Project Cinpletiom Report cn PISO Bank-
Loan 1555-PH. We found the report very amprehensive and exhaustive.
As requested, we would like to share with you some thoughts on certain
items covered in the report. For easy reference, we have indicated
the pertinent paragraph number where we have some ecmments.
hIGHLIGS
iar. Tio.
2        We wish to add that the unsatisfactory performance of the
(Noted in PCR, page         six subprojects was brought about by a number of factors
ii, footnote 1)             prinarily the worldwide recession, aggravated by the
extrenly unfavorable developments in the Philippine
ecmoncny.
4        There are t1ree important points which we would like to
bring up and these are:
a. Our discussions with our clients and our own assess-
ment indicate that the main reason for the severe
liquidity and, in scme cases, solvency problems of
a number of PISO's clients is the material1y adverse
environment which characterized the Philippine
ecocnmy during the last few years. As can be gleaned
from the economic indicators presented in Schedule 1,
the country's economic condition during the last few
years has been the worst ever in recorded history.

("Overly" has been deleted    b. We take strong exception to the observation that the
in PCR. PISO Bank's               appraisals of the projects were "overly optimistic"
observation is noted in           and that consequently, "unrealistic operational
PCR, page iv, footnote 2.)        performance expectations" were made. We wish to point
out that the projection on the operational and financial
perfori ce of a number of subp  jects appear to be
"overly optimistic" when ompared to the projectst
performance during the last few years because the
Philippine eoonomy covering this period nas been in
a major slump. The scenario has changed significantly
from the time the appraisals were made - 1979-1981, in
the case of IBRD projects The political and econamic
problems the country has been experiencing during tne
last few years are grave, with severe market ccntraction
coupled with high inflation rates, high interest costs,
and labor instahility. No one could have foreseen a
crisis of this magnitude.
c. Developnent projects, involving new enterprises or new
entrepreneurs, such as those financed in line with
encouragement from multilateral institutions, are highly
vulnereble to pressures from the econmic environment.
These companies do not have the necessary ingredients
for resiliency.  Their markets a   not yet well established
and manageient experience and expertise is untested. In
ontrast, established firms are able to withstand outside
pressures and adapt easily to the changing environment
because of their inherent strength and depth of resources.

We also presented in 1981 a proposal to another
multilateral creditor for a $2.0 million loan to the
leading diversified construction company (the only major
one still making money'- The proposal was not
favorably acted upon by the multilateral institution
widch deemed the company  nondevelopmental in nature.
If these two loans were granted, they would
represent a substantial portion (approximately 13%)
of our portfolio and would have significantly improved
the portfolio's overall quality and performance. It
will be noted that these two companies continue to be
among the prime borrowers with excellent payment
record.
In early 1984, we started to consider granting
so-called non-risk loans (secured by deposits or
comparable assets), as given the harsh economic conditions.
However, our creditors disoouraged us fron giving
these types of loans, since these were not deemed
developmental and we were urged to absorb credit risks.
If we had been allowed to pursue these loans with
prime collaterals, the quality of our portfolio would
have greatly improved.
We wish to emphasize, however, that we continue
to actively pursue small and medium sized loans to
development projects. As shown in Annex 13 of your
report, 63% of the loans granted (in texms of number)
during the period 1979-1983 were either small or
medium sized with amounts of P3.5 million or less.
S             One of the major points raisea in this paragraph and
(The PCR covers the period 1978-   in a few other sections in the report proper was that

5.4               The two teleccmummcation coapanies referred to and
}Rlbberrld, Phils., Ir&., a large footwear company,
which are clients of PISO, are good examples of
established firms serving as PISO's "saving grace"
in these difficult times.
6.04, 6.09        The modular type of organization was implemented
primarily to enoourege campetition among the different
marketing groups. PISO was aware of the fact that
although the nxduiLar type of organization encourages
competitior., this might be achieved at the expense
of output's quality. As a safeguard, therefore,
the Management Investment Committee (MIC) was
constituted. The MIC is a camittee ocomposed of top
management people, including the heads of the
different operating groups. It is charged with
reviewing all project appraisal reports and approving
the corresponding loan proposals prior to
presentation to the Board.

instituted after the departure of the six key

major positions vacated have been filled through

COMMENTS FROM THE BORROWER              TPOs." 419-G.3 toC 5

Director, Operations Evaluation Dept.

Dear Mr. Watanabe:
Re: Project Completion Report - Philippines: PISO Development
Bank (Loan lSSS-PH)
Thank you for sending us a copy of the abovementioned report and for
Ilowing us to give our comments.
Overall, we think that PISO has performed very well relative to the
experience of other DFIs and in the context of the extremely un-
favorable economic environment over the last four years, and further,
considering that it is the first Bank loan to PI90 and that PISO under-
went a major reorganization during the period of project implementation.
Rate of Utilization (Para. 5.01)
PIS0 Bank was able to comit the Bank loan nine months ahead of the
expected full disbursement period. We think that this unexpectedly

this to be the main reason for the uneven quality of PISO's appraisal
reports and the lack of rigorous analysis of and critical judgment on
clients' project proposals. Based on Annex 8, Table 2 (Status and
Hlistory of the Twelve Subprojects), there seems to be validity in
this view. Hfiowever, it is not only the project proposal per se that
needs closer review but also the overall robustness of the proponent.

Project Appraisal (Para. 6.09)
The PCR observed that PISO's appraisal of subprojects tended to be
overly optimistic (particularly about estimates/evaluation of project
implementation timetables, contingency provisions for possible cost
overruns, and market prospects). Again, while the factors identified
to be contributory to the uneven quality of appraisal may be valid,
certain factors may be largely unforeseeable such as those associated
with delays. In fact, reasons given for the delays are conmonly en-
countered in public investment projects as well despite prior expe-
riences of executing agencies.
Conclusions (Para. 8.02)
We agree with the PCR that the Bank also could have reviewed sub-
projects more critically at appraisal and during supervision consis-
tent with the provisions of the Loan Agreement (Article II, Sec. 2.02
(a), (b); Sec. 2.04 (a), (b); and Article IV, Sec. 4.01 (a).)
We hope that the above comments will be useful for the final evaluation
of the project.
Best regards.
Very truly yours,
AssiZstant Diredtor-General
