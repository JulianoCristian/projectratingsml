designed to assist the\n            Philippine Government in realizing its objective of\n            expanding and diversifying the institutional capacity of\n            financial intermediaries capable of mobilizing and\n            allocating medium- and long-term resources to development\n            projects in the industrial sector. In particular, it would\n            develop the capacity of PISO, a private financial\n            institution, to initiate and expand its medium- and\n            long-term lending operations. The proposed loan will be used\n            by PISO for making sub-loans to finance foreign exchange\n            requirements of projects mainly in manufacturing. In\n            addition to the institutional improvements for which this\n            project provides, there are a number of financial and\n            industrial sector issues which the Government would need to\n            address within the next few years. The effectiveness of PISO\n            in mobilizing and allocating financial (particularly local)\n            resources will, to an important degree, depend on the policy\n            adjustments which the Government makes in the coming years.\n            Apart from these broader sectoral concerns, there are no\n            special risks associated with the project."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
