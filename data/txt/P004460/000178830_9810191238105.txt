STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
Recent Developments
1.01      The manufacturing sector developed rapidly up to the mid-fifties,
the result of a highly sheltered import substitution drive, then entered
into a prolonged period of slow growth. Although investment activities
seemed to improve in late 1972 the sector was particularly affected by the.
recession in the second half of 1974 and its growth rates dropped to below 5%
in 1974 and 1975, while gross value added in the manufacturing sector grew by
4.8% in 1974 (13.9% in 1973), 3.5% in 1975 and 5.8% in 1976 (in constant
prices). Sectors which have shown lower growth rates (at constant prices)
over the past three years and which by the end of 1976 had not recovered to
the high production levels of 1973, include wood and wood products, petroleum
and coal products, metal production and nonelectrical machinery. Some other
sectors, however, showed satisfactory annual growth rates including transport
equipment (15.1%), publishing and printing (10.3%), textiles (8.8%), and
paper and paper products. Food processing, the largest manufacturing
sector accounting for 26% of the gross value added in manufacturing, grew by
5.6%. The manufacturing sector now represents the second largest sector in
the Philippine economy accounting for 24% of GDP in 1976, absorbing about
one-third of fixed investment and providing employment for around 11% of the
total labor force./I
1.02      Preliminary estimates of production for the first half of 1977
indicate that the modest growth performance of 1976 continued in 1977. The
physical volume of manufacturing production grew by an estimated 4.7% in the
first half of 1977, compared to 4.4% during the same period of 1976. Growth
leaders during the first half of 1977 include textiles, clothing, chemicals
petroleum, base metals, fabricated metal products and machinery and
equipment.
Structure of Manufacturing Industry
1.03      The following table shows the changes in the sectoral composition
of manufacturing since 1970.
/I The contribution of the manufacturing sector to employment in the
Philippines is discussed in more detail in paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14.

While manufacturing value added grew at an average annual rate of 6.8% over
the six-year period, the relative sectoral share did not change significantly.
The first half of the period saw intermediate goods increase their share of
total value added at the expense of consumer goods which subsequently regained
some of the lost ground, and during 1976 accounted for 52.5% of total gross
value added. The fastest growing sector was chemicals and rubber products
(16.5%), followed by beverages and tobacco, printing and publishing and trans-
port equipment (9.6% each). Exports may be classified in two categories:
traditional manufactures (including sugar, coconut products, plywood, veneer,
etc.) and nontraditional manufactures (including electrical machinery,
electronics, garments, handicrafts, etc.).  Traditional export products
proved very vulnerable to slackening of demand in export markets and slumping
world market prices. However, nontraditional manufactured exports have begun
rising rapidly in recent years; the average annual growth rate has been 34%
during 1970-76.
1.04      The manufacturing sector is predominantly privately owned and is
generally concentrated in large-scale, relatively capital-intensive units.
In 1973-74, medium and large-scale enterprises accounted for around 88% of



-3-
industrial value added. In terms of employment, however, the small-scale
sector (establishments with 1-50 workers) is considerably more important, and
in 1973-1974 employed close to 1 million people, or 68% of the total indus-
trial labor force. Of the total share of the small-scale sector in gross
industrial value added, roughly one half is accounted for by firms employing
less than 5 workers, and the remaining half by establishments employing 5-49
workers.
1.05      Geographically, manufacturing enterprises are concentrated in the
Greater Manila area and its adjoining provinces. Statistical data relating
to industrial establishments employing five or more workers indicate that the
Greater Manila area alone accounted for 39% of all such establishments, 59%
of total industrial employment, 49% of gross value added, and 43% of total
fixed assets. If the adjoining Luzon province is also included, these per-
centages would rise by a further 20-30%. The geographic concentration of
industrial enterprises in and around Manila has not lessened in recent years.
Industrial Investment
1.06      Capital expenditures for durable equipment in the manufacturing
sector in 1975 increased at the high rate of 27%, reflecting investment
decisions made in 1973 and 1974 when the strong economy encouraged entre-
preneurs to expand. From the beginning of 1975 onwards, the commitment rate
for new investments steadily declined reflecting the slow investor response to
the recession which had first begun to be felt in mid-1974. This was accompanied
by a drop in the paid-in capital of new business organizations registered
during 1975. The declining trend in investments was also confirmed by the
Economic Development Foundation's survey of business expectations which showed
a clear downward trend in investment plans through 1975 from the peak levels of
1973 and 1974. For a brief period between March-May 1976, investment plans
rose sharply with the business community perceiving encouraging signs of
recovery in the U.S. and Japan (based on economic data released in the first
quarter). However, later indications that the worldwide recovery was slower
than initially expected caused another sharp dip in investments from July
1976 onwards. Actual growth of expenditures on durable equipment in the
manufacturing sector fell to 5% in 1976 (from 27% in 1975) and since overall
economic recovery has been slow domestically as well as abroad, it is not
expected to grow significantly in 1977.
Industrial Sector Issues and Policies
1.07      As outlined in the World Bank Economic Report,/1 industrial growth
in the Philippines will need to be based on balanced investment expansion in
export industries coupled with the diversification of intermediate and
consumer goods production for the domestic market. In terms of scale, the
World Bank report suggests that the "only rational policy appears to be one
that encourages the development of the most efficient industries regardless
of size." However, the analysis indicates that traditional cottage-type

Bank, June 1976.

industries are unlikely to play a significant role in future industrializa-
tion although they will need to be relied upon to maintain their present
employment levels over the next decade. It also stresses the importance of
reviving and sustaining growth in the labor-intensive modern small and medium
industries sector and orienting the output of this sector toward export
products. Investment in a few large, capital-intensive projects is needed to
strengthen the industrial structure and make greater use of the country's
natural resources.
1.08      The following is an outline of some major industrial issues facing
Philippine policy makers together with policy measures, some of which are
already in effect, that would ensure industrialization in the Philippines
moves in the right direction.
Rationalization of the Tariff System
1.09      The Government is rationalizing the fiscal and tariff incentive
system to ensure conformity with current development goals. The highly
differentiated structure of tariff rates presently in effect has remained
basically unchanged since 1973. In the near term, tariff reforms should aim
at a reduction of excessive protective rates, while in the long term, nominal
tariffs should be levelled at an average rate of 20-30%. Higher protective
rates, justified by development plans for specific industries, should even-
tually be phased out in accordance with time schedules set up in these plans.
The Government has started correcting tariff distortions by reducing the
number of items subject to the highest protective rates of 70% and 100% and
limiting tariff exemptions. The Tariff Commission is holding hearings on the
reduction of high tariffs that protect about 300 industries. As an export
incentive a tax deferral for tariff duties on imported capital equipment was
substituted in 1976 for the exemption previously granted. However, little
progress on tariff reform has been made because of delays in the outcome of
slow-moving international trade negotiations, the need for improvement in
procedures for protection against dumping, and strong resistance to proposed
changes in the industries affected.
1.10      Developments and Issues Related to Nontraditional Exports.  During
the 1950s and 1960s, the Philippines followed an industrialization strategy
based upon import substitution under highly protectionistic policies. At the
same time, the peso remained overvalued for long periods of time. The result
was that exporters were not only discouraged but even penalized since they had
to pay more for their intermediate goods and earned less domestic currency for
their exports. It was realized that exports in general, and nontraditional
exports in particular, needed to be encouraged to relieve what had become a
serious balance of payments constraint on growth. Consequently, a series of
corrective measures were taken such as fiscal incentives for investments
and exports under the Investment Incentive Act (1967) and the Export Incentive
Act (1970), devaluation of the peso in 1967 and 1970 which was subsequently
allowed to float, import duty rebates granted to exporters, and the estab-
lishment of an Export Processing Zone to facilitate access to imported
materials. These measures resulted in an increase of nontraditional exports
during 1968-72. During 1973-76 the export of nontraditional manufactured
goods grew dramatically, increasing almost fivefold; the increase in volume



was less dramatic but still impressive. The three leading product lines in
this expansion were garments, handicrafts, and electrical and electronic
components. This development was mainly attributable to the corrective
measures, to export promotion, and to procedural improvements initiated by
the Board of Investment. In addition, the strong demand pull from the
international boom in 1972-73 probably played an important role in the
initial export takeoff and the establishment of marketing contacts.
1.11      To maintain the recent momentum, further institutional support is
now necessary to strengthen contacts with foreign markets, simplify export
procedures, improve credit resources, and establish trading houses. To this
end, a Philippine Export Council comprising both public and private represen-
tatives has been established to study and make recommendations on various
aspects of export promotion; a study for the establishment of large trading
houses on the pattern of South Korea and Japan is under preparation; the
Government has established a public sector trading corporation for trade with
the socialist countries; various credit agencies are making an effort to
expand credit to the export oriented industry; and a Presidential Decree has
been issued to simplify export procedures. Implementation of these proposals
should help maintain a 25-30% annual growth rate in nontraditional exports at
least in the near future. Equally important, however, is access to markets
in industrialized countries on favorable terms.
1.12      Most of the export promotion measures adopted so far have only
compensated for the existing bias towards import substitution. Differ-
ential rates of protection combined with selective export incentives to
various industries are still producing less than optimal overall industrial
and export growth and could lead to development of a dualistic industrial
structure that might not be viable in the longer term. Therefore, to ratio-
nalize the industrial structure and to provide a solid domestic base for
future growth of industry and exports, it is necessary to move toward a
freer trade regime by removing import restrictions and reducing tariffs.
Such a regime would especially help the smaller and less organized firms
which have not fully benefited from the facilities of bonded warehouses and
tax and tariff incentives.
1.13      Employment Creation.  Except for the past two years, Philippine
industrialization has done little to alleviate unemployment and underemploy-
ment. Between 1960 and 1971, employment in manufacturing grew at an annual
rate of about 2.5%, while between 1971 and 1974 it did not grow at all.
Employment growth rates in the manufacturing sector were, however, higher in
1975 (7.6%) and 1976 (8.4%). The share of manufacturing in total employment
has actually dropped from 12.1% in 1960 to 10.4% in 1974 and is estimated to
have reached 10.9% in 1976.  Confronted with an estimated 3% growth in the
labor force over the next decade, the economy will have to provide almost
500,000 new jobs annually over this period. Because the absorptive capacity
in the agricultural sector is low, the provision of more work opportunities
in the manufacturing sector will be crucial.
1.14      The industrial incentives system has been strongly biased in favor
of the use of capital. For instance, over the period 1970-71, 80% of the
total estimated amount of tax relief enjoyed by 301 BOI-approved projects was



-6-
due to capital-favoring incentives. Attempts to counterbalance this bias by
introd&cing incentives for the use of labor in the modern sector have
had limited success. But the overall industrial employment picture did
not show any improvement because of an absolute decline of employment in the
large traditional cottage sector and stagnant employment in mining. If
the manufacturing sector is to provide a substantial share of the required
job opportunities, then labor-intensive export industries and some inter-
mediate and capital goods industries with a ready domestic market offer the
best hope of achieving this objective.  The Government has introduced some
policy changes and is currently reviewing the entire incentive system to make
it more conducive to employment, export and import substitution needs.
1.15      Promotion of Small-Scale Industry.  As in many other countries, the
small-scale sector faces many problems and artificial disadvantages usually
stemming from incentives systems favoring the large-scale sector. Ineffi-
ciencies caused by lack of expertise in organization, management and choice
of technology, difficulties in penetrating the market, deficiencies in the
quality and suitability of machinery and equipment employed, restricted
access to institutional sources of finance and difficulties in formulating
and implementing project concepts are some of the areas of concern. Recent
government efforts have made some progress. The basic organizational framework
has been set up to provide a wide range of technical services and expertise.
A fairly widespread program (MASICAP) has existed since 1973 to help small
businessmen formulate projects and this has led to financing of a substantial
number of projects by various financial institutions. In 1975, with assistance
from the Bank through a small component of Loan 1120-PH, the Department of
Industry began to establish Small Business Advisory Centers (SBACs), of which
there were 12 by July 1, 1977, which would form a broad network of technical
assistance extension services to be provided to small and medium industries
throughout the country. Various financial programs have been set up designed
to provide easier access to institutional finance for small-scale industries.
DBP's Small and Medium Industries Program (partly financed by the Bank), the
Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (see para. 2.10) (also partly financed by
the Bank), and PDCP's Small Business Program are some examples.
1.16      Despite the progress made so far, more could be done.  Well-organized
producers and traders cooperatives could perform many useful functions on
behalf of small industrialists, particularly in such areas as loan mediation,
organization of bulk purchases, joint marketing services, dissemination of
technical advice, and training. The links between small and large-sized
industries also need to be expanded, for instance by establishing information
exchanges to provide supply and demand and technological information. The
Government has successfully set up various organizations and mechanisms for
the promotion of small industries, but there is little knowledge available on
the existing cottage and other small-scale industries, and on potential
growth areas. A comprehensive survey of the small-scale sector is needed, as
are subsectoral and regional studies. As a result of the planned programs of
rural electrification, the growth in rural incomes, the labor-intensive
exports drive, and the policy of industrial decentralization, a fresh look
into new opportunities for small producers is becoming increasingly necessary.
Planning authorities might consider establishing a separate unit to study
these issues on a permanent basis.



-7-
1.17      Regional Dispersion of Industry.  As outlined earlier, manufac-
turing activity in the Philippines is heavily concentrated in the Greater
Manila area and its surrounding provinces. The Government, well aware
of the consequences of increasing regional imbalances, has undertaken several
steps to check expansion in the Manila area and to create conditions for more
balanced growth in the future. These steps include: fiscal incentives to
encourage projects to locate in less developed areas (these, however, have
had little impact); promotional measures by the BOI such as regional seminars
and an experimental regional development pilot program in Northern Mindanao;
BOI's practice of negotiating the location of a project before it is approved;
a ban on the establishment of new plants within a 50 km radius of Manila,
except for export industries; and the requirements that financial institutions
in the provinces allocate 75% of their accumulated deposits for loans to
projects in their respective areas.  These measures may have had a positive
impact but judging from the latest figures on BOI-sponsored projects in
recent years, it is obvious that new and stronger efforts are needed to shift
the balance of industrial investment in favor of other provinces. A real
shift in the balance of industrial growth will take place only when it occurs
in labor-intensive sectors, such as wood processing, textiles, and the
production of other goods for mass consumption and export.
1.18      The provision of adequate supporting infrastructure, such as
electricity, water, transportation and communications, financial and technical
services, and the availability of qualified labor are essential to direct
investment into desired locations. Fiscal incentives without such infra-
structure are unlikely to induce many new investments in the outer provinces
and with such infrastructure, are probably unnecessary. The Government has
launched several programs to improve the basic infrastructure in areas
outside Manila (such as substantial electricity generation projects in
Mindanao and the Visayas, road construction, and a ten-year shipping and
shipbuilding program). These efforts should be continued and extended to
other types of infrastructure as well as to other regions. To promote the
creation of areas of industrial concentration outside Manila, the Government
in recent years has put considerable emphasis on planning and promoting the
establishment of industrial estates and export-processing zones in a few
selected growth centers. It is possible that many of these export-oriented
projects would have been established anyway, even if the Manila area had been
closed to them. Therefore, a modification of this policy, together with the
establishment of more free trade zones and bonded factories and warehouses in
the outer regions, could greatly contribute to an effective decentralization
of industries.
Prospects
1.19      The manufacturing sector has continued to grow at the modest
historical rate of about 7%, with production rising by 6% in 1976 and an
estimated 7% in 1977. In 1978, both exports and government expenditure
should give increased stimulus to the economy. With incomes once again
rising as fast as production due to the stabilization of the term of trade,
consumption demand should also revive. The result should be increased
manufacturing output followed by a revival of private investment.



- 8 -
1.20      Over the medium to long term, the Government is committed to a
strategy that includes emphasis on accelerated industrialization, both
in capital-intensive basic industries and labor-intensive export indus-
tries. The performance of the industrial sector will have to improve
significantly if the Philippines is to be reasonably successful in easing
the foreign exchange constraint and particularly in expanding productive
employment, as at least 75,000 jobs a year will need to be provided by the
industrial sector by the early 1980s. To achieve these targets the
Philippines will need to expand investment in export industries and in a
wide range of intermediate goods industries where domestic demand prospects
are reasonably good. According to the Government's Five-Year Development
Plan (1978-82), the manufacturing sector is expected to grow at an annual
rate of 9% over the five-year period. To achieve this target, investments
will have to grow at an annual rate of 15.5% (from $1.7 billion in 1977 to
nearly $3 billion in 1982), of which about 65% would go to larger industries.
1.21      Finished consumer goods industries producing for the domestic
market are generally labor-intensive; their accelerated growth would therefore
be very beneficial in terms of employment generation and low-cost investment.
While the prospects are not bright for further growth of the traditional
cottage industry, which still employs over two-thirds of the industrial labor
force, there is considerable potential for developing the modern small-scale
sector in such areas as food processing, handicrafts and apparel. Domestic
demand should rise in the future as a result of rising incomes. A large
group of intermediate goods industries also offers room for accelerated
growth and significant foreign exchange savings in the decade ahead.
Domestic demand in these areas is likely to rise much faster than in most
final demand categories. In addition to import replacement, industry will
have to play a much greater role in the country's exports. After allowing
for the probable increase in agricultural and mineral exports, some $4 bil-
lion of nontraditional manufactured exports would be needed by 1985 (compared
to $550 million in 1976) to finance the projected level of imports. Indus-
tries with significant export potential include, clothing, leather goods.,
handicrafts, electronics, and nickel and copper goods.
2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Overview
2.01      The Philippines has a relatively well developed and increasingly
sophisticated financial system. The core of the system is a large commercial
banking sector, both local and foreign, regulated by the Central Bank of the
Philippines. There are in addition two specialized development finance
institutions providing long-term capital, and a variety of other financial
institutions, e.g. investment houses, savings and loan associations, rural
banks, regional development banks, etc. The Land Bank was recently revi-
talized to finance the Government's agrarian reforms. The Government has
also encouraged the rapid development of a network of small independently
owned and operated rural banks and private development banks which concen-
trate on providing financial resources in their localities. In late 1976 the
Government allowed the establishment of Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) and



- 9 -
expanded Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs) to undertake foreign currency
credit operations. There is also a well developed and very active short-term
money market on which a variety of commercial and industrial issues are
traded. Although three stock exchanges exist, activity on them is concen-
trated on a few speculative issues. Lease financing and mortgage financing
are also relatively less developed.
Institutional Structure
2.02      Commercial Banks.  As of December 31, 1976, there were 25 privately-
owned domestic commercial banks, and two government-owned, plus four foreign
banks with branches in the Philippines. Commercial banks operate under a
branch banking system with over 1,100 branches and offices and are the main
source of working capital and trading credits. The largest bank is the
government-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB) with almost 200 branches,
which accounted for over 36% of the banking system's total assets (P 80.0 bil-
lion) at the end of 1976. The commercial banking system has grown rapidly
over the past five years, increasing its assets almost fourfold. Domestic
credit provided by commercial banks during the first seven months of 1976
amounted to P 72 billion, 28% of which went to the manufacturing sector,
mainly for short-term working capital. To strengthen and rationalize the
commercial banking system, the Central Bank instituted a program aimed at
doubling the system's capital base to P 3 billion which by the end of 1975
was exceeded by almost 20%. The program also encouraged increased equity
participation by foreign banks in commercial banks and other intermediaries
(by the middle of 1977, 11 foreign banks and financial institutions held
equity interests in 8 domestic banks) and provided a much needed plan of bank
consolidation and merger which resulted in bringing the number of commercial
banks down to 27 from 34 in 1973.
2.03      Development Finance Institutions.  Two institutions, the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and PDCP are the main providers of long-term
finance with DBP by far the larger of the two (total assets of P 12.7 billion
compared to PDCP's P 867 million at the end of 1976). During FY76 DBP
extended a total of P 3.9 billion in financial assistance. As of June 30,
1976, DBP had over 247,000 loans outstanding, amounting to P 6.4 billion. Of
these, industrial loans accounted for the greatest share (50%), while over
200,000 agricultural loans accounted for 82% of the total loans. DBP's
resources come from government equity contributions, deposits (principally of
the Government), borrowings from the Central Bank, sale of bonds, foreign
borrowings guaranteed by the Government, and internal cash generation.
Nearly all of DBP's resources come either directly from public funds or are
raised with government support. Its securities carry relatively low interest
rates that would make them unattractive except for such special features as
exemption from taxation and eligibility for reserve requirements. Because of
the sheer volume and diversity of its operations, DBP plays a prominent and
unique role in Government financing of economic development.
2.04      Although PDCP is considered an investment bank under Philippine law,
its main business is the extension of long-term loans which accounted for 81%



- 10 -
of its total assets as of June 30, 1977. PDCP also makes equity investments,
provides guarantees, underwriting and private placement of equity and debt
instruments and syndicates loans. Its operations are mainly geared towards
assisting private manufacturing enterprises but it also assists all other
productive sectors which are considered economically beneficial. Up to now,
PDCP's main resources were loans from IBRD and ADB (88%) and equity contri-
butions (8%).
2.05      Rural Banks.  The rural banking system consists of approximately
800 privately-owned banks in rural areas with total assets at the end of 1976
of P 3 billion with a deposit base of P 850 million. Ninety-three percent of
the loans made by rural banks during 1976 were for agricultural purposes,
mostly seasonal production credits. The Government supports the growth of
rural banks by providing counterpart equity contributions, loans and technical
assistance from the Central Bank along with tax exemption privileges and
special rediscounting schemes to supplement their credit extension abilities.
Over the past five years rural banks have grown almost fourfold, slightly more
rapidly than the banking system as a whole.
2.06      Private Development Banks (PDBs).  These institutions, of which
there are now 33, have been promoted by DBP in various regions (with assis-
tance similar to that provided by the Central Bank to rural banks) to spe-
cialize in the mobilization and lending of long-term resources for small
local ventures. As of December 31, 1976, PDBs' total assets amounted to
about P 482 million with a deposit base of P 139 million. Outstanding loans
and investments of PDBs as of end-1976 totaled about P 382 million,
three fourths of which were in the form of medium and long-term loans.
During 1976, PDBs made loans totaling P 242 million. Agricultural loans
accounted for about 49% of total lending while industrial loans accounted for
26%, the remainder being for trading/commercial firms (15%) and consumption
(10%).
2.07      Savings Banks.  There are 10 savings banks in the Philippines with
a network of around 60 branches. Drawing funds mainly from households and
industrial savers in the form of time deposits, these thrift institutions had
aggregate total assets of P 2 billion and deposits of P 1.3 billion as
of December 31, 1976. Savings banks lend mostly for housing and real
estate, although in the past few years an increasing proportion of their
resources have been channeled into government securities (24% of total
portfolio in 1976).
2.08      Savings and Loan Associations (SLAs).  SLAs, of which there are
200, can be either "stock" companies (132) i.e. they can engage in deposit
and banking business with the public at large or "nonstock" companies (68)
which means they are limited in their banking transactions to members only
(credit union). Almost two thirds of all SLAs are located in the Greater
Manila area. As of January 31, 1977 SLAs total assets were about P 511 mil-
lion with a deposit base of P 371 million. Most of the business of "stock"
SLAs concerns financing of home mortgages while nonstock associations



- 11 -
specialize in personal consumption loans. With the assistance of Central
Bank, SLAs have begun diversifying their lending operations to finance
agricultural and home-based cottage industries.
2.09      Other Term-financing Institutions.  Several other institutions
provide term finance, a very small proportion of which goes to industry.
These include: private investment houses, insurance companies, and
pension and trust funds including the Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS) and the Social Security System (SSS), whose resources for industry
are lent mainly through DBP. While the outstanding loan portfolios of
GSIS and SSS totaled about P 6.1 billion at December 31, 1976, the bulk
of their lending is for real estate (53%) and consumer loans (19%).
2.10      The Investment Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF).  IGLF is a long-term
compensatory financing and guarantee fund owned by NEDA and administered by
the Central Bank. It was established with USAID assistance in 1952 to
encourage private banking institutions to provide long-term financing to
small entrepreneurs. Its compensatory financing function is discharged
through a special time deposit provided to sponsoring banks at an interest
rate of 7% (to be on-lent at 12%). IGLF also provides an automatic guarantee
for 60% of the amount being loaned, at a cost to the borrower of 2% p.a. of the
guaranteed amount. As of March 31, 1977, ten institutions, five commercial
banks and five nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs), had been accredited
to the IGLF. Since 1974 the IGLF approved 626 loans totaling P 114.8 million
and at March 31, 1977 its total assets amounted to P 134.1 million.
2.11      Investment Houses.  Defined as any enterprise which engages in the
underwriting of corporate securities, an investment house is prohibited from
engaging in deposit banking business. However, it can engage in "quasi-banking"
operations by creating deposit substitutes. The minimum paid-in capital
requirement for an investment house is P 20 million and the majority must be
owned by Filipino nationals. There were 12 investment houses at the end of
1976 with 5 institutions dominating the industry. Most are linked with major
international financial institutions or large local commercial banks. Their
operations and revenues so far have been heavily based (about 80% on average)
on money market operations rather than on development of the securities market
or the provision of corporate merchant banking services. Total assets of the
investment houses amounted to about P 4.3 billion at the end of 1976. The
total capital base of the industry amounted to P 494 million, with paid-in
capital stock amounting to P 335 million. Over a third of paid-in capital
was contributed by foreign sources.  For eight years until 1974, the assets
of this segment of the financial sector grew at over 50% annually. However,
growth over the last two years has been about 8% only, mainly due to government
efforts to strengthen the commercial banking system and to curb the growth of
the short-term money market (see para. 2.17) as a means to develop the long
end of the market. The investment houses possess sophisticated financial
skills and have great potential for further development. However, their
development to date has not been in accordance with their aims at establish-
ment, largely because of inappropriate policies.

2.12      Finance Companies.  There are 194 finance companies registered
with the SEC, the 42 largest accounting for 80% of the total business.
These companies, mostly subsidiaries of major commercial banks, are heavily
engaged in financing consumer durables on installment payment plans, short
and medium-term credits for local manufacturers or traders for financing
inventory, receivables or transport equipment. A few such companies have
diversified into equipment leasing. Such firms typically rely on paid-in
capital and direct borrowings for cash generation; a few have successfully
placed-medium-term debentures with the public.  As at the end of 1976 total
assets of these companies stood at P 4.6 billion with a total capital base
of P 713 million and outstanding lending volume of P 3.6 billion.
2.13      Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) and Foreign Currency Deposit Units
(FCDUs). A significant development in the Philippine banking system was
the establishment in September 1976 of offshore banking facilities aimed at
developing Metro-Manila as a regional financial center. In addition the
Government has expanded the foreign currency lending authority of a number of
commercial banks that had been already acting as FCDUs.
2.14      Presidential Decree 1034 issued in September 1976 authorizes a
branch, subsidiary or affiliate of a foreign banking corporation, referred to
as OBU, to conduct banking transactions in foreign currencies involving the
receipt of funds, principally from external sources, and the subsequent
utilization of these funds for borrowers inside or outside the country.
Under the system, funds in foreign currencies which are accepted and held by
an OBU in the course of its business, are considered as "deposits." The
withdrawal of equivalent amounts of such funds including interest by owners
of the "deposits" is not subject to restrictions. These transactions are
primarily offshore operations. However, a certain amount of offshore-to-
onshore operations are permitted, subject to prior licensing by the Central
Bank. Presidential Decree 1035, also issued on September 1976, expands the
functions of the FCDUs by exempting them from the 15% reserve requirement to
be held in the form of foreign exchange deposits with the Central Bank and by
allowing them to extend up to the amount of foreign currency deposits, foreign
currency loans to any domestic enterprise. As a major incentive to encourage
foreign banks to set up OBUs, exemptions are provided from all forms of local
licenses, fees, dues, or any other local taxes or burdens. However, as with
transactions of FCDUs, a tax of 5% on offshore income is imposed. For gross
onshore income, a tax of 10% is imposed, based on the amount of gross interest
income from loans granted to onshore borrowers.  All regular commercial
banking income is subject to the usual corporate tax.
2.15      As of July 30, 1977, the Central Bank had approved 16 foreign banks
to operate OBUs in the country.  As of the same date, 4 branches of foreign
banks and 13 domestic commercial banks were authorized as expanded FCDUs. As
of August 10, 1977 most FCDUs and OBUs were occupied with organizational
matters with three OBUs having formally inaugurated their offices.
2.16      Suppliers' Credits.  Foreign commercial borrowings guaranteed by
domestic financial intermediaries (principally DBP) have in the past accounted
for 30-35% of total investment in manufacturing. At the end of 1976, the
private sector accounted for 43% of the outstanding external debt, just over



- 13 -
one half of which went to the manufacturing sector. Prior to 1970, such
borrowings were obtained on relatively hard terms. As a result of the
stringent debt management measures taken since 1970 by the Central Bank
and the substantial increases in export earnings, the burden of servicing such
debts has been reduced to a manageable level.
2.17      The Money Market.  The money market provides the mechanism through
which commercial banks and corporations keep their liquidity position in
4         balance.  There are basically three submarkets:  (a) government securities;
(b) interbank; and (c) intercompany.  The government securities market is the
principal segment, with the Government being the largest trader. The main
securities traded are short-term Treasury Bills, medium-term Central Bank
Certificates of Indebtedness (CBCIs) and Treasury Notes, and long-term
Progress Bonds issued by DBP. While direct trading in Treasury Bills is
heavy, trading in longer term securities is mainly "indirect," i.e., the
securities themselves are not traded but serve as collateral for "repurchase"
agreements. Participation in the intercompany market is restricted to firms
with prime credit ratings. Until January 1976, money market rates were not
subject to the statutory ceilings imposed on bank deposits. Hence there was
a rapid growth in deposit substitutes at the expense of traditional bank
deposits. In an attempt to mobilize savings through the banking institutions,
the Central Bank raised the interest rate on savings and time deposits and
regulated yields on money market instruments. Simultaneously, the minimum
denomination of deposit substitutes was raised from P 50,000 to P 200,000 for
instruments with less than two years maturity and P 100,000 for instruments
with longer maturities. In June 1977, a withholding tax of 35% on interest
paid on short-term financial instruments and 15% on savings and time deposits
was introduced.
2.18       The Securities Market.  The Philippine financial system does not
have an active stocks and bonds market. In recent years only a small propor-
tion of the capital expansion of Philippine corporations has been financed
through issues sold in the three stock exchanges which are located in Manila,
Makati, and Quezon City. New firms have generally been unable to sell
equities. The same applies to corporate bonds.
Recent Developments
2.19       Since 1975 the principal objectives of selective monetary and
credit policies have been to promote growth with stability, both in the
external and internal sectors, and to improve the mobilization of financial
resources and their allocation to priority sectors. In particular, monetary
policy was aimed at containing inflation and improving the external balance,
while selective credit policies were geared toward promoting growth through
financing investment expenditures. Major areas of concern for the authorities
included the shift of funds from commercial bank deposits to nonbank financial
institutions and deposit substitutes with commercial banks, and the inadequate
growth of facilities for medium and long-term financing. Both phenomena were
the result of low interest rate ceilings on deposit rates, Usury Law limits
on many lending rates and other administrative regulations. The problems
were exacerbated by high inflation during 1973-74 when real interest rates
became negative.



- 14 -
2.20       Total liquidity rose by 24% in 1976 and a further 10% during the
first six months of 1977 to P 39.6 billion as of June 30, 1977. Over the
past 18 months money supply grew by 27%. Various government measures to
check the growth of deposit substitutes seem to have been successful with
deposit substitutes increasing only 16% over the 18-month period ending June
30, 1977, after having more than doubled over the preceding two years. In
contrast, time and savings deposits which had grown only 30% during 1974/75
rose by 70% during the same period ending June 30, 1977. Outstanding
domestic credit grew by 24% in 1976 (30% in 1975) and during the first six
months of 1977 by only 5%, to reach P 50.5 billion. Through 1976 credit to
the public sector rose by 51%, to P 9.3 billion, mainly because of unusually
high credit demand by Philexco (the Government sugar marketing company).
During the first half of 1977, net credit to the Government declined by
P 0.2 billion, mainly for seasonal reasons and also Philexco's credit demand
was 8% below the previous year's level because of a changed sugar pricing
system and a sharp increase in sugar exports. Private sector credit grew
much more slowly, 18% in 1976 and only 3% in the first half of 1977, reaching
P 34.6 billion at June 30, 1977. The weak investment demand in the private
sector was caused by various factors, inter alia, the unfavorable outlook of
economic recovery, higher real cost of borrowing due to receding inflation,
and excess capacities resulting from the 1974/75 investment boom. After
having risen by 12% in 1973 and 40% in 1974, the growth of consumer prices
slowed markedly to 7% in 1975 and 6% in 1976. The rate for the first
half of 1977 was 7%, and for the next five years is expected to be between
7% and 8%.
2.21      During 1975/76, several measures were taken to strengthen and expand
the financial system. The final phase of the capital build-up program
for the banking system, which required every private domestic commercial bank
to increase its paid-in capital to at least P 100 million, was completed in
1975. As of the end of that year, the aggregate paid-up capital of domestic
commercial banks amounted to P 3.6 billion or P 400 million more than the
Central Bank target. The program also encouraged: (a) increased equity
participation by foreign banks in commercial banks and other intermediaries;
and (b) a much needed program of bank consolidation and merger which resulted
in reducing the number of commercial banks from 34 to 27 in 1973. In 1975,
the Central Bank also embarked on a program of more systematic and stringent
regulation of NBFIs and quasi-banking institutions. Other measures taken
toward increasing effective intermediation included opening the Central
Bank rediscounting window for thrift banks and encouraging the establishment
of bank branch offices, savings agencies and pawn shops in areas inadequately
served by commercial banks. At the beginning of 1976, the Central Bank
issued a series of circulars aimed at improving the interest rate structure
(see para. 2.23) and in September of that year issued two decrees on offshore
banking operations (see para. 2.14). On June 3, 1977 the Government issued a
decree instituting a 35% final transaction tax on interest earned on commercial
papers issued in the money market and set a 15% withholding tax on interest
paid on savings and time deposits. This measure was designed to improve tax



- 15 -
collection and increase borrowing rates on money market instruments, thus
reducing yields so that financial savers could be induced to place their
funds in medium and long-term deposits rather than in short-term money
markets.
2.22      Interest Rate Reform.  Until January 1976, the interest rates
charged by the banking system were governed by the Usury Laws which allowed a
maximum nominal rate of 12% p.a. As the discounting of interest due for up
to a maximum of a year was usually applied, the banks in fact realized an
effective yield of 13.6% and 16.3% depending on the security offered. In
addition, the Central Bank allowed financial institutions to charge service
fees ranging from 0.75% p.a. to 2% p.a. on a graduating scale. In 1974, in
response to tight money market conditions, interest rates on savings and
time deposits which ranged from 5-9% p.a. were increased to 6% and 11.% p.a.
In spite of the increase in the nominal rate of interest, the real rate of
interest continued to be negative.  While the banking sector was subject to
the following regulations, these did not apply to the nonbank financial
intermediaries (NBFI). The weighted average rates paid to investors on
comparable money market instruments were often twice as high or higher during
1974-75. As a result, there was a considerable flow of funds from deposits
to deposit substitutes issued both by banks and NFFIs.
2.23      At the beginning of 1976, the Central Bank enacted a series of
changes in interest rates and reserve requirements aimed at both the banking
sector and NBFSs. Maximum deposit rates were increased and, for the first
time, a distinction was made between short and long-term lending rates. The
major changes enacted were: ceilings on loans with maturities of more than
two years were raised to 19% p.a.; secured and unsecured loans of less than
two years continued to have a ceiling of 12% and 14% p.a. respectively
although a service charge of 2-3% p.a. could be added; the maximum yield on
money market instruments with maturities of up to two years, including all
charges, was set at 17% p.a.; all ceilings on yields of instruments with
maturities of over two years were removed. In the absence of official
statistics, it is not clear whether there has been a shift towards the
long-term end in the structure of deposits, but deposits as a whole have
risen quite fast since the beginning of 1976 at the expense of deposit
substitutes. On the credit side, while some investment houses and commercial
banks did arrange long-term peso loans, the market for medium and long-term
peso finance remained unproductive (the decline in LIBOR and the ready
availability of suppliers' credits to corporate clients at relatively low
rates may have been contributing factors). It is important to note that with
the unusual level of inflation in 1973-74 having been curbed, these measures
have resulted in real or positive rates of interest on loans, and positive
yields on savings; hence, they represent an important step toward rationa-
lizing the level and structure of interest rates.
2.24      In December 1977 further interest rate legislation was introduced.
The major changes were: the imposition of an effective interest rate ceiling,
exclusive of bank charges, of 12% and 14% p.a. for secured and unsecured
loans with maturities of under two years; the imposition of an effective
interest rate ceiling, inclusive of bank charges, of 19% for loans with
maturities exceeding two years; a reduction of the effective maximum yield,



- 16 -
inclusive of the 35% transaction tax and bank charges, from 17% to 16% on
deposit substitutes with a maturity of two years or less with a further
reduction in the yield to 15% effective July 1, 1978.
2.25      As a result of this legislation, the yield on deposit substitutes
has been brought closer in line with that of traditional bank deposits.  It
is hoped that this will result in a shift of resources from nonbanking
financial institutions to the banking sector. In addition, there has been an
attempy to encourage investment by reducing the cost of borrowing. This
reduction has been affected, however, with no corresponding adjustment
in the deposit rates paid. Consequently, the commercial banks will now be
operating on smaller spreads. The Government claims that the reduction in
spreads will compel the banking sector to be more competitive.
Financial Sector Issues
2.24      Aggregate savings performance in the Philippines has improved
generally during the last decade and is comparable to that of other countries
at a similar stage of economic development. Since 1975, gross domestic sav-
ings have been at a level of 25% of GNP and financed approximately 80% of
total investment. However, in order to reach a gross investment level of
more than 31% of GNP by 1982 and reduce the country's dependence on foreign
savings, the Five-Year Development Plan (1978-82) calls for an increase in
gross domestic savings to a level of more than 28% of GNP at the end of the
Plan period. To achieve this objective, the savings of the household sector
which is expected to contribute approximately 40% of the total domestic sav-
ings requirement, will need to increase by more than 17% p.a. during the
next five years.
2.27       As more savings flow from households to Government and the
corporate sector through financial intermediaries, interest rate and credit
policies will become increasingly important. The Government's role will be a
critical one in ensuring that the interest rate level and structure are in
line with the opportunity cost of capital in the economy and satisfy both
savers and investors with rates that reflect different maturities and risks.
In addition, efforts will be needed to strengthen the institutional framework
of the financial system in order to enable it to undertake its increasing
responsibilities. The Government, through the Central Bank, has started this
process with a program, already completed, to increase commercial banks'
capital and attempts are being made through various government programs
to increase allocation of institutional credit to small-scale industry. More
needs to be done, however, to clarify the allocational role of each type of
institution and to improve the quality and broaden the coverage of financial
services.  This would involve stimulating the growth of thrift banks,
insurance institutions, and the rural banking system. It would also include
encouraging the emergence and development of a stronger securities market
which so far has been hampered by the limits on longer term interest rates
and to some extent by the dominance of the term market by government finan-
cial institutions because of the preferential treatment given to their debt
instruments. The recent introduction of a 5% development tax on closely held
corporations to encourage them to go public is a step in the right direction.
Finally, financial institutions and credit programs in the Philippines have



- 17 -
experienced considerable deterioration of loan recovery rates during recent
years which has seriously affected their financial performance. However, the
Government is increasingly attentive to the problem of arrears so that
recovery will be improved without closing the essential credit channels.
2.28      The Bank attaches considerable importance to a systematic long-term
plan to develop the Philippine financial sector along rational lines. As a
first step towards that end, a detailed discussion and review of the various
issues facing the financial sector is presently under way within the Bank.
Depending upon the outcome of these discussions, a special financial sector
mission may then visit the Philippines to undertake a thorough first-hand
study. The findings of this mission would provide the basis for a dialogue
with the Government on the measures needed to be taken by the Government.
3. JUSTIFICATION FOR BANK LENDING TO PISO
Perspective
3.01      The proposed Bank loan to PISO is justified because it addresses
two basic objectives to which the Philippine Government attaches high
priority, namely:
(a)  increasing the transfer of long-term financial resources to the
industrial sector; and
(b) assisting in strengthening the institutional structure of the
financial sector, particularly those institutions which allocate
term funds for productive capital investment and which are geared
to mobilize resources as they develop.
Capital Requirements for the Industrial Sector
3.02      For Philippine industry to grow at the rate projected in the World
Bank's recent Basic Economic Report and to provide the needed increase in
exports and employment, there is little doubt that the long-term resources
available for industrial investment will need to be significantly increased
(para. 1.20). At present the flow of such resources is constricted by the
limited number of institutions capable of mobilizing and rationally allocating
such resources. The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP),/1 which is
the single largest source of term funds, presently accounts for about 80% of
long-term loans to the manufacturing sector. The Private Development Corpo-
ration of the Philippines (PDCP) accounts for a further 15% and the balance
of 5% is accounted for by commercial banks and other investment houses.
However, such long-term loans provide less than 20% of the estimated total
investment required by the industrial sector. The balance is provided by
internally-generated funds, suppliers' credits and capital investments
financed by short-term accommodations on a roll-over basis. Although no
/1   The Bank has so far made 11 loans to DBP amounting to US$245.4 million.



- 18 -
reliable data are available, informed "guesstimates" are that short-term
financing accounts for roughly 30-40% of total capital investment in the
industrial sector.
3.03      While DBP and PDCP are expanding their own lending activities to
the extent that long-term resources are available to them, they still con-
front limits on institutional, processing and managerial capabilities.
Given the likely rate of growth of industrial investment and the need to
diversify sources of funds so as to establish a more competitive financial
"market", the Philippine Government is encouraging the diversification of
such sources in both the public and private sectors; these considerations
suggest that to build PISO's capacity for long-term financing to industry is
justified.
Strengthening the Institutional Structure
3.04      As suggested in paras. 2.11 and 2.25 the Government has, for some
time, also been concerned with the direction in which some of the recently
established investment houses have developed. These institutions (of which
there are now 12) were originally expected to specialize in long-term cor-
porate financing and assisting in capital market development; they have,
however, with the exception of PDCP, focused largely on money market opera-
tions. A series of recent policy measures has been instituted to steer them
towards their originally conceived functions (paras. 2.21 and 2.23). The
impact of such measures would be reinforced by building up long-term deve-
lopment financing capability in such institutions through the provision of
long-term funds and institutional support. PDCP has so far been the sole
private DFC to receive development assistance from either the Bank or ADB;
the Government feels it now opportune for the Bank to assist an additional
institution in the private sector. This view is based upon a strong feeling
that the Bank's role in PDCP has been a constructive one. The Government's
choice is based upon its assessment of: (a) PISO's willingness to develop
its long-term financing capabilities further; (b) its ownership pattern,
which does not reflect "captivity" to a single family dominated business
group; (c) its present size and stage of growth; (d) capable management
and staff; (e) institutional emphasis on corporate client services; and
(f) PISO's generally good record of "responsible corporate behavior" and
prudent financial management. A review of other similar institutions
suggests that PISO is indeed a good choice for the Bank to work with at this
stage.
Development Orientation
3.05      PISO has realized the danger of relying too heavily on short-term
operations, particularly in the light of the latest government regulations,
which aim at a shift of resources from nonbanking financial institutions to
the banking sector and the mobilization of long-term resources. Accordingly
PISO has decided to shift its emphasis from predominantly short-term opera-
tions to medium and long-term lending. In this context both its Policy
and Corporate Strategy Statements call for the support of new entrepreneurs,
of small-scale enterprises and of clients who do not enjoy ready access
to financing elsewhere, but as a newcomer to long-term financing, PISO



- 19 -
will inevitably start with modest targets and will have to rely to a consi-
derable extent on the financing of larger established companies. The Bank is
satisfied that PISO's intent is to gradually become an institution financing
a wide range of companies in terms of size, and stressing such development
objectives as export-orientation, employment creation and regional dispersal.
4. PHILIPPINE INVESTMENTS SYSTEMS ORGANIZATION
A. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Background, Objectives and Charter
4.01      PISO was incorporated on March 1, 1974 as a privately-owned
Philippine corporation. Along with PDCP it is one of the few private
financial institutions which is not dominated by, or captive to the interests
of, any particular shareholding group. Its shareholders have diverse back-
grounds and interests in mining, construction, textiles, chemicals, shipping,
electronics and considerable experience in the financial sphere. These attri-
butes should favor objectivity in evaluating investment opportunities and
open the doors to a wide range of business clients.
4.02      In November 1974, PISO's domestic shareholders invited the Private
Investment Company for Asia (PICA) S.A. to participate in PISO's ownership.
PICA, internationally owned by large multinational banks and industrial
corporations, is a development oriented private sector institution. The
association with PICA (which remains PISO's single largest and sole foreign
shareholder) over the past three years has served PISO well. Apart from
providing assistance in mobilizing foreign resources for PISO's syndications,
PICA's participation in the Board has proved to be helpful and constructive.
4.03      PISO's corporate philosophy is best reflected in one of its original
basic documents wherein it committed itself to:
(a) the development of enterprises and financial markets;
(b) the pursuit of the objective of broadening stock ownership (in the
enterprises it finances); and
(c) the evaluation of both the financial aspects of projects and
their contribution to the economy.
These broad objectives are reflected in the Policy Statement which has been
reviewed during negotiations (para. 4.22).
4.04      Charter.  PISO's charter, as embodied in its Articles, contains all
the provisions normally associated with development financing/investment
banking institutions. It allows the corporation, inter alia, to:
(a) develop and promote projects in any business sector; to
assist in corporate reorganization/restructuring and to
provide corporate financial advice;



- 20 -
(b) assist capital market development through the issue, purchase,
underwriting, syndicating or trading of various types of financial
instruments and securities, and to engage in providing portfolio
advice and management services;
(c) engage in real estate investments and development;
(d) undertake long and short-term lending, guaranteeing,
leasing and direct primary equity investment functions to
or for any type of enterprise; and
(e) borrow funds from any sources without any general restric-
tions as to types and sources of funds.
Capitalization and Ownership
4.05      Under its Articles, PISO's authorized share capital is P 100 mil-
lion: 10 million common shares with a par value of P 10.0 divided into
6 million Class A shares and 4 million Class B shares (Class A shares being
restricted to Filipino ownership)./l As of December 31, 1977, the sub-
scribed and paid-in share capital amounted to P 23.6 million (or about
US$3.1 million); accumulated retained earnings amounted to a further
P 4.2 million bringing total stockholders' equity to P 27.8 million (or
about US$3.7 million). PISO's Class A share capital is presently held by six
major Philippine shareholders including PISO's President, who holds 12.4%.
They collectively own 63.8% of the outstanding stock, while several of PISO's
officers hold another 2.6%, and PICA owns the balance of 33.6% (see Annex 1,
T-1).
4.06      In discussions with PISO's management and the Government the
desirability of diversifying PISO's ownership was raised and a consensus
reached that PIS0 should, within the next three to five years, aim at having
its shares publicly listed and traded.  PISO would proceed with a listing of
its shares as soon as practicable within that period. For the interim it was
indicated that PISO would endeavor to attract more domestic shareholders on a
private placement basis and that no single domestic shareholding would exceed
15%. This agreement has been confirmed at negotiations and recorded in the
agreed minutes.
4.07      While its present equity base is sufficient to sustain its current
volume of operations (in fact, PISO has the lowest debt/equity ratio in the
Philippine investment banking community), PISO recognized the need to
strengthen its equity base if it is to undertake an expanded program of
/1   Corporations are classified as "Filipino" when 60% or more of the shares
are owned by Filipino nationals.



- 21 -
long-term financing operations with the assistance of the proposed Bank loan,
Accordingly, PISO's representatives have agreed during negotiations to
increase its total net worth (share capital plus retained earnings) by no
less than P 10 million or about 36% to a total of at least P 37.8 million
(or about US$5 million). The agreed upon increase, which shall be a condi-
tion of loan effectiveness, has subsequently been approved by PISO's Board
at its meeting on March 29, 1978; the funds are expected to be paid in on
April 3, 1978.
4.08      For PISO to be eligible to obtain a Government guarantee for
foreign borrowings, the extent of foreign ownership cannot exceed 30%; this
requires a reduction in PICA's present shareholding from 33.6% to 30% or
less. PICA has already agreed that it would exercise its subscription rights
only to the extent that its resulting holding would not exceed 30% of the
total; this has been confirmed at negotiations.
4.09      In connection with the proposed share capital increase, PISO has
elicited the interest of the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), which will
subscribe 14.6% of PISO's capital. During negotiations, PISO's representa-
tives confirmed that they had agreed in principle with LBP on the divestment
of the latter's holdings within the next three to four years and the mecha-
nism for such divestment.
Board of Directors and Executive Committee
4.10      Composition of the Board of Directors.  As prescribed by PISO's
By-Laws, the Board of Directors comprises 11 seats of which 9 have presently
been filled (see Annex 1, T-2). Domestic shareholder interests are repre-
sented by five directors, all of whom are principal shareholders. The sole
foreign shareholder has presently four seats, all filled by PICA officers;
however, only one of them is "active" in any practical sense. Board members
have shown a keen interest in PISO's affairs; absences from regular monthly /1
Board meetings are more the exception than the rule. All Board members are
well qualified and complement each other in terms of their individual and
collective experience, industrial interests, and links with financial/business
groups. The Chairman of the Board is also PISO's President and Chief
Executive Officer.
4.11      With the proposed reduction in PICA's holding (para. 4.08) and the
entry of additional domestic shareholders, there will be a reconfiguration
of PISO's Board. While PICA has agreed to relinquish one seat, the partici-
pation of LBP and the provision of a Government guarantee for the proposed
Bank loan will also result in one representative nominated by the Government
and two by LBP sitting on PISO's Board. One of LBP's representatives is
most likely to be an ex-officio /2 member.
/1 The By-Laws call for Board meetings at least on a quarterly basis.
/2 This term is commonly used in the Philippines to define Board representa-
tives without voting power.



- 22 -
4.12      Powers of the Board.  In addition to the normal powers vested in
the Board of Directors prescribed under Philippine corporation law,/I
PISO's By-Laws /2 require that only the Board, with the affirmative vote of
at least two-thirds of its total members, has the power to approve (and/or
amend) inter alia, the following:
(a) the annual business plan, budget and projected operations;
(b) policies on money market activity and transactions;
(c) the incurrence or guaranteeing of any debt with a maturity
of over one year or to approve any long-term financial
transaction with any one debtor/creditor exceeding P 3.5 million;
(d) a (total) debt/equity ratio of more than 10:1;
(e) capital expenditures of over P 1 million; and
(f) dividend policies, changes in the nature of PISO's business
or entry into any business not expressly provided for in the
Annual Business Plan.
4.13      Executive Committee.  PISO's By-Laws also provide for the establish-
ment of an Executive Committee (Excom) of the Board comprising a maximum of
five directors of whom three represent Class A shareholdings and two represent
Class B shareholdings. Membership of the committee is based upon appointment
by the full Board, which can also appoint alternates to designated committee
members. The Chairman of the committee is elected by the members themselves;
there is no provision requiring the Chairman of the Board to be either member
or Chairman of the Excom. The Excom, which is presently chaired by the
Chairman/President of PISO, comprises two other Directors (one of whom
represents PICA) and is empowered to act for the full Board between its
scheduled meetings and may carry out those functions delegated to it by the
Board. Actions and decisions of the Excom are based upon agreement by a
simple majority of its members, who constitute a quorum.
Organization, Management and Staff
4.14      Organization.  PISO's present activity mix is handled by five
departments, Annex 1, C-1. Broadly, these departments cover the following
functions:
/1 These include the powers of appointment and dismissal of PISO's employees
and officers and the powers to fix their compensation, terms of employ-
ment and to exercise those powers and functions which are not expressly
required to be done only by the stockholders (under the Articles and
By-Laws).
/2 Article III, Section 5 of the By-Laws.



- 23 -
(a) Corporate Services: including, inter alia, legal services, per-
sonnel management, public relations, and general administration.
(b) Corporate Planning and Development (CPD): including economic
research, business development, mergers, acquisitions and corporate
reconstruction, and primary equity investments. The present Senior
Vice-President for CPD also manages (c).
(c) Investment Management Office: responsible for investment
analysis and research, portfolio management services, investment
advisory services, and secondary equities trading and investment.
(d) Resource Mobilization: covers project evaluation and supervision,
clients' financial assistance packages, syndications, underwriting/
private placement, and guarantees.
(e) Financial Market Operations: deals with short-term trading in
commercial papers and government securities, credit rating services,
wholesale securities marketing, and accounting/financial control.
Within this departmental group also resides the responsibility
for Small Business Financing operations and the Capital Markets
division.
4.15      PISO's present organization results in some deliberately planned
overlapping, intended to optimize the use of available staff resources and to
expose officers to a greater variety of tasks. Management reviews the system
constantly and considers the present setting desirable to foster mutual
interdependence and cooperation among the managers.
4.16      The growth in the volume of PISO's operations may necessitate
a reorganization which ought to include the following realignment of functions:
(a) shifting the small business lending function from the Money
Market Operations Department to a Term-Financing Operations
Department,/l having the latter concentrate primarily on all
project evaluation and supervision work and making it responsible
for all term-lending operations;
(b) transferring the syndication functions to the Term-Financing
Operations Department;
(c) embodying the underwriting/private placement and corporate
services functions into the Investment Management Office which
should also undergo reorganization to emerge as a full-fledged
department; and
(d) establishing a separate monitoring and follow-up unit as a
division within the Term-Financing Operations Department.
/1 This Department is presently called Resource Mobilization in PISO's
terminology.



- 24 -
The suggested revamping of PISO's organization along functional lines as
the volume of activities increases is likely to eliminate potential frictions
and overlaps and would put due emphasis on the term-lending operations.
4.17      Management.  PISO's top management team comprises its President,
Mr. Victor S. Barrios, two Senior Vice-Presidents, and three Vice-Presidents.
Of the two Senior VPs, one is a full time staff member of PICA and is under
contract to spend 60 hours per month with PIS0. Mr. Barrios is a prominent
member of, and among the leading spokesmen for, the Philippine financial
community. He has had considerable experience in the development banking
sphere (including working as a senior staff member with PDCP); his ability
and commitment to development financing are respected in both the private and
public sector. The "external" Senior Vice-President /1 plays a constructive
and useful role in PISO's management team, particularly on its Management
Investment Committee (MIC). While he has no full-time assignments or respon-
sibility for any operating or support group in PISO, his availability for
special assignments, general advice and as an objective, impartial sounding
board for other members of the management team have proved to be in PISO's
interest. Moreover, he has been instrumental in arranging participation by
foreign financial institutions in PISO's syndications.
4.18      PISO's full-time Senior Vice President and the other three Vice-
Presidents constitute a good management team whose individual members comple-
ment each other well. These managers have demonstrated their competence in
meeting the requirements of their present tasks. In sum, PISO's management
team is well qualified and has the capability for gearing the organization up
to cope with the task of efficiently allocating and monitoring a long-term
line of credit for industrial project financing.
4.19      Staff.  During the last six months of FY77, PISO recruited another
7 professionals, an increase of 23%; as of March 15, 1978 its staff totalled
55 compared to a total of 43 some 12 months earlier. With 38 officers, PISO's
professional staff accounts for about 69% of the total and, discounting a
slight predominance of accountants and financial analysts, is fairly evenly
distributed among the various disciplines. As of now, there are eight
engineers, two of whom are Vice-Presidents with backgrounds in chemical /2
and industrial engineering. PISO's present engineering team appears to be
fully adequate for its long-term lending program, even though some may be
still somewhat inexperienced. Twelve of PISO's professional staff have been
involved in project appraisal so far. To gear up for the project evaluation/
supervision/administration workload likely to result from a Bank loan, PISO
will strengthen its staff by approximately 9-10 additional employees by the
end of FY78.
/1   This arrangement was an integrated part of the Investment Agreement
with PICA.
/2 The chemical engineer has 12 years experience in various aspects of the
operations of a major oil company.



- 25 -
4.20      PISO's history of rapid staff turnover (Annex 1, T-3) is partly
attributable to the general shortage of well trained and experienced staff in
the Philippine financial sector. This development may have been aggravated
by a tendency to recruit over-qualified people for essentially rather low
level tasks and the limited opportunities for career development in a small
organization such as PISO. In late 1976 PISO's management carried out an
in-depth study of the causes of the relatively high staff turnover. It was
determined that in more than 60% of the cases the turnover was accounted for
by staff who werel offered salary levels and positions significantly better
than those provided by PISO. Management has since taken several remedial
steps including a periodic upward adjustment of salaries and the provision of
more diversified work assignments to retain career interest. These measures
have proved reasonably effective and since September 1976, turnover has
slowed down perceptibly.
4.21      The quality of work produced by PISO's staff displays a high level
of competence and an unusual degree of analytical ability in the assessment
of long-term investment opportunities.
Policies
4.22      Operating Policies.  Since its incorporation, PISO has gradually
been developing a coherent policy framework to guide its operations. With
broad directional guidelines for corporate activity having been established
at the outset by the Board, a series of specific policies governing day-to-
day operations continue to be developed. These policies, however, are not
embodied in PISO's present Policy Statement. PISO's management recognizes
the usefulness of refining and expanding its Statement to incorporate and
expand upon existing policies relating to the conduct of its operations and
the regulation of its financial affairs. Accordingly the draft Statement
has been discussed and finalized during negotiations; the agreed upon version
(Annex 2), which has been formally adopted by PISO's Board in its meeting on
March 29, 1978, constitutes one of PISO's "basic documents" and has been
cross-referred to in the legal agreements between PISO and the Bank.
4.23      The Policy Statement incorporates the following key features:
(a) Investment exposure limits which call for: total financial commit-
ments to any single enterprise normally not to exceed 25% of PISO's
net worth; investments in enterprises normally not to exceed 50% of
the assets of those enterprises if established or 75% if new; no
single equity investment normally to exceed 15% of PISO's net
worth; aggregate equity investments not to exceed PISO's net worth;
and equity investment in any given enterprise normally not to
exceed 35% of the paid-in share capital of that enterprise.
(b) Operating guidelines on portfolio diversification; relation-
ships with client enterprises; divestment of equity investments
and dispersal of ownership; provision for reserves: plow-back
of at least 40% of average net earnings as retained earnings.
The Statement also includes policies on: the application of



- 26 -
professional standards to project evaluation and project follow-up;
new entrepreneur/enterprise promotion and small business enterprise
financing; money-market operations; management-board relationships;
relationships with Government authorities; and organization and
staffing.
4.24      The Policy Statement does not include any guidelines on debt/equity
limits (see para. 5.12). Provisions covering these aspects have been sepa-
rately provided for in the legal documents for the proposed loan. In accord-
ance with the Project Agreement, PISO's total debt shall not exceed ten times
and its long-term debt shall not exceed four times its equity, except as the
Bank and PISO shall otherwise agree.
Project Processing, Evaluation and Supervision
4.25      Project Processing.  PISO's loan processing procedures have been
established with the view to minimize the time lag between the first applica-
tion by a prospective borrower and the eventual decision by PISO. They
permit efficiency without sacrificing work quality and provide for rational
work flow. As of December 31, 1977, PISO had appraised about 14 operations
of which 11 had resulted in PISO's arranging financial assistance. On
average, the processing period was between 6-12 weeks. Prior to a decision
on proceeding with full-scale project appraisal and before submission to the
Board for approval, every long-term assistance proposal (and each credit
rating report for transacting money market business with a new client) is
coursed through a Management Investment Committee (MIC) comprising the
President and Vice-Presidents.
4.26      Project Evaluation.  On the basis of a review of all of PISO's
project appraisal reports and special market studies the existing project
evaluation capability was found to be of uniformly high quality. Market and
financial aspects were dealt with particularly thoroughly, and project
reports were found to be comprehensive documents which provided a reasonable
basis for sound investment decisions.
4.27      On the technical side, the reports were somewhat too descriptive
about production processes and equipment and they needed strengthening in
dealing with such matters as critical points in the process cycle, suitability
of various equipment components, pricing of equipment packages, implementation
schedules, plant layout, and elements of technical service agreements.
4.28      Most evaluation reports did not provide any formal economic justi-
fication but this was not reflective of an absence of expertise in economic
evaluation. Most of PISO's projects were BOI-registered and there was no
demand for such analysis by PISO's syndicate partners. However, during
negotiations an understanding has been reached, reflected in the Project
Agreement, to the effect that PISO would include ERR analysis for all proj-
ects exceeding the free-limit of US$750,000. Apart from this, all appraisal
reports should contain the usual partial economic indicators (e.g., value
added, new jobs generated, foreign exchange earned or saved).
4.29      Project Supervision.  With a small and largely "new" portfolio,
there was no firm track record on which to assess the quality of PISO's



- 27 -
supervision efforts. Supervision procedures, however, are soundly conceived
and the few supervision reports reviewed were found to be of good quality.
In the project implementation stage, supervision over disbursement and
physical progress was tight, with variances between actual performance
and the original cost budget being analyzed on a quarterly basis. PISO also
required clients to submit financial statements on a quarterly basis. These
were reviewed on receipt and a brief report prepared on borrower performance
and financial standing. In general, PISO's management placed substantial
emphasis on regular supervision.
Procurement and Disbursement Practices
4.30      Procedures employed by PISO assured that equipment procurement and
civil works contracting by clients were carried out with due regard for
economy and efficiency. Clients were required to submit evidence of a
reasonably broad canvassing effort with competitive quotations (usually
three) being requested to support such evidence. In reviewing the clients'
final choice, PISO's staff frequently checked with known users of chosen
equipment to determine the soundness of the choice and the experience of
suppliers. Disbursement procedures were also soundly conceived and ensured
sufficient safeguards to minimize the possibility of funds misuse. For fixed
asset purchase, PISO required the submission of pro-forma invoices against
which actual disbursement requests were checked. Clients were generally
required to apply equity funds to initial expenses before loan funds were
released; on occasion, however, a pari passu disbursement request had been
entertained. PISO's loan contracts include general conditions for disburse-
ment as well as specific conditions appropriate to each client.
Operating Practices and Procedures
4.31      PISO's establishment and the evolution of its organization have
proceeded in a systematic fashion with internal operating procedures
within and between operating units being carefully laid down and reviewed.
Each department had set out in manual form its departmental role, functions,
intra-departmental work-flow and operating procedures. Policies on specific
activities carried out by each department have been modified and translated
into sets of rules for working level staff. Furthermore, PISO's management
has adopted a well-controlled system for the planning and budgeting of
operations for each department, as reflected in its Board-approved Business
Plan.
B. CORPORATE STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT ORIENTATION
4.32      In its operational orientation, PISO has explicitly recognized the
importance of: (a) maintaining a financially sound profile through the expan-
sion of a stable portfolio base; and (b) eventually achieving levels of
profitability which are commensurate with a competitive return to existing
shareholders, attractive to potential shareholders and acceptable to commer-
cial creditors. These objectives might be achieved without PISO's exerting
substantial efforts to develop its long-term operations. However, PISO



- 28 -
realizes the danger of relying too heavily on short-term operations, partic-
ularly in the light of the latest Government regulations, which aim at a
shift of resources from nonbanking financial institutions to the banking
sector and the mobilization of long-term resources. Accordingly PISO has
decided to diversify from predominantly short-term operations to medium- and
long-term lending. PISO has also been encouraged to go into medium and
long-term financing by the advantage of its reputation for competence in
project appraisal and supervision, established in connection with its syndi-
cation operations.
4.33      PISO plans to play a role in financing of small-scale industries.
Both its Policy and Corporate Strategy Statements call for the support of new
entrepreneurs, of small-scale enterprises and of clients who do not enjoy
ready access to financing elsewhere. PISO was accorded accreditation status
under the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) scheme for financing
small business. Nevertheless, as a newcomer to long-term financing, PISO
will inevitably start with modest targets and will have to rely to a con-
siderable extent on the financing of larger established companies.
4.34      However, PISO's general objective is satisfactory, that of gradually
becoming an institution financing a wide range of companies in terms of size,
and stressing such development objectives as export-orientation, employment
creation and regional dispersal. The Bank's institution building role is
expected to be significant in assisting PISO in its efforts to arrive at
these goals.
4.35      Capital Market Development.  Over the past year, PISO has expended
considerable efforts in establishing contact with international, regional and
local sources of long-term funds to widen the base of participating institu-
tions in its syndications efforts. Particularly noteworthy in this connec-
tion are its efforts to arouse the interest of trust and pension funds, and
insurance companies in long-term project financing. To date PISO has had
only limited success, in both these efforts and in mobilizing peso resources.
4.36      Corporate Strategy Statement.  To bring into focus its developmental
orientation, PISO's management has prepared a Corporate Strategy Statement
which outlines the directions it proposes to take and what it hopes to
achieve over the next 3 years. This Statement has been reviewed at negotia-
tions. The agreed upon version (Annex 3), which has been formally adopted by
PISO's Board in its meeting on March 29, 1978, has been cross-referred to
in the legal agreements between PISO and the Bank. The main features of the
Statement are PISO's plans to:
(a) maintain its character as an investment house but with increasing
emphasis on long-term financing;
(b) increase the proportion of long-term assets to total assets from 2%
in 1976 to about 50% by 1981;
(c) attain an average annual growth of its short-term assets of about
25% during 1977-81;



- 29 -
(d) diversify its portfolio with respect to industrial, geographical,
and regional distribution and to restrict its exposure in any
single industry to 30% of its outstanding long-term portfolio;
(e) closely monitor security market conditions with the intent to
publicly list its shares and widen its domestic ownership base;
(f) diversify its long-term foreign and domestic resources and to blend
multiliateral official funds with commercial resources; and
(g) evaluate the contribution of all projects to the Philippine
economy and where possible stress such particular development
objectives as employment creation, export orientation and regional
dispersal of industries.
C. OPERATIONS
4.37      Long-Term Financing Operations.  Given its relatively short opera-
ting life and the constraints on mobilizing long-term funds, PISO does not
have an established track record (Annex 1, T-4). Apart from one equity
investment (P 25,000), PISO has not yet taken any risk positions in primary
equity investments. PISO has adopted the prudent approach of avoiding risky
investments until its portfolio provides a sufficient cushion to absorb the
impact of potential losses on such investments. The absence of significant
activity in primary equity investment is generally in keeping with the
experience of other similar financial institutions in an environment where
good primary investment opportunities are confined to tightly-held corpora-
tions unwilling to invite institutional participation. The general trend is
for only marginal projects to seek equity participation from external sources.
4.38      PISO has, so far, managed 11 syndications of long-term loans (see
Annex 1, T-5), in which it has approved loans from its own resources total-
ling P 21.3 million /1 and has disbursed P 11.1 million of which P 4.0 mil-
lion has already been repaid, leaving a balance of P 7.1 million outstanding
as of December 31, 1977. Of the 11 projects, 7 were new and 4 were "pioneer-
ing" ventures in product lines not hitherto established in the Philippines.
Most of them were, nevertheless, undertaken by established companies or their
subsidiaries. PISO felt that its initial concentration on established enter-
prises was necessitated by a lack of its own resources. Since commercial
banks, participating in syndications, were unlikely to venture into less well
known corporations, PISO had focused on establishing a reputation with
clients whose names could be "sold".
4.39      The average total cost of the indus3trial projects assisted was
about US$7 million and their financial rates of return, estimated at the time
of project appraisal, were expected to exceed 20%. Clearly, the need to
balance its portfolio will require PISO to do business with established firms
/1   The largest of these was a US$1 million loan for Sarmiento Industries
from the US-Eximbank Cooperative Financing Facility.



30 -
undertaking financially viable and economically desirable projects; but, on
the other hand, PISO hopes to reflect its development orientation and
efforts in the future distribution of its portfolio.
4.40      In addition to the above, PISO has: (a) privately placed (under-
written), on a "best efforts" basis, common stock issues (total value
P 8.7 million) of three of the newer companies /1; and (b) guaranteed part
of three commercial loans for a total amount of nearly P 8 million.
4.41      Short-Term Financing Operations.  With the obvious limitations on
PISO's ability to finance long-term investments directly, the bulk of its
income is derived from short-term financing operations, money market trans-
actions and syndication efforts. The importance of such operations is
reflected in the table below:

- 31 -
As shown above, short-term trading assets constitute the bulk of PISO's
portfolio and are financed by short-term borrowings and equity. The volume
of such assets has stabilized since 1976.
4.42      PISO has been prudent in the management of its trading operations
which are guided by specific Board-approved policies and are based upon an
approved "placement" list /1. The list comprises companies and individuals
whose creditworthiness is thoroughly investigated; a rating is applied and an
exposure limit is set for each one. PISO's credit rating analysis is quite
sophisticated; each recommended addition to the placement list is carefully
vetted by the MIC before approval is provided to place PISO funds. The
policies applied include: (a) diversification in company and industry exposure
and in PISO's government securities inventory; (b) a minimum current ratio of
1:1; (c) matching of assets and liabilities for each 90-day period; (d)
maintenance of specified maximum limits on the net short forward position and
on minimum forward cover under different market conditions; (e) maintenance
of reserve positions well above the minimum levels required by Central Bank
regulations; (f) a single enterprise exposure limit of P 10 million with
typical approvals of P 5 million against commercial paper issues; and (g) a
forced "clean-up" period for specific issues to test the ability of clients
to meet maturing obligations without resort to rollover.
4.43      That these policies are prudent vis-a-vis industry practices is
reflected in PISO's consistent ranking /2 each year at the top of the indus-
try list in comparative analyses of liquidity/solvency ratios in the
Philippine investment banking community. PISO also has the lowest debt/
equity position in the industry. The adoption of a liquidity margin has
been agreed upon with PISO at negotiations (para 5.13).
D. FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Position
4.44      PISO's audited balance sheets as of December 1974-77 are shown in
Annex 1, T-6. Total assets have grown by 7.6% during 1977 against 5.7% dur-
ing the whole of 1976 and they stood at P 125.5 million (about US$16.7 million
equivalent) as of December 31, 1977. The growth of PISO's operations in 1976
was slow because early in the year, there were several new regulations issued
by the Central Bank affecting interest rates and the business of investment
houses generally which tended to constrain money market operations. This
trend also continued through 1977 partly due to the additional introduction
of a 35% transaction tax in mid-1977 on interest earned on commercial papers
issued in the market as primary money market instruments. Almost all assets
(95%) as of December 31, 1977 were classified as current assets of which the

individuals (in a roughly 60:40 ratio).

short-term investments, net of provisions for doubtful accounts, amounted
to P 93.1 million or 74%, against P 95.3 million or 82% as of December 31,
1976. Although the term-loan portfolio increased by 3.7 times, it remains
relatively insignificant accounting for only 6% of total assets (P 7.1 mil-
lion). PISO's current ratio stood at 1.3:1 as of December 31, 1977 (Annex 1,
T-12). With the availability of long-term resources, PISO's balance sheet
would undergo major structural changes. Current assets are projected to
decline from about 95% of total assets as of December 31, 1977, to less than
50% at the end of 1981.
4.45      PISO's assets were mainly financed by short-term liabilities (96%
of all liabilities as of December 31, 1977) principally comprised of securi-
ties sold under agreement to repurchase and, to a lesser extent, PISO notes.
Current liabilities grew by 2.3% during 1977 against 7.7% in 1976. For the
first time in its history PISO showed a medium/long-term debt position
(P 5.3 million) resulting from its cooperative finance facility with the
US-Eximbank (P 11.3 million). As of December 31, 1977 PISO's total debt/
equity ratio stood at 3.8, including contingent liabilities, against 3.7 at
the end of 1976.
Financial Performance
4.46      The audited income statements for FY74-77 and the pertinent ratios
of operational performance are given in Annex 1, T-11 and T-12. Net income
after provision and tax recovered substantially in 1977 and amounted to
P 3.5 million, an increase of 49% after a sharp reduction in 1976 (by 22%).
The recovery took place almost across the board; income from short-term
operations increased in 1977 to P 3.2 million, or by 49%, against P 2.2 mil-
lion for the whole of 1976, but did not reach the high 1975 level (P 5.4 mil-
lion). The decline in profitability in 1976 was the result of regulatory
measures introduced by the Central Bank in January 1976 which affected the
operations of all investment houses. Revenues from medium/long-term operations,
which went up from P 0.08 million to P 0.5 million in 1977, continue to remain
insignificant. During 1977 there was only a modest income from underwtiting
(P 0.08 million) and an insignificant amount received from management and
financial consultancy services (P 0.08 million), but a substantially increased
income from PISO's syndication operations (P 2.4 million against P 0.8 mil-
lion during 1976). However, part of the effort that led to the high income
from syndications was undertaken in 1976. Administrative expenses, which had
stayed relatively stable in 1976, rose steeply by 61% in 1977. This develop-
ment is mainly attributable to substantially increased (by 82%) personnel
costs resulting from both an increase in the number of staff (from about 40
employees in 1976 to 55 as of now) and an upward revision of salaries.



- 33 -
Financial expenses of P 9.2 million in 1976 (including provisions) which rose
by about 65% in 1976, declined again to P 5.9 million in 1977 or by 36%. The
improved earnings situation resulted in a better net return on average assets
of 2.9% in 1977 against 2.1% in 1976.
4.47      For 1976, PISO paid the same dividend (on par value) as for 1975
(6%) with pay-out ratios of 31.2% and 51.1% respectively. As of December 31,
1977 the book value of a PISO share was 18% above par, slightly less than as
of December 31, 1976 (25%) due to a 15% stock dividend in 1977 (December).
Quality of Portfblio
4.48      Since PISO has virtually no long-term portfolio, it has had no
significant experience in containing a problem of arrears. Its disbursement
on a medium-term loan is being repaid satisfactorily as are its outstanding
guarantee accounts. On its short-term portfolio, PISO has one doubtful,
fully secured (real estate with an appraised value of P 4.0 million) account
of nearly P 2 million. In providing for doubtful accounts, PISO has adopted
the practice of determining the level of provisions on the basis of an
account-by-account review. In FY75 and FY76 PISO made a provision for
doubtful accounts of P 1.5 million and a further P 1.0 million in FY77 as a
charge against earnings. The management's policy is to increase provisions
annually at a rate commensurate with portfolio growth until they correspond
to at least 1.5% of total loan portfolio by 1981. As of December 31, 1977,
PISO's retained earnings amounted to nearly P 4.2 million or over 18% of the
paid-in share capital including stock dividends.
Audit
4.49      Since its inception, PISO has had its accounts audited by the
auditing firm of Sycip, Gorres, Velayo and Co. (SGV), which is well known to
the Bank and familiar with the Bank's "long-form" audit requirements. PISO's
accounts have always been passed by the auditors without qualification.
5. PISO: BUSINESS PROSPECTS, RESOURCES AND PROJECTED FINANCES
General Outlook
5.01      During 1977, the Philippine manufacturing sector is expected to
have achieved a growth of 4-6%. Its lackluster performance over the past few
years was due to the slow growth of domestic demand coupled with a slower
than expected recovery in the economies of the Philippines' major trading
partners. It is expected that with stabilizing terms of trade, demand will
revive in 1978 giving the necessary impetus to the manufacturing sector to
achieve a faster growth rate. Subsequently, investments in durable equip-
ment, which have remained at low levels since mid 1975 (following the invest-
ment boom of 1974/75) are expected to rebound.
5.02      Over the medium to long term, the Government is committed to
a strategy that includes emphasis on accelerated industrialization. The
performance of the industrial sector will have to be significantly improved



- 34 -
if the Philippines is to be reasonably successful in easing the constraint on
foreign exchange resources and in expanding productive employment to the
required level of at least 75,000 jobs a year in the industrial sector by the
early 1980s. To achieve these targets the Philippines will need to expand
investment in export industries and in a wide range of intermediate goods
industries where domestic demand prospects are reasonably good. According to
the Five-Year Plan (1978-82), manufacturing is expected to grow at an annual
rate of 9% over the plan period. To achieve this target, investments will
have to grow by 15.5% p.a. between 1978 and 1982 to total P 86 billion, of
which about 65% would go to larger industries.
Business Forecast
5.03      Except for the US Export-Import Bank's Cooperative Financing
Facility of US$1.5 million),/1 PISO has not had access to any other long-term
resources. As the proposed Bank loan would be PISO's first long-term loan
from an international institution, it is difficult to gauge, without the
benefit of experience, the volume of lending operations PISO can achieve in
the immediate future. Nonetheless, PISO's management has developed operational
forecasts (Annex 1, T-8) on the basis of a pipeline and overall capital
requirement assumptions which have been carefully reviewed. These are
summarized below:

- 35 -
5.04      PISO's operational forecasts are also based on its perception of
institutional capability (taking into account its plans for the present as
well as the future for staff strengthening, see para. 4.19) and of what
share of the potential market it could reasonably capture. Estimated dis-
bursements would reach P 164 million in FY78 or about 2.6% /1 of the total
size of the potential market, i.e., the estimated demand for investment funds
from the private corporate sector for the type of projects which PISO is
capable of catering to. This estimate is based on an assumption derived from
historical time-series that about 62.8% of national investment in durable
equipment and 11% of total investment in non-residential construction in the
Philippines would be undertaken by the private corporate sector, with about
60% of the required amount being financed from institutional sources and 40%
from internally generated funds. PISO's management believes that it should
be able to increase its share of the market up to 3.8% by FY81 as summarized
below:

- 36 -
5.05      However, PISO's share of the total market is reduced to about 0.2%
only in FY78, 1.2% in FY79, 1.5% in FY80 and FY81 if syndication operations
are excluded. On a similar scale, projected disbursements of the other two
development banks in the Philippines, DBP and PDCP, show an average market
share of around 30% and 4% respectively for the same period. On balance,
PISO's projected share of the market should be attainable.
5.06      PISO's estimates of its financing activities have been influenced
by its current assumptions about resource availability. PISO's projections
have assumed the availability of the proposed Bank loan of $15 million
in early 1978 allowing it to launch its long-term lending operations from
that year. This explains the sudden jump of loan commitments in FY78 and
FY79. The share of direct lending operations in total commitments has been
projected to increase from 3.7% in FY77 to 22.2% in FY78 rising to 43.3% in
FY81. Foreign currency loans are projected to account for the lion's share
in total loan commitments reflecting PISO's expectation that the prospects
for long-term local currency resource mobilization will improve very slowly.
It also reflects the continuing dependence of the Philippine industrial
sector on imports for a major portion of industrial machinery and equipment.
5.07      Though small business loans are projected to increase in absolute
terms, their share in total loan commitments is expected to remain at about
4.6% throughout the projected period. In terms of the number of operations,
their share will be much larger and will increase. PISO's strategy for small
business loans calls for their promotion to the extent that PISO's manpower
resources will allow in view of the high administrative costs involved in
such operations. Equity investments are projected to be supported more
through underwriting and private placements rather than direct partici-
pations in primary issues. PISO's guarantees, in local as well as foreign
currencies, are projected to account for a minor portion of its operations.
Resource Position and Requirements
5.08      Local Currency Resources.  Details of PISO's resource position as
of December 31, 1977 are provided in Annex 1, T-9. As shown, PISO's long-
term peso resource base consisted almost only of shareholder's equity amounting
to P 27.8 million. As of the same date, PISO had long-term peso loans of
P 1.7 million outstanding. Undisbursed long-term peso resources therefore
stood at P 26.7 million which PISO kept in the form of current assets. Since
PISO is to maintain a safety margin of 10% in its current ratio, it will need
to continue keeping a subtantial portion of its long-term peso resources in
liquid form. As a result, only about P 16 million could realistically be
regarded as peso resources available for long-term commitments. Against this
amount, PISO's peso commitments for the period 1978-81 are projected to be
P 42 million (including small business loans totalling P 22.8 million for
which refinancing is expected to be obtained from IGLF). The remainder is
expected to be financed through additional paid-in capital, net collections
and internally generated funds. PISO's future peso resource picture (posi-
tion and requirement) is shown below:

5.09      Foreign Currency Resources.  As shown in Annex 1, T-9, PISO's only
source for long-term foreign funds has been the U.S. Eximbank's Cooperative
Financing Facilities (CFF). Utilization of the CFF by PISO is limited to
US$1.0 million p.a. On the basis of these available resources and PISO's
operational projections, PISO's future foreign currency resource requirements
and position up to December 31, 1979 are summarized below:

- 38 -
PISO's projected requirements of foreign currency resources between FY78-79
amount to about US$20.6 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million
would meet the bulk of PISO's needs of foreign currency resources over
that period.
Projected Financial Position and Performance
5.10      Projected Financial Position.  Based upon its operational fore-
casts, PISO's total assets are expected to grow by 47.6% in FY78 to P 186 mil-
lion (Annex 1, T-10). Thereafter, spurred largely by long-term financing
operations, assets are expected to increase at an average annual rate of
about 50% to P 626 million in FY81. The projected asset growth will be
accompanied by a noticeable structural change in asset composition with the
significance of long-term loans /1 in the total asset base increasing from
4.2% in FY77 to 6.8% in FY78 and further to 31.6% in FY79 and 52.2% in FY81.
Current assets (including current maturities of long-term loans), on the
other hand, are projected to grow by 43.1% in FY78 and at an average annual
rate of 20.4% thereafter but their share in the asset base is expected to
decline gradually from 98.0% in FY76 to 47.2% in FY81. On the other side of
the balance sheet, long-term liabilities are expected to increase sharply
from P 4.2 million in FY77 to P 321.5 million in FY81 and their share in
PISO's resource base is projected to rise from 3.3% in FY77 to 51.3% in FY81.
Short-term liabilities /2 are projected to increase in absolute terms from
P 93.5 million in FY77 to P 229.0 million in FY81, but their share in the
resource base is expected to decline gradually from 74.5% in FY77 to 36.6%
in FY81.
5.11      Capital Base and Structure.  PISO's current equity base of
P 27.8 million (consisting of paid-in capital of P 23.6 million and accumu-
lated retained earnings of P 4.2 million at end FY77) is only sufficient
to sustain its current volume of operations. PISO recognized the need to
strengthen its equity base to undertake an expanded program of long-term
financing operations with the assistance of the proposed Bank loan. Accord-
ingly, agreement has been reached during negotiations to increase PISO's
equity by P 10 million./3 PISO's Board has approved the capital increase
in its meeting on March 29, 1978; the funds are expected to be paid in on
April 3, 1978. PISO's reserves are expected to grow by a rate averaging 55%
annually between FY77-81 to P 20.0 million; they are expected to account for
26.4% of net worth in FY81.
/1   Excluding current maturities of long-term loans.
/2   Including current maturities of long-term liabilties.
/3 Another equity increase of P 10 million is envisaged by 1981.



- 39 -
5.12      On the basis of PISO's financial projections, the total debt equity
ratio is expected to rise from 3.8:1 in FY77 and FY78 to 5.7:1 in FY79 and
further to 7.6:1 in FY80 before it decreases slightly to 7.5:1 in FY81; its
contractual limit is 10:1. Correspondingly, the long-term debt/equity ratio
is expected to rise from 0.4:1 in FY77 to 0.5:1 in FY78, Z.2:1 in FY79, 4.1:1
in FY80, and further to 4.5:1 in FY81; its limitation to 4:1 has been agreed
upon during negotiations.
Liquidity
5.13      In addition to the recommended total debt/equity and long-term
debt/equity ratio limits (para. 5.12), the Bank has discussed with PISO,
at negotiations, the desirability of maintaining a minimum liquidity ratio,
in view of the significance of its short-term operations and portfolio.
(According to PISO's projections, the current liquidity ratio is not expec-
ted to fall below 1.2:1). Moreover, confirmation was sought at negotiations
that PISO will continue to adhere to prudent policies with respect to main-
taining debt service and interest coverage at satisfactory levels. According
to PISO's projections, the debt-service ratio would be 3.1 times in FY78
(when the long-term debt service burden is negligible) and would, in subse-
quent years, decline to 2.8, 2.9 and 2.0 in the years FY79 to FY81 respec-
tively (Annex 1, T-12), remaining well within prudent limits at all times.
The understanding was reached during negotiations, reflected in the Agreed
Minutes, that PISO will continue to adhere to prudent liquidity policies and
will use as a guideline a 10% margin for the current, debt service and
interest coverage ratios.
5.14      Projected Financial Performance.  PISO's projected statements of
income and expenses are shown in Annex 1, T-11. Net income is expected to
increase from P 3.5 million in FY77 to P 16.6 million in FY81, reflecting a
yearly average increase of about 48%. The income contribution from the
long-term portfolio is expected to increase from 8.8% of total income in FY77
to 67% in FY81. Operating expenses are projected to increase from P 3.2 mil-
lion in FY77 to P 9.1 million in 1981, which is not adequately reflected by the
ratio of average total assets (2.7% and 1.7% in the years FY77 and FY81) due
to the substantially increased asset base. PISO's projections show gradually
increasing net returns on average equity from 13.3% in FY77 to 25.7% in FY81
in spite of the fact that PISO's long-term operations are expected to yield
only marginal profit during the period 1978-81; this conclusion is based on a
conservatively assumed spread of 3.5%, however. In accordance with its
policy guidelines, PISO intends to pursue dividend policies which will allow
for reasonable returns to shareholders along with a satisfactory build-up of
retained earnings. PISO intends to plow back at least 40% of its average net
earnings every year to strengthen its capital base. In line with this
policy, PISO plans to maintain a cash dividend rate of 6% (of par value)
through FY77, and projects increases in the dividend rate to 8% in FY78, 9%
in FY79 and eventually to 10% in FY81. The cash dividend payout ratio will
range between 57.5% in FY78 and 33.5% in 1980.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
Objectives of the Proposed Loan
6.01      At the moment there are only two specialized sources of long-term
capital in the Philippines: the Government-owned Development Bank of the
Philippines and the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines. The
primary objective of the proposed Bank loan to PISO is to improve the institu-
tional arrangements for providing long-term capital to the private sector by
creating one more source in addition to the existing two, thereby increasing
both the availability of long-term capital and easing the institutional
bottlenecks to the flow of such resources. These objectives are consistent
with the Philippine Government's efforts to strengthen the operations of
private financial institutions and to re-orient their financing activities
towards longer maturities. The proposed loan is consistent with the Bank's
lending strategy in the country in that it will meet the investment needs of
an increasingly important industrial sector. Another important objective of
the proposed loan is the traditional institution-building role for the Bank.
PISO is just beginning to undertake long-term operations. It is, however, a
dynamic institution and has considerable potential and promise. The Bank's
involvement from this early stage will have an impact on the institution that
should prove mutually beneficial in the long run.
Expected Utilization of the Proposed Loan
6.02      The proposed loan will be made to the Philippine National Bank
(PNB) for the use of PISO. PNB will be used as a conduit because, under
Philippine law, the Government may guarantee a loan to a public entity only.
The Bank will have a direct contractual relationship with PISO by means of a
Project Agreement. PNB is expected to charge PISO a service fee of 0.75% to
cover its adminstrative cost and Central Bank charges (0.20% of the value of
its assets related to the loan). The proposed loan will be used by PISO in
making a number of subloans. Since PISO does not have a history of long-term
lending, it is difficult to be precise about the size distribution of the
subloans. The foreign exchange risk will be fully borne by the subborrowers.
6.03      As usual with Bank Loans to DFC's, the proposed loan would have a
flexible amortization schedule conforming substantially to the aggregate of
the repayment schedules of the subloans made by PISO. The maximum term for
subloans would be 15 years including an appropriate grace period not to
exceed 3 years. PISO will charge an interest rate on subloans of up to
12-14% (including all service charges). Based on the Bank's currently
prevailing interest rate, PISO's spread could be between 3.75% and 5.75%.
Its actual spread, however, is expected to be on the lower end because there
is considerable competition from the new Off-Shore Banking Units and PISO
would not want to be priced out of the market.
6.04      It is recommended that the limit for subloans not requiring prior
Bank approval be fixed at US$750,000. Based on PISO's pipeline, this limit
would assure that at least between two-thirds and three-fourths of the sub-
loans by amount and 50% by number will be subject to the Bank's prior review.
It is recommended, in addition, that an aggregate free limit of US$5 million
should also be fixed to assure that no more than one-third of the proposed
loan amount would be accounted for by below the free-limit projects.

6.05      Procurement for subprojects financed from the Bank loans would
be in accordance with the standard practice for DFC projects, i.e., PIS0
will require subborrowers to submit several bids to PIS0 before final se-
lection of the supplier is made, after giving due regard to economy and
efficiency. Disbursements under the proposed Bank loan would be: (a) 100% of
the foreign exchange cost of direct imports; (b) the equivalent of 50% (being
the estimate of the foreign exchange component) of such amounts expended for
goods locally procured; and (c) the equivalent of 40% (being the estimate of
the foreign exchange component) of expenditure for civil works.
Agreements and Understandings Reached During Negotiations
6.06      During negotiations, the Bank reached agreement with PIS0 to the
effect that:
(a)  PIS0 will increase its equity by P 10 million prior to loan
effectiveness (para. 4.08);
(b) PISO will adhere to a long-term debt/equity ratio of 4:1
(para. 5.12); and
(c) PIS0 will adhere to a total debt/equity ratio of 10:1
(para. 5.12).
6.07      During negotiations, the Bank reached agreement with PISO with
respect to:
(a) PISO's adoption of a Policy Statement, acceptable to the Bank,
as a Condition of Board presentation of the proposed Loan
(para. 4.22);
(b) the incorporation of ERR analysis in reports for projects
exceeding the free-limit of US$750,000, and incorporation of the
usual partial indicators into all appraisal reports (para. 4.28).
6.08      During negotiations, the Bank reached an understanding with
PIS0 on the following (reflected in the Agreed Minutes of Negotiations):
(a) PISO's adoption of liquidity and debt servicing policies
acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.13); and
(b) limiting the maximum holding of a single domestic investor to
15% of PISO's total share capital (para. 4.06);
(c) the arrangements to be made for PICA's waiver of subscription
rights so that its holding in PIS0 are not more than 30% of PISO's
total share capital (para. 4.08);
(d) the target date for a public listing of PISO's shares on the stock
exchange (para. 4.06);
(e) the possible timing and mechanism of a divestment of LBP's holdings
in PISO (para. 4.09); and



- 42 -
(f) the contents of PISO's Corporate Strategy Statement.
Recommendation
6.09      A loan of US$15 million is recommended for use by PISO in financing
the foreign exchange component of imported capital goods and services for
eligible productive enterprises in the Philippine private sector on the terms
and conditions usual for Bank loans to development finance companies.

PHILIPPINES
PHILIPPINE INVESTMENTS SYSTEMS ORGANIZATION
Policy Statement
A. PISO's Role and Objectives
1.        Corporate Character.  PISO is a financial institution which is:
essentially Philippine in origin, sentiment and character; committed to the
active promotion of development-oriented investments and to the provision of
financial assistance and related services to ensure the success of such
investments; systems oriented in its approach and operations; and reliant
upon the strength derived from its organization and the diversity of its
ownership. Its primary role will be to mobilize and allocate financial
resources as efficiently as possible to further the process of economic
development.
2.        Objectives.  As a participant in the process of resource allocation,
PISO will actively seek out and assist the development of productive ventures
and income-generating projects undertaken by privately-controlled /1 business
enterprises in various sectors of economic activity. PISO will assist only
those projects and ventures which, in its judgment, are or will be financially,
economically and technically viable, and are properly organized and soundly
managed. PISO will likewise participate actively in furthering the develop-
ment of the capital market in the Philippines especially by way of long-term
domestic and foreign resource mobilization.
3.        Activities.  PISO will provide a full range of financial services,
and technical and management assistance as provided for in its Articles of
Incorporation. These will include (but not be restricted to): (a) the pro-
vision of medium and long-term financing facilities /2 by way of domestic and
foreign currency loans, guarantees and equity participation; (b) syndication,
underwriting, private placement activities; (c) the provision of financial
packaging, consultancy and investment portfolio management services; (d) leas=
ing and hire-purchase facilities; and (e) management consultancy assistance
in association with its financial services. On the resource mobilization
side, PISO will continue in expanding and diversifying the supply of financial
instruments to stimulate savings and channel them into longer-term maturities.
/1 As used here, the term applies to enterprises in which private-ownership
represents a majority (greater than 50%) share. In this connection, PISO
explicitly recognizes the role that Government participation in ownership
may need to play in accelerating investment in certain areas.
/2 For financing fixed assets and working capital.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
B. Guidelines for Operations
4.        Project Evaluation and Follow-up.  In providing assistance to any
project or enterprise, PISO will apply high professional standards in evaluat-
ing: managerial aspects; technical aspects; market prospects; financial
viability and debt-service capability; and the economic viability and desir-
ability of such projects/enterprises. It will closely monitor the implemen-
tation of projects and the eventual operations of the enterprises to which it
provides long-term assistance. Whenever it considers necessary, PISO will
provide constructive remedial advice to those enterprises it perceives in
present or eventual difficulty.
5.        Collateral.  In accordance with normal business practices, PISO will
obtain adequate security for the financial assistance it provides. PISO will
also take steps to have adequate insurance coverage obtained for its security.
Its investment decisions, however, will be guided primarily by considerations
relating to project merits.
6.        Investment Exposure Limits.  To ensure that its resources are widely
spread and prudently diversified, PISO shall adopt the following guidelines:
(a) Total financial commitment /1 (including amounts of outstanding and
undisbursed commitments) to any single enterprise /2 shall not
normally exceed an amount equivalent to 25% of PISO's net worth
(defined as the sum of its paid-in unimpaired capital, surpluses
and reserves).
(b) Total investment in any enterprise shall not normally exceed 50% of
the assets of that enterprise if it is already established or 75%
if the enterprise is being newly established.
(c) No outstanding equity investment made by PISO in any one enter-
prise shall normally exceed 49% of the paid-in share capital of
that enterprise and 15% of PISO's own net worth. This limitation
will not apply to a subsidiary, if and when established by PISO.
(d) The aggregate sum of PISO's equity investments shall not exceed
PISO's own net worth.
/1 This term includes equity investments, loans and guarantees (excluding
short-term for the latter 2 categories). The term excludes exposures
covered by hold-out agreement or any firm off-setting arrangements on
debt extended to PISO.
/2 The term enterprise as used in this Statement shall include the enter-
prise and its subsidiaries whenever PISO has any investments in such
subsidiaries.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
7.        Portfolio Diversification and Divestiture
(a)  PISO will endeavor to diversify its loan, equity and guarantee
investments in a wide variety of sectors and industries. It will
also exert its efforts to encourage investment in underdeveloped
regions and to actively promote the location of investment outside
the Metropolitan Manila Area.
(b) In accordance with its views on capital market development and to
maximize the use of its own resources, PISO shall dispose of its
equity investments as early as practicable. In selling its hold-
ings, PISO shall consider, in addition to its own interests, the
interests of the other original participants in the investment as
well as the interests of the concern whose shares are being dis-
posed of. PISO will endeavor to diversify, as widely as possible,
ownership in the entities in which it invests.
8.        New Entrepreneur/Enterprise Promotion.  In its operations, PISO
will stress the promotion of new entrepreneurs and enterprises. Broadening
the entrepreneurial base in the Philippines will be one of PISO's operational
objectives. To this end, PISO will exert reasonable efforts to: (a) extend
financial and technical assistance to small and medium scale enterprises /1;
and (b) attempt to develop a client base of enterprises which, by virtue of
their size, age, ownership or location, have not enjoyed ready access to
financial assistance as have larger, more established and better-known
corporations.
9.        Relations with Client Enterprises.  Recognizing the value and
implications of sound lender-borrower relationships, PISO will adhere to the
following policies in its dealing with client firms:
(a) PISO shall not normally seek to control any of the enterprises that
it finances nor to assume primary responsibility for the management
of such enterprises, except in the event that its interests are
jeopardized, in which case, it may take such action as may be
necessary to protect its interests. A higher percentage of equity
holding than mentioned in 6(c) above may also result from an under-
writing commitment undertaken with the expectation that the eventual
investment would be within the cited limit. Every attempt will be
made to reduce the equity holding to the maximum limit mentioned in
6(c) above as soon as practicable, all factors considered.
/1 As defined by the Department of Industry.



ANNEX 2

(b) PISO shall request its clients to establish and maintain up-to-date
records and accounts in accordance with generally accepted account-
ing practices, and furnish whatever information it may reasonably
request on their operations and accounts. Under its financial
contracts, PISO will establish its right to inspect the enterprises
it finances as well as their operations and accounts.
(c) PISO shall honor the confidences of its clients. In this connection:
no member of PISO's Board, by virtue of his/her membership, shall
have access to information submitted by clients to PISO's management
or staff when, in the view of management, such access would prejudice
the interest of the client.
10.       Dispersal of Ownership.  PISO will strive to broaden its ownership
base as widely as possible. PISO will take all possible steps to prevent any
one person, entity or group from dominating its ownership or management.
C. Financial Policy Guidelines
11.       Capital Structure, Liquidity and Debt Service.  In the conduct of
its business affairs, PISO shall exercise due financial prudence and shall
ensure that its capital structure remains sound, a reasonable liquidity
position is maintained and that its cash inflow is always sufficient to allow
a comfortable margin for servicing its debt.
12.       Reserves and Dividends.  PISO will adhere to a prudent dividend
policy which will allow it to provide a fair return on shareholders' invest-
ments and simultaneously allow for building-up retained earnings and reserves
at a reasonable rate. At a minimum, PISO shall plow back at least 40% of its
average net earnings in any given fiscal year as retained earnings. PISO
will provide, by charges against income, valuation reserves consistent with
the size and quality of its loan and equity portfolio. From time to time,
PISO shall appropriate as necessary a portion of its retained earnings to
surplus reserves to ensure that they adequately reflect the size and risks
of its portfolio and to protect its equity against erosion.
13.       Foreign Exchange Risk.  It is PISO's policy not to expose itself
to foreign exchange risks associated with foreign currency obligations/trans-
act ons.  Accordingly, PISO shall, to the extent possible, pass such risks on
to its clients or arrange, on behalf of clients, for forward cover on such
risks at no cost to itself, or make any other arrangement which insulates
PISO from bearing any part of such risks.
D. Relationships with Government Authorities
14.       PISO shall, at all times, maintain cooperative working relation-
ships with various government agencies and authorities with respect to its
investment operations and its activities toward capital market development.
Its operations will be consistent with overall government economic policies.

E. Organization and Staffing Policies
15.       In furtherance of its institutional capabilities and to assist its
clients to the fullest possible extent, PISO shall, on a continuing basis,
build and strengthen its management and staff, and evolve an efficient and
sound organizational structure. To those ends, it shall adopt equitable and
competitive recruitment, employment and compensation policies. PISO shall
provide for continuous training of its staff, realizing as it does, the
importance of human resources. PISO shall endeavor to ensure that its staff
are of a high professional calibre and represent an appropriate mix of pro-
fessional qualifications, ability and experience to permit the achievement
of its corporate objectives in the most efficient manner.
F. Revision of Policies
16.       This Policy Statement may be amended only by the affirmative vote
of at least two-thirds of all directors.

Statement of Corporate Strategy for 1978-80
1.        In the conduct of its operations, PISO will be guided by the Policy
Statement approved by its Board on March 29, 1978. This Statement of
Corporate Strategy enunciates the general directions of PISO's operations and
activities, frames in broad terms its objectives over the next three years
and outlines the course which Management proposes to chart to achieve them.
Clearly, adaptive changes in strategy will be necessary to respond flexibly
to changes that may ensue in government policy, overall economic conditions
and the regulatory environment in which PISO must function. Management, with
the approval of PISO's Board, therefore reserves the right to change strategic
thrusts in the best interests of sound and balanced long-term corporate
growth.
2.        Support for Economic Development.  PISO's corporate strategy will
be consistent with the Government's efforts at achieving stable long-term
economic growth and the efficient mobilization and allocation of financial
resources. Its efforts on the allocation side will be to concentrate on
furthering the development of the industrial, agro-industrial, tourism,
transportation, and services sectors by encouraging directly productive,
revenue generating and privately controlled business investments in these
sectors. In financing specific investments, PISO's strategy will be to
adhere to the policy established by regulatory agencies such as the Board of
Investments, Department of Tourism, etc. On the resource mobilization side,
PISO's strategy will be to support actively the development of a market for
long-term capital through the direct issue of suitable financial instruments,
support for the establishment of an effective secondary market for long-term
securities trading, encouragement for the diversification of industrial
enterprise ownership by persuading client enterprises to go public, and
cooperation in the establishment of a sound regulatory framework for the
operations of financial institutions.
3.        Operational Strategy.  With the stage of its corporate formation
and of the establishment of its reputation in the financial and business
communities coming to a close, PISO will, over the next three years, embark
on a growth path along the following lines:
(a) While PISO will maintain its character as an investment banking-
type institution, emphasis will be placed on long-term resource
mobilization and financing operations with PISO attempting to
develop a direct long-term loan portfolio (resources permitting).
Resource mobilization activities to be emphasized alongside direct
long-term financing are so-called "off-balance" sheet activities



ANNEX 3
Page 2
consisting of underwritings, private placements, syndications and
guarantees. Specifically, PISO will aim to increase its share of
the long-term financing market (for durable equipment and non-
residential construction) by about four times from a level of 1.0%
in 1977 to a level of about 3.9% by 1980. In.monetary terms
(current pesos), PISO will endeavor to provide (on an approval
basis) aggregate long-term financial assistance, by way of direct
loans, guarantees, syndications and underwriting, totaling over
F 350 million annually by 1980; of this amount, PISO's strategy
will be to achieve a balance between its direct long-term loans and
other forms of term financing.
(b) Recognizing that the gestation period for developing a mature
long-term portfolio yielding a stable revenue stream will be around
3-5 years, PISO will continue to follow a balanced approach in
restructuring of its assets to ensure the generation of income at a
satisfactory level. In relative terms, PISO will aim at reducing
the proportion of short-term assets (from trading operations) in
its total asset base from around 80% in 1977 to less than 50% by
1980. PISO will maintain an average annual growth rate in its
short-term asset base of around 25% for the period 1977-80.
(c) Growth in both short- and long-term financing operations will be
based upon a strategy of risk and portfolio diversification by
industry, by geographic region and by business groups/client firms.
PISO will aim at spreading its available funds as widely as
possible between industries, entrepreneurs and regions. Special
emphasis wil be given to the establishment of "pioneer" projects
undertaken by newer or lesser established entrepreneurs. To the
extent possible, it will actively encourage investment outside
regions where industry is presently concentrated. While being
guided primarily by considerations of individual project merit and
the investment priorities of the Government, PISO's strategy will
be to review investment proposals with particular care if such
investments cause PISO's exposure in a given industry /1 to exceed
30% of its outstanding (including committed but undisbursed funds)
long-term /2 portfolio. The limits will not be applied as arbitrary
/1 Industries here will be defined as those categories of activity at the
2-digit level using the standard international industrial classification
code.
/2 Long-term in this connection, includes PISO equity investments, and its
loans and guarantees with a maturity of over one year at the time originally
contracted.

cut-off points but as guidelines beyond which PISO's management and
Board will require special justification before approving such
investments. Exposure limits in client firms and business groups
will be based upon the guidelines embodied in PISO's Policy Statement.
4.        Financial Strategy.  In keeping with its policy of maintaining a
sound financial structure of improving financial performance as rapidly as
operational constraints will allow, PISO aims to adopt the following strategic
objectives:
(a) A reasonable increase in paid-in share capital that enables PISO
to maintain its solvency and liquidity, and at the same time a
reasonable return on capital. PISO's objective is to retain 40% of
its net earnings. During the 1978-80 period, PISO will closely
monitor securities market conditions with a view to the public
listing of its shares and the widening of its domestic ownership
base.
(b) Diversification of sources of long-term foreign and domestic funds.
PISO will aim, to the extent possible, to reduce reliance on any
one source of funds. While PISO recognizes that it may be hard
pressed to achieve, by 1980, levels of financial performance which
would permit access /1 to foreign commercial credit on reasonable
market terms, it will keep this goal in mind as one to be achieved
as soon as circumstances permit. One financial strategy to be
tested is the blending of funds from multilateral financial insti-
tutions with those from commercial sources, hoping to yield blended
costs and repayment terms that meet the requirements of the country
and projects assisted.
(c) An annual growth rate in earnings per share that will enable PISO
to attract additional equity capital, when needed.
(d) The broadening of the company's ownership base is considered as an
important objective. A gradually increasing dividend rate is
considered an essential element in the process of widening PISO's
ownership base and making its shares attractive to smaller investors.
5.        Promotional Strategy.  Between 1978-80, PISO's strategic objectives
in its promotional activities will include:
(a) Promoting (by way of identification, prefeasibility analysis,
persuasion of business groups, and financial packaging) the devel-
opment of projects in industries which: (i) utilize indigenous raw
materials; (ii) increase the value-added component in existing
product lines; (iii) create substantial employment; and (iv) further
/1 Without support by way of government guarantees.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
diversify the range of nontraditional manufactured exports. Speci-
fically, PISO will attempt to identify and promote projects which
manufacture a wider range of intermediate an; finished products:
wood nnd lumber-based products; copper and nickel-based products;
copra and coconut oil-based products; leather-based products;
construction-related products and activities; and sugar and
molasses-based products. PISO will also attempt to identify
and develop smaller projects which result in the development and
utilization of domestic energy resources (e.g. coal mining).
(b) Promoting the developing of adaptive/intermediate, i.e., labor-
intensive technology in industrial operations. While recognizing
the limitations on its abilities to convince business groups and
entrepreneurs of adopting more labor-intensive methods of produc-
tion, PISO will endeavor to support its attempts at persuasion,
with the development of close relationships with faculties of
engineer-.ng and with domestic institutes for science, applied
technolog,y and development. PISO will actively cooperate with the
Technology Resource Center in its aim to promote commercially new,
appropriate technologies. PISO will also attempt in its project
evaluations to consider whether more labor-intensive modes of
production are known which are economically feasible and point out
the advantages/difficulties of adopting such methods in a proposed
investment.
(c) Promoting the development of indigenous capital goods and engineering
industries especially in the production of general purpose equipment
commonly used by other domestic industries.
(d) Promoting small business development. PISO will aim to increase
its operations in this area from around 4-6 projects for loans
totaling P 2 million in 1978 to 15 projects for loans totaling about
P 7 million by 1980. PISO will actively participate, in a prudent
manner, in the program of the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund
designed to assist small entrepreneurs. In this connection, PISO
will attempt to establish formal links with smaller financial
institutions (such as private development banks and some of the
larger, better-run rural banks) to finance on a joint basis small
business projects in the regions to undertake an analysis into
the feasibility of launching a leasing and hire-purchase financing
subsidiary to address the equipment acquisition problems of smaller
enterprises.
(e) Promoting joint ventures and foreign investment in pioneer indus-
tries within the framework of established incentives and regula-
tions. PISO will actively seek out suitable foreign partners to
participate in projects which would benefit through the introduc-
tion of foreign capital and technology. It will actively assist

domestic entrepreneurs with contractual arrangements with foreign
partners on terms which would equitably meet the mutual interests
of project participants and would yield a substantial benefit to
the domestic economy.
