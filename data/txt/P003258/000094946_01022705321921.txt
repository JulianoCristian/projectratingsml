3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The original objectives of the Financial and Legal Management Upgrading
Project (FILMUP) as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), June 22, 1993, were to:
(1) Improve the flow of government business; (2) Improve the implementation of
development programs; and (3) Facilitate reform. At the outset of the project, many of
the basic financial aid and other processes were in disarray. The project aimed at putting
in place the building blocks that would set the stage for deeper subsidiary reforms. These
objectives would be achieved by removing obstacles through capacity building and
institutional development in the areas of accounting and auditing, public sector
procurement, legal drafting, the administration of justice, and the provision of business
information. The FILMNUP was essentially a facilitation project that provided basic,
practical inputs (vehicles, furniture, computers and training) to Government financial and
legal institutions.
The project pursued these objectives under three strategic thrusts: (1) Improving
key aspects of public private interface, including regulatory, legal, judicial and
procurement; (2) Increasing the transparency of the legal process; and (3) Building the
accounting profession within Zambia.
This strategy was consistent with the national emphasis on private initiative and
free market principles that were also expressed in the 1992 Policy Framework Paper.
FILMUP was designed to meet needs identified in two other Bank projects, the
Privatization and Industrial Reform Credit (PIRC) and the accompanying Technical
Assistance (TA), (the PIRCTA), for example, the revision of many laws dealing with
business (e.g., the Banking Act and the Companies Act). FILMUP was to provide the
resources necessary to build up a permanent capacity to deal with these legal reforms.
The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) requested targeted training and
equipment for civil servants in order to build the capacity. Although FILMUP provided
inputs to many (13) implementing agencies (Table 1), the overall objectives were clear as
the unifying theme was capacity building through hardware and training.
3.2 Revised Objective:
No revisions.
3.3 Original Components:
FILMUP had two major components: (1) Financial Management Upgrading and
(2) Legal Management Upgrading, with support from a Project Coordination and
Management Unit (PCMU). The subcomponents of each and their original allocations
were:



Financial management Upgrading (US$4.0 million)
* Upgrade accounting and auditing services through technical support in establishing
local qualifications and examinations to Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants
(ZICA-US$1.0 million);
* Train intermediate accountants at the Copperbelt University (CBU), the Accountancy
Training College (ATC), National Import and Export Corporation School of Business
Management (NSBM) (US$1.0 million); and
* Improve the Zambia National Tender Board's (ZNTB) and line ministries'
procurement performance through training, equipment, procurement reforms and
clarifying relationships (US$2.0 million);
These interventions were aimed at achieving efficiency in procurement and
building the accounting profession by strengthening the domestic accounting regulatory
authority, ZICA, increasing the supply of accountants and technicians, and issuing
accounting guidelines consistent with international standards.
Legal Management Upgrading (US$11.0 million)
* Build up legal drafting capacity at Ministry of Legal Affairs (MOLA) and the Zambia
Institute of Advanced Legal Education (ZIALE), formerly the Law Practice Institute
and the Institute of Legislative Drafting (US$3 million);
* Improve the administration of justice with provision of equipment, training and court
space to the Judiciary, including the Industrial Relations Court (IRC) (US$5.7
million);
* Print the revised Laws of Zambia (US$2.0 million); and
* Improve availability of information on corporate affairs to investors through training
and equipment for the Registrar of Companies (US$0.3 million).
The improvement in the administration of justice aimed at accelerating the
resolution of commercial cases and thereby improving the Government's operations that
deal with the private sector. Building the capacity for legal drafting also aimed at
improving the Government's role in creating a climate favorable to a growing private
sector through more responsive and precisely written laws and legal opinions. The
updating and dissemination of the complete laws of Zambia was desperately needed to
equip the legal community because a comprehensive update and consolidation had not
been done for 20 years. FILMUP further improved the legal environment for businesses
by strengthening the Registrar of Companies' ability to register new companies and
provide information to the public about existing companies.

The remainder of the credit amount consisted mainly of price contingencies
(US$1.9 million) and project coordination (US$0.9 million). The components aimed at
relieving the priority constraints in achieving the main project objectives. Implementing
agencies were not overtaxed because the many FILMUP activities were divided among
13 implementing agencies.

At the Mid-term Review, an additional US$999,503 was allocated to fund an
additional 200 sets of the Laws of Zambia and 500 copies on CD-Rom.

3.4   Revised Components:
No revisions. The components remained as originally designed, although with
some small reallocation of funds between components (see Annex 2 tables). The Lands
Tribunal was added as a beneficiary at the Mid-Term Review (see Table 1) in order to
speed up the delivery of justice with respect to land cases considered important to the
overall reform program.

3.5   Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry is rated satisfactory by the ICR as counterparts were deeply
involved in project preparation and the design was responsive to national priorities of
improving government operations that deal with the private sector, of increasing legal
transparency, and building the accounting profession. FILMUP design took into account
implementation capacity constraints as implementing agencies set their own programs.
The Zambia FILMUP also benefited at the design stage from the experience of another
FILMUP that had been financed in Tanzania. There was no Quality Assurance Group
(QAG) assessment.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4. 1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Zambia FILMUP's participating agencies prepared and managed their own
components and set their programs according to the three guiding principles of improving
the public/private interface, legal process transparency and strengthening the accounting
profession. Both the financial component, which encompasses the upgrading of public
procurement, and the legal component are rated satisfactory. A summary of objectives,
achievements and impacts is provided in Annex Table 1.
The expected results of the FILMUP were:
Improve the Administration of Justice for Commercial Cases- Faster legal drafting
requiring improved capacity in drafting laws, faster and more efficient Industrial
Relations Court, and improved administration of justice requiring better training and
physical working conditions, and an improved system of legal information for investors.
Increase Legal Process Transparency: Revised printed and disseminated complete sets
of the laws of Zambia.
Strengthen the Accounting Profession: Improved accounting and auditing standards,
more qualified accountants (to remedy the dire shortage of accountants - 150 available
whereas 420 needed), stronger capacity of ZICA and introduction of a national
qualification for technicians.
Public Sector Procurement: Faster and more efficient procurement practices and
standardized documentation of international standard, (the latter, mainly a legislative
problem of establishing rules and requirements and thresholds), and improved the
procurement skills of the ZNTB.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Legal Management Upgrading
The most significant impact of FILMUTP was improving the Government's legal
processes that the private sector uses. FILMUP training built capacity in legal drafting



- 6 -
which was essential to the long overdue revision of Zambian laws and further reform.
FILMUP financed training in legal drafting, commercial law, criminal law and
international law. In addition, FILMUP provided for 14 master's degree programs for
judges and magistrates (Judiciary subcomponent). About half of these were converted to
shorter programs because judges could not afford such a long leave of absence. This
training had a major impact on the Judiciary transforming the way commercial cases
were treated. The training led to the development of a "Commercial List" which placed
time-sensitive cases affecting businesses on a fast track for hearing. Commercial cases
are now "judge-driven" and are heard in a fraction of the time of criminal cases whose
handling has not undergone a similar transformation. Private sector companies have
noted the significant improvement in case processing (see Annex 10). Another major
impact of training was the initiation of judicial specialization where judges would be
assigned cases relevant to their particular expertise and would continue to build expertise
and better handle complex and technical cases. For example, judges were better able to
take into account the socio-economic impact of their decisions.
An important achievement in increasing transparency of the legal process was to
print and disseminate the Revised Laws of Zambia (1995 edition), a comprehensive, 26
volume set of laws. Under FILMNP, 1,000 sets were printed (800 originally planned and
200 added at the mid-term review). On its own initiative, MOLA established a revolving
fund to purchase another 200 sets (making a total of 1,200 sets). The laws were also put
on CD-Rom and 500 copies have been delivered. There is now broad access by
government, the legal fraternity as a whole, scholars and the public to up-to-date and
comprehensive legal information, which facilitates research for cases by judges and
lawyers. One snag is that in some instances there is only the need for certain laws or
category of laws, but it is required to purchase the entire set which is beyond the means
of some potential customers. Impact would be enhanced if it were possible to purchase
excerpts of the laws. Another problem is that updates to the laws is done in an ad hoc
way, with owners of the sets of laws responsible for collecting legal amendments as they
come through. Owners of CD-Rom law sets will be informed of any revisions and
amendments which will be provided through the Ministry of Legal Affairs.
To further promote transparency, FILMUP procured much needed books and
journals to update legal libraries, which has facilitated legal research and improved the
quality of case preparation, legal write-ups and opinions. Future procurements will be
enhanced if they are combined with improvements in library management such as better
security, enforcing late fines, and documents organization.
FILMUP helped rebuild a professional working environment by improving the
physical working conditions in a number of agencies through the delivery of furniture
and office equipment (e.g., at ZIALE, before which there were no properly equipped
offices). The project helped improve also the document security (filing cabinets), data
storage (computerization, e.g., at the Judiciary), better access to judges' cases and
decisions (Judiciary and IRC), better company information (computerization at the
Registrar of Companies), faster document processing and overall improved organization
and accessibility of legal information. At the IRC, judges were able to handle nearly five
times the caseload targeted (700 in 1999 vs. 150 reported in 1994). With the better
performance, adjudication became more attractive to businesses and the caseload



- 7 -
increased faster than judges' productivity. Although the case backlog did not decrease,
more cases were being resolved.
Vehicles greatly improved officials' ability to regularly attend court sessions,
meetings and other appointments on time. Administration of justice improved locally.
Furthermore, vehicles were distributed to the provinces under the Judiciary component.
Although the provision of vehicles was an important contribution by FILMU:P to
Government operations, it was also one of the least sustainable parts of the project. In the
case of ZLDC, for example, of the two 4X4 vehicles it received, one was reported stolen
from the police station and the other was damaged in an accident and had been in repair
for nearly two years.
Financial Component
FILMUP strengthened the accounting profession by helping ZICA introduce a
locally administered accounting technician qualification, NATECH, which has trained
between 600 and 700 technicians on a fee for service basis. NATECH has reduced
dependence on foreign institutions for qualification at the technician level. Although the
supply of technicians has increased, the demand for technicians has risen rapidly due to
the higher requirements of decentralization. Thus, it will take several years to close the
gap between the supply and demand for technicians. The next profession building step is
to develop a qualification for associate accountants, and then for full, chartered
accountants. Another important step in building the accounting profession was that
ZICA issued some accounting and auditing guidelines consistent with international
standards.  ZICA will need further capacity building to effectively regulate the
accounting profession.
The accounting profession was also strengthened under FILMUP as additional
accountants were trained with the help of FILMUP support to the training colleges at
ATC, the NSBM and the accountancy department of CBU which represent three of the
eight accountant training institutions (the Zambia Center for Accounting Studies being
the major training institute). Capacity was created at CBU, ATC and NSBM through the
provision of books, equipment and technical assistance, which contributed to nearly a
doubling of accounting graduates from those institutions. Vehicles also played an
important role as the acquisition of a school bus at one college on the Copperbelt led to
increased enrollments because it allowed students to reach the school on the outskirts of
town (which was not served by public transport). The provision of computers to the
training colleges has led to an increase in graduates with computer skills, which are in
short supply in Zambia.
FILMUP helped upgrade national procurement capacity by strengthening ZNTB.
* Public procurement software has been installed. The acquisition of computers and
installment of public procurement software has led to the computerization of the
procurement process since January 2000. Processing time and tender costs have been
reduced.



- 8 -
*  Procurement guidelines conforming to international standards and acceptable to the
majority of users have been produced, widely circulated, debated and implemented
with launch workshops held in all provinces with 400 persons attending. The
Permanent Secretaries and the donors were afforded a chance to discuss the
guidelines. These guidelines are a first step in decentralizing procurement to the
ministries.
*  The motor vehicles acquired have allowed the inspection department to carry out
procurement audits. This was a modification of the original plan which had not
included vehicles for the inspection department.
Upgrading the procurement function was promoted through the Second Economic
and Social Adjustment Credit, which had as a trance release condition the
implementation of the procurement action plan that was approved in May 1996. All
procurements that were planned under the project were completed, except for civil works.
Civil works were not carried out as planned because the proposals were not in conformity
with Bank guidelines. In the case of ZIALE, new buildings, rather than renovated ones
were needed, and in the case of the IRC, the building was not owned by the government,
but rather another organization. Another building designated for upgrade was a historical
monument and could not be modified.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not applicable
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The main impact of FIILMJUP on institutional development was achieved through
the three strategic thrusts of improving key aspects of the public/private interface
(regulatory, legal, judicial and procurement), increasing legal transparency, and building
the accounting profession. FILMUP achieved institutional development by providing
desperately needed resources to carry out responsibilities. FILMVP succeeded in these
three areas of institutional development because Zambia offered an environment
predisposed to respect the rule of law along with a sense of professional pride. By
providing complementary resources, beneficiary agencies were able to make better use of
their human and financial resources. Human resources benefited from training and tools
(vehicles and computers) needed to do their jobs. As a result beneficiary agencies
functioned better even though the government budget allocations were often inadequate
and far below plan



5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5. 1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency.
With very few exceptions, FILMUP was rated satisfactory for both components
and in all aspects during supervision missions throughout the project life (Annex 8).
There was an instance of alleged supplier fraud that may cost FTLvIP equipment
valued at US$46,000. The alleged fraud hinges on possible collusion between a supplier
and a freighter with respect to a shipment of goods from London. Only part of the order
was shipped and the supplier has since gone into liquidation. The matter is still being
pursued by the MOF through the Zambian High Commission in London. The
Government will keep the Bank apprised of any developments.
Poor consultant performance in a few areas also limited the impact of FILMUP.
At the ZNTB, the impact was partial because computer system bugs have prevented the
printing of tender reports. Although some of the poor performance was beyond their
control, a large part of the responsibility lies with ZNTB as described in section 5.3.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The largest factor was the shortfall in government contributions. Government
contributed only US$204,000 of its US$1.6 million commitment. Thus, the GRZ did not
meet a condition of the development Credit Agreement (Section 3.05 of Article III).
Despite this difficulty the project was able to meet its objectives as most procurements
were eligible for IDA financing. The Government also tended to provide less resources
for the agencies' overall budgets than planned. It was reported that in FY99, GRZ
provided only K4 billion of a K13 billion allocation to the Ministry of Legal Affairs.
Such shortfalls detracted from the project in a number of ways, including undermining
the Government's scrutiny and inspection of contract performance, and lower morale.
The slow pace of public sector reform limited the impact of the training program
for procurement specialists. Once trained, the specialists could not enter their new
positions because government agencies had not been restructured nor had set up
procurement units. Even the 90 persons that were trained could not be employed until the
agencies had been restructured. The slow pace of public sector reform also impeded the
decentralization of procurement.
On the legal side, FILMUP was successful in accelerating the delivery of justice
once the case reached the court. However, the legal process was still very slow in
criminal cases in the investigative and prosecutorial functions, which were not covered
under FELMUP.
The low Government pay scale also hurt the impact from FILMUP because staff
trained under FILMUP were easily tempted to leave Government for higher paying
private sector jobs, as was often the case of trained legal drafters.



- 10-
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The major positive outcome in terms of implementation was that Implementing
Agencies (IAs) generally made very good use of the equipment and training which led to
success in improving Government operations that deal with the private sector, legal
transparency and strengthening the accounting profession. Most training was successful
and, with some exceptions, most notably in legal drafting, trainees did not leave their
institutions in significant numbers. The vast majority of trainees under the Judiciary, the
largest component, remained with the Judiciary. The Registrar of Companies did so well,
that it became independent of Government funding in 1997. It operates on revenues it
receives from registering companies, patent and trademark applications, and information
requests.
There were also difficulties in implementation. The largest difficulty was in
ensuring that suppliers and contractors were competent to deliver goods and services.
lAs needed further capacity building in quality control. In the civil works category, lAs
should have verified ownership of the building to undergo civil works, and should have
proposed only rehabilitation and not new construction, which was not allowed under the
Development Credit Agreement. There was also an example where the head of the
beneficiary institution, in this case ZICA, tended to manage the component in a non-
transparent way, restricting others at the institution from  information regarding
implementation, and reducing FlLMUP's impact in building the accounting profession.
The ZNTB was in the throes of preparing for reorganization for the first two and
one half years of FILMUP. The ZNTB activities depended on a diagnostic study that was
to identify problems in the procurement system and recommend solutions. The study was
substandard in part because of poor supervision by ZNTB. Without an acceptable action
plan, activities could not proceed, causing a delay of over two years. The ZNTB
subcomponent had disbursed a mere US$0.2 million (out of US$1.8 million planned) by
end of 1996, but recovered quickly with training and equipment purchases and had
disbursed 93 percent of its original allocation by project close. Nevertheless, the lost
time resulted in many activities being rushed at the end of the project. Line ministries
were not as prepared to set up procurement units, and could not absorb trainees which
slowed implementation of the component. The advisory council to the ZNTB has been
held up in Parliament and, therefore, not implemented.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total credit amount was US$18 million of which 93 percent, or US$16.7
million, was disbursed. The credit was made on standard IDA terms with a term of 40
years.



6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability is rated as likely, mainly because there is a follow-up Public
Service Capacity Building Program (PSCAP). Otherwise, the sustainability rating would
be less likely. Although the training inputs and the resulting benefits of elevating the
efficiency and effectiveness of operations among the beneficiary institutions can be
sustained for the medium term, the supply and maintenance of other inputs such as
equipment and vehicles would not likely be sustained.
Although the main project objectives were largely achieved, sustainability is a key
issue for FILMUP. Because of FILMP's nature as a facilitation project, combined with
the chronic budget difficulties of GRZ, the potential for losing some of the gains is
significant. Questions arise as to what will happen as vehicles, furniture and computers
age. There does not appear to be a built-in mechanism to ensure that they can be
maintained and replaced. In view of low civil service pay, there is also limited assurance
that people who were trained will continue in their posts. In the short-run, to counter the
threat to sustainability, the GRZ and the Bank have launched the PSCAP. The PSCAP,
like FILMUP, has the objective of improving public service efficiency and effectiveness
and will continue reforms started under FILM[UP.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The PSCAP is the first of a three-stage Adaptable Program Lending (APL) credit
in the amount of US$28 million. PSCAP not only provides hardware, but aims at more
fundamental public sector reforms that would enhance sustainability of injections of
hardware and training. Additional computerization of tender submission and processing
at ZNTB (also a beneficiary of PSCAP) and at the ministries are needed to continue
procurement reforns. Another remaining concern is that a few of the smaller agencies
that benefited under FILMIUP are not targeted under PSCAP (e.g., ZIALE). The
sustainability of their gains is therefore in jeopardy.
The new Governance program, supported by a number of donors, should promote
sustainability of FILMIJP's impact because it emphasizes budgeting, financial
accountability and transparency. The Governance plan for building capacity for good
governance also focuses on the effectiveness of MOLA including ZIALE, ZLDC and the
Lands Tribunal, all of which were FILMUJP beneficiaries. However, it is not clear what
resources will be made available to these institutions under the Governance program.

Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Bank performance was satisfactory. In the area of project design, the Bank
effectively involved Zambian counterparts. Desperately needed basic hardware and
training required to build professionalism and legal services to deal with commercial
matters were identified and financed. The major weakness was not to build in a way to
sustain the gains of the project. Thus, while important to the national objectives of
improving government operations, legal transparency and the accounting function,
FILMTUP lacked a strategy to maintain and replace the inputs.
7.2 Supervision:
A weakness during supervision was caused by the changes in task team leaders
(three different leaders). There were delays in getting no objections following the first
change in the task team leaders. Due to complaints from most beneficiaries, the Bank
assigned a new task team leader. The task team leader who took over and saw the project
to its close worked very well with the beneficiaries. This task leader had a positive
approach and good grasp of the project objectives. Most beneficiaries commended this
approach especially in its effectiveness in problem solving. Beneficiaries appreciated
timely decisions during supervision missions which aided implementation.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. The Bank did well in helping to group
the vast array of needs among 13 beneficiary institutions into six major procurements:
two for computers, two for vehicles, one for furniture, and one for equipment. This
approach saved money and was a valuable experience in procurement for the agencies
involved. However, the Bank might have given additional assistance to the agencies with
quality control of some of the contracts.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The GRZ beneficiaries had a high degree of ownership of project design as they
determined their own needs under FILMUP. The inexperience of some of the agencies in
procurement did result in some problems with specifications, such as in the balance
between computers and peripheral devices.  Some agencies purchased too few
peripherals, such as surge protectors and printers, for the number of computers to be
served. Another example was that at the Judiciary a much more heavy duty copier was
required than what was procured.



- 13 -
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government performance, to be distinguished from IA performance, was
unsatisfactory. The Government was not able to provide the counterpart funding as
agreed with the Bank. Out of a budget of US$1,600,000 GRZ contributed only
US$204,000 over the entire period of the project. The peak of the implementation period
fell in a time of significant macroeconomic difficulties for Zambia. Government's
capacity to enforce the contracts was also sometimes weak as it, on occasion, failed to
invoke its rights under contracts where the supplier underperformed.
The signing of disbursement letters was delayed when the special accounts were
under the Ministry of Finance (MOFED). However, the system improved when the
accounts were brought under the control of the supervising ministry, MOLA. Similarly,
the signing of withdrawal applications speeded up when the panel of signatories was
expanded beyond the loans and investments department of MOFED to include the office
of the GRZ Coordinator of World Bank programs based at the same ministry.
7.6 Implemenfting Agency:
IA performance was satisfactory. Without IAs' ability to plan and use training
and equipment for their intended purposes, FILMIUP would not have fulfilled its major
objectives. In addition, in almost all cases, lAs utilized their full allocation under the
credit. Areas where performance needed improvement was in planning of training,
contract/consultant management and monitoring and evaluation. Training requests were
appropriate at the Judiciary and the Registrar of Companies, but in some cases tended to
be ad hoc rather than tied in to a strategic institutional plan (e.g., ZICA). lAs sometimes
had difficulty managing consultants and ensuring full service delivery (e.g., ZNTB's
management of the diagnostic study and computerization of tendering consultancies). In
monitoring and evaluation, although lAs could keep track of what inputs they were
actually getting from FILMUP, they were less able to assess the impact of the inputs on
operations. There was a lack of monitorable output and outcome indicators in place by
which to judge impact. It would have been particularly important to track how many
trainees remained with their institutions and for how long to give a better idea of the
benefits from investments in training, and, possibly, the need to provide better incentives
to retain newly trained personnel.
7. 7 Overall Borrower performance:
Taken as a whole (Government and IA), Borrower performance was satisfactory with
the major exception being the counterpart funds shortfall and some procurement
problems arising from inexperience.

8. Lessons Learned
*  Externally provided training, equipment and vehicles can be successful in
developing legal institutions where there is a fundamental respect for the rule of
law. There was a risk in the FILMUP design that the overseas training, vehicles and
computers would be wasted if MOLA and the Judiciary did not have a commitment to
restoring an operating legal system supportive of the private sector. At the Judiciary,
the judges took advantage of the legal training and computerization of caseloads in
order to better serve commercial parties. They recognized the time sensitivity of
cases and responded by greatly reducing the time necessary to schedule and hear a
case. Commercial entities have the perception now that legal remedy is far more
effective in Zambia as evidenced by the rapidly growing number of cases.
*  Professionalism can be rebuilt with basic inputs where there is already a sense of
professional duty and pride. FILMUP's provision of basic office necessities such
as furniture, office equipment, transportation and training was effectively put into use
because members of the accounting and legal profession who benefited from
FILMUP had been instilled with a sense of professional duty. At the time of
FILMUP, these professionals lacked the basic tools needed to operate as
professionals. Had legal and accounting professionals not had such a sense of
responsibility, it is doubtful that the NATECH would have been established, or that
commercial cases would have been greatly accelerated.
*  Even when professionalism  is the norm, constructive leadership is still a
requirement for the successful use of resources. In the case of ZICA, it was clear
that although the lAs accomplished significant achievements, their impact was
reduced because the component head for most of the project was arbitrary and
secretive in his management of FILMUP resources which led to a lack of coherent
strategy for the component during the early part of the FILMUP.
*  Countries with a history of implementation difficulties may need extraordinary
intensive assistance to select contractors that are qualified and ensure that they
perform satisfactorily. Even though there was a procurement specialist specifically
hired to avoid engaging substandard contractors, the specialist himself was
substandard and lAs in many cases had to fend for themselves. This breakdown led
to poor contractor performance. For example at the ZNTB, did not enforce the
contract to get the supplier of the public procurement software to account for specific
performance even though the package had left out the module for generating reports.
The CBU failed to discipline or terminate the contract of an expert who had
performed poorly. In still another case, ZNTB lost an opportunity to engage
consultants for training and procurement because they also believed they could avoid
the Bank's procurement procedures arguing that time was running out before project
close.
*  Overall public sector reform, including adequate compensation is vitally
important to ensuring that institutions can fully realize the benefits of staff
training. Slow public sector reform undermined the training for procurement officers



- 15 -
for attachment to ministerial procurement units because the ministries had not yet
carried out decentralization activities. Trained cadets could not be placed in the
ministries because the ministries do not yet have decentralized procurement units, nor
budgets for the extra staff. The Zambia National Tender Board (ZNTB) is now
having to carry the burden of paying these cadets. On compensation, the lecturers
who were trained to attain Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA)
or Chartered Institute of Management Accountants CIMA, left CBU after qualifying
because of poor remuneration. Although training was provided, improved capacity
has not been sustained. In addition, in the absence of civil service pay reform,
training as an incentive to work in the public sector is only transitory. Training
qualifies personnel for better paying private sector jobs. This is not necessarily bad
for the nation as a whole, but it makes it difficult to build and sustain capacity in the
public sector as was the case for legal drafters at MOLA.
It is important at design stage to consider the sustainability of project activities
beyond project life, especially for facilitation projects. F1LMUP really did not
incorporate measures to enhance sustainability of equipment and vehicle supply and
maintenance. There was discussion of a follow-up FILMUP II as a way to continue
the activities, but not a strategic approach to lessen the dependency for further
procurement support.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
*  By and large the project objectives have been achieved. The project provided much
needed funds to improve human capacity and physical working environment in the
beneficiary institutions.
*  Training in World Bank procurement guidelines is essential to  all project
stakeholders.  The lack of knowledge of these procedures often resulted in
procurement delays and affected the speed of project implementation. Emphasis is
accordingly being placed in new projects on acquiring knowledge of the procedures.
*  There was no provision for supervisory consulting services in the purchase and
installation of computers to ensure that the supplier or contractor either at time of
supply or installation provided the correct items as well as properly installing them.
Such services are essential to help undertake physical assessment of supplier capacity
prior to contracting.
*  The Government faces serious financial problems in meeting counterpart funding
requirements. Therefore, it would greatly ease the pressures on the Government if the
requirement of counterpart funding for local costs were eliminated altogether.



- 16 -
* The enhanced coordinating role of the borrower's representative including the
contracting of project staff created stability in the project management and minimized
discontinuity in project implementation.
* Training can be an incentive for officers to remain in employment where the
conditions of service are unattractive.
*  Being largely a procurement and training related project, FILMUP should be viewed
as a foundation project upon which other improvements in financial and legal
management can be continued.
* Sustainability is not easily achievable in a project with a high output of depreciative
assets.

Annex 10. Private Sector Feedback on the Commercial List
D.H. Kemp and Company
The observation by D.H. Kemp is that there has been a remarkable change in the
way commercial matters are being handled by the Commercial Court since the
establishment of the Commercial List as compared to the time when all such cases had to
pass through the Principal Registry.
The notable change they have discovered in using the Commercial Court is that it
is more efficient and disposes of its cases more expeditiously as compared to the other
court. The reasons for this being that:
I.    The court deals only in Commercial Matters hence the Commercial List is less
congested thereby giving room to judges to deal with such cases more expeditiously.
2.    Another advantage with the Commercial Court is that immediately a suit is filed,
it is allocated to a judge for hearing and upon receipt of the file, the judge appoints a date
of hearing for the case. This brings about conclusion of the case faster than in the
ordinary court where upon filing a suit, parties have to go through the process of
exchanging pleadings and thereafter apply to the judge in charge to have the matter
settled down for trial.
3.    The Commercial Court does not entertain unnecessary adjoumments like in the
other court as the party applying for such is made to pay a fine. This prevents
unnecessary delays in concluding cases.
4.    The fees in Commercial Registry are higher than those in the Principal Registry
meaning that a party going to the Commercial Court should have a genuine cause of
action. This prevents litigants from bringing frivolous and baseless Law Suits, or other
suits which could otherwise be settled outside court.
However, the Court would be more efficient and produce better results if judges
appointed to hear such cases were trained and specialized in commercial matters.
Specialization should not only be restricted to Commercial matters, but to all branches of
the law, e.g., constitutional, criminal etc. Consideration should be given to establish
other courts in the same manner as the Commercial Court. This would bring about
efficiency in the dispensation of justice not only in Commercial Matters but in all cases
that are brought before the Courts of Law.
Simeza Sangwa and Company
The introduction of the Commercial List has been effective so far in the area of
speedy delivery of judgments. Judges are paying more attention in cases before the
Commercial Court, and litigants bringing their cases through the Commercial Registry
should be ready and serious.

There are however, some "grey" areas in the working of the system. The 'grey'
areas relating to borderline cases which have some elements of commercial issues and
some elements not relating to commercial law for example in cases where the Zambia
Revenue Authority assessment of tax is questioned, the judges are sometimes not sure
whether the determining factor for a case to be brought before the Commercial Court
should be the content and substance of the case rather than the mode of commencing the
litigation. There is need therefore, to clarify the rules of the Commercial Court, as they
appear to be too general. There is also need for the judges to show more activism in
interpreting and applying the rules.
Allocation of cases before the Commercial Court is faster than the Civil Registry.
Before the Commercial Court was established, it would take any time up to six months
before a case would be allocated to a judge, but now with the introduction of the
Commercial Court, a case is allocated within a week after filing.
The disposal of cases before the Commercial Court is much faster with sometimes
a maximum of six months whereas in the Civil Registry some cases can be pending for
three to four or more years. The fact that the judges in the Commercial Court are now
very strict about observing deadlines in conducting the pleadings, has sent a new message
to both lawyers and clients to be more serious and ready before they bring any case
before that Court.
There is however need to have the judges better trained in commercial cases in
order to deal with the demand of the changing times. There is obviously a learning curve
for the officers in the Registry before everything could be said to run smoothly in the
operations of the Commercial Court.
The success rate in disposal of cases is very high.
Levy Mwanawasa and Company (Dissenting View)
The new Commercial List, in the view of the this firn, has made the legal process
even more inefficient. Statements of proposed witnesses attending before a judge require
to be filed before a trial date can be fixed further increasing the line of pending cases. It
is not uncommon for such status conferences for trial dates to be fixed five to six months
ahead.
The Registry staff do not yet know how to operate the computers [project staff
confirmed the contrary, that staff can effectively use computers] and the perception is that
it was a waste of time to acquire these facilities. When asked to access information on
any Court Record, one is told that the date has not been entered and then time is spent to
locate the physical file, which may not be found.
A part from benefiting the Judiciary in increased Court fees, the Commercial List
has not introduced any benefit to the litigants.
