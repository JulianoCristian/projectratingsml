MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE GOVERNMENT OF ZAMBIA
FOR A FINANCIAL AND LEGAL MANAGEMENT
UPGRADING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and ro       on a proposed credit to
Zambia for SDR _ milion,   equivalen of US$18.0 million, on standard IDA tem  with a maturit
of 40 years to belp finance a projet of finania and lega managemen upgr .
2.    Sector Bagrond. Durig the last two years Zambia has made a commedabe effort to
reverse the economic decline of the past twenty years. Its ambitious reform progra. has inluded
(among o     masures) reduction of the budget deficIt, liberaliation of interest  d ehge rates,
and a maJor pODvatzatin progam. Governm   sey  alms at providing a less intrusive and more
suportve framework for private investment, rehiiation of the physical and socal   ucture,
ipvement of social services, alleviation of pwerty, mplemenion of  on         policies, and
enhancement of the efficiency of public intto. This last element of th straty (mpement of
the efficiency of public instions including the civil seice) is the focus of the project described in
this report.
3.    There are some goverment services which are absolutely indispesable for the developm
and efficiency of all sectors of the economy, but which are often ignored, by-passed by ew nal
asstac, or taken for grted, because they are not closely associaed with any single sector. Such
services  lude accouning and auting, procrmen, and the    nitton of justdee.
4.    In Zambia, goverment has created the hIttons necesy for the assurance of these
sevices. The Zambia Institue   of Certfied Accountats (ZICA) is Cged with the development and
regulation of fte accouncy profession, whie the Accountt-General and Auditor-Genera are
respectively responsible for acung and auiting In the ci  service. The Zambia National Tender
Board Is reponsible for public sector prcement, and the Mnstry of Lega Affairs (MOLA) and its
agencies are responsle for all legal matters, including the drafting of law, the certfication of
lawyers, and the administrton of justice.
5.    Govement and donors alike have been aware for a long time that there was considerable
room for imvement in the qualIty of services prvded by the instions meioned in the
preceding paagraph, pardy becase of the same inaeqacy of human and material resources afflicting
aUl public agencies, and partly because much foreign astance tnds to be sector-focused, and these
services do not belong in ay paricular sector. Such assistance as has been forthcoming has tended to
be piecemn   and poody codiae  while cetan key institutions, for example, ZICA and the
judiciary, have never received any eter  asstace.
6.    This need for Improvement was confirmed In interviews the IDA appraisa mission conducted
with principal uses of these serices - govenment departents, partst   Institutions and donor
agencies employn accounting, auditing, procumet and lega draftg services; public and private



2
secr istttions ad private accouting fms hg                  lawy  in public and private
practice; entrepreus, and ordinary members of the public subject to the administration of justice.
7.    There is a sevr shortage of qualified acountas in Zambia (estmaed at about 300 fuly
qualied, about 1,000 semi-qualified, and about 4,000 tchnian level), with fregners holding many
accounting jobs in the economy, and hardly any Mly qualified profeional aountan  in the cvil
service. Procurement services are slow, contentious, be-deved by lack of standardized procedures
and du on, and considerably slow  down both goverme   and erally--fnanced
developt. The proes of legal drafftig is dow, with the country faing an immediate need to draft
or r-draft more than fifty pieces of legiation (including a Companies Act daing back to pre-
indepndence days) to implement its economic reform program, while only about one-third of the
legislative drafting posts are filled because of the shorte of qualified perone. Ti
of justce is saddled with a judiiry which is inadequately exosed to modern developments,
particarly in commerca law, with legal precedents rendered    ile  by lack of finds to publish
the Laws of Zanmia, rural law courts some of which sit In dilapidated buildings, and court fles which
somedmes go missing due to insecure storage.
S.    Gownment Stuuey. In the accuntg field, ZICA, actg on behaf of govement, has
prepared a o ensi  long-em strategy entitled Proposa on the Future Stucture, Trag  and
Development of the Accuntacy Pfensson in Zambie. The document covers, among other aspects,
plans to adapt accountancy taining and exanxnatons more cosely to Zambian needs, rationalize
accountancy training institutions and qualifications, and produce more national profesonally quaified
accountants, while SiVing to maintain inionally accepted profsional standards. In the area of
public sector prcement, Govermn  has set the frmework through the Zambia National Tender
Board Act, 1982, etbshing ZNM, ad the Teder Reguations, 1990, 3etting up its committees and
the limi to their procurement   ios. What is now required is to make this framework
uction as intended. As regards the administion of justice, the legal framework was largely
inherited from the Bfitis colonil Govnment at independence, and comps  the same Iricate mix
of common law and  somary laws found in most Commonwealth African counties. Govenment
stategy is to uphold the rue of law and the efficie  adminisraton of justce by contining to adapt
and moderiz this inheritd legal famework, whe assuring the competence and   epdence of the
judiciay.
9.    Pjct Objectv.  The prmary objective of the project is to improve sadards of
acunting, public sector procurement, and legal services, by strengthening key insuto  imolved in
these three activ    through Impvements in their human and matedal resorces. The project is
expected tD make a noticeable impact on many of the deficiencies noted in the preceding paragraphs.
10.   Projct Dcriptfon. Ihe project is divided into two main pats: financial magement
urding, comprising imprvements to accounting and procurment services, and legal management
upgrading, which onsis  of improvemen  to legal services. Over a five-year peiod, the project
would provide assistance for: (a) FAeen     Maaagw*nt           thrugh () accountncy
development and traNng (JS$2.5 million) by proig  trang, eupmnwt, library support and
tcic  assice for the main ptofssional accounay orgaiation, ZICA, and three major
accutany nsttutions, namely, the Accountancy Trang College (ATC), the NIEC School of
Business Maagement (NSBM), and the Accounnq Deatment of Cpperbt University; and (ii)
pwcment imrvement (US$2.1 million) by providing rag, eqpment, and techical assistnce
to the Zambia National Tender Board (ZNTB); (b) Legal Manawemei Upgrading (US$12.5 million)
through the prvion of trainig, equipment, essential publicis and minor building rehabilitation
works for the Minisby of Lega Affairs (MOLA) and its maor agences iluding the Juiciay, the



3
ndutrW  Roation Court 4RC) and the Law Practce Institute (LPI) as well as for the Registrar of
Companes and leg services of a few key Ministries (e.g., Finace, Agi Lre, Lands, Inustry and
Trade); (c) Plje Ct  ornlnale  and Management (US$2.5 million) to pay for the office costs and
salaies of two project coordinators: one for the financial magement fomponen,  who wil o seve
as the project accountant, and the other for the legal mangement componen, the costs of the project
launch worop, the hidependent audit of proect accomuft, prment               an d the
inrementd operating costs of project nstituions (to be finced by the gpvanm). The project, to
be implemented over 5 years, Is esdmed to cost about US$19.6 million. Project costs and financing
are summaized In Schedule A. The proposed prcurem    methods, allocaton and dibu ns of
the IDA Credit ae in Schedues B and C. Staff Appral Repop  No .........Is beig distrbuted
separately.
11.  PAJet I       n     on. No new Intiution Is t be crated under this project. Ths aim is
to reinforce xisting  iuos by providing them with the resources and orientio  esa  for
carrying out the tsks for which they were established. Each projet beneficiary intton would
implemt its own components of the project. However, in view of the large num    of fary small
governm  agencies Involved, and to faltate cordion of project Implementton, r        g,
monh3ing and suvion, project agencies have been grouped into two broad categs
resondn broady to the two ftcetioai areas the project is designed to improve. Thus, fincial
man4ag   upgrain Oasically accunting and pcuremt), involving ZICA, CBU, ATC, NSBM,
and ZNTB would be coordanxted by a Finamcial Component Coordinator (FCC) locaied in ZICA. Tne
upgra     of the legal servics involving the MOLA and its ageacies, hnuig the JIiciary, the IRC
and LPI, as well as the Regir  of Companies, would be cootdinated by a Lgal Component
Coodinator (LCC) located in MOLA. The aboe  grouping of re ilities has boee tested and
proved efective ding proje preparaion. The apprais  also cofirmed tat project in      can
mplement their compents and dellx the expected results.
12.   PrWect Su.tulnabfllty. With no new iniion or PMU, and no incremental operatig
cos beyond the life of the project, no sustnability problem i8 f _een. Most of the project benefits
(drafted laws, better trained personel, and better sevices) would actually be realized during the
prject period. In addito, most project instiuons are e  d in cost recovey prgram, which
would be intensified and monitored during the project.
13.   Lessons ftm Previous Bank/DA Invovent  Based on OED fiding on Technical
Asnoe (VA) proects, this capacity building project is deliberately designed to avoid most of the.
problems associated with T/A projects. The emphis In each comonent would be on the training of
nat        civil servants to implement the project, rather than on the  iring of technical assistance.
14.   Raftonle hr IDA InvoIent  The Bank's past epien  of finncing this kind of
assstance In other counties makes it an appropriate govenmet partner in this endeavor.  his project
is also a necessry practical fdation for the policy chamges IMA is promotg in Zambia.
Improvements In accounDtg, legal, and company registr's services are i    e      for the
succusfi ImPlementatn of Zambia's prvatzation progm. Wihout Bank ibvoent, neiter
local reources, nor donor funding, would achieve the level necessary to make the desired impact on
tdaVe pe imance of the Institu  iotvolved.
15.   Actlons to be Agreed. (a) Government would Identfy the two project oordinators (FCC
and LCC) acceptable to IDA before egotiadons, endeavor to bring them as part of the Govemment
delegtion to the Credit negotatons, and appoint them before, and as a condition of Credit
effctiveness; (b) Goverment would brig to neoato  draft terms of rfeence, and a Ht of



4
posble cosltat for the prorn   improveme  component; (c) the diagosdc study on
would be completd within 12 months foilowing Credit effecdveness, and greement on
it recommendations by Govenment and llDA officials would be a condition of dis   for the
rest of the procurement (ZNTB) Improvement component of the project; and (d) appoitm   by
Govermet of a qualffied archite  accptable to IDA to supwevi  al the buiig rdesig  and
rehabiton would be a conditon of disbusmen  for the building rhabiliation for the LP and the
IRC.
16.   Banke Progrwm Objectve Ceetodes. Tbe projet's central focus Is capacy building.
In addition, the iprvd acuning sndards8 pouement and legd services are expected to result
la better public secoor mnagemet, and the comany law refrm and impes at the registrar of
compaes would assist private sector deveopment and the Governmen's privaization program.
17.   Envfnwmetal Aspcts. Te project is a capacity buding effort, with w eionent
implications. The limited contructon Involves improvement to existing buildings to be carred ont
under exustig building codes which ate quidt strict ad ei nally sound.
18.   Project Beneft. The proje  Is expcted to result in both quatative and quaitatve
benis. Alhugh the capacity buflding nate of the project precludes the nomal calclaons of
aft  of reun, seve  project befi  can be qunfied, and will be closely monited. These
include, for example, the number of acouncy students graduai  fom the CBU, ATC and the
NSBM; the number of legal dr=am  tained, and the number of cases brought before the  dustri
Relations Cou  during a specified period (e.g. one year). Qualitadve benefits (also to be closely
monitored duig project imlemeion) Iclude ZICA's ability to evolve a unified and generafy
acceted system of           qualificatons; ZNTB's ability tD intoduce stndardizeu and widely
accepte procuemet standards and procedures; and the quality of service received by Investor and
members of the pubic seekdng infrmation   on eisting compaies at the Registrar of Companis
19.   Project RMM*: The gretest risk to the project is the possible tasfer to other duties of the
dedicated civil servants and ots  who prepared it, snd are committed to its successfil
imple tatio. - e second risk I Inde  governmet fun . Prvisios in the Developmen
Credit Agrment would seek to deal with both risks.
20.   Rd        non. I am satified that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreemnt of the Asscaton ad recommend that the Executive D ors approve it.
