the rehabilitation of each school.
D. SCHEDULE
Present (preferably in Chart Form) Start Dates and Finish Dates for:
* Mitigation Activities
* Monitoring Activities
* Training Activities
Rehabilitation activities could only be decided and start after the proposal iS agreed on, and the detailed methodology is developed in
selecting schools and allocating funds using the school mapping database. Therefore, activities on mitigation, monitoring and training

The PCU will be responsible to hire and oversee the required architects, engineers and contractors. In the context of the rehabilitation
of schools, the PCU's role is to manage the design, bidding, supervision of projects (including civil works, goods and services). The PCU's
responsibility includes the following activities:
- hire the services of private architectural/engineering firms capable of providing comprehensive services, i.e. architectural, all
required engineering, preparation of tender documents and site supervision;
- supervise the work performed by the architectural/engineering firns to ensure that they are applying adequate standards and are
following agreed procedures, as well as the agreed environmental plan.
-  organize tendering procedures, review tender evaluation performed by the architectural/engineering firms, arrange for the
contracts to be signed in accordance with agreed procedures.
- ensure that the architectural/engineering firns are providing adequate site supervision, particularly the supervision of carrying
out the environmental plan.
