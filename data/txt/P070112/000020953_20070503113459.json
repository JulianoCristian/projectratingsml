in Lithuania were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was highly satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned included: 1) The importance of continuous\n            Government ownership and capacity building at the local\n            level; 2) The directors and key staff of the departments of\n            the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) not only stayed\n            in their positions and but also showed strong performance\n            throughout the Project; 3) Establishing the institutional\n            and legal arrangements for the implementation at the outset.\n            This is a common sense requirement for any project, but is\n            not so easy to do in practice; 4) The importance of public\n            consultation; 5) The quality of technical assistance has\n            been good and their work has been well targeted to develop\n            the capacity of the MES; 6) The benefit of thorough project\n            preparation; 7) There should be balance between physical\n            investment and institutional capacity building; and 8) The\n            Government appreciated the Bank's technical advice\n            during Project preparation and implementation more so than\n            its financial resources."}, "docdt": "2007-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
