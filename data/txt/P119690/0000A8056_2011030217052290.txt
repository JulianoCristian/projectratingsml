                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Since the closing date of the project is December 31, 2011, it was agreed that the Government should extensively engage in the project implementation to avoid delays in the
                         procurement process. Thus, the Government needs to initiate the procurement of both the international and local consultants envisaged under the project. This is to ensure that the
                         agreement on the final interventions in each project jamoat is finalized to allow for prompt commencement of public works. It is also important to focus on the Technical Assistance
                         Component of the project and finalize the Terms of Reference for the preparation of the "Development of a Comprehensive Framework for the Introduction of River Basin
                         Management to Tajikistan."
