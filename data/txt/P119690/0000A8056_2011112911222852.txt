                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Although the project has made good progress by disbursing over 65% of funds and achieving most of the PDO indicators, there are a number of intermediate indicators that did not
                         meet their targets due to various reasons (increase in cost of fuel, some indicators were overestimated at the design stage, etc). The project rating has been, therefore, downgraded
                         to Moderate Satisfactory. Since this project is of emergency nature and has a very short life (less than 12 months), there was a limited time to make any adjustments to the project
                         indicators. However, the Government intends to request the Bank to restructure the project through extension of the Closing Date for one month (until January 31, 2012), and re-
                         allocation of funds. In this respect, the project team believes that this will be a good opportunity to adjust selected indicators as well to accommodate for changes that occurred during
                         the project life time.

                         Since the project is closing on December 31, 2011, the mission discussed with the PMU the preparation of the ICR according to Bank Guidelines. The mission requested the PMU to
                         prepare the Government's Implementation Completion Report before the project closing date and shared with the PMU the Bank outline for such a report.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
