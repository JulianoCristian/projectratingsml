                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to show significantly progress towards achieving the PDOs. Unaudited data from the second year of service provision show major increases in coverage of
                         basic health services in the beneficiary rural areas. For instance, the percentage of children less than one year old fully vaccinated increased from 20 to 40 percent and the
                         percentage of women receiving more than three prenatal care services increased from 26 to 66 percent. In addition, the Ministry of Health (MINSA), with the support of the Project,

                         has also completed a new National Health Strategy. Project implementation is rated as "Satisfactory" as disbursement delays have been significantly reduced in the last few months.

                         At its start, the project suffered long delays in implementations due to factors outside the executing agency control. Given these initial delays, the Government has requested an 18-
                         month extension of the project's closing date. In addition, to simplify project execution, MINSA requested some revisions to the project, including more flexibility in the percentage of
                         eligible expenditure to be financed by the loan, a simplification of the disbursement conditions for component 1 of the project, and the revision of the targets of some indicators in light
                         of baseline data. The disbursement letter for the project has already been amended to simplify the disbursement condition and a letter has been sent to the Government with the
                         agreed amendment of the Results Framework. For all other requested revisions, an amendment of the loan agreement has been sent to the Government for their countersignature.
