Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Panama Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project (HEPI) was approved by the Board on August 5, 2008 and became effective on
 December 8, 2008. The Loan is fully disbursed.

 The Project made progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO), as demonstrated by achieving and having surpassed targets
 for four out of five PDO indicators: (1) PDO indicator #1, percentage of pregnant women completing at least 3 pre-natal controls by the 3rd gestational
 trimester (target: 60 percent, achieved: 86.1 percent); (2) PDO indicator #2, percentage of children (<1 year) with a complete vaccination scheme for
 their age (target: 80 percent, achieved: 96.1 percent), (3) PDO indicator #3, percentage of women delivering children with assistance of trained
 personnel (target: 55 percent, achieved: 92.76 percent), and (5) PDO indicator #5, percentage of individuals from rural areas diagnosed with diabetes
 and hypertension in need of medication receiving prescribed drugs by primary health care units according to MOH protocal (target: 55 percent,
 achieved: 54.37 percent diabetes, 78 percent hypertension). Overall, of the Project's 11 indicators (5 PDO and 6 intermediate indicators), a total of 7
 indicators were fully achieved.

 The Project financed the provision of a basic package of health services under the “Estrategia de Extension de Cobertura” (EEC). Audited data for the
 last four month period of the 2013-2014 service delivery period reflects a slight increase in the beneficiary population reached from 146,000 at the end
 of 2013 to 149,028. This slight increase reflects the monitoring and data collection efforts taken by the government to maintain the most current data
 regarding the beneficiary population reached.

 The Government and Bank team will review the Project experience and prepare a Project Implementation Completion Report (ICR) that will include the
 Government and Bank's assessment which will be made available by June 30, 2015.

         This indicator was not achieved. The baseline and targets for the National Health Strategy were not established. However, the MOH,
         ICGS, and INEC jointly developed the TOR for the National Health Survey and all three institutions are working in conjunction to identify
         funding to carry out this activity.

               Comments
               Because the National Health Survey was not conducted during the life of the Project, the baseline was not established which resulted in this
               indicator not being achieved.
