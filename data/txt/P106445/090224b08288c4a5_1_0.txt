                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Panama Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project (HEPI) was approved by the Board on August 5, 2008 and became effective on December 8, 2008. As of October
                         17, 2014 the Project has disbursed US$37.2 million, which represents 93.24 percent of the loan.

                         The Project continues to make progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO), as demonstrated by achieving and having surpassed targets for three out of
                         five PDO indicators: (i) PDO indicator #1, percentage of pregnant women completing at least 3 pre-natal controls by the 3rd gestational trimester (target: 60 percent, achieved: 75
                         percent); (ii) PDO indicator #2, percentage of children (<1 year) with a complete vaccination scheme for their age (target: 80 percent, achieved: 89 percent), and (iii) PDO indicator
                         #3, percentage of women delivering children with assistance of trained personnel (target: 55 percent, achieved: 93 percent). In addition, the remaining two PDO indicators, and four
                         out of six intermediate indicators have either been achieved or are on track to be achieved by the Project closing date of December 31, 2014.

                         The Project continued to finance the provision of a basic package of health services under the “Estrategia de Extension de Cobertura” (EEC). Audited end-of-year data for 2013
                         reflects a decrease in the beneficiary population from 203,220 in 2012 to nearly 146,000 at the end of 2013. This result reflects the efforts taken by the government to improve data
                         collection and work with updated data by cleaning any duplications appearing within the beneficiary population.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government and Bank team agreed to review the Project experience in having implemented a Results-based Financing (RBF) scheme to deliver a basic package of health
                         services through mobile health teams to rural and non-indigenous communities who traditionally faced challenges in accessing such services. The review will be carried out as part
                         of the Project closing and will include assessing the results achieved and the processes related to implementing the RBF scheme to identify good practices and lessons learned that
                         can be useful to future activities in the health sector.
