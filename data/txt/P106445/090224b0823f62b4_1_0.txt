                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Panama Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project (HEPI) was approved by the Board on August 5, 2008 and became effective on December 8, 2008. As of March
                         19, 2014 the Project has disbursed US$31.4 million, which represents 78.4 percent of the loan.

                         The Project continues to make significant progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO), as demonstrated by achieving and having surpassed targets for
                         three out of five PDO indicators: (i) PDO indicator #1, percentage of pregnant women completing at least 3 pre-natal controls by the 3rd gestational trimester (target: 60 percent,
                         achieved: 75 percent); (ii) PDO indicator #2, percentage of children (<1 year) with a complete vaccination scheme for their age (target: 80 percent, achieved: 89 percent), and (iii)
                         PDO indicator #3, percentage of women delivering children with assistance of trained personnel (target: 55 percent, achieved: 93 percent). In addition, the remaining two PDO
                         indicators, and four out of six intermediate indicators have either been achieved or are on track to be achieved by the Project closing date of December 31, 2014.

                         The Project continued to finance the provision of a basic package of health services under the “Estrategia de Extension de Cobertura” (EEC) reaching 219,942 beneficiaries from
                         rural, non-indigenous areas. This reflects an increase in the beneficiary population reached through the Project from 203,220 at the end of 2012 to 219,942 at the end of 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government and Bank team agreed to review the Project experience in having implemented a Results Based Financing (RBF) scheme to deliver a basic package of health
                         services through mobile health teams to rural, non-indigenous communities who traditionally faced challenges in accessing such services. The review will include assessing the
                         results achieved and the processes related to implementing the RBF scheme to identify good practices and lessons learned that can be useful to future activities in the health sector.
