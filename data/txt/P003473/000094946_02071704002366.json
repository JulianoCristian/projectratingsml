World Bank\n            performance is evaluated as satisfactory due to the high\n            quality and innovative nature of its lending activities and\n            its persistent, yet flexible and supportive role in project\n            supervision. Overall government performance is considered\n            satisfactory. The following lessons can be learned: The key\n            to the project's success or failure is the continuity\n            and quality of key personnel on the Borrower's as well\n            as on the Association's end: with the right people in\n            place, complex urban projects, albeit more time-consuming in\n            their preparation and their supervision, can be implemented\n            successfully. Turnkey contracts can be a desirable vehicle\n            for implementing large water supply or wastewater projects.\n            Although the two-stage bidding process may be more\n            time-consuming, it normally results in superior technical\n            designs and a high quality output. During preparation, it is\n            important not only to review the organizational set-up of\n            project management, but also to ensure that there is an\n            explicit commitment by the authorities to provide adequate\n            funding for these units. Cultural preservation of historic\n            buildings, if properly integrated with urban development,\n            can raise ownership pride and commitment by the implementing\n            agencies, and appreciation and support by the citizens. In\n            those projects requiring a high degree of technical\n            assistance, the selection of good consultants can make or\n            break a project."}, "docdt": "2002-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
