"Ratings for the Cotton Sector Recovery\n            Project for Tajikistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the bank should not shy away from\n            intensely engaging government and working closely with other\n            partners (such as the ADB and the IMF in the case of CSRP)\n            to resolve difficult issues. A good results framework is\n            critical to good project design and effective\n            implementation. The role of local Non-Governmental\n            Organization (NGOs) in extension activities in a small\n            country like Tajikistan should not be underestimated.\n            Providing market information to all beneficiaries at all\n            levels (in this case the ginneries and farmers) confirm the\n            usefulness of market price information in bringing\n            competition in the agricultural sector."}, "docdt": "2013-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
