"The broad objectives of the project are\n            to promote rational energy policies and to strengthen the\n            efficient management of energy resources. Specifically, the\n            project aims to: (1) develop efficient institutions in the\n            sector and improve the quality of public investment; (2)\n            improve the efficiency in the use of energy resources\n            through reforms in the pricing structure of electricity,\n            petroleum products and woodfuels; (3) expand the access of\n            the population to electricity; and (4) reduce negative\n            environmental effects for the use of energy through the\n            execution of charcoal efficiency and improved stoves\n            program.  The project has two main components: institutional\n            reform and small investments in biomass, household energy\n            and power.  The credit will support: (a) institutional\n            strengthening of the Directorate of Energy and the\n            Directorate of Water Resources and Rural Energies; (b) a\n            rehabilitation program for Regie de distribution d'eau\n            et d'electricite (REGIDESO); (c) feasibility studies\n            for selected hydropower plants and an update of the Power\n            Sector Master Plan; (d) a charcoal efficiency program to\n            disseminate improved techniques of production and sensitize\n            charcoalers to the issue of deforestation; (e) an improved\n            charcoal stoves program; (f) a household energy survey and a\n            study of peat substitution; (g) a Master Plan for rural\n            electrification; (h) extensions and new connections for the\n            distribution system; and (i) improvements in the\n            transmission system."}, "docdt": "1991-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
