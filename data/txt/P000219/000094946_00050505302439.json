Lessons\n            convey that the Bank was overly optimistic regarding the\n            speed at which change would take place in the Burundi\n            environment, and, evidence suggests that privatization\n            programs, could greatly benefit during implementation from\n            the experience of a private sector organization, or merchant\n            bank, ensuring commitment, and an objective decision-making,\n            based on sound economic principles. Furthermore,\n            implementation delays could have been avoided, had the Bank,\n            at appraisal, agreed with the Government on key issues\n            raised in the previous operation; for although, the\n            launching of the project might have been delayed, on\n            balance, it could have led to a satisfactory outcome.\n            Alternatively, had agreement not been reached, a less\n            ambitious project design could have been implemented, even\n            if results provided only modest resource transfers to the\n            sector. It is suggested that a performance contract between\n            the Government, and a government-owned power utility, is not\n            effective for improving operational, and financial\n            performance, since it is not conducive to reduce the role,\n            and monopoly status of a public utility, and certainly not\n            to increase private sector participation. Realistic\n            assessment of the country-related risks, should be included\n            in the project design, and appraisal."}, "docdt": "2000-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
