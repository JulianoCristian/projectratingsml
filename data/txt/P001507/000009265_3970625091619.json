"The overall purpose of the Ports\n            Rehabilitation Project is to rehabilitate selectively the\n            physical infrastructure and equipment of ten ports,\n            primarily to reduce overall transport costs to the users of\n            shipping services.  These ports accounted for about 97\n            percent of the port traffic in the country in 1984.  The\n            proposed project includes the ports of Toamasina, Manakara,\n            Tolagnaro, Toliara, Vohemar, Morondava, Mahajanga, Nosy Be,\n            Antsiranana and Port St. Louis.  It includes (i)\n            rehabilitation of port infrastructure; (ii) modifications\n            and improvements to cargo handling; (iii) strengthening\n            services to the shipping sector; and (iv) institutional\n            development and reform.  The project is expected to reduce\n            the cost of international and coastal shipping through\n            improved cargo handling."}, "docdt": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
