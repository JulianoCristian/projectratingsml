The major impacts include: 1)\n            changes of topography, coastline, land use, and sea bed due\n            to dredging and sea reclamation; 2) partial loss of land and\n            marine ecology due to land clearance and dredging; 3)\n            degradation of water quality and marine ecology, including\n            seaweeds and other marine life; 4) increase of air and noise\n            pollution around the proposed site due to the use of heavy\n            equipment and transportation during construction operations;\n            and 5) increase in generation of wastewater and other wastes\n            during construction and operation of the port and industrial\n            complex.
