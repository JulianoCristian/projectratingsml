Ratings for the Judicial Reform Project for\n            Guatemala are as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to\n            the development outcome was negligible; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Judicial Conflict Resolution\n            Improvement Project for Colombia are as follows: outcome was\n            unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. This Project\n            Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) suggests three broad\n            lessons. The first is that it is important to adapt the\n            objectives and design of the project to local law,\n            conditions, and peculiarities. The second lesson highlights\n            the need for flexibility in overall approach in the\n            conception of the project. In addition, it is essential to\n            solicit local knowledge as well as input from specific\n            beneficiaries in the process of selecting project\n            objectives, design, and implementation arrangements. The\n            third lesson is that it is unwise to rely exclusively on\n            by-products of case management software to generate the data\n            needed for adequate monitoring and evaluation. The key\n            recommendation for initiatives in judicial reform is that\n            more resources should be invested in identifying local\n            experts to give them a leading role in the design,\n            execution, and evaluation of projects. This will facilitate\n            greater adaptation to the specific conditions of each\n            country, and ultimately ensure ownership and sustainability."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
