Government of\n            Colombia, under the leadership of the Superior Council of\n            the Judicature, aimed at improving judicial conflict\n            resolution services. The project is expected to allow the\n            testing of a participatory and compregensive organizational\n            change strategy to bring about change in court operations\n            which ensure people swifter, fairer, and more transparent\n            conflict resolution services. Beside the project management\n            component, the project has two main and interrelated\n            components. The first component supports a comprehensive\n            organizational change process in 37 participating civil\n            courts in the main urban centers of Colombia aimed at\n            generating notable improvements in the expediency and\n            quality in providing conflict resolution services and in the\n            productivity of judicial resources. These sub-components\n            address cultural change, human resource competencies and\n            capabilities, organizational structure change, information\n            systems, and court facilities. The second component supports\n            a broad communication and participatory strategy by the SCJ\n            aimed at ensuring public support and the involvement of\n            relevant actors. The communication strategy consists of\n            events, publications, and other means deemed necessary to\n            promote the proposed change effort among judicial staff,\n            media, relevant judicial actors, and public opinion at large."}, "docdt": "2001-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
