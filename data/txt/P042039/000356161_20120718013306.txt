   IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in independent evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report prepared by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) for two transport sector projects in Mozambique: the Railways
and Ports Restructuring Project (Credit 3288-MOZ, 1999-2009), and the Roads and
Bridges Management and Maintenance Project Phase 1 (Credit 3550-MOZ, 2001-2007).
The International Development Association (IDA) credit to the Mozambican government
for the Railways and Ports Project was approved on November 14, 1999, and the credit
became effective on March 28, 2000. In 2007 the project was restructured and the Bank
approved changes to some of the components. Total project cost was US$130.7 million,
higher than the original US$120 million estimated at appraisal, and Bank financing
amounted to US$106 million, versus the original US$100 million, due to the devaluation
of the US Dollar relative to the Special Drawing Right (SDR). The project closing date
was extended four times, from June 30, 2005 to June 30, 2009, to account for delays in
project implementation and for some changes in scope. The credit was fully disbursed by
the final project closing date.

The IDA credit to the Mozambican government for the Roads and Bridges Project was
approved on July 19, 2001 and the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was signed on
September 21, 2001. Following a request by the government, the deadline for
effectiveness was extended, originally to March 21, 2002, and later to June 4, 2002 when
the project was made effective. The project closing date was extended twice from June
30, 2005 to June 30, 2007. IDA funding increased from US$162 million to US$187
million due to the devaluation of the US Dollar against the SDR. The Roads and Bridges
Management and Maintenance Project was the first phase of an Adaptable Program Loan
designed to improve road infrastructure, sector policies and road sector management.
The estimated cost of the ten year road program in three phases was US$ 1.7 billion.
Phase 1 was expected to be of four years duration and had an estimated cost of US$703
million, Phase 2 (three years) had an estimated cost of US$453 million, and Phase 3
(three years) had an estimated cost of US$544 million. Phase 1 was to be financed by the
government (US$211 million), 16 other development partners (US$330 million), and
IDA (US$162 million).

The projects were selected for assessment together because combined they cover a wide
range of World Bank interventions in several of the transport sub-sectors (rail, port,
roads, and waterways) in Mozambique. This assessment would facilitate the analysis of
World Bank support to the transport sector in one country. The projects also had similar
content, combining substantial rehabilitation of publicly owned road, rail, port and
marine structures with leadership by the restructured port and rail authority and the
national road agency while attracting and extending private initiative in the provision of
the transport services required by the country. They thus constituted a good test of the
Bank‘s strategy to assist restructuring of national authorities and agencies focusing on
better management and planning of infrastructure assets. Both projects aimed at
establishing a sustainable financial mechanism in each mode and provided significant
support to the institutional strengthening and policy reforms for the sector. The findings
on sustainability of outcomes from the projects would be an input into a parallel IEG
study on ‗Sustainable Infrastructure Services and the World Bank Group.‘

IEG prepared this report based on an examination of the relevant Project Appraisal
Documents (PADs), Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs), legal
agreements, project files and archives, as well as other relevant reports, memoranda and
working papers. Discussions were also held with Bank staff (current and retired) in
Washington, D.C. and Mozambique. An IEG field mission visited Maputo, Beira,
Nampula, Nacala, and Quelimane in January 2012. It discussed both the projects and the
effectiveness of Bank assistance with relevant officials, stakeholders, and users of the
road, port, and rail services. The mission much appreciates the generous support and
attention given by the borrower, implementing agencies and all concerned parties in both
countries as well as in Washington, D.C.

Following IEG practice, copies of the Project Performance Assessment Report draft were
sent to government officials and borrowing agencies for their review and comments, but
no comments were received.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the development effectiveness of two
Mozambique transport sector projects approved in 1999 and 2001 and completed in 2009 and
2007: the Railways and Ports Restructuring Project (Credit 3288-MOZ) and the Roads and
Bridges Management and Maintenance Project (Credit 3550-MOZ) . Both projects were
concerned with the development of new institutional structures and policies, better adapted to
a modern economy than those inherited from the past of civil unrest. Both projects had
similar content, combining substantial maintenance and rehabilitation of major
infrastructures under public responsibility with support in attracting and extending private
initiatives in provision of the services required. The railways/ports project can be viewed in
the context of significant restructuring and downsizing of the Ports and Railways Company,
and granting of long-term infrastructure concessions to the private sector. The roads project
can be viewed in the context of important changes to the institutional framework of the sector
and with a view to further developing the local construction industry.

Railways and Ports Restructuring Project (1999-2009)

The main objectives of the Railways and Ports Project (US$106 million) were to increase the
operating efficiency of the three major port-rail systems in Mozambique and enable them to
increase their share of the international freight traffic from neighboring countries as well as
to strengthen the transport sector policy, the regulatory framework, and the institutional
capacity of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC).

The project achieved its objective of increased efficiency. The share of international port
traffic handled by the three main port-rail systems increased from 93.5 percent in 1998 to
98.2 percent in 2008. The share of international rail traffic barely changed from 79.7 percent
in 1998 to 79.9 percent in 2008. This, combined with the staff rationalization and
organizational restructuring of the state-owned enterprise, the Ports and Railways of
Mozambique (CFM), has resulted in increased net income since 2007 which has enabled
CFM to pay dividends to the government. There was mixed progress across the different
elements of sector policy, institutional and regulatory framework, and capacity building. The
project achieved partial strengthening and capacity building of MoTC, but the strengthened
regulatory framework and sector policy was achieved to a lesser extent because the
concession monitoring unit was not established at the ministry. The presence of strong
sponsors with global expertise on port operations is perhaps the single most important reason
for the better outcomes in the port sector.

The overall outcome of the railways/ports project is rated Moderately Satisfactory. While the
objectives were highly relevant and the objective of increasing the operating efficiency of the
three major port-rail systems was substantially achieved, the relevance of design to the
objectives was modest, as was efficiency. The objective of strengthening the transport sector
policy, the regulatory framework, and the institutional capacity of the ministry of transport
and communications was modestly achieved. The risk to development outcome is Moderate.
Overall, the country is still not offering fully competitive rail and port services commensurate
with its strategic geographical location. The ability to maintain or grow current port and rail
                                               x


traffic depends not only on the competitiveness of the transport services offered, but also on
Mozambique's combination of multimodal transport infrastructure and its ability to continue
improving trade logistics. Taking this into account, as well as current progress in port and
railway development and the government‘s future plans, Mozambique has the opportunity to
increasingly position itself as one of the countries with the lowest costs of trading across
borders. The Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Independent Evaluation
Group interviewees give credit to the Bank for consensus building across the government
regarding further concession of these sectors and for its persistence over a long period.
However, the Bank could have tapped into the expertise of other parts of the World Bank
Group, to structure the port and rail concessions. Also, there was no fall back plan to deal
with declining rail traffic, urgent maintenance needs and slippages in concession targets.
Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The government demonstrated a
commitment to and ownership of the project and railway and port sector reform through a
series of actions. It appreciated the need to monitor more closely the impact of its policies
and investments on the efficiency and effectiveness of the transport sector, both to validate
the changes/investments made and to help identify where additional reform or investment
was required. Yet, a concession monitoring unit was not established. The implementing
agency, Ports and Railways of Mozambique, benefited from a strong and committed
leadership at the top and also from support from the government departments involved in the
restructuring process.

Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Project (2001-2007)

The main objectives of the Roads Project (US$187 million) were to improve the coverage
and conditions of roads and bridges, strengthen institutional capacity to manage and
administer the roads sector, establish financing mechanisms for roads maintenance, promote
the use of local resources in roads construction and management, and improve road safety
transport.

Overall, there have been substantial improvements in coverage and quality of roads in
Mozambique. At time of project closure, 46 percent of the network roads were in good or
fair condition, against a target of 40 percent and 36 percent at appraisal in 2001. The ability
of the sector agencies to manage the sector has also been improved and placed on a strong
footing. ANE has good management capacity, and adequate road management systems are
being implemented. The Road Fund was strengthened to better forecast funding needs,
managing revenues, coordinating and auditing road sector budgets and expenditures, and
ensuring transparency and accountability in its operations. Overall, while total revenues
were just under the expected target for 2002 and 2003, the government met the target in 2004
and provided more than 50 percent above the target in 2005. Although this trend has
continued, the Road Fund has not been able to allocate significant funds for periodic
maintenance. The share of total maintenance funded by the Road Fund over 2007-2011 was
31 percent compared to 34 percent during 2005-2006. Of this share, periodic maintenance is
currently low at about 7-10 percent compared to 30-40 percent in 2001, partly because roads
are in better condition today. While most of the institutional measures that would have
affected road safety were not implemented, the road improvements along the National
Highway 1 (N1) probably did have a safety impact in the provinces of Maputo, Gaza and
                                                  xi


Inhambane, where the Maputo-Maxixe section of the N1 road is located. The road accident
data show mixed results, as total accidents and fatal accidents increased in all three Provinces
during 2003-2007, but fatalities decreased in Inhambane and stayed constant in Gaza. Since
then, accidents have declined in all three provinces, while fatal accidents have risen.

The overall outcome of the roads project is rated Moderately Satisfactory. While the
objectives were highly relevant and the objectives of improving the coverage and conditions
of roads and bridges, strengthening institutional capacity to manage and administer the roads
sector, and providing adequate road maintenance financing were substantially achieved, the
relevance of design to the objectives was modest, as was efficiency. Achievement of the
objective of reducing road maintenance costs was negligible and of improving road transport
safety was modest. The risk to development outcome is rated Moderate. As of 2011, 73
percent of roads were in good and fair condition as a share of total classified roads, and the
country was in line to meet its target of 77 percent. Rural population with access to an all
season road has increased to 32 percent in 2011 from 30 percent in 2007. Bank performance
is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The preparation of the civil works and of the institutional
strengthening aspects of the project was generally well handled although with important
delays, but it is questionable whether the road safety and the local resources aspects were
properly prepared and implemented. This was particularly so, given that this was not the
Bank's first road sector project in Mozambique. Borrower performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. The government's performance during the project showed a high degree of
commitment and ownership toward the project design, preparation and implementation. The
National Roads Administration, the implementing agency, suffered from capacity constraints
that impeded full oversight and supervision of the project.

Lessons

Six lessons emerge from this review:

      Lack of close coordination of work on different transport modes impedes greater synergies
       and a more strategic and holistic approach to transport sector policy and institutional and
       regulatory frameworks. The two reviewed operations were individually prepared and
       implemented and the opportunity was lost to look at the strategy of the entire sector and
       advise the government on inter-connectivity issues and trade-offs, as well as on ways to
       improve the sector‘s funding and spending efficiency.

      Improved infrastructure does not necessarily ensure efficient trade and logistic networks
       along the infrastructure corridors or across the country. The aspect of regional trade and
       transport facilitation and logistics comes strongly into play in the case of Mozambique, but
       was not adequately reflected in the operations as there was little consideration to the
       importance of linking the transport infrastructure with the need to develop efficient transport
       systems.

      Restructuring into leaner organizations is worth attempting in its own right. Successful
       restructuring requires planning for redundancy payments, pension liabilities, and re-
       integration costs of the labor force into the job market. Even without concessions, lean
       restructured entities are better placed to run infrastructure assets in a more commercial way.
       Despite deciding against privatization efforts, the government and the Bank successfully
                                              xii


    formed a working partnership to implement the restructuring of the Ports and Railways of
    Mozambique, and achieved solid results in this respect. Supporting governments through
    these changes and maintaining a neutral partnership is paramount if any progress is to be
    achieved at all.

   Including extraneous components that have peripheral relevance to achieving project
    objectives results in a project that is too ambitious and complex for the institutional
    capability of the borrower. This is so due to limited resources and a small window of
    opportunity to support a specific sector in a given country, such as those benefiting from
    concessional finance from the International Development Association. The Railways and
    Ports project could have benefitted from a simpler set of components more aligned with the
    key development objective of the project.

   Given the increasing role of the private sector in many aspects of transport and transport
    services, there is a growing overlap in activities across the World Bank Group, mounting
    duplication of skills and escalating inefficiencies. Failure to tap into the right expertise of
    other parts of the World Bank Group results in unnecessary delays, fatigue of all the parties
    involved, and often failure of private sector initiatives. Project concepts and project
    documentation normally fail to show whether other parts of the Bank Group have been
    consulted, and to give reasons as to why private sector activities are not being undertaken by
    other parts of the Bank group where the expertise resides and which are best placed to make
    the initiatives succeed.

   Intermodal competition, and the difficulty for concessionaires to finance substantial
    capital investment, among others, can directly contribute to the failure of concessions.
    The experience with intermodal competition between road transport and the Mozambique
    railway concessions provides further lessons for other railway concessions in Africa.

   Simply involving private concessionaires doesn't ensure sustainability of railway
    infrastructure. In the absence of a regulatory framework for railways in Mozambique,
    private concessionaires neglected maintenance and allowed the railway beds to deteriorate to
    a point that government had to step in with additional costly rehabilitation investments before
    they could be re-bid.

1. Background and Context
1.1     Mozambique has a population of 22.4 million inhabitants and is situated in
southeastern Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north,
Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west and Swaziland and South
Africa to the southwest. After gaining independence from the Portuguese in 1975, the
country was plagued by civil war from 1977 to 1992. It is estimated that over 1 million
people died during the war, most of the infrastructure was dilapidated, and the tropical
climate worsened the health conditions of the population. Mozambique enjoys a wet season
from October to March, during which cyclones are common, and a dry season from April to
September. Rainfall is heavy along the coast and decreases in the north and south. The
resettlement of civil war refugees and initiation of economic reform placed Mozambique on a
path to recovery.

1.2     Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 9 percent in the decade up to 2007,
one of Africa's strongest performances. However, heavy reliance on aluminum, which
accounts for about one-third of exports, subjects the economy to volatile international prices.
The sharp decline in aluminum prices during the global economic crisis lowered Gross
Domestic Product growth by several percentage points. Despite an improvement shown by a
6 percent growth in 2009 and 8.3 percent in 2010, severe problems persist. Mozambique
remains dependent upon foreign assistance for more than half of its annual budget, and the
majority of the population remains below the poverty line. The country's once substantial
foreign debt has been reduced through forgiveness and rescheduling under the International
Monetary Fund's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative. Current growth is expected to
be maintained by the service sector, light industry, and agriculture or even increase with an
important influx of investment associated with the exploitation of natural resources,
particularly coal.

1.3     Mozambique faces critical infrastructure challenges, with perhaps the most serious
being in the transport sector. To the north of the Zambezi River, the country has a spatially
dispersed population that relies mostly on agriculture, whereas to the south, the population
clusters around major urban areas and transportation networks (including the Moatize coal
area) and relies on manufacturing and mining jobs. Transport infrastructure is developed
transversally, west-east, connecting mining and agricultural clusters inside Mozambique and
in neighboring countries to exit ports. While some of the transport corridors are mostly
functional in providing regional connectivity and connecting mining and key production
centers to the ports, Mozambique's connectivity among urban and economic clusters is quite
limited, lacking linkages that connect parallel corridors to each other. With the exception of
the recently finalized north-south National Road N1 (which has been the main focus of the
Bank's support in the road sector during the last decade), the country has limited connection
among the several west-east corridors, and developing full connectivity would require
sustained investments over decades. Rural population accessibility to domestic markets is
also a challenge.

1.4      Mozambique enjoys a privileged and strategic location as the natural exit for most
of its landlocked neighbors, in particular Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. Over the past
                                                      2


years, Mozambique has made a big effort to capitalize on these geographic advantages,
integrating different transport modes within the country and with neighboring countries.
As a result, the transport sector underwent major changes during the mid and late 1990s.
Government policy towards the roles of the private and public sector was transformed,
regulation was relaxed, competition encouraged and the privatization of railways and ports
started. In addition, large investments were made to rehabilitate and strengthen transport
infrastructure, and bureaucratic procedures involved in business and trade were streamlined.
As a result, the combination of multimodal transport infrastructure and recently improved
trade logistics is increasingly positioning Mozambique as one of the countries with the
lowest costs of trading across borders.1 It is in this context that the World Bank support was
envisaged and undertaken.

1.5     Over the last ten years Mozambique has enjoyed a relatively stable support from the
World Bank Group first provided in the 1990s. The First and Second Road and Coastal
Shipping projects have been followed by a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan for roads
and bridges management and maintenance. Efforts by the Bank to support the reform of the
port-rail systems in Mozambique started with the Beira Transport Corridor, which paved the
way for the Maputo Corridor Revitalization Technical Assistance Project. These projects
aimed at involving the private sector through concession of the operation and management of
the port-rail systems. As the concept of concession was new and government‘s commitment

Africa, and the time required to export and import is around 70 percent of the Sub-Saharan average) (AICD,
2011a).

to privatization was low, the projects became a learning ground. Having drawn initial
skepticism, the projects helped make considerable progress towards developing a
commitment to concession, and in providing experience in the process for concession. The
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) complemented this support with a
guarantee to the private sector concessionaire of the Maputo Port. The Urban Rehabilitation
Project (1988-96) has seen some continuation through the two-phase Adaptable Program
Loan for Maputo municipal development. Support to air transport reform was for the first
time included as part of the Communications Sector Reform Technical Assistance Credit
(Table 1). As part of the strengthening of the Ministry of Transport and Communication‘s
(MoTC) capacity and sector policy, the World Bank project supported the transport
development corridors since 2002 through the Development Corridor Technical Assistance
implemented under the ministry‘s responsibility and modeled on the previous six years of
successful experience with the Maputo Corridor first phase during 1996-2001. Taking all
World Bank Group supported activities together, Mozambique has had Bank operations in air
transport and airports, railways, ports, roads and highways (including urban roads) and water
transport and infrastructure.

1.6     Nineteen development partners have been active in the transport sector in
Mozambique. Historically, Portugal, the European Union and the African Development
Bank have been the largest donors in that order. Some recent additions include the United
States‘ Millennium Challenge Corporation which in July 2007 signed a compact with
Mozambique; the compact became effective in September 2008 for five years. Compact
projects focused on improving sanitation, roads, agriculture, and the business regulation
environment. Reflecting the strategic geographical location of Mozambique, and its
importance to regional trade, technical assistance activities have focused on corridors
development completed in 2002, the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study completed in 2005,
transport corridors and spatial development completed in 2009, and growth poles and special
economic zones completed in 2010.

1.7     The government approved in May 2009 an integrated transport strategy for the
period 2009-2024. The strategy aims at developing integrated transport systems to reduce
transportation costs due to a more rational and efficient utilization of waterways, railways,
roads, and airports. The strategy promotes the development of major transport arteries with
respect to the country‘s main development poles in the context of national and international
trade. The government is planning to reactivate cabotage2 services, build a 3,000 kilometer
(km) north-south railway line, and establish five airport hubs in Maputo, Beira, Tete, Nacala,
and Pemba. The north-south railway line would be connected to feeder lines, roads and
waterways running east-west. The interconnection locations would be developed as logistic
platforms of various kinds depending on their economic importance. While there is a need to
provide incentives for trade growth with South Africa, and an efficient rail system is a
requirement for that, the question as to whether an investment of the magnitude required for a
north-south railway line is justified to improve cargo transport in the long-term needs careful
examination.

2. Railways and Ports Restructuring Project (1999-2009)
Background and Context
2.1     Mozambique’s 3,130 km railway system comprises four clear railroad corridors: (i)
Maputo to Gauteng in South Africa (also connecting with Zimbabwe and Swaziland through
railway branches; (ii) the Machipanda line connecting Beira to Zimbabwe; (iii) the Beira to
Tete (Moatize); and (iv) the Nacala to Malawi line (see Map in Annex E). These are
combined into three disconnected railway systems located in the north, central, and south
parts of the country, structured and managed around the three major Mozambican ports
(Maputo, Beira and Nacala). Considering the changes in traffic mix, total freight traffic
conveyed averages about 70 percent of what was carried in 1975. International freight
railway traffic is 83 percent of total traffic and still below with 3.2 million tons out of 4
million tons per year in 1999.

2.2      The Mozambican railway system has rail lines of strategic importance for the
region. The Maputo railway line in the south of the country is part of one of the most
successful Spatial Development Initiatives in Africa, the Maputo corridor, which aims to be
an example of improved transport logistics (USAID 2008). In the central part of the country,
the Machipanda line is crucial for mobilizing cotton from Malawi and agricultural and
mineral products from Zimbabwe. Also, the Sena line, connecting Moatize with the Beira
port, is key for providing capacity to mobilize coal and general cargo—unlocking the
potential for Mozambique‘s coal exports. Zambia, Malawi, Swaziland and Zimbabwe are all
landlocked countries that depend to some extend on Mozambique‘s railways and ports for
their imports and exports. In 1999, international traffic corresponded to 83% of all the rail
traffic and 95% of all the port traffic in the country.

2.3      The railways and ports in Mozambique are managed by Ports and Railways of
Mozambique, a state-owned enterprise (Caminhos de Ferro de Mozambique – CFM), the
first railway/port authority in Southern Africa to have introduced private sector participation
in the railways and ports sector and in its other activities. The first privatization effort took
place as early as May 1991 with the formation of a joint venture to manage and operate the
rail and road terminal in Gare de Mercadorias.

2.4     Mozambique has three main seaports, located in Maputo, Beira and Nacala, and
several regional ports. Six of Mozambique‘s seven seaports are operating with the
involvement of the private sector, which positions Mozambique as a country with a relatively
high level of private sector involvement in the port sector. The three major seaports, along
with the railways corridors that serve them, form three independent port-rail systems in the
south, central and north part of the country. Mozambique benefits from 460 km of inland
waterways; the Zambezi River is navigable to Tete and along Cahora Bassa Lake. The
company Transmaritima runs sea ferry services in southern and central Mozambique, but
these have no bearing on the three main port-rail systems or the international traffic handled
by the regional ports.
                                                  5


2.5     A number of development partners have been involved in supporting the railways
and ports in Mozambique. These include Italy, France, the Nordic Countries, the United
States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, the European Union, Portugal, and
Netherlands (see Table 2). Railways and Ports investments have been financed solely by the
government, and private sector concessionaires, with support from the International
Development Association.

Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency


As this project was under preparation, these were the main issues affecting the sector:

       High Level of Government Financial Support to the Sector. The government was in
1999 providing substantial financial support to all the transport sub-sectors. In the railway
and port sectors, although CFM had not received a direct operating subsidy from the
government since 1987, it was not able to service its loans and the government had to write
off some of its outstanding debt. With the tariff rates at the time, the government was unable
to generate enough surpluses to keep the rail and port asset base in a good condition. CFM
assets had deteriorated to such an extent that a substantial injection of private and public
capital was considered necessary to prevent the assets from collapsing, particularly the
railways.

       Problems of managing publicly owned railway and port enterprises. The Bank‘s
experience in the railway sector and to a lesser extent in the port sector during the 1990s
highlighted the difficulty of improving the performance within a public sector (parastatal)
framework because: (a) subtle and sometimes direct political interference in the functioning
of the sector erodes the authority and effectiveness of the management; and (b) pressure,
particularly on the railways, to provide loss-making services without adequate financial
support forces them to cut back on maintenance.

       Slow Rate of Regional Integration. In spite of intentions to this effect, no concrete
steps had been taken by the railways in this part of Africa to integrate many of their functions
and activities and take advantage of the economies of scale and specialization with a view to
improving efficiency and productivity. Yet the condition of the rail infrastructure continued
to be a constraint to the growth of transit traffic from the surrounding landlocked countries.
The concession of the railways was seen as a potential trigger for regional integration, with
the private sector seeking to gain from advantages of scale by entering into appropriate
                                              6


contractual agreements with the railways from neighboring landlocked countries and other
service providers.

Objectives, Design, and Relevance
OBJECTIVES

2.6 The overall project development objective of the US$ 120 million Railways and Ports
Restructuring Project was to (i) increase the operating efficiency of the three major port-rail
systems in Mozambique and enable them to increase their share of the international freight
traffic from neighboring countries; and (ii) strengthen the transport sector policy, the
regulatory framework, and the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Transport and
Communication (MoTC). The first objective was stated identically in the Development
Credit Agreement (DCA) and the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The second
objective in the PAD is similar in substance to the articulation in the DCA, but the latter
clarifies that the port-rail systems in question are those of the Borrower.

DESIGN

2.7    The project had the following components:

      Component 1: Concession of CFM’s major Ports and Railways (original estimate
       US$1.0 million; actual cost US$1.81 million). This component aimed to: (i)
       strengthen the operational capabilities of CFM through technical advisory services to
       manage the concession process of Nacala, Beira, and Maputo port and railway
       systems; and (ii) provide financial support for any essential activities for the
       concession process.

      Component 2: Staff Rationalization (original estimate US$93.5 million; actual cost
       US$77.8 million). This component was expected to: (i) carry out a CFM staff
       reduction program through retrenchment or early retirement, including support for the
       payment of negotiated and statutory severance payments; (ii) carry out a
       redeployment program of redundant staff including counseling and training services
       consistent with the Social Mitigation Plan; (iii) establish and operate a pension fund;
       and (iv) develop a system for information dissemination on a regular basis regarding
       the issues pertaining to restructuring in general and the staff rationalization program
       in particular.

      Component 3: Corporate Restructuring (original estimate US$2.3 million; actual
       cost US$0.96 million). This component looked to: (i) finance a study for creating a
       number of holding and subsidiary companies to take over some of the functions of
       CFM, and for establishing a technical regulatory unit within CFM; and (ii) provide
       related technical advisory services and office equipment.

      Component 4: Strengthening of the MoTC (original estimate US$1.7 million;
       actual cost US$2.6 million). This component aimed to: (i) carry out a study to review
       the transport policy framework and the legal and institutional framework for
                                                7


       concessions; (ii) define the new functions of the ministry, assess its organizational
       structure and staffing requirements taking into account the Borrower‘s civil service
       reform program; and (iii) provide technical advisory services.

   Component 5: Regulatory Framework (original estimate US$7.2 million; actual cost
    US$0.70 million). This component was expected to: (i) carry out a study to review the
    options of setting up a regulatory body for either the railway sector or the transport
    sector as a whole and formulate the design and implementation plan of the chosen
    option; and (ii) provide equipment and technical advisory services for the launching of
    the new regulatory agency, and support the functioning of the agency for an initial
    period of three to five years.

   Component 6: Tertiary Port Rehabilitation (original estimate US$9.0 million, Actual
    expenditure US$0 as this component was dropped). This component looked to: (i) assist
    MoTC in carrying out a program of rehabilitation of the small ports of Angoche,
    Macuse, Mocimboa da Praia, and Pebane; and (ii) provide technical advisory services
    for the supervision of the civil works in the four mentioned ports, and the preparation of
    a study on the revitalization of the Inhambane Port.

2.8      Revised and New Components. The project was approved on November 14, 1999,
and the Credit became effective on March 28, 2000. In 2007 the project was restructured and
the Bank approved changes to some of the components, including dropping the rehabilitation
of tertiary ports and replacing it with support to water transport and additional railway
rehabilitation. The tertiary ports rehabilitation component was dropped because there had
been a decline in the demand for these ports and since there was little private sector interest
in operating concessions for these ports, the funds were reallocated to higher priorities. A
new component for the rehabilitation of key passenger jetties and purchase of new boats and
ferries was added (estimated cost - US$15.0 million, actual cost US$8.78 million), and a new
component for the rehabilitation of the Ressano-Garcia line which extends for 88 km and
links the port of Maputo with Republic of South Africa (original estimate US$6.4 million;
actual cost US$5.96 million) was also added.

2.9     Planned implementation arrangements involved two separate implementing agencies
for the CFM and the MoTC components. Ports and Railways of Mozambique would
implement its own components. The ministry-related components were planned to be
implemented by the ministry‘s Office of Maritime Affairs (Gabinete de Projectos
Maritimos).

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.10 Relevance of the objectives is rated high. The objectives were relevant to the
country‘s development needs in the railways and ports sectors, and aligned with the Bank‘s
Country Assistance Strategy at project approval (1997-2000), the subsequent 2000-2003 and
2003-2007 Country Assistance Strategies, and also with the more recent Country Partnership
Strategy (2007-2011). The government had a strategy of reform and investments in the
transport sector aiming at: (i) establishing a road network linking all provinces; (ii) providing
increased rural access to markets and social services; and (iii) generating substantial foreign
                                              8


exchange earnings through the international transit corridors. Construction of the toll road,
part of the Maputo Corridor development initiative, and concession of the Maputo port in
1998 was intended to pave the way for a comprehensive restructuring of the railways and
ports sector. Accordingly, infrastructure rehabilitation, capacity building, increased
Mozambican participation in new or newly privatized enterprises, and public sector reforms
were identified as areas for greater effort in the Strategy. During implementation, the First
Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty or Plano de Acção para a Redução da
Pobreza Absoluta was approved by the Cabinet in April 2001 envisaging a general expansion
in internal trade, transport and services. Consequently, the Bank‘s First Poverty Reduction
Support Strategy and CAS (2003-2007) strategy included infrastructure as one of the six
priority areas identified for support, with transport and rural development highlighted.

2.11 The CPS (2007-2011) developed jointly between IDA, IFC, and MIGA at the time of
the project closure date was to support the government in implementing its Second Action
Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty, approved by the Cabinet in September 2006.
This CPS was timed to be in sequence with the development of the government's strategy,
the Bank‘s Second Poverty Reduction Support Strategy, and to facilitate coordination and
alignment among development partners' country assistance strategies. One of the main issues
addressed by this CPS was the need to increase the access of the rural population to an all-
season road, and to improve connectivity for rural producers and communities, which also
involves increasing access to ports and railroads and decreasing transport costs. The key
elements of the objectives remained relevant at the time of IEG‘s mission.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.12 Relevance of project design is rated Modest. The project design appropriately
addressed the country‘s priority needs for increasing the performance of the main railways
and ports. As a strategic choice, the project design included three components to support the
transformation of CFM into an efficient modern rail and port company, two other
components to develop a sustainable institutional and regulatory framework, and an unrelated
component on tertiary port rehabilitation later replaced by an equally unrelated component to
rehabilitate jetties and to purchase ferries/boats. The three CFM-related components were
highly relevant to achieving the objectives. They focused on labor efficiency and
organizational structure of the entity, and on assisting the government to award concessions
to the private sector. The CFM staff rationalization component was extremely well designed
and thought through. The CFM restructuring was designed to spin-off non core activities to
subsidiaries and to undertake an organizational restructuring of the core port and rail
functions while reinforcing the planning and concession monitoring functions. The
concessions rightly tackled the three main port-rail systems in the country at the same time,
because the massive staff reduction envisaged could not have been undertaken selectively, or
sequentially. Despite the alleged urgency of addressing the critical state of the port-rail
systems through concessions, the decision to support the concession award process with only
modest funds scarcely sufficient to finance a single advisor to the Company is questionable.

2.13 The project design included components not directly necessary to achieve the core
objectives, such as the strengthening of the entire MoTC, instead of focusing exclusively on
the aspects concerning ports and railways. The design included components which were
                                                9


unrelated to the objectives, mainly the rehabilitation of tertiary ports later replaced by water
transport improvements, and the institutional and regulatory framework concerning civil
aviation. Thus, the design was broadly consistent with the objectives to be achieved, though
included extraneous components not linked to the objectives, and the results framework was
somewhat appropriate.

MONITORING & EVALUATION DESIGN

2.14 The project originally only included one outcome indicator, which was increased
international freight traffic (tons per year of international freight). Instead, to match the
project objectives, the outcome indicator of increased share of international freight traffic out
of total traffic takes into account of external factors such as economic activity in the
neighboring country that affect the level of traffic. Support to waterways included during
project restructuring in 2007 had one outcome indicator (annual traffic) used to measure
improved water transport at Maputo, Inhambane, and Quelimane. Two intermediate outcome
indicators were also added to measure increased operating efficiency (staff productivity) and
strengthened regulatory framework and sector policy (establishment of an independent
regulatory body). A fourth intermediate outcome was added during project restructuring
concerning increased capacity of the Ressano-Garcia railway line after rehabilitation. In
retrospect, the additional intermediate outcome indicators could have been devised during
appraisal.

2.15 Output indicators were modified during project restructuring and included: (i)
concession of three main ports and two (previously three) of the three railways; (ii)
reorganization of Ports and Railways of Mozambique (creation of a number of holding and
subsidiary companies to take over some of the functions) and (iii) strengthening and capacity
building of the ministry. Baseline values were included in the monitoring and evaluation
framework, and the two implementing agencies had clear responsibilities to undertake data
collection and evaluation for their respective areas of responsibility.

Implementation
2.16 Initial implementation was slow, partly due to the complex and evolving nature of
issues underlying the CFM restructuring program. In particular, the improvements to the
severance payment package for CFM staff to be retrenched needed the agreement from the
staff unions, updating of the computer software, and approval by the government.
Similarly, according to Bank internal documents, the decision that the government would be
the conceding authority for the concession contracts rather than CFM triggered a change in
the direction of CFM restructuring and raised the question as to whether there was a need to
establish a holding company. By mid-2001 the pace of project implementation had
accelerated and by end-2002 disbursements had started. Total project cost was US$130.7
million, higher than the original US$120 million estimated at appraisal, and Bank financing
amounted to US$106 million against US$100 million due to the devaluation of the US
Dollar relative to the Special Drawing Rights (SDR). The credit was fully disbursed by the
final project closing date on June 30, 2009.
                                                       10


    2.17 The project period was extended four times by a total of four years, and there were
    some changes in its scope, but not in its objectives. The project closing date was extended
    from June 30, 2005 to June 30, 2009 to account for delays in project implementation and for
    some changes in scope3. There was an important delay by the concessionaires in the port
    takeover and/or in making the port operational. Many other factors contributed to this delay
    including: (i) failure of the private parties to achieve financial closure (e.g. Nacala port and
    rail); (ii) breakdown in the internal structure of consortiums when the major partner and key
    player in the region pulled out from the consortium (i.e. Spoornet of South Africa
    concerning Maputo rail); (iii) maintenance postponement by prior concessionaires resulted
    in higher rehabilitation needs and ultimately the inability to subsequently concession the
    infrastructure (i.e. the Ressano-Garcia Line of Maputo rail); (iv) hold off the concession of
    the other lines due to other setbacks experienced (i.e. flooding of the Limpopo and Goba
    lines of the Maputo Railway System); and (v) sharp downturn in the Zimbabwean economy
    which lead to a reduction in trade. In addition, discrepancies of opinion regarding
    contractual clauses and government handling of these also delayed the takeover.

    2.18 By the initial project closing date of June 30, 2005, only about 70 percent of the funds
    had been disbursed, and the retrenchment process was only about 70 percent complete
    (World Bank 2009a). The remaining 30 percent of funds were required to complete the staff
    retrenchment process at CFM, but also to complete and undertake a wide range of
    restructuring, strengthening, and policy/strategy support activities, which had an important
    bearing on the future development of the sector. In practice, most efforts during the last
    four years of project execution were on the implementation of the CFM and water transport
    components, and on completing technical assistance activities with MoTC, but to a lesser
    extent on ensuring traction with MoTC on policy and institutional reform or sector strategy.
    As the implementation of some of the MoTC components was comparatively slow, the
    ministry took stock in 2005 of steps and actions that needed to be taken within the
    remaining project life in order to achieve the main objectives (e.g. restructuring of MoTC;
    establishment of regulatory bodies, particularly rail and maritime and drafting of appropriate
    regulations) but with modest results.

    2.19 There were three reallocations of credit proceeds. The first one in 2004 to increase
    funds for severance payments to retrenched CFM staff (although total cost of staff
    rationalization decreased), and to support maintenance of the Nacala and Maputo port-rail
    systems until concession. The second one in 2007 corresponding to the project restructuring
    to include water transport and the rehabilitation of the Ressano-Garcia line, and the

3
  The first extension was granted in May 2005 for eighteen months to December 30, 2006 to complete the staff
retrenchment process at CFM and associated social mitigation activities, and to explore the possibility of
concession the rehabilitated Limpopo and Goba lines, part of the Maputo railway system. The second extension
was granted in December 2006 for five months to May 31, 2007 to allow preparation of the Environmental
Impact Assessment for the jetty rehabilitation component being discussed for possible financing under the
project instead of the rehabilitation of tertiary ports. The third extension was granted in May 2007 for thirteen
months to June 30, 2008 to accommodate the incorporation of support to water transport, and the rehabilitation
of the Ressano-Garcia railway line, part of the Maputo railway system. This extension was granted as part of
project restructuring, yet no changes were made to the project objectives to take into account these water
transport activities. The fourth and final extension was granted on June 27, 2008 for twelve months to June 30,
2009 to complete all remaining activities financed by the project.
                                                          11


    dropping of the tertiary ports rehabilitation component. The last one in 2008 was to take
    account of final amounts of awarded contracts and of expenditures known at the time. The
    staff rationalization component was reduced by US$18.63 million and the CFM
    restructuring and regulatory framework component by US$9.14 million.

    2.20 Changes to the implementation arrangements for the MoTC components resulted
    in heavy reliance on external consultants and little project implementation capacity in-
    house. The ministry decided to transform the Office of Maritime Affairs, the implementing
    unit within the ministry, into the Transport and Communications Project Management Unit
    or Unidiade de Gestao dos Projectos de Transportes e Comunicacones with enlarged
    responsibilities to monitor all projects related to the transport and communications sector
    implemented by the ministry or any entity subordinated to it and to conduct dialogue with
    key sector donors. Initially a consulting firm was engaged to assist the unit to provide
    technical and economic analysis and to carry out the financial management of the project.
    Although the intention was to manage project implementation at the unit while also
    increasing its capacity, in practice the unit was either staffed by consultants or heavily
    reliant on them for the most part of project implementation and little capacity or know how
    was transferred from to the rest of ministry.

    2.21 Overall, the project suffered greatly from strained and deteriorating relationships
    between the government and the various concessionaires. With the exception of Beira
    Port, all other rail and port concessions experienced delays of almost 4 years before they
    became fully operational. This, in turn, resulted in delayed rehabilitation of infrastructure
    and other assets and revitalization of operating systems. These persistent difficulties
    resulted in fatigue for all those involved after half a decade of discussions. This was a
    serious concern during the first four to five years of project implementation and brought
    much frustration to the client and the Bank. Even after takeover, several issues hindered the
    smooth operation of the concessions, including differing interpretations of the concession
    agreement by the concessionaires and CFM, and delays in setting up and staffing the
    concessionaires‘ organizational structure.4 The Maputo railway has been managed by CFM
    since July 2005, after Spoornet of South Africa pulled out of the Ressano-Garcia Railway
    concession to focus on revitalizing its own railway system in South Africa,5 and was
    terminated three years after signing due to the breakdown in the internal structure of
    consortium. The Nacala railway was conceded to Corridor do Desenvolvimento do Norte
    (CDN), a partnership between CFM and Sociedade de Desenvolvimento do Corredor do
    Nacala holding, in January 2005 for 15 years, after the initial port-rail concession awarded
    in September 2002 could not be rendered operational due to limited traffic on the line; it was
    cancelled due to lack of financial closure.




4
    This was particularly the case for the Nacala port-rail system.
5
  The remaining partners, an international group of companies that focuses on infrastructure investment
projects, were reluctant to continue negotiation without the South African Railways‘ participation as most of the
traffic on this line was originating from South Africa.

RESTRUCTURING

2.22 The project was restructured in May 2007 following a detailed review of the
implementation progress and prospects, and of priorities in the light of elections and
government changes that took place in 2005. The Board approved the revised activities and
key associated outcome targets. The original project development objective was retained, but
the project scope was changed substantially by replacing one component (rehabilitation of
tertiary ports due to little demand from private sector at the time for operating concessions)6
in favor of two new components to improve water transport and to address the emergency
rehabilitation of the Ressano-Garcia railway line and the marshalling yard after the
concession was cancelled and the line had fallen further into disrepair.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS POLICIES

2.23 The project was classified as Category ―B‖ under the Bank‘s environmental and
social safeguard policies. The safeguard policy for environmental assessment was triggered.
An Environmental Management Plan was prepared by the government with assistance from
external consultants following public consultation and stakeholder meetings. The documents
were disclosed to the public as required under the safeguard policy triggered. In 2007, new
environmental assessments were prepared for the jetties to be rehabilitated, and in
accordance with Bank policy they were properly disseminated and mitigation measures were
incorporated into the civil works contracts. Overall compliance with environmental and
social safeguard requirements was satisfactory though there were shortcomings and delays in
the course of their implementation as discussed below.

2.24 Environmental Safeguards. A comprehensive Environmental Management Plan
was prepared in March 1999 before project approval, including a preliminary environmental
audit of the port-rail systems in the country to identify the need for clean-up operations, the
costs of which were unknown at the time of appraisal. The preliminary audit identified the
spots where pollution took place, but did not identify the extent of the pollution and the risks
to public health and the environment. Provisions relating to the Environmental Management
Plan were integrated into the contracts and their implementation was monitored.

2.25 The implementation of the environmental aspects of the project had a slow start, and
by July 2003, when the mid-term review took place, the environmental audit was yet to be
undertaken. Similarly, dredging plans for Maputo and Quelimane ports, including an
Environmental Impact Assessment in order to manage the impact on beach erosion and of
dredge disposal, had yet to be carried out. A dredging study for the Beira port was financed
by the Dutch. At the time, the Global Environment Facility was financing the preparation of
an Oil Spill Response Plan.

2.26 An environmental unit was established in CFM to undertake environmental
monitoring of the concessionaires and of its own operations on behalf of the Ministry of
Coordination of Environmental Affairs to ensure compliance with national environmental

6
  The feasibility studies for the ports of Angoche and Maxixe ascertained that that their rehabilitation was not
justified given the traffic demand levels.
                                              13


guidelines, and also with the 1998 World Bank Group‘s Pollution Prevention Abatement
Handbook in the case of the concession facilities. Compliance with the Handbook was
required, among others, because it sets liquid effluent and air emission standards that were
not part of the Mozambican standards at the time.

2.27 CFM‘s Railway and Port Inspection Unit was established in 2004 to ensure that
concessionaires were implementing the agreed safety, occupational health, and
Environmental Management Plans in accordance with national law and the World Bank
Safeguard Policies and Procedures. By law, the concessionaires were required to be certified
and CFM‘s Railway and Port Inspection Unit also monitored this. The procedure for the
concessionaires to obtain the certificates included engaging safety auditors from a panel of
consultants jointly approved by CFM and the concessionaires. In addition to monitoring
compliance, the unit refined safety and environmental regulations and prepared a manual for
compliance monitoring. By 2006, the Inspection Unit was applying ISO 14001 standards
and procedures, an environmental management standard that specifies a set of environmental
management requirements for environmental management systems. Some monitoring was
done on CFM‘s own facilities as well. It was envisaged that the unit‘s functions would be
modified when the government appointed a regulator for the railways and ports sector, but
this had not occurred by project closure.

2.28 Lack of a CFM environmental policy prevented full monitoring and enforcement of
the implementation of the concessionaires‘ policies. Two concessionaires adopted their own
environmental policies to the satisfaction of the Bank. The Beira port concessionaire
prepared its own environmental policy, a preliminary environmental audit in May 2004, and
a final safety, health, and environment audit in June 2005. The Maputo port had an approved
Environmental Management Plan dated January 2005, but as of April 2006 it had yet to
obtain its environmental license from the Ministry of Coordination of Environmental Affairs.

2.29 Social Safeguards. The original Environmental Management Plan did not focus on
resettlement or land acquisition issues. During implementation, it was discussed that the
Bank‘s Involuntary Resettlement Policy might be triggered with regard to the Limpopo
railway line. It was suggested that an inventory of property and people living in the right of
way of the Limpopo line to be undertaken according to the Bank‘s recommendation dated
July 2003. However, given that rehabilitation to the damaged Limpopo line of the Maputo
railway was not part of the project and the government decided to instead use the United
States Agency for International Development funds, no further Bank involvement was
required on this issue and obviously the Bank‘s policy was not triggered.

2.30 Public consultation of environmental related activities was monitored. For example,
the Maputo port carried out a public consultation for the dredging operation and dredging
spoil disposal in 2005 and was monitored by the Bank.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

2.31 Strict control of use of funds was assured by creating a separate project account for
all severance payments by CFM, and a special account at MoTC, as well as by disbursing
against previous expenditures.
                                                      14


2.32 CFM. A financial management manual and a project financial management system
were developed by consultants during the first year of project implementation for accounting
and reporting on project expenditures of CFM components. With the approval of the
Communications Sector Reform Project, the computerized financial management system was
expanded to also include the Communications Project, prior to its effectiveness. The system
was capable of producing most of the required information and was considered satisfactory at
the time by the Bank. However, it had several weaknesses which included: (i) deficient
internal control of transactions; (ii) lack of an asset register system; and (iii) difficult
procedures for annual and monthly budget follow up.7 In order to improve the financial
control of both projects, a contract was awarded to Ernst & Young in 2006 to implement an
integrated management system to replace the existing.

2.33 The audit aspects of the project undertaken by Ernst & Young included: (i)
independent audit of CFM project accounts; and (ii) independent audit of all computation of
retrenchment and all retrenchment-related disbursements. The auditors, by performing the
audit of all computation and payment of retrenchment invoices, were in a good position to
express an opinion on the project‘s financial statements, since retrenchment costs absorbed
the majority of the project funds. Audit reports were unqualified except for 2000 and 2005.
As the CFM‘s restructuring success depended to great extent on the post-retrenchment
financial viability of CFM, the company submitted entity financial statements to the Bank
during 2002-2007, for their review and comments. In this way, CFM was able to show
through the 2004 accounts that the bulk of CFM debts were either taken over by the
government or written off, and that the company was showing a net profit of MZM 20.5
billion. There was consistent follow up of the financial management aspects of the project,
and there is evidence in internal documentation that the client worked to ensure that the
issues identified by the auditors were rectified. Audit qualifications of project accounts were
in most cases quickly resolved.8

2.34 MoTC. The financial management system for project financial monitoring of MoTC
components was completed by Price Waterhouse Coopers, and subsequently by Ernst &
Young in 2005. Quarterly FMRs were not produced until 2006. Auditing of project
accounts for the MoTC component was undertaken by Deloitte & Touché.

2.35 Procurement of works, goods and services was carried out in accordance with Bank
guidelines, and the bidding processes were conducted in a fair and transparent manner.
Persistent delays in procurement of both MoTC and CFM activities resulted in frequent
revisions to the implementation schedules and lower than expected disbursements. After the
reallocation of funds among categories undertaken in 2005, the expectation was that the
procurement plans would be strictly implemented and the rate of disbursement would pick
up. This was not the case and procurement delays continued. The Bank‘s supervision

7
 These deficiencies were highlighted by the project implementing agency in email correspondence to the Bank,
and also several times by the Ernst & Young auditors in their 2002 annual project financial accounts audit. The
Bank insisted on the need for the client to focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of the project‘s internal
controls as a result of deficiencies found in the 2007 audit report.
8
  For example, the presentation of the 2000 project financial accounts was considered inadequate but promptly
resolved.
                                                       15


mission consistently requested CFM, and in particular MoTC, to apply more rigorous
monitoring of procurement plan implementation. However, delays in the award of contracts
did not directly result in extensions of project closing dates. Two procurement-related
complaints were brought to the attention of Bank missions, both concerning water transport
component9. This was communicated by the Bank mission to the government for appropriate
action.

Achievement of the objectives
Substantially increase the operating efficiency of the three major port-rail systems in
Mozambique and enable them to increase their share of the international freight traffic
of the neighboring countries

2.36 Outputs. The project achieved most of its output targets: (i) three main ports
(Maputo, Beira, and Nacala) and two of the three rail systems (Beira and Nacala)
concessions10 were operational at the time of project closure (see Table 3); (ii) rehabilitation
with capacity to carry 10 million tons per annum by running 12 trains per day of the
Ressano-Garcia line, part of the southern railway system not a concession; (iii) a total of
14,728 staff retrenched against a target of 14,000, corresponding to 76 percent of the work
force; and (iv) reorganization of CFM with separate administration and operation functions,
although also with de facto regulatory functions.

Table 3: Operationalized Concessions at the time of project closure (2009)




2.37 CFM Staff Rationalization. The staff rationalization program was to be implemented
as part of the process of concession of rails and ports so in this way the concessionaires
would absorb the retrenched employees. In practice these two processes could not be
combined. Staff rationalization started in 1998, during the preparation of the Bank project,
and only 1,430 employees were transferred in that year to the concessionaires as opposed to
about 5,000 originally planned. A pension study was added to the project at the last minute

  First, an individual complained to the Bank‘s Institutional Integrity Vice Presidency in 2007 regarding
concerns about the qualifications of the selected manufacturer and the system in place for ensuring that safety
standards were met on the ferry boats that were to be financed by the Bank. INT found no evidence of wrong-
doing. Second, there was an internal dispute in 2009 between the manufacturer and the supplier of the ferries
regarding manufacturing defects noticed on delivery of the vessels, and their impact on commissioning and
warranties.
10
  The concessionaires paid an entry fee of up to US$5 million, a fixed annual fee, and a variable annual fee as
percentage of revenues. In most cases the annual fees had step increases depending on the revenue projections
for the infrastructure concession. CFM has an equity stake of 49 percent.

after the government requested the Bank's assistance in financing part of the normal pension
component of the severance payments for CFM staff. The completion of the study was a
dated covenant under the project which was not complied with. The IEG mission met with
both the Staff Technical Unit and the Human Resources Department. IEG was informed that
about 2 percent of the retrenched staff (1,073 staff) filed complaints, and these were mainly
pointing out wrong computations of length of service due to incomplete files. A former CFM
staff who that benefited from the retrenchment process attributed the smooth implementation
to good communication between CFM and the labor force and to the fact that the
retrenchment packages were designed to enable CFM staff to re-enter the labor market by
creating opportunities in various industries and in self-employment. Indeed, several factors
appear to have contributed to the low complaint rate, including: (i) the analysis of workers‘
profiles facilitated the design of reintegration options for the workers; (ii) a specific
department within the Staff Technical Unit was created to promptly manage the special
cases; (iii) most payment awards were expedited by ministerial approval to follow the
administrative procedure for award of amounts of less than MZM 100 million whereby CFM
assumed the administrative responsibility of identifying qualifying heirs;11 and (iv) Deloitte
& Touche certified one hundred percent of the calculations and payments. By the end of the
retrenchment process, CFM had 1,653 staff against 19,387 in 1998.12 Of the downsized staff,
14,775 accepted the retrenchment package, 1,430 were transferred to the concession
companies, 576 retired and 953 left for various other reasons. Staff rationalization was
completed within the cost estimated at appraisal. The implementation period was 30 months
longer.

2.38 The IEG mission was not able to determine how successful the socio-professional
reintegration program was. There was no impact analysis done upon completion, and no
follow up of a sample of those retrenched. The final GAPI report shows 557 staff re-
employed, 553 staff employed as members of associations formed with infrastructure and
equipment no longer used by CFM in the provinces of Sofala, Manica, Tete, Nampula,
Zambézia, and Niassa, an estimated 900 employed formally and informally in small
industries, and the rest amounting to over 7,000 as self-employed. Interview data points to a
higher impact in the central and northern areas of the country where there was more focus on
agricultural activities for livelihood of retrenched staff.




11
  A delegation of four representatives including one representing the external auditor travelled to the locality in
Mozambique once about 200 administrative processes had been completed and payment awards were ready to
be made. As the majority of workers received less than MZM 100 million, the administrative procedure
expedited the payment process. For payments above this amount, notarial and judicial processes were followed
as per the law.
12
  The 2008 independent audit report of the project financial statements noted that several issued cheques, some
of which dated back to 2003, were not yet granted to the respective beneficiaries or their families. This has
been resolved by now.

Box 1: The Mechanics of CFM Staff Rationalization Program
The preparation phase of the staff rationalization included: (i) diagnosis of staff composition and characteristics
by an international consultancy firm in November 1998; a local consultant firm survey of 3,020 workers
throughout the country to identify the activities they wanted to undertake after retrenchment; (ii) legal
consideration of retrenchment solutions and compensation options; development of a Financial Procedures
Manual in February 2000, stating the requirements for the Bank's no objection to hiring an internationally
recognized auditing firm to audit the project accounts and one hundred percent of any invoices and payments
relating to the staff rationalization process; (iii) creation of specific operational units including: a Staff
Technical Unit in January 28, 2000 as an autonomous office to handle the sensitive process of retrenchment and
reintegration of surplus staff and the adoption of social mitigation measures; a Project Accounting Unit in
December 2000, and Offices for the Organization of Early Retirement in April 2001; and (iv) following
conception of the pilot phase of the reintegration program and its costs, award of a contract with strategic
partner GAPI to implement the socio-professional integration of the retrenched workers.

An important complementary aspect to the staff retrenchment process was the resolution of the funding gaps
and other issues with the pensions for both government and parastatal staff. The intention was to establish a
structured pension scheme which in turn would have made the restructuring of the public sector easier. The
study being completed by Ernst & Young at the time was suspended in 2004 because the data maintained by the
National Institute for Social Security (INNS) was not computerized and therefore difficult to analyze. A second
attempt was made and the Pension Study terms of reference were finally completed, but by 2009, the
government was undertaking the study in phases and with its own funds with co-financing from the African
Development Fund under the purview of the Ministry of Planning and Finance.



2.39 CFM Corporate Restructuring. The project financed in 2001 a study on the new role
of CFM in the context of the proposed holding company, including the establishment of a
technical unit to deal on the concessions with the private operators, and a legal framework
study in 2002. The government decided against creating an asset holding company to retain
ownership of the railway and port infrastructure assets.13 Some stakeholders in Mozambique
were of the opinion that the corporate restructuring should have proceeded more slowly.
Therefore, the recommendations of these studies were by and large not implemented,
although the studies provided the foundations for further support to the reforms that had
started in the mid-1990s. It included the separation of strategic, corporate, and regulatory
functions from day-to-day commercial and operating functions; making the headquarters and
the zonal units lean and thin; replacing traditional port and railway operation skills in the
headquarters with specialized legal, financial, institutional, and corporate functions and
skills; and increasing accountability through performance contracts between the government
and CFM.

2.40 The first phase of CFM‘s restructuring included the creation of two specialized units
in 2002-3: (i) the Railway and Port Inspection Unit; and (ii) the Directorate for Financial
Participation. These units were instrumental in ensuring compliance with safety, health and
environmental standards and in monitoring the performance of CFM investments in other
companies including joint ventures. In addition, CFM‘s Board of Directors set in motion the
implementation of a new Strategic Management Plan in March 2006 based on a revised
human resource policy. The new Plan emphasized training cadres and appropriate guidance

13
  As stated during the Mid-term Review in February 2003, the study carried out by KPMG indicated the
unnecessary tax implications that would be involved when creating a separate company.
                                                       18


within the organization, structured a model for professional development articulated with
individual career plans and systematic performance evaluation. All in all, there was
important progress in the CFM restructuring, albeit not along the lines originally envisaged.
This activity disbursed only 42 percent of the original allocation amount.

2.41 In an attempt to establish what would have happened in the absence of the project, the
ICR compared the Economic Rates of Return rates between a ―with‖ and a ―without‖ project
scenario assuming that a five-year delay would have been incurred in the absence of Bank
support. However, while it is likely that the government would have continued with the
concessions, since after all CFM started concessions of specialized port terminals before the
project14, IEG interviewees consistently stated that without the Bank support the complex
retrenchment of CFM staff would never have taken place. Therefore, although there was a
delay even when the Bank supported the staff rationalization process, the increasingly
efficient management system at CFM, which was enabled by the retrenchment program, was
necessary for CFM to increase substantially the role of the private sector. In turn, private
sector involvement was necessary for increased port and rail traffic. Indeed, the concessions
were granted to promote the modernization of the systems and increase their performance; to
attract the resources needed to finance investments in infrastructure, equipment, information
technology, and maintenance; and to generate an additional source of returns for CFM and
the government.

2.42 Outcomes. The project achieved its outcome of increased efficiency. The share of
international rail traffic handled by the three main port-rail systems increased from 79.7
percent in 1998 to 79.9 percent in 2008. Similarly, the share of international port traffic also
increased from 93.5 percent in 1998 to 98.2 percent in 2008. The project documents do not
specify if the share out of total international country traffic was expected to increase. But
given that the three port-rail systems already handled 100 percent of all international rail and
port traffic in the country in 1998, it was assumed that this was not what the stated outcome
referred to. At the end of the project the outcome indicator used by the project to measure
increased international freight traffic (tons per year of international freight) was met for ports
but not for railways. International port traffic for the three main port-rail systems increased
from 5.6 million tons in 1998 through 9.4 million tons in 2005 and 11.2 million tons in 2008,
exceeding the target of 10 million tons. This figure grew to 19 million in 2011. International
railway traffic for the three main port-rail systems moved from 3.3 million tons in 1998
through 3.4 million tons in 2005 to 3.5 million tons in 2008, significantly short of the initial
target of 7 million tons. Although the international railway traffic also grew in the last 3
years, the growth has not meet expectations, reaching only 5.7 million tons in 2011 (see
Table 4 and Figure 1).

2.43 The outcome of the rehabilitation of the Ressano-Garcia railway line is an increase
from 18 tons to 20 tons per axle and maximum permissible speed from 20-50 km per hour to


14
   The government already had some direct exposure to private sector participation in the port sector through the
concession in October 1998 of the management and operation of the general cargo and terminals of the Beira to
the Dutch company Cornelder. The fuel terminals in all the ports and the bulk grains and aluminum terminals
in Maputo port remain in the hands of CFM.
                                                        19


60 km per hour, with increased reliability as unscheduled stoppages and derailments per
week decreased from seven in 2006 to two in 2008.

2.44 The outcome concerning CFM‘s staff rationalization and organizational restructuring,
is CFM‘s increased net income since 2007 and the fact that it has since then been able to pay
dividends to the government. Net income shows a growing trend that amounted to US$25
million in 2010 against US$13 million in 2009 (CFM, 2010).

2.45 Additional Measure of Port Efficiency. During the years of project implementation,
Mozambique increased the use of its ports capacity. The amount of Twenty-Foot Equivalent
Units (TEUs)15 shipped daily grew 43 percent over this period, from 207 in 1999 to 297
TEUs in 2008. The number of ships calling at the ports increased by around 16 percent, from
1,353 to 1,574. Similar growth was registered in the number of tons shipped per day, which
increased from 2,280 in 1998 to 3,658 in 2008. Handling fees in Mozambique are relatively
low. As of 2009, the container cargo fare was $150 per TEU for the Maputo port.16 After
Cape Town (South Africa), dry bulk handling charges in the Maputo and Beira ports are the
lowest in the region (AICD 2011). Maputo, Beira, and Nacala ports have two of the three
standard productivity factors:17 their private concessionaires have adopted modern container
gantries but the size of their operations is the smallest in the region. This is indicative of
efficiency. The IEG mission visited the three concession ports that had support from the
Bank project and was informed of the many difficult years in getting the Maputo port and the
Nacala port concession to perform well. The mission found some modern infrastructure,
particularly in the Maputo and Beira ports, including two modern gantry cranes in the
container terminal, conveyor belt loading of sugar, and an expanded car terminal in Maputo.
The mission found some good security at the Ports, as is demonstrated by the use of selective
electric fencing and gates, container scanning, and land- and water-based security patrols.

15
   TEU is the standard unit for describing a ship's cargo carrying capacity, or a shipping terminal's cargo
handling capacity.
16
   Data was only obtained for 2009 to 2011, for the port of Maputo.
17
   For crane productivity, the important factors are the presence of private operators, the usage of specialized
container-handling equipment, and the overall size of terminal operations.
                                              20


The mission was informed that the grain terminal in Maputo is equipped with modern
technology to handle wine and vegetable oil in bulk, and that the container and multi-purpose
terminal in the port of Beira is equipped with a modern computerized management system
for handling large volumes of traffic. But overall, the facilities and equipment at Nacala port
are in deteriorated condition.

traffic with trend line (1975-2011)

2.46 Operating efficiency is also measured by the contribution of the port to the logistics
chain. In 2007, the Maputo Corridor Logistics Initiative reported that the total cost of cargo
transport by rail or road through Maputo port is lower than via Durban for all hinterland
locations in South Africa and Swaziland, except for Pretoria in the case of road plus port
combination. For both exports and imports, the Maputo port is the best performing part of
the Maputo logistics chain in comparison with the border posts, and surface transport, and
corresponds to a fair rating for international ports (USAID 2008). It appears that these results
can be attributed to the Government plan supported by the Bank project. Other support
involved the Port of Quelimane which was rehabilitated in 2007 with funds from the German
Reconstruction Credit Institute or Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau. The port concession was
awarded directly to Cornelder in 2004.

2.47 Attribution of increased efficiency of Railways. Aggregates mask important
differences in trends among rail systems. Whereas cargo traffic on railways under CFM
management (i.e. Maputo system) increased around 10 percent between 2005 and 2008, the
lines under concession experienced important declines. A substantial decline of 60 percent of
cargo traffic was registered in the Beira Railway and a 10 percent drop in the Nacala
Railway18 (see Annex B). The IEG mission visited the Beira railway - and saw the
deteriorated rolling stock wagons- which would need to improve wagon capacity to be able
to respond to any increase in demand. The mission was informed that CFM has recently
invested US$3 million in the rehabilitation of rolling stock, and that the rehabilitation is
ongoing. There is a question on the attribution of the increase in international rail traffic,
because both the growth of the economy and the better condition of the railways would
impact on international traffic. The Machipanda line, part of the Beira system in the central
part of the country, is highly dependent on Zimbabwe‘s economic situation. According to
internal documents, international traffic from Zimbabwe on Machipanda Line was expected
to increase by 30 percent from 498.000 tons in 2004, but instead it decreased. The
Government of Zimbabwe banned maize imports, stating record crops for the year of 2004.
The University of Zimbabwe estimated in 2008 that between 2000 and 2007 agricultural
production decreased by 51 percent (www, 2010). Since there were no imports of maize
starting in 2007 and exporters were unable to collect payments, traffic on this line suffered a
significant drop (see Annex B).

2.48 Overall, there have been substantial improvements in the operating efficiency of the
ports and to a lesser extent some of the railways in Mozambique. Hence, in this respect the
development objective has been substantially achieved.

STRENGTHEN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR POLICY, THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK, AND THE
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

2.49 Outputs. A study for the development of a strategic plan was financed by the project
without visible evidence of any traction or sector policy directions originating from it. It was
expected that this study would pave for the development of a sector policy adequately

18
  During 2006, it became known that CVRD had the intention of buying out the Nacala concession, which is
believed by some interviewees to have resulted in the concessionaires putting on hold investments and other
important decisions, further affecting the performance of the rail corridor.
                                                     22


addressing emerging issues concerning increased private sector participation such as
concessions, and the necessary regulation. Many other studies were also financed in a
fragmented way without much result to date, including the 2005 Transport Costs Study
which presented in a succinct way key actions to be undertaken in the road, rail and ports
sectors, but which was not widely disseminated (the Bank project did not include specific
provisions for dissemination of studies by MoTC). A much needed transport sector study was
not undertaken and instead a study of the trucking sector was proposed for financing.19

2.50 Following Resolution 10/2001, the ministry was restructured to facilitate a more
integrated and holistic rather than sectoral approach, and the number of directorates was
reduced to three to deal with infrastructure, economic analysis and investment, and surface
transport, instead of having separate directorates for different sub-sectors. Overall, the
project implementation unit capacity in MoTC increased substantially, but this unit was
almost entirely staffed by outside consultants,20 thus after project implementation the
improved capacity has yet to percolate significantly into the rest of MoTC. The IEG mission
met with three staff trained and concluded that the benefits of such training were not obvious.
Furthermore, a number of actions to address structural and organizational issues and improve
the ministry's performance were still pending by project closure. This component did not
link to the 2003 Public Sector Reform Program supported by the World Bank, the 2005
Institutional Support Project for Public Sector Reform supported by the African
Development Fund, any other civil service training or reform program funded by the
government or by other doors.

2.51 As part of the strengthening of the ministry‘s capacity and sector policy, the World
Bank project supported the transport development corridors since 2002 through the
Development Corridor Technical Assistance implemented under responsibility of the MoTC,
and modeled on the previous six years of successful experience with the Maputo Corridor
first phase during 1996-2001.21 The project supported the Corridor Development Program
by financing staff of the corridor units, vehicles, office equipment, training, and consultants.
The objective was the creation of lasting capacity at the provincial and local level. The IEG
mission was not able to ascertain any benefits arising from the project‘s support to this
initiative. The assistance aimed at promoting multi-sectoral development along the country's
four main transport corridors (Maputo, Limpopo, Beira, Nacala), in close cooperation with
the neighboring countries South Africa, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Official bilateral cooperation
agreements were concluded with South Africa on the Maputo Corridor and Malawi on the
Nacala Corridor, in which Zambia subsequently joined. The IEG team found no evidence of
an agreement having been signed with Zimbabwe for the Beira Corridor. However, the
South African Department of Trade and Industry, in the context of its regional Spatial

  The Maputo Corridor connects Maputo with the South Africa‘s Gauteng province, running through one of the
most highly industrialized and productive regions of the Republic of South Africa. The corridor is considered
one of the most successful stories in Africa in terms of improved cross-country trading (USAID 2008). At the
western end of the corridor are Johannesburg and Pretoria, and moving east toward Mozambique, the corridor
passes through the areas of aluminum production close to Maputo and the industrial development of Mozal.

Development Initiative program, funded through the Development Bank of Southern Africa
(DBSA) the promotion of a number of selected development corridors in SADC, including
the four Mozambican corridors.

2.52 The study about the regulatory framework completed in 2002 suggested a sectoral
regulator, as the most suitable for the Mozambique transport sector, due to: (i) limited
availability of technically qualified human resources in the country; (ii) relatively lower costs
of implementation; and (iii) the need to take into account the integrated sector development
perspective and to respond to on-going initiatives such as the development corridors, and
multi-modal logistics. At the time, there were already examples in the country of sector
regulators, such as the National Institute of Communications of Mozambique (Instituto
Nacional das Comunicações de Moçambique - INCM), the Regulatory Council for Water
Supply (Conselho Regulador do Abastecimento de Agua CRA), and others with some typical
functions of a Regulator. With the establishment of a separate maritime institute in 2005,22
the earlier thinking to establish a common regulatory body for the railways and maritime
services fell out of favor. IEG interviews suggest that the government was concerned with
the establishment of another regulator and the cost implications to the economy of creating
additional entities without a clear and cohesive view on the most appropriate national
regulatory framework. In 2006 Bank internal documents observed that in order to avoid any
potential conflict of interest, the monitoring of the port and railway concessions needed to be
undertaken by an independent unit within MoTC under the Directorate of Planning and
Investments. At project closure, a draft implementation plan for the concession monitoring
unit at MoTC had been prepared but was not finalized given government‘s repeated concerns
on how to contain the cost of such a unit within MoTC.

2.53 Outcomes. The project was expected to result in: (i) the implementation of a sector
policy adequately addressing emerging issues concerning increased private sector
participation such as concessions, and the necessary regulation; (ii) a more integrated sector
planning and management by the MOTC; and (iii) effective regulation. There was mixed
progress across the different elements of sector policy, institutional and regulatory
framework, and capacity building. The project achieved partial strengthening and capacity
building of MoTC. Interviews suggest that the learning and experience from implementing
the project are having a positive impact on MoTC. The strengthened regulatory framework
and sector policy was achieved to a lesser extent because the concession monitoring unit was
not established at ministry. The difficulty in achieving this objective illustrates the existing
constraints to improving the performance of line ministries and the need to have in place
buy-in from all stakeholders and commitment from the very top. In fact, the project does not
appear to have been able to strengthen the ministry‘s ability to set sector policy reflecting
integrated planning and management of the sector. Hence, in this respect the development
objective has been modestly achieved.

OTHER UNINTENDED EFFECTS

2.54 Outputs: Rehabilitation of Jetties and Acquisition of Boats/Ferries. Support to
waterways was included in 2007 during project implementation as a way to utilize the

22
     The Instituto Nacional Da Marinha (INAMAR) was entrusted with maritime regulation.

financing originally allocated to the rehabilitation of tertiary ports. This support does not
contribute to the achievement of the development objectives of the project, and therefore its
achievement is not rated. It comprised the financing of civil works for physical infrastructure
like wharfs and jetties, associated consultancies and engineering services for the
rehabilitation of the jetties in six locations as required for the transport from Maputo,
Inhambane and Quelimane to Catembe, Maxixe and Recamba, the purchase of six
ferries/boats for the transport service of both passengers and cargo, and preparation of a
study on the development of the Inhambane region, focusing on the importance of ports and
jetties in the area. While the facilities are valued by the government and the passengers and
there have been evident improvements to safety and quality, the transformation of the
waterway transport company (Transmaritima) into an autonomous state company with no
government financial support has been unsuccessful. The company is incurring heavy losses
and has borrowed from the government to settle salary bills overdue.

2.55 IEG visited the ferries and jetties supported under the project at Quelimane and
Maputo. While ferries in operation and jetties are in good state of repair, Transmaritima has
several boats in various locations and to varying degrees of disrepair that cannot be utilized
due to lack of resources to cover operations and maintenance costs. IEG interviews point out
the dissatisfaction among the private boat operators who are forced to compete with
Transmaritima in all routes but one, but are not able to raise their tariffs for cost recovery
above Transmaritima‘s tariffs in anticipation of public outcry. The distortion of the market
created by the state's unrealistically low tariff formulation makes the present sector structure
not sustainable. Although a Maritime Legislative and Regulatory Framework study was
undertaken, as well as a technical and operational review of the performance of
Transmaritima, the institutional arrangements for operation and maintenance of the jetties,
ferries and boats was not set up. Transmaritima‘s performance study concluded that the
company did not have the capacity to operate the ferries and that the possibility of private
sector participation needed to be explored. Indeed, given the high staffing levels in
Transmaritima, it was evident at the time that the corporatization of the company without
resolving the outstanding personnel and salary-related debts was unlikely to be a long-term
solution. Despite discussing the results of Transmaritima‘s performance study at a
stakeholder meeting chaired by the Ministry of Transport and Communication in 2006, and
agreeing to the need for looking at a proposal for operation on a Public Private Partnership
basis, the ministry delegated these tasks to the new Transmaritima in 2009. The Bank failed
to adequately impress upon the government the necessity to assess the various institutional
options and adequately advice the government on policy, institutional and regulatory reform
in this area.

2.56 Outcomes: Improvement of Water Transport. At the end of the project the
outcome indicators (annual traffic) used to measure improved water transport at Maputo,
Inhambane and Quelimane respectively increased from 1.9 million, 0.57 million and 0.36
million in 2007 to 3.4 million, 0.7 million, and 0.63 million respectively in 2009. This trend
has continued and overall, passenger transport grew by 50.8 percent in 2010 from 13.2
million to 19.9 million passenger-km due to new boats serving Maputo-Catembe,
Inhambane-Maxixe, Beira-Buzi, Beira-Machanga and Quelimane-Recamba.

Efficiency
2.57 Efficiency of the project is rated Modest. The ex-post economic and financial
analysis followed the same methodology used at appraisal. Overall, the rates reflect lower
than expected rail traffic, and a three-year delay in project implementation. Based on the
ICR, the rate of return for the CFM components is 24 percent, which is significantly below
the estimate at appraisal (rate of 52 percent). The CFM components include the staff
rationalization, port-rail concessions and organization restructuring and represent 81 percent
of the project funds, similar to the 80 percent calculated at appraisal, and include as well the
investments made by the government on the Ressano-Garcia line after the concession failed.
The rates of return exclude the rehabilitation/acquisition of jetties and boats/ferries, which
costs and benefits are not associated with CFM, but which had a rate of return at
restructuring of 35 percent (World Bank 2007). The rates of return also exclude the costs
and benefits corresponding to the strengthening of the Ministry of Transport and
Communications and the improvement of the regulatory framework, because the associated
benefits are difficult to quantify. Yet, although these components only correspond to 20
percent of the Project funds, their contribution to the overall sustainability of the project
outcomes and indeed of the sector as a whole is much greater. Neither the strengthening of
the ministry nor the improvement to the regulatory framework delivered visible benefits. In
theory, since the costs of these activities were small compared to the total cost of the project,
their exclusion from the rate of return calculation need not significantly change the results at
appraisal or completion.

2.58 The efficiency is affected by: (i) supporting the concession award process with only
modest funds scarcely sufficient to finance a single advisor to the Company; (ii)
incorporation of an unrelated component on tertiary ports later replaced by improvements to
water transport; and (iii) significant delays with the staff rationalization and concession
programs.

2.59 Several assumptions in the analysis make it probable that the rates of return
calculated overestimate actual efficiency on the ground. The Financial Rate of Return
calculation of 23 percent at appraisal assumes a maximum of US$50 million for CFM‘s cash
flow, including the portion derived from investments by the concessionaires. Should 70
percent of the cash flows from concessionaires be excluded - for consistency with excluded
concessionaire‘s investments – the Financial Rate drops to 18 percent. In addition, CFM‘s
cash flows in 2011 were only US$25 million (CFM, 2011 Annual Report) against the US$50
million assumed, thus the rate may be lower than 18 percent. Furthermore, the calculation
does not take into account the funds spent on unrelated water transport activities not
associated with project objectives. Therefore, the actual rate may be lower.

Ratings
OUTCOME

2.60 While the objective to improve the operating efficiency of the three port-rail systems
was substantially achieved, the key objective to strengthen the regulatory function in the
ministry of transport was only modestly achieved. Moreover, while the operating efficiency
                                                     26


increased, it took four years longer than planned. There were shortcomings in respect of the
institutional development of the Ministry of Transport and Communication and regulatory
efforts which were crucial for underpinning the continued sustainability of the reforms
undertaken. The project design did not include institutional strengthening of the ministry that
matched the effort required with the level of existing capacity and commitment on the part of
the ministry and the government. The economic rate of return was significantly lower than
was expected at appraisal. Delays, expenditures on the unrelated water transport component,
and insufficient resources and accountability for the concession activities affected the
project‘s efficiency. Based on the high relevance of the objectives and substantial
achievement of improved operating efficiency, but modest relevance of design, efficiency
and modest improvements in regulatory functions, the overall outcome of the project is rated
moderately satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.61 Risk to development outcome is rated Moderate. There are several risks to the
development outcome including: (i) increasing trend in the number of CFM employees
undermining the results of the staff rationalization program;23 (ii) inadequate monitoring and
regulation of the concessions may result in further deterioration of the government
relationship with some of the concessionaires and decrease of private participation; (iii)
increased diverted traffic to Durban or Port Elizabeth from Maputo and to small regional
ports from Nacala and Beira if congestion at the main three ports is not resolved; and (iv)
further worsening of the service provided by the railways due to delayed rehabilitation and
maintenance and delays in donor funding.

2.62 While the government intends to review the various existing concession models for
both ports and railways, in the absence of strong autonomous regulation, a key risk to
development outcomes is the lack of adequate monitoring and regulation of concessions,
deterioration of government-concessionaire relationships due to perceived arbitrary revenue
generation by the state against the interest of the concessionaires, and concessionaires exiting
the sector. IEG interviewees pointed to two examples of perceived arbitrary revenue
generation by the state. The first example concerns the access channels, which are often
included in the master lease agreements with due and proper regulation. At the moment, the
channel in Maputo is the Inahina‘s responsibility (the Mozambique hydrographic institute)
which uses a surcharge for the Maputo Channel to cover the cost of dredging of the port
channel including also the Beira channel. Although the deepening of the channel is purely in
the interest of the bulk terminal users, the Maputo Harbor Authority (function undertaken by
the concessionaire as part of the Master Lease Agreement) levied the charge toward all ocean
carriers since April 2011 of USD 25/TEU. The second example concerns the MoPF-awarded
concession in October 2005 to a private company for scanning of all cargo handled at
Mozambican Ports. A portable scanner was installed at Maputo port in July 2006 and from
IEG interviews it appears that the company has plans to place other scanners at Beira and
other ports. Typically, shipments are scanned based on risk assessments, and most countries
inspect no more than about 20 percent. It is rare for bulk or transit cargo to be scanned. All
cargo in Maputo Port must be scanned using the scanner and fees range from USD 20 to
23
     The average number of employees during 2010 was 2,890 against 2,643 in 2009 (CFM, 2010).
                                                       27


USD 100/TEU, USD 65 per automobile and USD0.25-1.90 per ton of bulk cargo, which by
those interviewed as well as according to Bank mission documents, appear particularly
high.24 Transporters of bulk cargo, for example, see this measure as unnecessary, and as
another example of inadequate and arbitrary revenue generation to the state,25 which goes
against the principles of ―Doing Business.‖

2.63     Although private sector participation in railways has been largely unsuccessful,
today, six of Mozambique‘s seven seaports are operating with the involvement of the private
sector. With increased interest in private sector provision of infrastructure services, some
progress has been made and a new surface transport regulator (INATTER) covering both
roads and railways was recently established, a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) law dated
August 10, 2011 was approved, and a proposed complementary PPP law and regulation were
being discussed at the time of the IEG mission.

2.64 While the government intends to develop a national port policy aiming at increasing
the competitiveness of Mozambican ports, there is no plan to develop a single national ports
and railway strategy. In the vacuum created by the lack of strategic direction a key risk to
development outcomes is the inability to offer competitive transport services to passengers,
bulk/commodity and general cargo, particularly to the small producers that have no part in
the ports or railway concessions. Despite important progress in the modernization of
Mozambique‘s port systems, there still is a time lag between an increase in demand and the
development of infrastructure projects to meet that demand. Mozambique faces the risk of
further traffic diverting to competing ports, specifically to Durban or Port Elizabeth in South
Africa from Maputo port due: (i) low frequency of sailings, because if cargo misses a vessel
sailing from a Mozambican port, there would be a longer wait than if cargo was waiting at
Durban; and (ii) high additional charges for channel dredging and scanning of cargo – despite
closer proximity of Maputo to Johannesburg and the Mpumalanga province in South Africa.
An independent report on the Maputo corridor stated that adding on significant costs for
cargo scanning would decrease the competitiveness of the corridor (USAID 2008). There is
further risk if the Maputo port puts on hold investments due to these charges.26 Therefore,
one of the biggest challenges for Maputo port is to become the first option for importers and
exporters along the Maputo corridor and to take advantage of its lower cost compared to
Durban and Richards Bay. With congestion in both the Beira and the Nacala ports, small
regional ports like Pemba which is close to Nacala and Quelimane which is close to Beira,
have become attractive to the private sector even without increased cabotage services.
Diverted traffic to small regional ports may be permanent if congestion at the main three
ports is resolved. There is expectation for improvement, as the government's current sector
strategy, among others, focuses on improving the Maputo, Beira and Nacala ports, as well as

24
 Container security fees listed in a 2006 United Nations report on maritime security reportedly ranged from
USD1.5 to USD19 per TEU (http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=07MAPUTO509 retrieved on March
20, 2012).
25
   The Bank discussed with government the need to adjust charges to reasonable levels as per international
standards and to waive certain bulk cargo that is usually not scanned such as sugar, coal, and granite. A task
force was created to analyze the situation (AM September 2006). The IEG mission was unable to obtain an
update on the task force‘s work.
26
     IEG interviews suggest that some investments at Maputo Port may depend on these charges being reduced.

the rehabilitation and construction of secondary ports.

2.65 Mozambican railway lines act as feeders to other systems, which subsequently carry
the traffic a few hundred kilometers farther. These systems have a good chance of competing
for general freight traffic, even as the road network is improved and intermodal competition
increases, as long as they can maintain satisfactory service levels. But significant funding is
required to rehabilitate and maintain the railway systems to a good standard. The
government currently counts with support from several development agencies to continue
making progress.27 The government plan includes both the rehabilitation of existing rail lines
destroyed by the war and the construction of new lines as envisaged in the Integrated
Transport Strategy. A total of US$25 million from the World Bank and the United Kingdom
Department for International Development will support the Spatial Planning Unit in the
Department of Studies and Projects in MoTC to undertake the necessary studies for the
implementation of the proposed north-south rail line and its integration with ports, roads and
waterways. Similarly, China Road and Bridge Corporation is undertaking the feasibility
study for a Mutuali rail corridor linking Mutarara and Mutuali. Delay in the implementation
of this funding poses additional risk to the railways as critical maintenance and rehabilitation
would suffer.

2.66 The country is still not offering fully competitive rail and port services commensurate
with its strategic geographical location. While many of the actions contemplated by the
government are in the right direction, tangible results are yet to be seen particularly regarding
effective regulation. On balance, the risk to development outcome is rated moderate.

BANK PERFORMANCE

2.67 The quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank's team undertook
detailed project preparation and had constructive policy dialogue with the government to
address the most critical areas for railway and port sector reform. A consensus building
approach was adopted during project preparation through formal and informal consultations
and meetings with all relevant stakeholders. Interviewees give credit to the Bank for
consensus building across the government regarding further concession of these sectors.
Some of the views expressed were incorporated in the project design leading to design
improvements as in the case of the retrenchment component. The project design took into
account the experience of previous rail and port sector restructuring projects in Africa and
other regions: (i) contingency plans are necessary in the event of delay or lack of interest in
setting up independent and effective regulation, but restructuring must take place and
projects must continue to seek increased private sector participation; and (ii) staff
retrenchment programs are a cornerstone of sector restructuring projects, provided they are
properly designed, adequately resourced and go hand in hand with related social mitigation

27
   There has been a recent increase in the number of wagons operating in the Maputo rail system in an attempt
to reduce the traffic and congestion on the roads. The Ressano-Garcia line shows an increase in cargo from
South Africa of diverse products including automobiles since 2010. The Beira rail system restarted passenger
transport between Beira and Marromeu on November 29, and between Beira and Mutarara district on November
26, 2009. The Nacala rail system added new locomotives in 2010 to allow more frequent passenger transport,
and passenger transport is planned on the Goba line (part of the Maputo system).
                                              29


programs. Six key risks to project outcomes and five potentially controversial aspects were
identified. None of the risks regarding the staff retrenchment program materialized.

2.68 The assessment of the risks and likelihood of MoTC strengthening, and of regulatory
reform taking place, was not fully covered at the time of project preparation/appraisal, which
translated into multiple delays and long implementation time. This was particularly so
because the government approved a comprehensive restructuring of MoTC in 1998
(Ministerial Decree nº 211/98, dated December 2, 1998), which was being implemented
during project preparation and completed in 2001. MoTC capacity was also known to be
relatively weak, partly due to the new structure.

2.69 There was no fall-back plan to deal with declining rail traffic, urgent maintenance
needs and slippages in concession targets. There was also no plan to deal with higher than
expected investment requirements of the rail lines. The Bank could have sought an active
engagement of IFC to structure the port and rail concessions. This decision added significant
delays and unnecessary complexity to the concession process and it deprived the concession
component of a dedicated team of railway and port concession experts during both
preparation and implementation, who would support the government, discuss the merits and
pitfalls of other approaches for selection of strategic partners which may have been more in
line with the government‘s strategy at the time, ensure that concession contracts specified
desired performance outputs rather than inputs, and overall have some accountability for the
success or failure of the concessions. This component needed to result in successful
concessions rather than in concessions that were simply operational as defined in the results
framework. It did not take into account the lack of concession experience of the client.

2.70 The Bank did not encourage the government to have a more active dialogue at high
levels with the neighboring countries, particularly with South Africa, during project
preparation and throughout implementation. The project did not incorporate an impact study
of the CFM retrenchment program. The Bank team also incorporated without proper due
diligence a component on tertiary ports rehabilitation which was intended to give continuity
to the support provided by the First Roads and Coastal Shipping Project. The M&E
framework, although consistent with the objectives, lacked an outcome indicator that would
measure the objective of increased share of international traffic. The framework also
included output and outcome indicators for the unrelated component on tertiary ports, and
later water transport.

2.71 The quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory. Supervision was carried out on a
continuous basis and covered a wide range of activities and issues. Task leadership remained
mostly in the hands of one single staff member. Interviews suggest that the Bank
relationship with the clients was cooperative and fruitful even during times of strong debate
among the parties. The professional advice given was well received and the Bank was
considered a solid partner during the restructuring process. Moreover, the Bank consistently
requested that the government carefully review alternatives being proposed when the interest
of private sector parties and concessionaires appeared to be putting pressure on government
                                                        30


decision-making.28 It also showed a solution-oriented approach even during the most
sensitive times when the relationships between the government and the concessionaires were
at a low point.29 One example is the decision to support CFM with the subsequent Beira
Railways project and associated European Investment Bank financing which was prepared
and implemented when it became evident that the high investment required to rehabilitate the
line was an obstacle for the Beira railway system concession – and the financing for
rehabilitating the line was outside the scope of the restructuring project. It was precisely the
unavailability of financing that impeded the Beira railway concession to take place in the
context of the Ports and Railways Restructuring Project.

2.72 Despite delays, the Bank persevered, and obtained multiple time extensions for
project implementation to ensure continuous support to the government including
implementation of new components; but the project development objectives were not
changed when the new water transport component was added to the project. In addition, the
Bank's supervision efforts focused more on ensuring the completion of CFM‘s components
(staff rationalization, port and rail concessions and CFM restructuring), than on those
involving MoTC. According to internal documents, several non-core studies were dropped
such as the bus terminal study and the human resource management studies for MoTC, but
significant fragmentation in the scope of the ministry component remained.

2.73 The risks concerning the concessionaires' performance, the management of the
concession process, implementation of concessions, and ineffective regulatory framework
did materialize to different extents. During the course of project implementation, CFM and
the Bank team developed new mitigation measures to address the unsatisfactory performance
of concessionaires, including termination of concessions and developing long-term client-
centric strategic partnerships instead. Similarly, MoTC attempted to overcome the lack of an
effective regulatory framework and consistently attempts were made both at CFM and MoTC
to mimic the functions of an autonomous regulator but without much success. M&E
framework was systematically utilized during project implementation and progress with
indicators recorded in mission documents. Given the weaknesses described above regarding
quality at entry, the overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Government Performance

2.74 Government performance is rated satisfactory. The government demonstrated a
commitment to and ownership of the project and reform in the railway and port sector
through a series of actions. In the context of the 1996 transport policy recognizing the need
for private sector participation in ports, railways, airports, as well as in air and sea

28
  For example, the May 2006 mission was concerned by the fact that CVRD intended to use the Nacala rail
corridor for the export of coal from Moatize without a feasibility study, and with significant additional cost to
be borne by the government. The mission encouraged the government to rely on independent third party
assessments of the feasibility and costs of that proposal.
29
  For example, the non-payment of fees for years led to further deterioration of the relationship between the
concessionaire of the Maputo Port and CFM.
                                             31


navigation, full support was provided to the restructuring of CFM, including the publication
of the legal framework relating the payment of compensation for retrenched staff as set out in
Decree 12/2001 of 10 April approved by the Council of Ministers. The government paid its
own account severance payments amounting to US$8.7 million corresponding to the
retrenchment of over 14,700 staff at CFM during 1998-2007. This payment was additional to
the agreed counterpart funds of US$20 million which were contributed in full. The
government ownership of 49 percent of all concessions begs the question as to how
committed the government was to the concession of the railway-port systems. The
government stake in the concessions created conflicting interests between the government‘s
roles of policy maker, regulator, and client on the one hand, and shareholder on the other.
This was aggravated by the lack of autonomous regulation.

Implementing Agency Performance

2.75 Implementing agency performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Ports and
Railways of Mozambique implemented its own CFM components. The ministry-related
components were initially implemented by the ministry‘s Office of Maritime Affairs, and
later by the Transport and Communications Project Management Unit.

2.76 Implementing agency (CFM) performance is rated satisfactory. CFM benefited from
strong and committed leadership at the top and also from support from the government
departments involved in the restructuring process. The internal organization, structure and
regulations were reformulated keeping in mind the new structure of CFM. CFM spearheaded
the successful retrenchment of surplus staff from 19,387 employees in 1998 to 1,637 in 2007.
This complex exercise was well conceived and executed. CFM had in place a
comprehensive strategy for benefit payments and retraining that earned the trust of the
institution, the staff and the unions. Rail and port concessions were awarded with various
degrees of success, except for the southern railway system. CFM consistently sought out
proactive solutions to overcome the various delays and failures of the concessions, including
initiating rehabilitation and upgrades with their own funds and facilitating work outs for
concession companies unable to reach financial closure. CFM managed the project in a
professional manner, and the relations with the Bank were cooperative.

2.77 Implementing agency (MoTC) performance is rated moderately satisfactory. MoTC
was proactive in making arrangements during project preparation, including the timely
agreement on key studies, technical assistance and capacity building to be supported under
the project. During implementation, MoTC actively supported water transport and related
infrastructure. Delays occurred in the definition of the terms of reference for some studies
such as the pension study, pointed out by project documents in 2007. Delays also took place
in the implementation of the recommendations of the MoTC‘s restructuring and
strengthening study, in the study on regulatory framework and on Transmaritima‘s
operations. The concession monitoring unit was not established. From the results of the
assessment of Transmaritima, the ferries‘ operation needed to be undertaken by private
operators, but those operations remain to date in the hands of the public sector.
                                                32


2.78 Given the weaknesses described above regarding the performance of MoTC, and the
overall inability and unwillingness to implement an adequate regulatory framework, the
overall Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

QUALITY OF MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)

2.79 M&E Implementation. An updated M&E framework has been in effect since
September 2005. This reflected the need to monitor whether CFM was financially
sustainable and included reviewing the financial performance of the various concessions.
However, the information collected as a result of these efforts was sketchy and piecemeal
and the Bank acknowledged in mission documents dated May 2006, that this information was
not conducive to good decision making. Therefore, there was agreement that some of the
targets from the PAD needed to be revised, as most of the concessions became operational
well after the initial target date, affecting both the efficiency of the concessions as well as the
extent of retrenchment at CFM. Although actual numerical targets in the results framework
at restructuring did not change, some refinement and precision was added to the qualitative
targets.

2.80 M&E Utilization. The MoTC and CFM critically evaluated their future needs in
2005 and based on their recommendations the project funds were reallocated among the
different categories in order to ensure the best utilization. Hence, data appear to have
explicitly served as a feedback mechanism for taking corrective actions during
implementation. The government appreciated the need to monitor more closely the impact
of its policies and investments on the efficiency and effectiveness of the transport sector,
both to validate the changes/investments made and to help identify where additional reform
or investment was required. It was agreed that the ministry would formulate some
intermediate indicators to track implementation progress, and provide the Bank with an
updated plan, taking into account all the changes. In trying to understand traffic trends and to
provide further insight for decision-making, a baseline study for the competitiveness and
service levels in the Mozambique transport sector was undertaken in 2007, and a review of
the competitiveness of Maputo port in 2008. In the absence of a comprehensive transport
sector study, these helped assess the cost and quality of transport and trade services in
Mozambique, and complemented the 2004 transport cost study. Overall M&E design,
implementation and utilization is rated Substantial.

Epilogue
2.81 Five years after the project was approved, a new credit of US$110 million for the
Beira Railway project was approved by IDA‘s Board on October 14, 2004. The project
closed on December 31, 2011 and the completion report is pending. The credit was approved
to finance the reconstruction of the Sena Railway Line (about 600 km) through on-lending of
US$104.5 million to the railway concessionaire (CCFB) and US$5.5 million to CFM for
institutional strengthening, environmental management, and capacity building. The main
development objectives of the Beira Railway Project were to: (i) make cost effective and
efficient transport available for the freight and passenger traffic in the Zambezi Valley to
accelerate economic growth in the sub-region; (ii) increase international traffic through the
Beira Railway system; and (iii) improve the operational, managerial and financial
                                                        33


sustainability of the Beira railway system. The key elements of the Beira Railway project
objectives were thus still relevant at the time of this Project Performance Assessment Report.

2.82 The Beira corridor was given in concession to the consortium formed by Rail
Mozambique Technical and Economic Services (RITES) Ltd. and IRCON International in
December 2004, with support from the Beira Railway Project, but the concession was
terminated by the government on December 7, 2011 after failure of the concessionaire to
substantially complete the rehabilitation of the lines on time, and since then CFM is
operating the Sena line. Despite the decline of traffic on lines under concession and the
partial neglect of passengers relative to cargo, passenger transport grew by 46 percent in
2010. The staff productivity measured in traffic units (net-ton km plus pass-km)/staff/year
for the Beira railways increased from 0.35 million traffic units per employee per annum in
2004 to 0.9 in 2011 against 1.3 million traffic units per employee per annum planned for
2011. Although this figure seems to be an improvement, it needs to be interpreted as a sharp
decline in traffic due to the fact that some of the traffic is the concessionaire‘s traffic and all
passenger traffic is on the Machipanda line.30 As of date, a total of 545 km of the Sena
railroad were rehabilitated between Beira and Moatize. The first coal train left Moatize for
Beira on August 8, 2011 after a temporary agreement on track access charges was reached
between the railway concessionaire and the mining company. No rehabilitation was
undertaken of the 317 km of the Machipanda line.

2.83 Productivity and efficiency of the rail lines in Mozambique are considered on par
with its southern African peers, aside from South Africa (AICD, 2011). The 2011-2012
global competiveness survey assigned a rating of 2.2 out of 7 and a ranking of 86 out of 142
countries for quality of railroad infrastructure. The rating is equal to Zambia‘s, but worse
that Malawi‘s (2.4), Zimbabwe‘s (2.7) and South Africa‘s (3.4).

2.84 The government continues to actively promote the development of the port sector.
The 2011-2012 global competiveness survey assigned a rating of 3.4 out of 7 and a ranking
of 110 out of 142 countries to the quality of port infrastructure in Mozambique. The rating is
worse than those of its neighbors (Malawi: 3.6; Zambia: 4.0; Zimbabwe: 4.4; South Africa:
4.7). However, the 2011 Doing Business Report gave Mozambique a rating of 136 out of
183 economies for ease of trading across borders. This rating is better than South Africa
(144), Zambia (153), Malawi (164) and Zimbabwe (172). In Mozambique it takes
approximately 23 days to complete an export process and 28 days for an import process,
against 30 and 32 days in South Africa and many more days in the other neighboring
countries. Similarly, Mozambique is competitive in terms of cost for export and import of
goods. While it is difficult to assess the conflicting rankings of port competitiveness
published by these sources, it is clear that the performance of Mozambican ports continues to
improve.

3. Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance
Project (2001-2007)
Background and Context
3.1     Mozambique's classified road network (national and regional roads) is 29,349
kilometers in extent of which roughly 20 percent (5,814 kilometers) are paved. It carries 95
percent of all surface traffic, as cargo moves primarily by road. Shippers often prefer road
freight because it is more convenient, average speed is acceptable,31 and several west-east
road corridors allow connectivity to the ports and the N1 which runs the length of the country
generally staying close to the coast from Maputo to the north. Road density per land area is
low at 46 meters per square kilometer due to the large size of Mozambique (204 per square
kilometer for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole), but quite average relative to the population, at
423 meters per 1,000 of population. The share of classified roads in good and fair condition
was 36 percent in 2001.

3.2    The road sector is managed by the National Road Administration (ANE), an
agency of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MoPWH). ANE is responsible for
the administration of national and regional roads.32 It is an autonomous public institution
subordinate to the Minister of Public Works and Housing. Its management reports to a Board
of Directors which includes both private and public sector representation. In 2001, the
government developed a Road Sector Strategy (RSS) and ten-year plan in collaboration with
IDA and other Development Partners.

3.3     The Road Fund has the fiduciary responsibility for road maintenance funds. It was
created in 1990 as a separate administrative body with a Roads Board to manage the fund.
However, the Board Chairman was also the director of the department of roads who in turn
appointed the director of the Fund. As such the independence of the Fund was compromised
and the Fund acted as a unit within the National Roads Administration. It financed both
maintenance and rehabilitation with resources from a fuel levy called an added tax on
existing taxes, which made difficult the earmarking of these funds as road tariffs for roads
and therefore the levy was considered part of the government's general tax revenues. The
fuel levy was set by the Council of Ministers, based on recommendations from MoFP and the
Price Commission. Since the revenues in Mozambique are then deposited into the ministry
account, the money does not flow regularly into the Road Fund. As a result, only half the
revenues collected through the fuel levy were actually paid into the Road Fund during 1993.
The work was carried out by government contractors, and disbursements were certified by
provincial inspectors employed by the Road Fund (Balcerac de Richecour, 1995). At the
time of project preparation, the roads sector was the highest-spending sector on the
investment account of the country and third highest in total, after education and health.

31
   Speed limits are generally 100 to 120 km/hr on national roads and 60 km/hr in urban areas, but average speed
in built up areas is about 40 km/hr.
32
  Little planning, policy or management capacity existed at the provincial level. The devolution of decision-
making and management to provincial and local authorities did not succeed because such capacities were not in
place. Hence they were devolved to ANE (World Bank, 2003).

Maintenance expenditures had leveled out in real terms since 1996 despite growing
maintenance needs and a growing economy (World Bank, 2003).There was a need to convert
the Road Fund into an autonomous legal entity to manage these high levels of expenditure in
a transparent and efficient way.

3.4      World Bank support to roads and highways started in 1992 with the First Road and
Coastal Shipping Project (1992-1999) and continued through to the Roads and Bridges
Management and Maintenance Program Phase 1 (2001-2007) assessed here and Phase 2 to be
completed in 2012 (See Table 5). WB group support in the roads sector has been long
standing and continuous. The Bank is credited with providing timely and relevant support
following the sector‘s first intervention after the end of the civil conflict in 1992. Early on in
the engagement, the Bank supported the resumption of regular transport services to formerly
inaccessible areas, financed land mines removal, supported the creation of social units in
charge of HIV/AIDS prevention measures along the transport corridors, and supported
institutional reforms. This helped removing bottlenecks for agricultural production and
distribution (World Bank, 2003a).

and Maintenance
Note: 1. Financing was spent on all types of productive infrastructure, including rural roads and bridges, health
centers, schools, water supply, sanitation systems, and markets.

3.5     Some support was also given to unpaved rural and regional roads, and Bailey
bridges. The overall purpose was to improve accessibility by increasing the percentage of
population that lives within 2 kilometers of an all-season road. This support, as part of the
First and Second Roads and Coastal Shipping Projects, initially required liaising with a
number of agencies in the country including the National Directorate of Roads and Bridges
and the Provincial Department of Roads and Bridges, both aggregated into ANE in 1999.
Later, the Bank support was envisaged to ANE for rural roads rehabilitation as part of the
Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Program Phase 1, as a secondary project
objective.

As this project was about to be designed these were the main issues affecting the sector:
    High Cost of Road Transport. The road tariffs averaged US cents 12.0 per net ton
        kilometer (ntkm) in 2001, partly because of the poor condition of the roads, leading to
        the high cost of vehicle spare parts and fuel consumption.

        Inadequacy of Road Infrastructure. A considerable effort was being made to improve
         the road infrastructure in Mozambique. However, the condition of the road
                                              36


       infrastructure continued to be a matter of concern and was proving to be a definite
       constraint to the growth of transit traffic from the surrounding landlocked countries.
       The road infrastructure had suffered in the past and continued to suffer due to
       inadequate allocation of funds for maintenance, inadequate enforcement of axle load
       regulations, and inefficient maintenance.

Objectives, Design, and Relevance
3.6     The Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Project is the first phase of a
three-phase Adaptable Program Loan designed to improve road infrastructure, sector policies
and road sector management. The program was designed to be implemented over a ten-year
period to support the government‘s 2001-2011 road sector program. Each phase is triggered
based on the planned/measured progress in the previous phase. Phase 1 focused on periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation of the maintainable network of paved and unpaved roads,
implementing institutional and policy reforms, and completing preparation for the investment
program to be supported in Phases 2 and 3. These phases aim to: (i) focus on periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation; (ii) strengthen road management capacity; and (iii)
implement a road safety improvement program.

3.7     The estimated cost of the ten year road program in three phases is US$ 1.7 billion:
Phase 1 (four years, US$703 million); Phase 2 (three years, US$453 million); and Phase 3
(three years, US$544 million.) Phase 1 was to be financed by the government (US$211
million), 16 other development partners as parallel financiers (US$330 million), and IDA
(US$162 million).

OBJECTIVES

3.8    The overall program objective is to ―stimulate economic growth and contribute to
poverty reduction through improved road infrastructure, better sector policies and enhanced
road sector management‖ (PAD, pg.3). The formulation of the project development objective
for Phase 1 varies between the credit agreement and the PAD.

3.9     According to the Development Credit Agreement (schedule 2): ―The objective of the
project is to assist the Borrower in: (i) improving the coverage and conditions of roads and
bridges in the territory of the Borrower; (ii) strengthening the Borrower‘s institutional
capacity to manage and administer the road sector; (iii) establishing financing mechanisms
for roads maintenance; (iv) promoting the use of local resources in roads construction and
management; and (v) improving road transport safety."

3.10 According to the PAD (pg. 3): "The specific Phase 1 objectives are to (i) improve the
coverage and condition of roads and bridges; (ii) strengthen the country‘s capacity to manage
and administer the road sector effectively and transparently, with efficient and sustainable
institutional arrangements; (iii) establish financing mechanisms to ensure sufficient, timely,
stable and secure flow of funds for roads maintenance; and (iv) improve road transport
safety. Secondary objectives are to help prevent the spread of AIDS and encourage
employment of women in the roads sector."
                                             37


3.11 For the purposes of this assessment, IEG will use the articulation of the objectives
from the Development Credit Agreement because it is the legally binding document as
follows: (i) improving the coverage and conditions of roads and bridges; (ii) strengthening
the Borrower‘s institutional capacity to manage and administer the road sector; (iii)
establishing financing mechanisms for roads maintenance; (iv) promoting the use of local
resources in roads construction and management; and (v) improving road transport safety.
The wording of objectives in the credit agreement and the PAD are substantially similar. The
two differences are: (i) the exclusion of prevention of the spread of HIV/AIDS; and (ii) the
use of local resources in roads construction and management rather than a specific mention
of the employment of women in the roads sector. These two excluded aspects will be
considered as part of the context for the overall Program.

DESIGN

3.12   According to the DCA the project contained three main components.

      Component A –Roads and bridges (appraisal cost including contingencies
       US$138.4 million; actual US$161.0 million). This component would provide the
       resources to undertake periodic maintenance of primary roads, rehabilitation of
       priority primary roads and bridges and of rural roads and bridges, emergency repairs
       made necessary by floods or other natural disasters, and installation of traffic signs.
       The works were to be financed by the Road Fund with contributions from IDA and
       other donors as follows: (i) periodic maintenance of about 525 km of primary roads in
       the provinces of Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane, Sofala and Manica with a 17 percent
       contribution from IDA; (ii) rehabilitation of about 313 km of the national road N1 in
       the provinces of Maputo and Inhambane with a 23 percent contribution from IDA;
       and (iii) rural roads rehabilitation of about 412 km in the provinces of Gaza, Nampula
       and Tete with a 25 percent contribution from IDA. Routine maintenance is financed
       by the Road Fund. The component also provided resources for engineering design,
       preparation of bidding documents, and supervision of works.

      Component B–Institutional strengthening and policy reforms (appraisal cost
       US$16.9 million; actual US$18.0 million). The component would assist the
       government in the establishment of an institutional framework for the roads sector
       through the provision of technical advisory services. The project would provide
       resources for ANE and Road Fund‘s capacity building, institutional strengthening,
       raising of awareness though publications, consultations with the public, and technical
       assistance.

      Component C–Strategy and preparatory activities for further investments
       (appraisal cost US$6.8 million; actual US$ 8.0 million). This component would assist
       the government in updating the road sector strategy taking into account stakeholder
       inputs, conducting environmental, socio-economic and social impact assessments,
       and preparation of engineering designs and tender documents through the provision
       of technical advisory services. The component would also support environmental,
       socio-economic and social impact assessment of road works mechanisms for
                                                    38


           sustainable financing of biodiversity conservation, including the establishment of an
           Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment Fund33.

 3.13 The planned implementing agency was the National Road Administration. It was also
 envisaged that the Road Fund would play a significant role in channeling the funds for the
 civil works component, and in liaising with the National Road Administration on sector
 issues.

 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

 3.14 Relevance of the objectives of the overall program and of the first phase is rated
 High. The objective of the program as well as of the Phase 1 was relevant to the country‘s
 development needs in the roads sector, and was aligned with the Bank‘s 1997-2000 Country
 Assistance Strategy) at project approval, the subsequent 2000-2003 and 2003-2007 Country
 Assistance Strategies and also with the more recent 2007-2011 Country Partnership
 Strategy. At the time of the year 2000 Strategy, the Government was prioritizing the
 rehabilitation of critical infrastructure damaged by the February 2000 floods. Over the
 medium- to long-term, the key issues addressed by the Government's road program included
 incomplete road systems, limited funding for maintenance, and limited involvement of
 national contractors in road construction. An important focus was on improving the
 sustainability of road rehabilitation. The government had a transport sector reform and
 investment strategy, the 1998 Road Sector Policy, aiming at: (i) establishing a road network
 linking all provinces; (ii) providing increased rural access to markets and social services;
 and (iii) generating substantial foreign exchange earnings through the international transit
 corridors. In this regard, ANE's chief priority was to improve the main north-south highway
 (N1), while an important secondary priority was to ensure a good all-weather connection
 with each of the provincial capitals to the N1, as well as selected feeder roads. At project
 approval, the Bank‘s strategies aimed at reducing infrastructure constraints for economic
 growth by promoting country-level reforms in the road infrastructure sector; modernizing
 roads sector institutions; and improving asset management performance. During
 implementation, the First Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty was approved
 by the Cabinet in April 2001 envisaging a general expansion in internal trade, transport and
 services. Consequently, the Bank‘s 2003-2007 included infrastructure as one of the six
 priority areas identified for support, with transport and rural development highlighted.

 3.15 The purpose of the CPS, developed jointly between IDA, IFC and MIGA at the time
 of the project closure date, was to support the government in implementing its Second
 Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty,34 approved by the Cabinet in September
 2006. This CPS was timed to be in sequence with the development of the government's

33
  The PAD also refers to two additional sub-components funded by a separate US$ 5million GEF grant and
implemented by United Nations Development Program as a complement to the Bank implemented activities: (1)
Development and preparation of an integrated Conservation Strategy for the Eastern Arc Mountain Forests; and
(2) a forest conservation intervention through government and community partnership initiatives. This GEF
grant was implemented separately from the APL1 and there is no record of its progress in any internal
documents.

strategy, and to facilitate coordination and alignment among development partners' country
assistance strategies. One of the main issues addressed by this CPS was the need to increase
the proportion of the rural population with access to an all-season road, and to improve
connectivity for rural producers and communities. As such, the key elements of the project
development objective remained relevant at the time of the IEG mission.

3.16 Relevance of the project design is rated Substantial. The project was the third Bank-
financed transport project in the country after the second Road and Coastal Shipping project
completed in 2003. The design of the program and of Phase 1 was consistent with the
objectives to be achieved, and the results framework was appropriate. The design of
Component A (Roads and Bridges) was relevant to address the project objectives of greater
access, since improved road conditions were likely to extend such access. The design of
Component B (Institutional Strengthening and Policy Reform) was relevant but it is not clear
how the outcome of achieving reform and stronger capacity was to be achieved, as it
primarily consisted of studies or hiring of consultants. The design of Component C (Strategy
and Preparatory Activities for future projects) was less conducive to meeting the objectives.
It primarily consisted of studies for the preparation of Phase 2 of the Program and revisions
to the existing integrated roads sector strategy in preparation for Phase 2 investments. The
Mozambique road sector was indeed suitable for an Adaptable Program Loan lending
instrument, due to the complex reform programs envisaged with long gestation periods. The
program was well grounded on the Bank country strategy and aligned with government
policies and institutional priorities over time. Triggers were defined for the program to move
from one phase to the next.

MONITORING & EVALUATION DESIGN

3.17 The project did not include outcome indicators, except for the decrease in number and
severity of accidents per vehicle, which was the outcome indicator for improved road safety,
and kilometers of roads in good or fair condition. Output indicators were included to
measure improved road coverage and quality, such as size of the maintainable network,
kilometers of roads under periodic maintenance, and kilometers rehabilitated. The project
also included output indicators of improved road sector policies and management, such as
implementation of institutional reforms intended to improve roads management; installation
of new financial management systems at ANE and the Road Fund, and periodic transfer of
required amounts to the Road Fund. Project management performance indicators were used
as proxies for intermediate outcome indicators concerning improved management and
included time for tendering, contracting road works and payment to contractors; the
percentage of works completed on time and within budget.

3.18 Overall, the project objectives were not outcome oriented. The indicators reflected
the objectives to some extent, but they focused on outputs rather than outcomes. There is no
evidence of incorporation of baselines in the M&E design. Kilometers of roads in good and
fair condition were provided, as well as the targets for each year during project
implementation; the percentage of roads in fair and good condition was not included. Road
Fund revenues from different sources as well as road maintenance user fees were included as
indicators with targets, whereas percentage of financing provided by the Road Fund (out of
                                              40


total financing required by the sector) would have measured the outcome intended. Overall,
the M&E framework appears to have been designed around activities rather than objectives

Implementation
3.19 Significant delays during implementation resulted in slow disbursements. There
were significant project approval, project effectiveness and initial implementation delays.
The project was approved on July 19, 2001 and the DCA was signed on September 21, 2001.
Following a request by the government, the deadline for effectiveness was extended,
originally to March 21, 2002, and later to June 4, 2002, when the project was made effective.
There was a nine month period between project approval and effectiveness, because
conditions of effectiveness took longer than expected to be met, including the formalization
of the subsidiary agreement between the government and ANE. There were also delays in
the preparation of engineering designs and bidding documents, and in the award of contracts.
Only in 2004 did contracts for five engineering consultancies get awarded for civil works
projects on five rural roads. Similarly, although ANE had signed consultancy services
contracts for 9 packages (5 for rehabilitation and 4 for periodic maintenance on N1)
comprising preparation of detailed design and tender documents financed by the previous
Bank project, the first bids were expected to be launched by June 15, 2003, and all works
were expected to start by January 2004, eighteen months before planned project closure.
Hence, there were almost no disbursements for close to two years during project
implementation. IEG interviews point to procurement procedures and clearance of all
contracts by a procurement board, as the single most important cause of delays with little
value added. By May 2004, according to mission documents, the total amount disbursed or
in the disbursement pipeline (i.e. already submitted to the Bank) was US$ 20 million or 11
percent of the total amount of the Credit.

3.20 The project period was extended twice by a total of two years, and there were some
changes in the scope of the project. The project closing date was extended twice from June
30, 2005 to December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2007 due to delays in project effectiveness and
implementation, and due to some change in scope. The first extension was granted to
undertake procurement activities and obtain MoPF approvals before contract signatures. The
second extension for six months was to complete some final tasks before project closure.
There were considerable delays in the procurement of civil engineering works and
consultancy services.

3.21 Project activities were completed at significantly higher than expected costs.
Successful bids for the eight IDA-financed projects along the N1 were respectively 54
percent above the original estimates for rehabilitation and 135 percent for periodic
maintenance. The higher cost of the project was mostly attributable to higher-than-expected
civil works costs in part due to changes in market conditions and delays in implementation.
Despite the fact that IDA funding increased from US$162 million to US$187 million due to
the devaluation of the US Dollar relative to the SDR, the cost increases and delays had too
high an impact and the project was not able to finance the original number of kilometers
estimated at appraisal. Cost increases were due to the rise in the price in oil which impacted
the cost of diesel and bitumen. ANE‘s Midterm Review report indicated that this increase in
cost would have been avoided if due attention had been paid to the commercial environment
                                              41


at the time of project appraisal. In particular, there were increases in costs of fuel,
construction material (cement, steel, and asphalt), equipment, and spare parts which,
compared to the appraisal estimates, resulted in higher bid prices. Time extensions also
varied between 20 and 150 percent of contractual time schedules.

3.22 Project focus changed from maintenance to rehabilitation during implementation.
No changes were made in the project design, objectives and components, but changes were
effected to the project implementation schedules, the scope of works and implementation
arrangements. The most important of these was an increase from 313 km to 456 km for
rehabilitation of primary roads and a reduction from 525 km to 295 km for periodic
maintenance. Delays meant that the primary roads had deteriorated further than had been
anticipated. As a result of the delays and cost overruns, ANE‘s annual plans were based on
those contained in the Project Implementation Plan and interventions focused mostly on
rehabilitation rather than periodic maintenance. The rehabilitation of the rural roads was cut
back from 412 km to 76 km due to the shortage of funds. Actual civil works amounted to
US$ 28.21 million against US$ 19.66 million in the PAD, due to road deterioration from
2000 until 2004.

3.23     During the three phases of program implementation, it was intended that the Bank
would gradually shift its support from periodic maintenance to rehabilitation, as the Road
Fund‘s finances improved and it took over full responsibility for periodic maintenance. By
the end of Phase 3 of the program, the Road Fund is supposed to cover 100 percent of
periodic maintenance in addition to routine maintenance. However, the shift that took place
during this project was not the reflection of this gradual shift taking place, but rather an
unintended consequence of delays in project implementation.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS POLICIES

3.24 The project was classified as Category ―A‖ under the Bank‘s framework for
environmental and social safeguards, which triggered the Bank‘s Environmental Assessment
and Involuntary Resettlement policies. An Environmental Impact Assessment was prepared
and disclosed to the public as required. Environmental and social issues identified were
minor, as none of the works were located in environmentally sensitive areas or thought to
involve resettlement issues or an impact on minorities. The spread of HIV/AIDS among
workers and people living near project roads was identified as a potential side effect of the
works and of improved transportation along the road corridors. Measures to prevent the
spread of HIV/AIDS were identified.

3.25 The project paid due attention to environmental management during planning and
implementation. Good practices were followed for public involvement and consultation.
The government showed commitment to implementing environmental and social safeguard
policies by setting up in 2000 a Social and Environmental Unit - Unidade de Assuntos
Sociais e meio Ambiente) in ANE which reported directly to the Director General. The unit
conducted supervision and monitoring of safeguard measures for all contracts under the
project. Monitoring reports indicate that supervision was undertaken regularly over the
lifespan of the project. Overall, the unit worked well in implementing environmental and
social safeguard policies during the project and this continues in the Phase 2 of the Program.
                                                42


3.26 Environmental Safeguards. Overall, environmental safeguard policies were
implemented in a satisfactory manner, but capacity building activities to strengthen social
and environmental management aspects were undertaken too late to benefit the project. A
variety of actual and potential environmental impacts were handled effectively. The project
sponsored an environmental specialist to address: design, contractual documentation,
implementation, and completion. This arrangement enabled the enforcement of agreed
measures and coordination with Bank missions on safeguards issues. Two external
consultants were engaged to monitor the Environmental Management Plans since 2004.
Environmental inspection checklists were used for each of the site visits and reports were
prepared. Internal documents note that staff from the Social and Environmental Unit also
undertook site visits to ensure the quality of the consultant‘s work, but these visits (as well as
those by the consultants themselves) were less frequent than required due to the shortage of
funds, and as a result there was an over-reliance on consultants for supervision of
environmental safeguards.

3.27 An environmental training course comprising eleven modules was developed to
strengthen ANE engineers‘ capabilities to better manage, assess, monitor and control the
environmental impacts linked to road maintenance, rehabilitation and construction. The
training course preparation started in mid-2003, and the unit environmental specialist, who
was sponsored by the project, delivered the first two modules in October 2003 half way
through project implementation. Expert consultants delivered some specialized modules thus
enriching the training course.

3.28 Social Safeguards. At the time of project approval, it was believed that road
maintenance or rehabilitation would entail no land acquisition or resettlement. However, the
project affected over 1,300 land parcels within or near the right of way, including several
houses and businesses (mostly in Maputo City) and areas for borrow pits, construction
camps, and drainage. This property acquisition followed government procedures as
interpreted by the ANE, and was done without World Bank knowledge or approval until late
2005. To acquire these areas, the ANE regional representative depended on the construction
companies to inventory land and assets to be acquired, value the losses according to the
provincial ministry of agriculture unit price lists, negotiate with the owners, and make
payments, which were subsequently reimbursed by ANE. The Bank‘s concerns related to: (i)
the completeness of the asset inventory; (ii) the adequacy of valuation rates and procedures,
as well as of other assistance; and (iii) effective delegation of responsibility for the asset
inventory and valuation, as well as compensation from ANE to the construction companies.
A Bank mission undertook a resettlement audit to determine the extent and nature of land
acquisition and resettlement. The Bank advised ANE to seek some way to offset any
hardships caused by providing some benefits to the communities as a whole, in addition to
individual families, to compensate for any inadequate land acquisition that may have
occurred. A socioeconomic study completed in 2001 and a socioeconomic study for 14 roads
(N1 and rural roads) undertaken in 2006 provided insight into the needs of various
communities. The IEG mission was not able to find records of this additional compensation
being awarded, but in interviews with ANE, it was maintained that there were no unresolved
issues from this relocation.
                                              43


3.29 The project continued the HIV/AIDS prevention activities initiated by the Second
Roads and Coastal Shipping Project, which was among the first Bank supported projects in
Africa to include activities to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. The project funded a
HIV/AIDS specialist in designing HIV/AIDS prevention strategies, and introducing clauses
in civil works contracts to involve Non-Governmental Organizations in organizing awareness
campaigns, and distribution of condoms at work sites. ANE included in all road contracts
social requirements according to which, the contractor was required to sub-contract a non-
governmental organization or individual to implement the HIV/AIDS activities for road
workers and communities along the road side influence zone. The implementation of the
activities suffered from several constraints including: (i) absence of resident HIV/AIDS
coordinator for each road contract; (ii) small budget to implement the activities; (iii) lack of
M&E system; (iv) inadequate coordination by the Non-Governmental Organizations with
local authorities, community leaders, and ANE; and (v) no links to national HIV/AIDS
initiatives. The IEG mission attempted to obtain historical statistics from multiple sources
reflecting behavioral changes, such as number of partners or condom use, which would
indicate the success of prevention activities along the sections of the N1 supported by the
project. No statistics are available targeting areas of influence of the roads projects thus it
was not possible to isolate the impact of the project activities on HIV/AIDS risk behaviors.
The most recent statistics on HIV/ AIDS available are based on the national survey on
prevalence, behavioral risks and information about HIV/AIDS carried out in 2009, which
reports on HIV prevalence per age group, gender, residence (rural against urban) and regions
(provinces), conducted by the Ministry of Health, through the National Health Institute, and
the National Statistics Institute. But there is no historical trend information on behavioral
risk. Overall, handling of environmental and social safeguard issues have all improved,
according to Bank specialists, in comparison to the previous project.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

3.30 Financial management was implemented expeditiously but staffing constraints in
ANE hindered the proper implementation of the project manual and payment delays
occurred. ANE was familiar with the Bank's financial reporting, accounting and auditing
requirements from its experience with the Second Roads and Coastal Shipping Project.
Therefore, compliance with project requirements was done expeditiously. By July 2002 the
Financial Management Manual had been approved by the Bank, the installation of the
financial management software at ANE was complete and the Financial Management System
was fully operational. The project relied on computerized Project Financial Management
System capable of providing timely and reliable information to monitor progress in achieving
the Project objectives. Despite the effective use of this system, the underlying financial
management and accounting functions had some constraints in staffing for processing
invoices, and as a result, significant delays were observed with respect to payments by ANE.

3.31 ANE recruited the external auditors for the fiscal years 2003 and 2004, for the annual
audits of the project accounts, the annual audits (financial and technical) of the Road Fund
accounts, and the interim financial situation of the Road Fund (including an interim technical
audit). In 2004, the audit of ANE found no internal audit arrangements, no established audit
committee, and no manual for accounting policies and practices applicable to the whole
organization. Respondents mentioned concern with the low quality of the audit reports and
                                              44


the fact that donor funded programs are heavily reliant on these reports for ensuring financial
control and promoting management improvements in the implementing agencies. The
project manual only applied to the project funds and accounts. ANE understood the
importance of institutionalizing proper accounting policies and procedures and agreed to
mainstream the project manual for use across the entire organization. IEG interviews at the
time of the mission and review of project documentation confirmed this was not achieved by
project closure or by the time of the mission.

3.32 Procurement was carried out in an efficient manner but delays occurred due to the
time it took to obtain government clearances. The Bank carried out the first post-
procurement review of the Credit in May 2004. Since the project became effective, ANE had
signed 40 contracts in an amount of US$131.1 million (IDA financed US$103.9 million).
IDA carried out a prior review and provided no objection for 31 contracts in an amount of
US$129.8 million (IDA financed US$102.8 million). A post-procurement review was carried
out for 4 contracts (1 civil works, 1 goods, and 2 consulting services) in an amount of
US$0.408 million, (IDA financed US$0.348 million), constituting about 45 percent of
eligible contracts and 32 percent of the value of eligible contracts. This review found some
discrepancies with Bank agreed procedures as follows: (i) the threshold for civil works in the
Bank‘s prior procurement review, given in the DCA, was US$ 300,000 as the value of
contract. However, the ANE considered it as the amount of IDA contribution (contract value
of US$300,000 +10 percent). Therefore, the value of the civil works contract reviewed by
the Bank was actually higher than specified in appraisal documents - US$ 349,678 and IDA
financing U$279,742; (ii) the definition of the emergency works was not clear and ANE was
following other procurement procedures, different from the ones specified at appraisal for the
emergency flood which occurred in 2000; works were completed only in March 2004; and
(iii) full procurement procedures were not followed in terms of short listing of consultants
and announcement of bids for civil works.

3.33 Overall, there have been significant improvements in financial management, auditing
and procurement, and the Bank played a strong role in supporting the Borrower in these
areas. Due to a shortage of technical and financial management staff in the country, the
capacity in this area could not be adequately strengthened.

Achievement of the Objectives
IMPROVING THE COVERAGE AND CONDITIONS OF ROADS AND BRIDGES

3.34 Outputs. At the end of the project the intermediate outcome indicators used to
measure kilometers of improved roads were met to a great extent. The project supported the
completion of 14,888 km of routine and periodic maintenance out of 15,900 km planned. It
also supported the completion of 456 km of rehabilitation of primary road (N1) and 76 km of
rural roads in Nampula province. Emergency repair works were undertaken in Nampula,
Zambézia and Inhambane provinces due to floods. Due to the late project start on N1,
periodic maintenance decreased and rehabilitation increased by 145 percent from 313 km to
456 km. Budget limitations prevented more rural roads rehabilitation, thus the original target
of 412 km was not met and only 18 percent was achieved.
                                                   45


3.35 To ensure sustainability in the roads sector, the Phase 1 of the Program placed
emphasis only on urgent periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of the classified road
network. The large investments needed were left for Phase 2 of the Program and later
operations. The project recognized the need to give more importance to connecting
agriculturally productive areas through extending the rehabilitation to rural roads, and
building capacity through appropriate technical assistance and training programs. The EIG
mission travelled the first 80 kilometers of the N1. This road remains in good condition and
there was evidence of routine and periodic maintenance being performed. Some poor
drainage was visible on selected spots, but some relatively straightforward corrective action
would resolve that issue easily.

3.36 Outcomes. Overall, there have been substantial improvements in coverage and
quality of roads in Mozambique. At ICR, 46 percent of the network roads were in good or
fair condition, against a target of 40 percent and 36 percent at appraisal in 2001. However,
project spending was higher than anticipated (US$70 million against US$43.4 million). The
share of classified roads in good and fair condition was 71 percent in 2009. The percentage
of the rural population that has reliable, all-year access (as measured by the percent of the
rural population within two kilometers of an all-season classified road) was 31.3 percent in
2011.

3.37 Based on the above, the outcome from the project‘s efforts in improving the coverage
and quality of roads and bridges is rated Substantial.

STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY TO MANAGE AND ADMINISTER THE ROAD
SECTOR

3.38 Outputs. The institutional reforms achieved with the support of the project are: (i)
separating the execution and funding functions; and (ii) establishing a second generation
Road Fund. The outputs included the establishment of a Road Agency (The National Road
Agency - ANE) and a separate Road Fund as an autonomous legal entity governed by a
Board of Directors with representation from the private sector with increasing commitment
by the government to road maintenance financing. The institutional modifications envisaged
in the Project Implementation Plan were implemented on or ahead of schedule. On the
institutional and policy side, the Government issued four decrees on May 20, 2003 that
covered important developments in the management of the roads sector.35

3.39 With the desired sector structure in place, the project supported enhancements for
sector performance, planning, management and execution. The workshop on Road Sector
and the Updated Road Sector Strategy was held on February 14-16, 2006, and was attended

35
  The first decree number 20/2003 included regulations of the institutional and financial framework within
which the roads sector operates. The second decree number 21/2003 created an inter-ministerial Road
Commission comprising of Ministry of Public works and Housing, Ministry of Planning and Finance, Ministry
of Transport and Communication, and Ministry of Local Government. The third decree number 22/2003 created
the Road Fund as an autonomous agency. The fourth decree number 23/2003 simplified the regulations and
organizational structure of the National Road Agency (ANE), which was already an autonomous agency. Now
the ANE and Road Fund have separate boards appointed on December 1, 2003, which is an important
development for the operation and financing of the roads sector.
                                                    46


by Provincial Governors and other road sector stakeholders such as the Road Fund, ANE, the
Road Agencies, the Donor Community, Provincial Directors of Works and Housing, ANE
delegates, consultants and contractors. ANE presented the revised road sector strategy in
terms of prioritized investment program, financial plan, long term planning issues, road
sector management issues and an appropriate monitoring and evaluation system.36 The
revised strategy placed emphasis on all critical issues: building institutional capacity at
headquarters and provinces, providing adequate maintenance of the road network, enhancing
riding quality of the unpaved road network, improving road safety, enforcing axle load
control, and prioritizing road rehabilitation and upgrading program. The workshop also
provided an opportunity to discuss modalities for the transition from the present to the
planned future organizational set up, and the interim finding of all on-going technical studies.
Indeed, in light of the consolidation of road sector responsibilities for the entire country in
ANE, due to which ANE‘s responsibility increased from 12,860 km to 29,349 km, the
definition of policies and a road act for the planning and management of unclassified roads
and new roads, as well as definition of roles for provincial staff and independent engineer
was required. The later consolidation was initiated and by project closure in 2007, ANE was
undergoing the required restructuring but not directly supported with project funds.

3.40 The project‘s mid-term review, which was attended by about 200 stakeholders,
provided a venue to discuss management and execution aspects of the sector. Numerous
proposals were made to enhance the execution of works. Of particular importance was the
need to streamline the government approvals from the MoPWH and the MoPF required
before ANE was to sign any contract. Another such venue was the donor coordination
meeting held on May 31, 2004, attended by 18 donors to the sector where it was agreed that
harmonization was required to improve the performance of the sector, but there was no
agreement on how this was to be achieved.

3.41 A combination of technical assistance approaches were supported under the project.
On one hand, consulting companies were recruited to support the government in: (i) updating
the road sector strategy; (ii) institutional strengthening and management; (iii) implementation
of a document management system; (iv) implementation of a highway network management
system;37 (v) development of road design standards and technical specifications using local
materials; and (vi) assessment of heavy vehicle overload control. On the other hand,
individual consultants were recruited to perform on-the-job training. While most of the
consulting firms delivered on the agreed outputs, the individual consultants tended to execute
line functions rather than conducting on-the-job training. Indeed, soon after project
effectiveness, recruitment for specialists in the areas of pavements, materials engineering,
bridges, contract management, training, procurement, and road maintenance was underway
through a management firm. Individual consultants were also supported under the previous
project, so this was an arrangement that ANE was familiar with and wished to continue. In

36
  The size of the five-year investment program is US$1,140 million with financing plan US$352 million from
the Road Fund, US$60 million from the Government of Mozambique, and US$728 million from the
development partners.
37
  The highway management system was supposed to be renewed under the project but this did not materialize.
The Bank also supported technical assistance initiatives such as the Road Economic decision Model (RED)
training delivered by Bank staff to ANE in 2005.
                                                     47


December 2003, ANE undertook an evaluation of this type of assistance, including a
systematic evaluation of technical assistance performance and its effectiveness in transferring
skills to Mozambican staff, quarterly reporting by technical assistance activities, and an
evaluation of the needs. The intention was not to extend or reappoint individual consultants
unless performance was high. The evaluation concluded that assignation of full-time client
counterparts to technical assistance consultancies delivered better results, and that use of
technical assistance staff to fill line positions was expensive and inefficient. Since then, there
appears to have been more selectivity on the use of this type of assistance and on the roles
and profiles of individual consultants.

3.42 Overall, sector policies are increasingly reflecting the participation of the private
sector. Road sector management has the adequate functional structure and separation
required for sustainability of the sector. ANE has retained qualified and experienced staff.

3.43 Outcomes. The ability of the sector agencies to manage the sector has also been
improved and placed on a strong footing. Continuous support to capacity building and
institutional reform has resulted in a government agency, ANE, with good management
capacity, and with adequate road management systems being implemented. The Road Fund
was strengthened to better forecast funding needs, managing revenues, coordinating and
auditing road sector budgets and expenditures, and ensuring transparency and accountability
in its operations. Given that the sector enjoyed the support of many donors in a fragmented
way, the question of attribution is difficult to answer.

3.44 Based on the above, particularly due to the achievements regarding institutional
framework and sector policy, the outcome from the project‘s efforts in strengthening ANE‘s
institutional capacity to manage and administer the road sector is rated Substantial.

PROVIDING ADEQUATE ROAD MAINTENANCE FINANCING

3.45 Outputs. Total road sector expenditures between 2001 and 2006 were about US$700
million or on average US$140 million per annum including both capital and recurrent costs.
The Road Fund fuel levy fee reached US cents 10.4 by 2006 against a planned fee of US
cents 11.8 and an original fee of US cents 5.9 in 2002. However, although fees were lower,
total revenues from road maintenance fee were higher and amounted to US$57 million in
2006 versus a planned US$ 55 million and an original amount of US$35 million in 2002. In
addition, the Road Fund received regularized budget transfers from the government. Total
government transfers for maintenance amounted to US$31 million in 2006. As a result, total
revenues amounted to US$88 million in 2006 versus a planned US$ 60 million and an
original amount of US$38 million in 2002. Overall, while total revenues were just under the
expected target for 2002 and 2003, the government met the target in 2004 and provided more
than 50 percent above the target in 2005. This trend continued in 2006 at the time project
closure.38 By 2011, the country was in line to meet its target of 77 percent of roads in good

38
  Agreed levels in terms of annual equivalent Meticais amounts transferred by the government to the RF:
2002 ......US$ 40 million (received: US$38.3 million)
2003 ......US$ 45 million (received: US$37.5 million)
2004 ......US$ 50 million (received: US$55.9 million)
2005 ......US$ 55 million (received: US$88.7 million)
                                                   48


and fair condition as a share of total classified roads. By 2009, total revenues amounted to
US$148 million versus US$132 million planned and in 2010 the MoPF authorized the Road
Fund to obtain commercial domestic financing to cover the deficit on certain projects and to
avoid delays in completion of civil works (ARMFA 2010).

3.46 A Fuel levy is rarely sufficient to cover maintenance needs, thus negotiating high
priority for the roads sector in the government‘s overall budget can ensure that the remaining
required funds flow to the Road Fund. This was achieved by the project. Furthermore, by
2004, the mechanism by which funds were transferred to the Road Fund was changed, so that
fuel levies were no longer transferred to the Road Fund through the government budget, but
rather through a designated MPF bank account and then directly to the Road Fund. Only
GOM counterpart funds and payments for IVA were transferred to the Road Fund from the
government budget.

3.47 The government took advantage of the user consultations during the road sector
strategy update to raise awareness about road maintenance costs and its funding challenges.
As a result of the strong media coverage and communication campaigns, there was no social
unrest about implementation of the fuel levy. However, increases in oil prices politically
restricted the scope for further increase in the fuel levy, and may have had a negative impact
on fuel sales. There was no mechanism to guarantee automatic increases in the levy, as such
increases required MoPF‘s approval. At the time of project closure, there was a risk that the
government would not approve the increase in road user charges. The government attempted
to mitigate this risk by fixing the fuel levy in equivalent US currency. However, the effort to
fix the fuel levy as a percentage of the fuel price did not bear fruit by ICR or to date. The
government has retained the fuel levy as a fixed amount and not as a percentage, and the
fixed amount has not been increased. Due to the recent appreciation of the Metical, the
average levy is about 11-12 cents of US dollars.

3.48 Outcomes. The Road fund allocates the funds collected from the user charges for
maintenance of municipal roads (10 percent), district roads (10 percent) and national network
managed by ANE (80 percent). These funds however do not fully cover the needs of routine
maintenance. Thus, to date, the Road Fund has not been able to allocate significant funds for
periodic maintenance. In fact, in the past few years, no substantial periodic maintenance
programs have been implemented. The share of total maintenance funded by the Road Fund
over 2007-2011 was 31 percent compared to 34 percent during 2005-2006. Of this share,
periodic maintenance is currently low at about 7-10 percent compared to 30-40 percent in
2001 because roads are in better condition today. The ratio between rehabilitation and
maintenance since 2007 is 0.73 because there is much greater expenditure on rehabilitation
than maintenance. Adequate maintenance funds, both on budget or through a Road Fund
mechanism, may potentially remove constraints and further enhance the development of a
competitive road construction industry and a sustainable roads sector.

                                              49


3.49 Based on the significant achievements above, but given that the Road Fund income is
still insufficient, the outcome from the project‘s efforts in providing adequate road
maintenance financing is rated Substantial.

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING ROAD MAINTENANCE UNIT COSTS BY PROMOTING THE USE OF
LOCAL RESOURCES IN ROADS CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT

3.50 Outputs. The project supported both the use of local contractors and the use of local
materials in continuation of the support provided under the Second Roads and Coastal
Shipping Project- To continue this support to the local construction industry, ANE held
meetings in 2004 with representatives of the local construction industry (Mozambican
Contractors Association (EMPREMO), Provincial State Enterprises for Construction and
Maintenance of Roads or Empresas de Construqiio e de Manutenqiio de Estradas e Pontes,
and the company called Construcao e Servicos. ANE considered contracting a consultancy
to review the status of local contractors and to develop a strategy and action plan for
contractor development works under the project. The consultant would identify the
constraints faced by the sector including: training needs, access to capital and credit,
availability of heavy equipment, management constraints, and an evaluation of the impacts of
ANE‘s own practices on local contractors (procurement procedures, payments regimes, etc,).
Through the project, the contractors were trained on several aspects. However, by Mid-Term
Review, only 29 percent of contracts were executed on time and only 50 percent on budget.39
In 2005, the MoPWH undertook a nationwide consultation program with contractors and
materials producers from the construction sector, with the objective of identifying problems
and developing an initial growth strategy for the private sector. One of the key elements of
the draft strategy document produced by ministry was the creation of and support for
provincial contractors‘ associations, with a confederation at national level.

3.51 The project also continued the development of local road designs and standards that
would utilize materials available locally. The Bank encouraged the development of local road
designs and standards that would utilize local materials available and would reduce the
construction costs. It was intended to proactively look for solutions to the high bidding costs
received for the works financed by the project. However, besides completion of the research,
IEG found no evidence that the results of the research were being implemented. Given the
long engagement in this regard, it was known at the time of project preparation that, although
much required to reduce the cost of civil works, enabling the use of local resources was not
going to gain much importance.

3.52 Outcomes. The project objectives do not state what are the outcomes expected from
promoting the use of local resources in road construction and management. Given that ―the
program aims at significantly reducing road maintenance unit costs through adaptation of
advance technologies to Mozambican conditions. A variety of road construction materials
will be tested for durability, ease of adaptation and overall cost-effectiveness‖ (PAD pg 19),
a reduction in road maintenance unit costs is the outcome evaluated in this review. Not only
there was no reduction, but almost all civil works contracts supported by the project suffered
time and cost overruns. The technical assistance awarded by the Public-Private Infrastructure

39
     The ICR has no data in this area.
                                              50


Advisory Facility to ANE to carry out a pilot project on performance-based management and
maintenance of roads, to mitigate the risk of time and cost overrun, was unrelated to the
project.

3.53 Based on the above, the outcome from the project‘s efforts in reducing road
maintenance unit costs is rated negligible.

IMPROVING ROAD TRANSPORT SAFETY

3.54 Outputs. By design, the project supported road safety activities concerning physical
measures such as pedestrian crossings, rumble strips, signs, road markings and construction
of vehicle inspection centers. A Working Group on Road Safety including staff from ANE,
National the Traffic Institute or Instituto Nacional de Viação, and the MoTC spearheaded this
initiative. The Working Group proposed to incorporate a road safety program management
component into the road safety audit supported by Phase 1. By Mid-Term review, Bank
documents reported some other activities such as Road Safety Audits, training and
information programs and the implementation and management of a comprehensive Road
Safety Strategy and Action Plan. Moreover, a $2.5 million computerized equipment to issue
credit-card type driver‘s licenses was purchased under the project, but the licenses were not
issued in time before project closure; however, they were issued under the Phase 2 of the
Program. As of the Road Safety Strategy and Action Plan, a consultant was hired to update it
and produce a Safety Audit report. This consultant was engaged to assist ANE in the detailed
planning and implementation of the road safety program including: road safety signs and
civil works, the development and implementation of an accident statistics system, the
establishment of driving testing centers, and construction of vehicle inspection centers. Two
activities which were not explicitly part of the Project Implementation Plan, but which the
GOM considered to be essential to the road safety program, were the computerization of
vehicle and drivers license registration.

3.55 The Directorate of Planning at MoTC managed the process for the development of a
road safety policy and strategy. The Bank agreed that for that purpose, a facilitator would be
employed to drive the process under the Director‘s supervision and a consultant would be
deployed to monitor and implement road safety measures on the Maputo to Maxixe section
of the N1 with a length of 362 kilometers. In practice, the road safety measures that were
implemented on the N1were part of civil works contracts under the purview of ANE, as a
way to mitigate poor road design from a safety point of view and to deal with speeding along
the road. Road safety measures identified by the road safety technical assistance through
road safety audits were not implemented by project closure, because the assistance was
engaged at a very late stage of the project. Therefore, besides the markings on a section of
the N1, the Phase 1 of the Program was able to achieve the installation of a system for secure
driving licenses to be issued. A consultant proposed a two-year period for monitoring road
accident information, but there is no evidence that this was implemented.

3.56 Outcomes. As most of the institutional measures that would have affected road
safety were not implemented, any changes in traffic fatalities would have a low attribution to
the project. However, the road improvements along the N1 probably did have a safety
impact. The provinces of Maputo, Gaza, and Inhambane, where the Maputo-Maxixe section
                                               51


of the N1 road is located show mixed results, as total accidents and fatal accidents increased
in all three provinces during 2003-07, but fatalities per accident decreased in Inhambane and
stayed constant in Gaza. Since then, accidents have declined in all three provinces, while
fatal accidents have risen.. The IEG mission attempted to find research studies of where
these accidents occur in each province, but that exercise also proved futile. Controlling for
the number of vehicles in circulation shows an increase in accidents per vehicles in
Inhambane and a decrease in Maputo and Gaza during the project. Since then, accident rates
have declined in Inhambane as well

3.57 Based on the above, the outcome from the project‘s efforts in improving road
transport safety is rated modest.

Table 6: Road Accident Data per Province




Efficiency
3.58 The efficiency of the project in meeting its objectives is rated Modest. The ERR for
all road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works was estimated at appraisal at 22.5
percent, with a Net Present Value of $174 million, while the revised ERR at the completion
of the project was 22 percent, with a Net Present Value of $163 million. Overall, the
economic analysis carried out at project completion used assumptions similar to that at
project appraisal. The high ERR at project completion was due to the substantial increase in
traffic on the N1, despite the increase in construction costs. The benefits from the
institutional strengthening component were difficult to quantify, and hence were not included
in the economic evaluation of the project at either appraisal or completion. However, given
that important institutional strengthening and capacity building was achieved under the
project at relatively modest costs, benefits of these initiatives quite likely surpassed the costs
and would be reflected in a higher ERR that the one calculated at ICR.

3.59 The delay in implementation resulted in substituting more expensive rehabilitation for
road maintenance, reducing efficiency in the use of project funds; it costs the government
many times more to rehabilitate a kilometer of road that if the proper maintenance was
provided on time. A high number of kilometers of roads remained in poor maintenance
condition due to this, with negative implications for vehicle operating costs and travel times.
Some of the softer sub-components, such as road safety, and local resources were given
superficial attention to the point that there was no accountability for the outcomes the project
funds were intended to contribute to. Yet, the funds were nevertheless spent with no attempt
to measure at ICR the outcomes achieved. It also took two years longer than planned to
implement the project.

Ratings
OUTCOME

3.60 Overall outcome of the Project is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The project
development objective was appropriate to the needs of Mozambique‘s roads sector. The
project design was robust and realistic in taking into account the government‘s commitment
to the project. The project‘s physical targets were mostly achieved – albeit two years late
and with more emphasis on rehabilitation rather than maintenance. There was tangible
progress on most sector policy and sector reform measures and the stage was set for further
improvements and strengthening to be supported under the proposed Phase 2 of the Program.
In particular, revenues to the Road Fund were met and since 2005 surpassed the agreed
levels. Less progress was made on institutional strengthening and capacity building, a
persistent concern for ANE during the years of project implementation. Delays and low
accountability for the expenditures on road safety and local resources affected the project‘s
efficiency. Based on high relevance of objectives, substantial relevance of design,
substantial efficacy of the three most important project objectives, modest or negligible
efficacy of the remaining two project objectives, and modest efficiency, the overall outcome
of the project is rated moderately satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

3.61 The risk to development outcome is rated Moderate. As of 2011, 73 percent of
roads are in good and fair condition as a share of total classified roads. This represents an
important increase since project closure in 2007 when the recorded figure was 64 percent.
The rural population with access to an all season40 road has increased to 32 percent in 2011
from 30 percent in 2007. Cargo continues to move primarily by road, despite it being more
expensive than rail (US$0.13 against US$0.10 per ton-km) (USAID 2008).

3.62 The Bank contributed to the implementation of some key policy and institutional
reforms of the roads sector, but even today only 50 percent of road maintenance needs in the
country are being financed. Maintaining the rapidly expanding road network is a hurdle to
overcome, as the size of the network is larger than the country‘s capacity to provide funds for
its maintenance. The government road program to 2014 is unlikely to receive the funding
required to achieve the US$2.7 billion investment envisaged.

3.63 One of the most important measures supported by the long-term and continuous Bank
and other donors‘ engagement in the roads sector was the development of an Integrated Road
Sector Program; 5-year strategy along with a 3-year implementation program (PRISE -
Programa Integrado de Sector de Estratas) estimated at US$1.043 million in 2007, that was
linked back to the approved 2001-2010 road sector strategy. It was originally intended to
finance a large portion of Integrated Road Sector Program through sector budget support for
health, education and roads sectors with the contributions from a total of nineteen donors
through the Phase 2. The Integrated Road Sector Program was designed to be a single rolling

rural population within two kilometers of an all-season classified road).
                                              53


program for the roads sector to be followed by all donors with common technical and
fiduciary reporting requirements. Since the co-financing proved unworkable as envisaged in
Phase 2, the sector continues to rely on the strategy and on the Integrated Road Sector
Program as tools for sector management and planning. Several donors from the United
Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and Italy have exited the sector mostly due to the global
economic conditions affecting their home economies and the National Road Agency (ANE)
may revert back to the fragmented model of individual donor/aid financing, although a single
sector strategy and investment plan is currently followed. Lower donor funding may pose
some risk to the sustainability of the sector.

BANK PERFORMANCE

Quality at Entry

3.64 The quality at entry for the project is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank's
performance at the identification and preparation stages contributed to the government's
proactive project preparation activities at entry. The Bank's team undertook detailed project
preparation and had constructive policy dialogue with the government to address the most
critical areas of institutional reform in the roads sector. During project preparation there was
widespread consultation. The project benefited from a Quality Enhancement Review in 2000
which was in general terms satisfied with the project design, and built upon prior experiences
including lessons learned from the two earlier projects. These lessons facilitated: (i) precise
definition and scheduling of works during project preparation; (ii) policy and institutional
reforms undertaken prior to major investments in works; (iii) participatory approach to reflect
changing priorities in strategy updates; (iv) appropriate financial management systems
established to guarantee accountability and transparency; (v) strengthened procurement
capacity; and (v) the use of local contractors as capacity is built. Of these lessons, perhaps
the one embedded the most in the project design was the use of a participatory approach to
continuously reflect changing priorities in strategy updates. The project had a flexible
overall design, phased investment plans and annual project reviews to ensure acceptable
outputs even under a weak institutional environment and in a post-conflict situation where
reconstruction needs are great. This was adequate for a post-conflict country still facing
transition issues and where priorities often changed.

3.65 Given that there was a long standing and well established relationship between the
client and the Bank, and that there was a Bank project under implementation at the time of
project preparation, the Bank and ANE proactively utilized project funds at the time to
finance the preparation of some activities under this project and increase the degree of
readiness for implementation. ANE had signed consultancy services contracts for 9 packages
(5 for rehabilitation and 4 for periodic maintenance on N1) comprising preparation of
detailed design and tender documents financed by the previous Bank project. But it was not
until late 2003 and 2004 those contracts got awarded. Similarly, five engineering
consultancies for detailed design, tender documents, and supervision of five rural road civil
works projects were awarded in 2004. This was eighteen months before original project
closure. Due to this delay, the preparation of the civil works component was less than
satisfactory. The preparation of the institutional strengthening component was well handled,
but it is questionable whether the road safety and the local resources components were
                                              54


properly prepared. Given that this was not the Bank's first road sector project in
Mozambique, and that the client had access to project preparation funds, timelier project
preparation and more upfront dialogue with MoTC regarding road safety was expected.

Quality of Supervision

3.66 The Bank’s quality of supervision during the project is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. The Bank‘s supervision missions were carried out at regular and frequent
intervals and fielded teams with a good skill mix. Through project documents, there is
evidence of extended interaction and detailed attention to issues. Specialists often joined the
supervision missions to look at specific topics such as to undertake the resettlement audit in
2005, or to check on progress with road safety in 2006. The Bank team also collaborated
with various other initiatives being undertaken at the time, facilitating the communications
between them and ANE, such as the preparation of a rural transport policy and strategy for
Mozambique by the Rural Travel and Transport Program of the Sub-Saharan Africa
Transport Policy Program, or the preparation of the public expenditure review. The Bank
supported the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility initiative that awarded ANE
technical assistance to carry out a pilot project on performance-based management and
maintenance of roads.

3.67 ANE staff and management told the IEG mission that World Bank staff was generally
open-minded, helpful and flexible, and balanced local conditions with solutions that were
based on experience in other countries. For instance, the Bank encouraged alternative
solutions to the costly technical assistance being provided to ANE. In this context, the agency
was invited by the State and the Road Agency of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil for potential
twinning and cooperation with ANE. The intention was for ANE to base this proposal on a
similar existing scheme between Mozambique and Brazil in the health sector, but this
initiative did not develop further. IEG interviews confirmed the important advice provided
by the project staff both on the client and on the Bank‘s side concerning the provisions in the
several decrees, and their support throughout the drafting and approval process.

3.68   The overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Government Performance

3.69 The government performance during the project is rated Satisfactory. The
government‘s performance during the project showed a high degree of commitment and
ownership toward the project design, preparation and implementation through a number of
actions: (i) the development of an updated integrated strategy including consultations with
users; (ii) the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Road Commission (i.e. a national road
board) in May 2003; (iii) the publication of four decrees, including the creation of the Road
Fund as a legal autonomous entity which became official on May 28, 2003, and another
simplifying the regulations and organizational structure of ANE; (iv) the set up of an
adequate road maintenance user fee from fuel levy; (v) the regularization of budget transfers
to Road Fund; and (vi) the consolidation of road management responsibility under ANE -
                                              55


provincial public works offices under the governor in each province handed over the
responsibility to ANE for tertiary and vicinal roads in 2005, and ANE became the road
services provider to provincial governments;

3.70 During the project, there was a generally cooperative relationship between various
governmental stakeholders. Overall, the government sustained a high degree of readiness and
commitment with project preparation and activities, regardless of the two-year delay in
implementation. Obtaining approvals from the MoPF and MoPWH for contracts to be
awarded by ANE took considerable time and affected the implementation schedule of works.

Implementing Agency Performance

3.71 Implementing agency (ANE) performance during the project is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. The implementing agency managed the project in a professional manner,
paying attention to quality and costs. ANE benefited from strong and committed leadership
and support from the government departments. Despite constant changing of leadership at
the top of the organization, continuity of some ANE staff postings in middle management
was a positive contributing factor to the outcomes of the project. ANE was proactive in
making arrangements during project preparation and supervision. However, ANE suffered
from capacity constraints that impeded full oversight and supervision of the project. This
capacity constraint was reflected in all aspects of project implementation, but particularly in
the delay of engineering designs and in cost overruns. Indeed, bids for works contracts were
substantially higher than engineer‘s estimates. This would not have been unexpected if
attention had been paid to the commercial environment at the time of appraisal and detail
design. ANE showed its commitment to addressing environmental and social issues through
the successful establishment of the dedicated unit which proved to be a well-managed
project-level institutional arrangement. Over the project period, ANE enhanced its capacity
for construction supervision and gained confidence in managing and taking ownership of the
road network. The triggers to move from Phase 1 to 2 were met, except for the fact that some
deficiencies were found in the financial management at ANE in the quality of the technical
audits. These deficiencies were addressed in the Phase 2 of the Program. The IEG mission
was told by ANE staff that the lessons and experience from the project are having a positive
impact on ANE beyond the PIU, particularly as the experience was continued with Phase 2.

3.72 Given the weaknesses described above regarding the performance of ANE, the
overall Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.73 M&E Implementation. Given that the project was implemented by several units
across ANE, data collection and information with respect to project implementation and
ANE‘s overall situation were fragmented and often contradictory. There was no baseline data
to use as benchmark and no proactive analysis of project progress versus the expected project
development objectives. The Mid-term Review report suggested that a single unit within
ANE be charged with monitoring all of the activities related to the project. But at project
closure in 2007, ANE was undergoing restructuring and no M&E was even undertaken for
                                              56


the ICR. No major efforts were made by ANE and the Road Fund to collect all of the data
and information that was required by management to improve M&E implementation.

3.74 M&E Utilization. Discussions with ANE, Road Fund officials and task team
members suggested that qualitative and quantitative data from periodic progress reports was
used to track progress of project activities and to take measures to speed up implementation.
Data for performance indicators provided feedback on outputs and served the purpose of a
feedback mechanism since late 2003. In August 2006, the Road Fund submitted to the Bank
the proposed performance indicators which were to contribute to the performance assessment
framework of the roads sector. This was done with a view to use a sector-wide approach to
sector financing as part of Phase 2 of the program.

3.75   Overall M&E design, implementation and utilization is rated Modest.

Epilogue
3.76 Five years after the project was approved, the subsequent Phase 2 was approved on
May 23, 2007 for an amount ofUS$100 million, and declared effective on October 5, 2007.
Phase 2 was originally scheduled for closing on June 30, 2011, but additional financing in the
amount of US$41 million was approved and the closing date was extended to December 31,
2012. The project development objective of the Phase 2 of the Program is to improve access
of the population to all-season roads through maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading of
the classified road network. The achievement of the project development objective is
measured through: (a) percentage of classified roads in good and fair condition; and (b) the
percentage of the rural population within two kilometers of an all-season classified road.

3.77 Roads continue to be the backbone of the economy in Mozambique. Cargo
continues to move primarily by road. Road passenger transport grew by 12.1 percent in 2010
and accounts for 91.5 percent of passenger transport. Total planned sector expenditure for
the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 are respectively US$333 million, US$268 million, and
US$402 million, but given the delays in implementation of externally financed investments
as a result of which actual sector expenditure for 2007, 2008, and 2009 reached only 70, 60
and 61 percent respectively of the plan, the sector may see much lower expenditure.

4. Conclusions and Lessons
4.1      Lack of close coordination of working on different transport modes impedes
greater synergies and a more strategic and holistic approach to transport sector policy and
institutional and regulatory frameworks. The two reviewed operations were individually
prepared and implemented. Hence, the opportunity was lost to look at the strategy of the
entire sector and advise the government on inter-connectivity issues and trade-offs, as well as
on ways to improve the sector‘s funding and spending efficiency. It is also an example
where incentives of the various institutions within the WBG and the various donors need to
be carefully aligned. While the Borrower needs to take the lead in ensuring a holistic
approach to sector policy, this does not exempt the various development partners from their
responsibility to bring about a comprehensive view of the sector into the discussions.
                                                        57


4.2     Improved infrastructure does not necessarily ensure efficient trade and logistic
networks along infrastructure corridors or across the country. The aspect of regional
trade and transport facilitation and logistics comes strongly into play in the case of
Mozambique. The areas around Beira, Zambezi Valley, Nacala, and Limpopo—all covered
by the railroad corridors—see their economic potential powered by complementariness with
the economies of landlocked neighbors (Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi) whose closest and
natural ports are Beira, Maputo, and to a lesser extent Nacala. The central and south railway
lines depart from the Beira and Maputo ports, respectively, and connect with a network of
primary and secondary roads that extend to Malawi, 41 Zimbabwe, and South Africa (AICD,
2011).While the Railways and Ports Restructuring Project had improved international traffic
as an overarching project development objective, the projects had no direct support for
transport facilitation and logistic aspects on the transport corridors they were investing on.
Besides limited support provided to some standalone specific trade and logistics initiatives,
there was little consideration for the importance of linking the transport infrastructure being
supported with the need to develop efficient trade and logistic networks along the corridor
and across the country.

4.3      Restructuring into leaner organizations is worth attempting in its own right.
Successful restructuring requires planning for redundancy payments, pension liabilities and
re integration costs of the labor force into the job market. While it is widely accepted that
privatization of transport services generally delivers more sustainable results and the
enabling environment is well understood, more often than not, the restructuring of parastatals
is all that projects are able to achieve and transport services remain in the hands of the state.
Even without concessions, lean restructured entities are better placed to run the infrastructure
assets in a more commercial way. Supporting governments through these changes and
maintaining a neutral partnership is paramount if any progress is to be achieved at all.
Despite deciding against privatization efforts, the government and the Bank successfully
formed a working partnership to implement CFM‘s restructuring and achieving solid results
in this respect.

4.4     Including extraneous components that are peripheral to achieving the project’s
objectives result in a project that is too ambitious and complex for the institutional
capability of the borrower. This is particularly so due to limited resources and a small
window of opportunity to support a specific sector in a given country, especially those
benefiting from IDA resources. The Railways and Ports project could have benefitted from a
simpler set of components more aligned with the key development objective of the project.
In contrast, the roads project included a flexible project design that relies on phased
investment plans and annual project reviews that ensured acceptable outputs even under a


41
  One of the most promising emerging rail corridors is that running from Moatize to Nacala via Malawi (the
north system) which along with Nacala port forms part of a concession. Currently the railway part of the
corridor is not complete. There are 200 km of rail missing just outside the Malawi border. As one of the main
economic drivers for the development of the Moatize–Nacala railway is the potential for coal export from the
Tete area, and the port of Beira is insufficient to manage the 20–25 million tons of coal that can be produced,
this necessitates the completion and upgrading of this railway to connect to the other natural exit port at Nacala.
As the railway must pass through Malawi, this creates the challenge of defining and relying on regional
agreements and building regional infrastructure in coordination with Malawi (AICD, 2011)
                                              58


weak institutional environment and in a post-conflict situation where reconstruction needs
were great.

4.5       Given the increasing role of the private sector in many aspects of transport and
transport services, there is a growing overlap in activities across the World Bank Group,
mounting duplication of skills and escalating inefficiencies; failure to tap into the right
expertise of other parts of the World Bank Group results in unnecessary delays, fatigue of all
the parties involved, and often failure of private sector initiatives. Project concepts and
project documentation fail to show whether other parts of the Bank Group have been
consulted, and to give reasons as to why private sector activities are not being undertaken by
other parts of the group where the expertise resides and which are best placed to make the
initiatives succeed. Selecting the right partner in a concession or in any public-private
partnership can determine the success or failure of any initiative. Greater progress, with less
fatigue, would probably have been made in finding appropriate partners had the Bank tapped
into the right expertise of other parts of the World Bank Group in structuring PPP
transactions, discuss the merits and pitfalls of other approaches selecting long-term partners
such as multidimensional auctions or beauty contests which may have been more in line with
the government‘s strategy at the time, and ensure that concession contracts specified desired
performance outputs rather than inputs.

4.6     The danger to railway concessions of intermodal competition with road transport
for freight, and the difficulty for concessionaires to finance substantial investment in track
and rolling stock can contribute to the failure of the concessions. There have been
important failures in railway concession in the region, most of which have been documented
along with evidence on performance (AICD 2009). The experience with intermodal
competition between road transport and the Mozambique railway concessions provides
further lessons for other railway concessions in Africa.

4.7     Simply involving private concessionaires doesn't ensure sustainability of railway
infrastructure. In the absence of a regulatory framework for railways in Mozambique,
private concessionaires neglected maintenance and allowed the railway beds to deteriorate to
a point that government had to step in with additional costly rehabilitation investments before
they could be re-bid.
