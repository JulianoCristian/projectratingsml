efficiency of three major port-rail systems in\n            Mozambique, and, enable share increases in their\n            international freight traffic with neighboring countries.\n            Six main components and their related sub-components follow.\n            1) Although Portos e Caminhos de Ferro de Mocambique (CFM)\n            has advanced in its concession procedures, the component\n            will provide advisory services in: the development of\n            bidding documents; the design, negotiation, implementation,\n            and monitoring of concession agreements; and, structure its\n            role as equity shareholder in concessions/joint ventures. 2)\n            Staff rationalization will include redundancy and\n            redeployment issues, social mitigation, and pension reform\n            aspects. 3) Corporate restructure will focus on the spin-off\n            of CFM commercial activities, through studies, and\n            consultant services. Required equipment will be supplied. 4)\n            The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) will be\n            strengthened, through the revision for new organizational\n            requirements, private sector participation, and, policy\n            formulation on aviation issues. 5) The development of a\n            regulatory framework for the transport sector, will be\n            studied, covering economic and technical aspects. 6) The\n            tertiary ports component will include rehabilitation works\n            in small ports."}, "docdt": "1999-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
