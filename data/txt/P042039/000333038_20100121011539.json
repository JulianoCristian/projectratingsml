for Mozambique were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project outcome indicators should be\n            fully reflective of the project development objectives\n            (PDOs). These indicators should be backed by an appropriate\n            model or a set of equations in order to compute their values\n            with clear identification for the control of relevant\n            exogenous variables and their impact. For example, the\n            outcome indicator of this project is traffic growth, as this\n            indicator itself is a function of many variables such as\n            efficiency of the railways and ports, economic growth in the\n            neighboring countries, developments in the road sector, etc,\n            a model with all the relevant parameters should have been\n            designed to identify the impact of each variable. This will\n            also facilitate improved monitoring by the implementing\n            authorities, unambiguous evaluation of performance at every\n            stage, and identification of timely corrective actions. The\n            relative weights of various indicators should be identified\n            at the project preparation stage so that the aggregate\n            performance with respect to a particular PDO can be judged\n            unambiguously. Taking example of this project, it will have\n            been useful to make a more informed judgment on the overall\n            performance under each PDO if the methodology for\n            integrating the results measured by port traffic, railway\n            traffic, ports efficiency, railways efficiency, staff\n            retrenchment, and capacity building had been specified\n            during appraisal not necessarily in quantitative terms only\n            but even in a broad ranking form or by relative weights\n            contributing to the specific PDO. The lesson drawn from\n            dropping the tertiary port rehabilitation component is: if\n            investment for a component is delayed for any reason, the\n            economic analysis must be repeated just before the\n            investment is actually undertaken to make sure that the\n            changed business environment has not diminished the economic feasibility."}, "docdt": "2009-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
