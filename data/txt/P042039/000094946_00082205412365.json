and Ports\n            Restructuring Project, in a safe environmental manner. The\n            report first reviews the legislative, institutional, and\n            environmental regulations relating to all facilities, and\n            operations encompassed by the project, and, recommendations\n            follow, in compliance with World Bank standards. Port\n            restructuring will have adverse impacts due to dredging,\n            which affects sea-grass meadows, and other biological marine\n            habitats, such as mangrove depletion within the estuary\n            which is affecting sedimentation. Mitigating measures\n            include actions to replant mangroves in specific areas, and,\n            carefully select a spoil disposal site for dredged\n            materials, to rehabilitate ecosystems, and control erosion.\n            Cargo discharges, and storage of raw materials, and products\n            present environmental risks, such as oil spillage, wastes -\n            including asbestos and fertilizers - and uncontrolled\n            surface water flow from coal, iron, and molasses. Hence\n            mitigation suggest the construction of storm-water drainage\n            systems, in addition to remedial action policies regarding\n            unacceptable levels of pollution, through soil and\n            groundwater contamination tests. Likewise, rail corridors\n            pose the threat of land degradation, soil erosion, and\n            adversity to natural habitats, in addition to the negative\n            impact from the transport of hazardous materials. Measures\n            suggest that wastes from storage facilities should be\n            disposed of at an environmentally safe disposal site, and,\n            cargo materials should be stored in bunded areas, where\n            cut-off drains, and storm-water controls are provided.\n            Recommendations suggest increased public awareness, and\n            sustained waste management practices, to be built through\n            institutional strengthening, dependent on a strong political response."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
