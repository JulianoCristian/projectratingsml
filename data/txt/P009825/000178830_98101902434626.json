          that the Bombay area can accommodate the expected growth in\n            marine freight through that area by the year 1993. The\n            project would construct a new container and bulk freight\n            port with associated dredging of access channels at the\n            Nhava Sheva site, about 20 kms distance from the existing,\n            overcrowded Bombay port. Also included is the necessary\n            mechanical equipment, linkages to the Indian Railway (IR)\n            network, land acquisition, staff housing, and training in\n            port operations. The new port is expected to move an annual\n            volume of 250,000 containers and 3.7 million tons of bulk\n            cargo (foodgrain and fertilizers) by 1993. The project\n            return is sensitive to traffic forecasts and delays in\n            completion of the construction and commissioning of the\n            port. Traffic forecasts have been conservatively estimated,\n            however, and adequate provision for additional financing of\n            the NSPT's operations in the critical early years has\n            been arranged."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
