To that end, the project consists of\n            subprojects to achieve these objectives, for which IDA\n            financing of $20.7 million is . About two thirds will be\n            available for sector planning studies and about one third\n            for technical assistance and training. At the\n            government's request, a total of $9 million will be\n            allocated at the outset for three comprehensive planning\n            studies for the iron and steel, petrochemicals and electric\n            power sectors. Subprojects will be identified and prepared\n            under the technical assistance/special studies and training\n            category, totalling $5 million for institution building.\n            Given its technical assistance nature, the project is\n            broadly justified by the contribution it will make to\n            China's overall planning and reform process and by the\n            qualitative support it will provide to the Bank's\n            economic, sector, lending and technical assistance activities."}, "docdt": "1987-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
