The PSSSP was designed to assist the PRC in\n            strengthening its development policy and planning\n            capability; in preparing and implementing inter-sectoral and\n            innovative technical assistance projects; and in\n            strengthening key institutions responsible for economic and\n            financial reform. IDA's performance was generally\n            satisfactory. The overall performance of the State Planning\n            Commission and the Ministry of Finance was satisfactory. The\n            Borrower's performance improved in the course of\n            project implementation. Notwithstanding some of the\n            practical problems of implementation, overall project\n            outcome is rated as satisfactory. The experience of PSSSP\n            provides four principal lessons for effective implementation\n            of technical assistance projects in China. The first is the\n            need to designate a single entity with responsibility for\n            project implementation, and to define monitoring and\n            accountability mechanisms and reporting requirements at the\n            outset. IDA should take the lead in this regard. Second,\n            clear definition of sub-projects and an implementation\n            schedule at the time of appraisal is more\n            resource-efficient. Third, participating agencies should\n            provide a thorough assessment of training needs and likely\n            staff deployment early in the implementation process.\n            Finally, both IDA and the coordinating agencies should pay\n            greater attention to assisting sub-project implementing\n            agencies in following IDA guidelines on procurement."}, "docdt": "1996-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
