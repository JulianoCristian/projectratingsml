The idea was to: offer\n            small loans to trustworthy villagers and wait for their\n            investments to bear fruit. This micro-credit scheme,\n            supported with additional World Bank funds in 1999, has\n            grown into a successful network of rural micro-credit\n            associations serving over 10,000 members. Micro-credit\n            institutions, based on individual trust and solidarity\n            between villagers, fill an important gap in the financial\n            fabric of the country. Together with remittances sent by\n            workers overseas, small loans helped Albanians emerge from\n            the deep crisis of the 1990s. Now the credits support the\n            growth of a promising rural economy. Most of the loans still\n            finance agricultural and livestock investments but the share\n            of trade, tourism, and crafts is increasing."}, "docdt": "2007-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
