Re: Credit 3253 ALB (Microcredit Project) 
Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the above-referenced Project, dated July 19, 
1999, between Albania and the International Development Association (the Association) and your letter 
dated January 30, 2004. 
 
Accordingly, we acknowledge that the Albanian Saving and Credit Union was established as a 
successor to the Rural Finance Fund (RFF) on January 25, 2002, in conformity with the law on Saving 
and Credit Association No. 8782, and registered upon the Court Decision No. 62, dated February 5, 2002, 
and we are pleased to inform you that the Development Credit Agreement is hereby amended as follows: 
 
1. 
Section 1.02 (f) shall be replaced with the following: 
 
“‘Albanian Saving and Credit Union’ means the Albanian Saving and Credit Union, established 
on January 25, 2002, in accordance to the law on Saving and Credit Association No. 8782, registered 
upon the Court Decision No. 62, dated February 5, 2002.” 
 
2. 
Wherever RFF is referred to in the Development Credit Agreement, the reference to RFF shall be 
replaced with the Albanian Saving and Credit Union. 
 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by countersigning both copies of this amendment 
letter and returning one of the countersigned copies to us.  Upon receipt by the Association of the copy of 
this amendment letter countersigned by you, this amendment letter will become effective as of the date of 
your countersignature.  We will notify you of the receipt of your countersigned letter. 
 
Sincerely,
