I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Intro duct ion
1.01     Turkey is heavily dependent on oil as a primary energy resource.  The
rapid industrialization, urbanization and expansion of the road network over
the past two decades have all been contributing factors to an increse in the
share of oil from 20% of commercial energy consumed in 1960, to 60% in 1980.
In order to reduce Turkey's dependence on imported oil, the Government
launched a massive program in the late 1970's to increase the domestic produc-
tion of electricity and lignite. This program has strained the implementation
capabilities of the responsibile State energy agencies. Improvement in the
performance of these institutions is fundamental to the success of Turkey's
energy development program and the elimination of the continuing energy
deficit that Turkey faces. However, even in the best of circumstances, Turkey
will remain heavily dependent on imported fuels, primarily petroleum.
1.02     Reducing this dependence would have a direct effect on the balance of
payments and would indirectly increase the Government's ability to take a more
flexible approach in handling other important economic issues. To accomplish
this, the Government should put a high priority on a more diversified approach
to use energy more efficiently and develop rapidly other resources, using a
broad range of implementing agents. One element of such an approach would be
the expansion of efforts to develop other known primary energy resources,
particularly through the expansion of programs to: (i) increase the recovery
of oil from proven reservoirs; (ii) explore for and develop potential gas
reserves; (iii) exploit identified geothermal fields; and (iv) use more
extensively forestry resources and wood plantations for fuelwood. This would
require an expansion of the financial and technical resources currently
committed to these fields. A second element would be through greater use of
the skills and resources of the private sector, both domestic and foreign.
The local private sector could develop the smaller projects that the State
enterprises are unable to consider because of a shortage of staff. The
foreign private sector could be encouraged in such fields as petroleum and
geothermal, where their expertise is needed to speed up the exploration for
development of these resources. The Government is taking the steps necessary
to implement such a policy. A third eLement would be through encouraging
greater efficiency in the use of existing energy resources.l/
Energy Resources
1.03     Turkey has substantial untapped lignite and hydropower resources, as
well as more limited, but still important, oil, gas and coal resources and
significant geothermal potential. Proven and probable lignite reserves are
about 7.5 billion tons, but about half is of extremely low quality.
Production in 1980 was 15.5 million tons, equivalent in energy terms to about
3 million tons of oil (3 MMTOE). The economic hydropower potential is
estimated at over 70,000 GWh per year (19 MMTOE); in 1980 production was about
11,000 GWh (3 MMTOE).
For a detailed review of the energy sector, see: Turkey: Issues and
Options in the Energy Sector, March 1983. Report No. 3877-TU.



-2-
1.04     Oil production has been declining over the last decade, as few
discoveries have been made in recent years; in 1980 production was about 2.3
million tons, representing approximate'Ly 15% of total consumption. Proven
recoverable reserves are about 16 milli'on tons. However, potential reserves
that may become economically recoverab]Le, using enhanced oil recovery tech-
niques currently being tested, could be as high as 30 million tons. Proven
recoverable gas reserves are about 450 billion standard cubic feet (about 10
MMTOE). Production of gas was insignificant in 1980; large scale delivery is
expected to begin in 1986.
Energy Production
1.05     Coal production has also been declining as operations move to deeper,
less accessable seams; in 1980 production was 3.6 million tons (2.4 MMTOE).
Proven reserves of economically recoverable and usable asphaltite and shale
oil are insignificant. While the possible geological reserves of shale oil
are quite large (5 billion tons), mineable reserves are less than 300 million
tons. Furthermore, the low and variable quality of the shale make it unlikely
that this resource can be economically exploited.
1.06     There is substantial potential for geothermal development for both
power and space heating, but no long-term development program has been
established to exploit it. However, a foreign company with extensive
experience in geothermal power has recently undertaken a technical review of a
number of promising geothermal sites, and discussions with the Government on
possible terms and conditions for developing one of these sites are currently
in progress.
Energy Use
1.07     Total energy use was about 33 iMTOE in 1980.  Petroleum was of over-
whelming importance, accounting for 60% of total commercial energy used.
Electric power, 5% of which was imported from Eastern Europe, accounted for
23% of all commercial energy used, of which 75% was consumed in the industrial
sector. Lignite use was less important, accounting for only 16% of primary
commercial energy, over a third of which went for power production. Non-
commercial energy, (primarily fuelwood, but also other biomass) was also
significant; while it represented less than one quarter of the energy consumed
in the economy as a whole, it was the primary energy source for the household
sector, accounting for almost 60% of this sector's total consumption (for
details, see Annex 1.2.

The most notable changes over the past two decades has been the decrease in
the relative share of hard coal in the total energy picture. This has been
accompanied by a rapid rise in the use of petroleum until the mid-1970's,
peaking at over 50% of total energy cornsumed in 1977/78, and a rapid rise in
the use of lignite (primarily for thermal power production) and hydroelectric
power as primary energy sources starting in the second half of the 1970's.
During all this period, hard coal consumption stayed relatively constant in
absolute terms, while traditional biomass energy sources increased slightly in
absolute terms, but decreased steadily as a percentage of total energy
consumed.
1.09     Turkey's energy consumption in 1980 was equivalent to 0.40 tons oil
per $1,000 GNP. This was lower than that of most temperate zone middle income
developing countries, but slightly higher than that of most of the higher
income OECD countries (see Annex 1.2). Total energy consumption increased by
5.8% per year between 1965 and 1980, while GNP increased by 6.5% per year.
Per capita energy consumption was, of course, substantially below that of the
higher income countries. This reflects Turkey's relatively lower per capita
income, per capita number of motor vehiLcles and level of industrialization.



-4-
1.10     The most important elements in the growth of demand for energy
resources will be the growth rate of the economy as a whole and the growth of
the relatively energy intensive and power intensive industrial sector of the
economy. Per capita energy consumption is likely to rise in parallel with
rising per capita income. Demand for lignite would grow particularly rapidly,
both for direct consumption by households and industry and, even more impor-
tantly, for electricity generation. This growth may be moderated somewhat by
the Government's increasing concern about environmental pollution, partic-
ularly in major urban centers. The growth in the demand for petroleum would
be moderated by the much higher price of imported oil and products, and by
substitution of other energy sources where ever possible. The issue facing
energy planners is whether, through an appropriate choice of industrial
policies, Turkey can keep its energy consumption per unit of output from
rising as the industrialization process speeds up.
1.11     If the growth rate of the economy were to average about 5% per year
over the 1980's (a growth rate of 63% over the decade) ancd the industrial
sector were to grow slightly faster, the projections suggest that electricity
demand would grow by 200% between 1980 and 1990, to 60,000 GWh; lignite demand
from industries and households would grow by 160%, to 27 million tons; lignite
demand for thermal power plants would grow almost tentimes, to about 50
million tons; fuelwood and biomass demand would grow by 14%, to 36 million
tons; and petroleum demand would grow by 110%, to 30 million tons. If
domestic resources such as fuelwood or Lignite are not available, some of the
excess demand would spill over into other energy substitutes that would have
to be imported. Demand would, of course, grow substantially faster in
response to a more rapid rate of growth of GNP.
1.12     To meet its energy requirements, Turkey launched a massive program in
the late 1970's to increase the domestic production of electricity and
lignite. It increased its investment in energy projects in constant 1980
prices, from TL 57 billion in 1973 to 154 TL billion in 1980, an increase from
1.9% of GNP to 3.8%. This represents an increase in the share of total fixed
investment from 9.3% to 17.9%. This program has stretched the implementation
capabilities of the responsible State energy agencies to their limit.  In some
instances, resources were spread too thinly, over too many projects, with
resulting long delays in completion sche!dules. Present implementation
schedules for the major power and lignite projects indicate that, even if the
Government's proposals for reforming its energy institutions can be
implemented quickly, an optimistic estimate of net availab:Le electricity in
1985 and 1990 would be 37,300 and 60,500 GWh respectively, and 31.7 and 70.7
million tons lignite, respectively.
1.13     Almost all of the planned new thermal plants wouldl be lignite
fired.  This places a heavy burden on the Turkish Coal Authority (TKI), the
Government-owned coal and lignite mining enterprise to expand its lignite
production facilities, and TKI has embarked upon an extremely ambitious
program to meet this growing demand for lignite. From the 15.5 million tons
produced in 1980, production in 1990 is planned to rise to 70.7 million tons,
a more than four-fold increase, to be accomplished through the development of
eleven large open pit mines and two large mechanized underground mines. The
potentially high cost of some lignite-based power projects raises questions as
to whether their development for power is economically justifiable and
competitive with other alternatives, such as thermal power plants based on
imported coal.



-5-
1.14     The Government's planned power development program calls for a
tripling of installed generating capacity in the decade of the 1980's,
reaching 15,000 MW by 1990. About half would be in hydro and half in
thermal. This program will require the lurkish Electric Authority, (TEK) the
Government owned power utility, to bring on stream three times more capacity
in the 1980's than it brought on in the 1970's. Investment in upgrading and
expanding the distribution and transmission facilities will also be given high
priority, since they have both high returns and can increase available
electricity supplies in a relatively short time span.
1.15     The energy balances based on the above demand and supply projections
suggest that sufficient power might be produced to eliminate the need to
import power in 1990, although firm capacity would still be below require-
ments. However, there would probably be shortfalls in lignite production of
about 9 million tons in 1985 and 7 million tons in 1990. These shortfalls
would, presumably, would have to be made up by additional fuel oil imports.
Energy import levels needed to balance demand requirements would range from
28.4 MMTOE in 1990, under the most favorable scenario, to 32.9 MMTOE in a less
favorable, but quite possible scenario that assumes (i) 20% slippage in the
lignite and power investment program and (ii) availability of firm hydro
electric power. A higher level of economic growth would, of course, lead to
substantially higher levels of demand. An increase of an extra 1% in GDP
growth per year until 1990, would, even with a low elasticity of demand of
1.2, increase total annual energy consumption by about 5 million tons oil
equivalent, all of which, presumably, would have to come from imports. The
need for such a high level of energy imports would put a severe strain on
Turkey's overall ability to import sufficient goods to keep the economy
growing smoothly.
1.16     The Government, until recently, put little emphasis on examining
other alternatives to help fill the energy gap. Although a natural gas field
had been discovered in Thrace in 1971, the Government assigned little
importance to it and no effort was made to determine whether the gas could be
produced economically until almost ten years later. It was only last year,
after well stimulation experiments (hydrofracturing), financed under Bank loan
1917-TU, demonstrated the possibility of high output levels, that the
potential benefits of this field were widely recognized and a program
initiated for the development of the required infrastructure (a gas pipeline
transmission system). Once this pipeline is in place, additional gas
discoveries could be brought to market quite rapidly. Gas production, which
is currently negligible, is expected to increase to about 50 million standard
cubic feet per day -- MMSCFD -- (over 0.4 MMTOE per year) when the Hamitabat
field is developed in 1986. By 1990, annual production levels of one million
to two million TOE (125-250 MMSCFD of gas) appear to be reasonable and
substantially higher levels are possible.
Energy Institutions
1.17     The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) was established
in 1964 to coordinate all energy-related agencies.  The Mineral Exploration
and Research Institute (MTA) explores for minerals, coal, lignite, uranium and
geothermal energy in coordination with Etibank (for minerals) and the Turkish
Coal Enterprises (TKI). TKI is charged with developing and marketing Turkey's
coal and lignite resources. Since most of its output is used for power



-6-
generation, TKI's development plans are closely linked with those of the
Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK). TEK is the agency responsible for
planning the general electrification of the country and for generating and,
distributing power.
1.18     The Petroleum Law promulgated on March 7,1954 (Law No. 6326), and
modeled closely after United States petroleum laws, set up definitions,
procedures and government institutions to regulate exploitation of petroleum
resources. This law was revised in April 1983 to provide substantial new
incentives for foreign private exploration. The General Directorate of
Petroleum Affairs (GDPA) is the operating arm of the MENR responsible for
implementing the Petroleum Law; its duties include approving and registering
petroleum concessions, collecting infcrmation on concessLons that are returned
to the State, ensuring that operating companies conform to good petroleum
industry practices, determining world market levels of crude oil prices, and
helping set refinery margins and ex-refinery prices.
1.19     The Turkish Petroleum Company (TPAO) was also established in 1954.
It was given responsibility for exploring for, producing, importing, refining,
transporting and marketing oil. TPAO is described in Chapter V. Petrol Ofisi
is the state economic enterprise that distributes and retails most of the
products refined and imported by TPAO and its affiliates.
Energy Sector Policies
a.       Pricing
1.20     Throughout the 1970's the Government's policy to maintain low
domestic energy prices led to increasingly serious economic problems.  The low
wellhead prices offered for domestic petroleum production became a major
deterrent to exploration and development by international oil companies.  At
the same time, the policy of holding domestic petroleum product prices
constant in local currency terms, in the face of accelerating domestic
inflation and rising world prices for energy, led to rapidly increasing demand
for petroleum and rapidly increasing imports. Similarly, prices for hard
coal, lignite and electricity, the other major primary energy sources for
Turkey, were also held down, causing serious financial losses to TKI and
marginal profits to TEK, and discouraging the adoption of effective conser-
vation measures in both production and consumption. It was not until the
financial and political crises of late 1979 and early 1980 that the policy of
energy subsidies was largely abandoned and most prices raised to international
levels. It is now the policy of the Government to allow energy prices to
reach levels required to promote economLic efficiency. Peltroleum product
pricing is discusssed in para. 2.04.
b.       Conservation
1.21     The Government is also in the process of developLng a program for the
conservation of energy resources by encouraging their more efficient use in
existing and new industrial enterprises. Energy efficiency programs and
legislation are being evaluated by both the Ministry of Energy and the State
Planning Office (SPO) and legislation has already been passed which allows for
tax credits for various types of investments in energy efficiency improve-
ments. The Government has initiated programs to assist industrial firms in
improving energy efficiency of their existing operations.



-7-
c.       Planning
i.22     The Fourth five-year plan (1979-1983) was prepared during a period of
exceptionally high growth expectations, wrhich proved to be unachievable in the
following years of economic difficulties. The rapidly changing economic
circumstances were handled through a process of one year plans that had
little, if any, relationship to the original five-year plan. These timely one
year plan revisions served quite well during a period of great economic
fluctuations and stress.
1.23     Planning for the energy sector in Turkey is an extremely difficult
exercise. The uncertainties of recent years require that the plans of the
public sector be periodically revised as conditions change and better fore-
casts can be made. This will require the planning process to be strengthened
and made more flexible so that (i) medium term (5 year) plans for the public
sector could be updated annually; (ii) a clearer demarcation of the relative
roles of the public and private sector could explicitly be made; and (iii) new
public sector projects could be fully evaluated and reviewed before they are
incorporated in the development plan.
1.24     The new five year plan (the Fifth) that is now under preparation for
the years 1984-1988. New energy demand and supply projections are being
made. Over the next decade, and probably beyond, growth in energy consumption
will, basically, be supply constrained. The Government's policy is, there-
fore, to increase the exploitation of domestic energy resources as rapidly as
possible. It is currently reviewing its investment alternatives with a view
towards maximizing future output, given the limits it faces on the avail-
ability of capital and human resources.

II. THE PETtOLEUM SUBSECTOR
Introduction
2.01     The high level of dependence on imported petroleum is the dominant
factor in Turkey's pattern of energy consumption. Turkey currently produces
only about 14 percent of its oil consumption, down from 47% in 1970, and its
gas production is insignificant. The share of petroleum in the consumption of
commercial primary energy rose from 20% in 1960 to 60% in 1980. The oil
import bill grew rapidly, surpassing total export earnings in 1980, and became
a major contributing factor to the 1979 economic difficulties. Production, on
the other hand, reached a peak of 3.6 million tons in 19159, and then declined
slowly to about 2.3 million tons in 1982. Imports rose at a rate of 20% per
year between 1970 and 1978, from 3.8 million tons to 14.3 million. World oil
price increases stopped this growth, as foreign exchange constraints limited
Turkey's import capabilities and economic activity declined. In 1982, imports
were about 13.9 million tons.
2.02     Oil production is expected tc continue to declinie over the next few
years unless there are important new discoveries. Large--scale enhanced
recovery projects involving the two major fields (Bati Raman and Raman), if
successful, could reverse this decline towards the end of the decade. Gas
production has been negligible until now, with about two million cubic feet
(MMCF) per day (17,000 TOE per year) However, it is ant:Lcipated that the
Hamitabat field to be developed shortly, will be able to supply about 18,000
MCF (over 0.4 MMTOE) per year of gas. Other recent discoveries near Hamitabat
indicate that production of gas could increase dramatically over the next few
years.

Petroleum Consumption
2.03     Currently, petroleum consumption is heavily weighted to a few
products, primarily fuel oil, about 42%, diesel oil, about 29%, and gasoline,
about 11%. The consumption of petroleum products is conservatively estimated
to increase by about 6.4% annually between 1980 and 1990 from about 15.6 tons
to about 28.9 million tons. Naphtha consumption, is expected to increase
rapidly from the present 3% to possibly 9% once the petrochemical complex at
Alia comes on stream. Fuel oil consumption could be substantially reduced if
sufficient quantities of natural gas were found to supply all major industrial
consumers in the Istanbul region. In this case, major modifications to some
refineries may become worthwhile.
Petroleum Pricing Policy
2.04     The Government's policy of maintaining relatively low levels of
energy prices during the 1970's lead to rapidly increasing consumption. It
was not until the economic crisis of 1979, that the policy of subsidizing
energy prices was largely abandoned, and most prices raised to international
levels. Since that time, petroleum product prices have been periodically
increased to reflect the world market prices. For oil produced from wells
drilled after 1979, crude oil prices have been fixed at international levels
to ensure maximum incentive for private companies to explore in Turkey.

2.05     The Government has not yet set forth an official system to set the
price of natural gas, either at the well head or at the point of consump-
tion. Until a distribution system is created to supply gas to fertilizer and
power plants and for power generation, the Government plans to encourage
nearby industries to use the quantities that are available by offering small
discounts below fuel oil equivalent prices. The existing proven reserves are
limited in relation to the potential market and replace fuel oil at the
margin. On this basis, appropriate long term price would be the fuel oil
equivalency price. At negotiations assurances were obtained from the
Government on the principles underlying its long-term gas pricing



- 10 -
policy. These principles tie the price of gas to the cost of fuel oil, taking
into account the price incentives that: may be necessary to encourage potential
consumers to convert their facilities to gas use.
Petroleum Geology of Turkey
2.06     Turkey's proximity to the large Middle East producing areas would, at
first sight, make it an excellent exploration prospect. Indeed, most major
oil companies operating in the Gulf States have, at one time or another,
explored in Turkey (Shell, Mobil, Esso, Caltex). The most active operations
were in areas closest to the Iraq and Syrian producing areas, i.e. in
Southeast Turkey. There was some activity in the Thrace Basin, but very
little in the remaining part of the country. Although some notable successes
have been achieved, it soon became clear that very large oil fields like
Kirkuk or Burgan were very unlikely to be present in Turkey. Rather, oil
fields that were found were small and complex by Middle East standards
rendering exploration and production difficult and expensive. The view that
Turkey is vastly underexplored and that it was only the unavailability of
large amounts of risk money which prevented the country from joining the
league of large producers is unfortunately not a realistic one. To see
Turkey's oil geological prospectivity in its proper perspective with the
Bank's exploration projects, a summary is presented here of some of the
petroleum geology and prospectivity of the large geological units in Turkey
where oil and gas exploration has been carried out. Discussions with the
Exploration Management of TPAO has basLcally confirmed these views. Further
discussions will be aimed at delineating strategies for future exploration
activity.
2.07     The morphology of Turkey is one of rugged relief.  The mean elevation
in western/central Anatolia is 3,500 feet, rising to over 6,500 feet in the
east. The mountainous relief is dominated in the north and south by ranges
over 10,000 feet that encircle the Central Anatolian Plateau. North of the
Central Plateau, the Karadeniz (Pontic), mountains follow the entire southern
shore of the Black Sea. South of the Central Plateau the Taurus mountains
extend in broad arches along the Mediterranean coast and north of Syria.
Central Anatolia is a semi-arid plateau with a core of old rocks overlain by
horizontal or slightly tilted Tertiary deposits. It contains many shallow
depressions with numerous shallow lakes. Some of these basins have a long
geological history. In the Tuzgolu basin, 150 km SSE of Ankara, thousands of
feet of sediments have been deposited. Most of the other "basinal" areas are
young downwarps with thin veneers of Tertiary sediments. In eastern Anatolia
the mountain ranges become very high and volcanic activity very strong.
Western Anatolia, known as the Aegean region, is characterised by elongated
mountain ridges which are separated by deep depressions; subsidence of the
depressions took place along a system of young, roughly parallel fault lines
running eastwest. Land forms in northwest Turkey are relatively simple. The
Thrace basin, west of Istanbul is bordered by mountains of moderate height;
the central part of the basin is filled with Tertiary deposits; it is an area
of gentle, rolling hills with easy access. This morphological summary alone
suggests that most of Turkey underwent strong geological dListurbances in the
recent past. Indeed detailed geological studies indicate that highly
disturbed areas are the rule and "conventional sedimentary basins" are the
exception.



- 11 -
2.08     The oil and gas prospectivity can be best discussed by dividing
Turkey into two distinct geological units. The first is composed of a
thrusted/folded/uplifted part belonging to the Alpine system covering most of
Anatolia, the Aegean and Thrace. Here, due to intensive tectonic forces and
strong deformations, hydrocarbons, if indeed formed, could not have been
preserved. In more recent geological times, however, some areas subsided and
received thick masses of sediments. Some of these basins are relatively
little disturbed and have hydrocarbon potential. The second megatectonic unit
in Turkey belongs to the Arabian platfonr. It comprises the entire area south
of the folded ranges, (i.e., southeast Turkey). It has certain elements
reminiscent to the oil geology of the Gulf States, but there remain major
differences. A more detailed discussion is in Annex 2.1.
a.       Basins related to the Alpine-FoLd System
2.09     A mountain system, like the Alps, is often accompanied by sedimentary
basins that were formed during the later stages of mountain building. Such
basins can be of considerable interest as hydrocarbon producers or providers
of geothermal resources. Their geological parameters vary so widely, however,
that no generally valid statements can be made. Rather, the merits of each
basinal area in a fold system has to be considered on their own. A number of
such basins have also been recognised in several parts of Turkey; the
geological prospects of the more important ones are summarized below.
2.10     The Thrace Basin is a pronounced, well defined geological depression
west of Istanbul; the basin measures 100 km x 140 km; in Tertiary times it
received sedimentary thicknesses in excess of 9,000 meters in its deepest
part. Exploration drilling has demonstrated the presence of source rocks and
reservoir rocks and has proved that the basin is an important hydrocarbon
bearing province. The geological prognosis of the basin is discussed in
detail starting in para. 3.04.
2.11     The Tuzgolu area is underlain by a deep basin, located some 150 km
SSE of Ankara. It covers a surface area in excess of 5,000 km2. The
thickness of the geological section with reservoirs and source rocks, make the
basin, prima facie, an interesting exploration objective, not least because of
its proximity to Ankara. TPAO has operated in this area since 1971; progress
has been sluggish due to extremely difficult and adverse working conditions.
Only a few wells have been drilled so far; one encountered some gas. Lennox
Oil Company (UK) has recently signed a joint venture agreement with TPAO
committing itself to seismic and exploration drilling, if they wish to extend
their program beyond three years. Geological prognosis: No full geological
analysis is available yet. Working conditions are difficult and exploration
progress has been slow. The basin offers moderate gas potential however
finding and production costs will be high.
2.12     In the Adana Basin, intensive exploration work by foreign oil
companies and TPAO has resulted in the discovery of only one small field with
some 6 million barrels reserves. ExtensiLve further drilling has proven
abortive. In the northern part of the basin TPAO has identified a structural
play, the main objectives being Palaeozo:Lc limestones. A TPAO/Shell joint
venture is drilling an exploration well to test this objective. Towards the
south, the Tertiary section thickens rapidly to over 5,000 meters. Geological
trapping structures are small and difficult to map. A Shell/TPAO well



- 12 -
encountered some gas/condensate in a thin Paleocene turbidite; it was too
small, however, for development. Further south, in the Gulf of Iskendrun
exploration has been equally disappointing. Geological prognosis: a basinal
area with complex structures and rapid changes in sedimentary composition.
Intensive exploration has led to the discovery of a small oil field. Further
prospectivity is considered low.
2.13     The Eregli area in the north/centrail area of Turkey, bordering the
Black Sea, contains some interesting oil geological elements. Trapping
structures are anticlines, thrusted anticlines and fault traps; oil shows have
been observed along thrust and fault planes. Future seismic acquisition if
terrain difficulties can be overcome may well lead to the identification of an
interesting oil geological play. In the Ulus basin East of Eregli, yet
another geological play has been identified. Along its fringes numerous oil
and gas seeps have been observed. However, adverse terrain conditions and
rapidly changing formations will make acquisition of high quality data very
difficult. Geological prognosis: Botlh areas may have some hydrocarbon
potential; access is a major problem; geological structures are complex and
difficult to map. Exploration will be very expensive and rewards will be
small.
2.14     Industry interest in the Aegean Sea basins has greatly increased
since Oceanic's discovery of the Prino! (Greece) oil field in the early
seventies; the field now produces some 20,000 b/d. This discovery is located
in a narrow, deep younger Tertiary basin. Similar, albeit smaller, basins are
likely to be present along the Turkish west coast. In the 1970's two
internatilonal oil companies (Dorchester and Shell) executed seismic work in
some of these basins. While the presence of a thick sedimentary section was
proven, no exploration drilling followed; possible trapping structures proved
to be too small to be of interest to them. Despite some remaining hydrocarbon
potential no further operations are planned by TPAO prior to a firm agreement
with Greece on the jurisdiction of the offshore areas.
b.       Basins Related to the "Arabiani Platform"
2.15     The area between the edge of t:he mountain front and the Syrian-Iraq
border belongs, in oil geological terms, to the Arabian platform.
Stratigraphically, there are some similarities with the prolific oil fields in
the south; these lie particularly in the composition of the middle mesozoic
limestone section. However, rich Juarassic source rocks, so well developed in
Saudi Arabia and Iraq, do not reach as far north as Turkey. Instead, source
rocks of poorer quality have been identified in the Palaeozoic section and,
possibly, in Mesozoic limestones. Regional caprocks, so predominant in the
Arabian Gulf countries, are also absent: in Turkey. Trapping conditions for
hydrocarbons are plentiful but in many cases migration of oil and gas
antedated the formation of structures, another important difference with the
Arabian Gulf countries.
2.16     The main oil prospective area in Turkey is located just south of the
mountain front.  Trapping conditions range from small thrusted anticlines
(Diyarbakir area) to large anticlinal upwarps (Rahman area). Production in
this area amounts to 40,000 b/d; remaining reserves are estimated to be of the
order of 120-150 million bbl.  Enhancecl recovery in certain heavy oil fields
could raise production to 70,000 b/d. With few exceptionis, the oil fields in



- 13 -
SE Turkey are small and have no surface expressions. Geophysical methods are
thus the only exploration tool available for the detection of such traps.
Difficult surface conditions and rapid changes in rock composition have mostly
resulted in very poor data quality; consesquently seismic interpretation was
difficult and often ambiguous. As a consequence, oil discovery rates remained
low and even the dry hole ratio for deveLopment wells has been inordinately
high. Exploration in the oil field area has now come to a stage where the
main structural trends are known. While there may be scope for new
discoveries, in the near future additions to production are expected mainly
from infill drilling and enhanced oil recovery.
2.17     The Hakkari area in the south eastern most part of the country
remains an important play where TPAO hopes to find large additions to
reserves. Here, geological formations similar to those of the producing
fields in northern Iraq are expected. Exploration is rendered very difficult
because the prospective rock formations are overlain by complex thrust sheets
consisting of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Ongoing geophysical work has
succeeded in outlining a few interesting prospects, some of which will be
drilled shortly. The Hakkari area contaLns considerable potential, albeit
very speculative.
c.       Geological Conclusions
2.18     Among the many basins in Turkey only two areas contain significant
hydrocarbon potential. The first, southeast Turkey, has been densely
explored; with the one exception of Hakkari, additions to reserves are
expected from infill drilling and enhanced recovery. The second, in Thrace,
is likely to develop into an important hydrocarbon (primarily gas) producing
area. While several other areas contain some geological elements favorable
for the generation of oil and gas, exploration is rendered difficult due to
adverse topography, rapid changes in the composition of prospective
formations, generally small size of expected trapping stuctures. Extensive,
high cost geoscientific data acquisition and interpretation work will be
required. Even then, the resulting discoveries are likely to be small; and,
the dry hole ratio high.
Petroleum Exploration
2.19     Since the introduction of the Petroleum Law in 1954, over 600
exploration wells were drilled in Turkey, of which about 40% were by foreign
companies. The latter part of the 1950s saw the greatest activity as the
companies made their initial evaluation of Turkey's prospects. However,
interest decreased during the 1960's as few discoveries were made and, by the
late 1960's, only two important foreign companies, Shell and Mobil, continued
to explore for and produce oil. In the 1970's, TPAO was allowed to greatly
expand the acreage that it could hold under license, while foreign companies
were, generally, discouraged from taking an active interest in exploring in
Turkey, so that at the beginning of 1980, TPAO held 249 licenses (of about
50,000 ha each but many of which are in very high risk areas), including 6 in
partnership with NV Turkse Shell, while 15 licenses were held by private
Turkish companies, and 11 by two foreign companies, both of whom had found oil
in the 1960's and were still substantial oil producers.

Turkey's Exploration Strategy
2.20     Turkey's strategy for exploration, once primarily comprised of
expanding TPAO's activities, has been evolving rapidly in the past few
years. On the one hand, it now emphasizes an extended role for private
investment and skills in exploration and development of the country's
potential. It has prepared the way, through legal, administrative and price
reforms, through decreasing the amount of acreage that TPAO could hold, and
through encouraging TPAO to look for joint venture arrangements. On the other
hand, it has encouraged TPAO to size its own program to its financial and
staff capacity, and to focus more of its energies in those areas in which it
has a comparative advantage, such as in natural gas and hLeavy oil development.
2.21     In 1980, the Government realized that it could provide TPAO with only
a small proportion of the resources that would be required to finance an
exploration program of the size needed to explore fully and systematically all
its prospective petroleum areas. Theresfore, after discouraging foreign
companies for five years by fixing wellhead crude prices at 1974 levels , the
Government allowed wellhead crude pricess to reach international levels and
made provision for companies to export up to 35% of any new crude oil finds if
they wished to. Possibly the most important encouraging factor, however, has
been that the General Directory of Petroleum Affairs (GDPA), responsible for
issuing exploration and production licenses and for supervising oil company
operations, has taken an active interest in assisting new exploration
companies to get through the bureaucral:ic procedures needed to start up and
operate efficiently. One component of the Bank's first exploration project
(1916-TU), is earmarked for technical assistance to strengthen the GDPA's
exploration promotion capabilities.
2.22     As a result, by the beginning of 1983, five foreign companies held 66
licenses (some in joint-venture agreements with local companies), covering 3.1
million ha, local private companies he]Jd 44 licenses covering 1.9 million ha,
and TPAO held 155 licenses covering 7.4 million ha. Thus, between 1974 and
1982, TPAO's license area decreased from over 90%, to about 60% of the total
licensed area. Furthermore, TPAO will soon have to reduce this license
holding again, since the proposed new Petroleum Law has a provision to reduce
the maximum allowable number of licenses that TPAO can hold in each district
from 16 to 12.  Four of the new foreign exploration groups are actively
engaged in gathering new seismic data. In total, in 1982 they shot 3,000
line-km of seismic in addition to geological work and reprocessing existing
seismic data, compared with 2200 line km shot by TPAO. No exploration
drilling has yet taken place, but at least three of the companies plan to
start their exploration drilling in 1983. A number of other companies also
appear to be interested in starting exploration activities,  However, many
have been reluctant to start work in Turkey until they have an opportunity to
review the revised Petroleum Law in its final form.
2.23     TPAO has also been indicating to all interested :Lnvestors that most
concession areas presently under its jurisdiction are ava:Llable for joint
venture partnerships on mutually agreable terms. TPAO has a joint venture
program with Shell in two license areas, and Shell is platning to drill two
wells in these blocks in 1983. One offshore joint venture program to drill
two wells in the Bay of Iskanderun was implemented, but no oil was found. In
addition, TPAO has just concluded negotiations with three other foreign



- 15I -
companies for joint venture agreements. While none of these agreements
include commitment to drilling during the initial period, they will all
require the foreign partner to undertake significant exploration data
acquisition programs at their expense and make a firm drilling commitment for
the second stage. Other companies have also expressed interest, but have not
been willing to go beyond trading letters of intent with TPAO until the new
Petroleum Law is passed and can be revi,ewed. TPAO anticipates undertaking a
major promotion effort to develop additional joint venture operations once the
legislation is passed.
2.24     TPAO's own exploration strategy has been closely tied to its budget
allocations. Starting in the late 1970's when TPAO acquired a large number of
drilling rigs, exploration drilling began to expand so rapidly that its
geological and geophysical explorationists found it increasingly difficult to
provide adequate support. As a result, wells were sometimes drilled without
adequate technical investigations and preparation, and TPAO's dry hole rate
began to rise. However, by late 1982, wildcat exploration drilling (drilling
in entirely new potential fields) was substantially curtailed by the
Government institution's strict budget controls. The 1983 program calls for
only 10 wildcat exploration wells, down from about twice that number in
1982. This has forced TPAO to set clear priorities on its exploration program
and to eliminate those areas of more speculative prospectivity. In the 1983
program, activity will be concentrated primarily in the major hydrocarbon
bearing areas of Thrace, Southeast Turkey, and in initial efforts to test the
prospects of Hakkari.
2.25     The Bank has reviewed this exploration program and discussed
exploration strategy and priorities with TPAO, and has found that TPAO's
strategies, which includes farming out ( in joint ventures with foreign
companies) of substantial portions of the acreage that it cannot handle with
its own budget, is appropriate to its circumstances. Furthermore, the current
level of exploration investment is consistent with TPAO's current prospects,
as well as with its technical and financial capabilities. This, of course,
could change, if new discoveries created highly promising new plays, as could
possibly happen, for instance, in Hakkari. The Bank has already developed a
productive dialogue with TPAO's exploration department, through its reviews of
TPAO's exploration programs during supervision of loan 1916-TU and appraisal
of this project. TPAO has agreed to continue to review its entire exploration
program with the Bank annually and to take into consideration the Bank's
comments before implementing it.
Role of the Bank
2.26     The Bank's lending to the energy sector was, until 1979, concentrated
on electrical power projects. /  Since that time, the Bank support for the
energy sector in Turkey has expanded and diversified to include all energy
subsectors. Lending for energy projects has included electricity generation
and distribution, petroleum, increased energy use efficiency and a PPF for
/  Until 1982, 10 loans and a technical assistance grant totalling 476.7 US$
million, and 3 IDA credits totalling $55.7 million, have been made for
electric power generation and transmission in Turkey.

lignite mining. Sector policy advice has been provided through the SAL
lending program and through technical assistance initiatives, including the
Public Sector Investment Review of 1980/81 (Report No. 3472) and the UNDP/Bank
Energy Assessment of 1981/82 (Report No. 3377). The recognition of the
growing critical importance of petroleum imports of the country's balance of
payments position resulted the preparation of an engineering loan in FY79,
and, subsequently, two lending operations in FY81 aimed at expanding petroleum
production.L/  This project would represent the fourth Bank loan for petroleum
to Turkey. A gas development and distribution project is also under
preparation; a PPF for this purpose has been provided.
a.       Energy Sector Policies
2.27     The Bank has undertaken a comprehensive dialogue with the Government
on its energy policies through the Energy Assessment mission of 1981, which
identified key issues related to (i) the effectiveness of energy institutions,
(ii) energy planning, and (iii) the role of the private sector (both domestic
and foreign) in developing energy resources. These were subsequently
discussed with the authorities in November, 1982. An energy action program is
now being elaborated for inclusion in the policy discussions regarding the
next Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL IV).
2.28     Improving the effectiveness of energy institutions through reform of
the energy State Economic Enterprises (SEES) has been a foicus of Bank
attention for a number of years. Legislation for the reform of these
institutions, part of the SAL III Action Program, was passed in May 1983.  A
technical assistance project to assist in implementing the reforms for a
number of SEES, including the coal company, TKI, and the power company, TEK,
is under preparation.
2.29     In energy planning, a review of energy investments was initiated in
1980, as part of the public sector investments review. The investment review
provided the format for evaluating sectorial investment priorities, and was
instrumental in assisting the Government to decide which projects had to be
cut, or delayed, within their ambitious overall development program.  These
changes were incorporated in the SAL II Action Program. Subsequently, the
energy sector assessment recommended and the Government agreed that a fully
detailed review of all major energy projects, especially the capital intensive
schemes in the lignite subsector, be undertaken in the conl:ext of the
forthcoming 5-year plan (1984-88), and that the planning mechanism to
accomplish this within the Ministry of Energy be strengthened. In the field
of energy efficiency, the Government has strengthened. the concerned agencies
and has given a draft of a new energy savings law for energy consideration by
the Censultative Assembly.
2.30     The Bank's involvement in the petroleum subsector started in FY79 in
response to the Government's recognition of the critical imaportance of the
petroleum imports in the country's balance of payments. During this first
review of the petroleum subsector as a whole, two priority areas of attention
/  IBRD Loans 1916-TU (US$25.0 million) and 1917-TU (US$62.0 million), both
of November 1980.



- 17 -
were identified: (i) the need to provide a transfer of advanced technology to
develop existing resources, and (ii) the problems of effectively expanding
exploration activity in the country.
2.31     Turkey had already identified substantial quantities of heavy oil and
sands gas resources, but did not possess the advanced technology required to
develop them. To provide for this transfer of technology, an engineering loan
was approved in FY79 (S -13-TU), to finance a comparative study which
evaluated of alternative technologies for increasing the production of the
Bati Raman oil field, the largest oil field in Turkey (with reserves of two
hundred million tons and a recovery factor by primary means of less than one
percent). This study was followed by the Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery
Field Demonstration Project (1917-TU) which is helping to finance the field
trials of the C02 injection method, the technology chosen to increase
production. WhiIe project implementation started slowly due primarily to
initial delays in equipment procurement, it is now proceeding smoothly, with
the initial testing expected to begin in mid-1984. A number of international
oil companies have shown interest in lending personnel for the technology
panel that will review the initial results and advise on an optimum
strategy. It is believed that the results will show that the process is still
profitable at current petroleum prices.
2.32     The Bank review also identified the need to reevaluate the production
potential of the Hamitabat gas field in Thrace, a field which had been
discovered in 1971 and left undeveloped for almost a decade. As a result, the
second component of Loan 1917-TU was designed to test the usefulness of
advanced fracturing techniques to increase its gas production potential to a
point where development would become economically viable. The reservoir frac-
turing tests of the field demonstrated that sufficient gas could be produced
to justify the construction of a transmission pipeline to deliver the gas to
large consumers. As a result, TPAO is developing the field and planning a
transmission pipeline. Having proved that gas can be produced profitably in
Thrace, TPAO is also expanding its gas exploration program in the Thrace Basin
to increased supplies.
2.33     In exploration, it was found that in 1979 the petroleum sector was,
defacto, closed to the private sector, and that the state oil company had not
adequately focused its own exploration program on high priority, high
potential areas. In its policy dialogue with the Government, the Bank has
placed major emphasis on the need for strategies for stimulating private
sector involvement in petroleum exploration, and the Government has taken a
number of important measures, including, on the one hand, encouraging foreign
companies by putting wellhead oil prices at an international level, and allow-
ing companies to export a third of their new oil and, on the other hand,
providing more opportunities to foreign companies by making TPAO reduce its
acreage holdings and encouraging it to make joint venture agreements on the
acreage it continues to hold. These niew policies have been instrumental in
changing the environment from what prevailed between 1978 and 1980, when no
new exploration activities were undertaken by foreign companies to the encour-
aging environment that it is today, with five new foreign oil companies have
obtained exploration licenses and have undertaken substantial seismic work and
three are Dlannine to drill exDloration wells in 1984. In the lost year TPAO
has also negot_ated3 agreements wIT.th three coamnAn4  fr joint ventuire
projects. Furthermore, in April 1983, a revised Petroleum Law was enacted



- 18 -
which should further improve the investment climate for foreign oil
companies. Thus, while the process of attracting foreign oil companies is now
well underway, it has not produced concrete results as fast as the Bank had
originally anticipated, primarily because the current petroleum market
situation has greatly reduced the level of exploration undertaken by
international companies.
2.34     On the institutional side, with the advice of the Bank, TPAO and the
Government have taken important measures to resolve major organizational
staffing, financial and managerial difficulties that TPAO was facing at the
time of the first loans. Those matters are discussed more fully in Section V,
paragraphs 5.05 through 5.14, of this r,eport.
2.35     The subsector planning dialogue has also helped refocus TPAO's
exploration program on high priority prospects consistent with its limited
exploration budget. The Petroleum Exploration Project 1916-TU was designed to
assist TPAO find better leads for its exploration undertakings; primarily
through basin studies, geophysical (seisimic) surveys, and the drilling of a
few key exploration wells in Southeast Turkey. Initial project implementation
was slow, and the review of the first round of the geophysical surveys and
basin studies showed that the results did not meet original expectations.
This new technical information contribut:ed to the reevaluation of TPAO's
exploration priorities and the shift to gas. In view of the upgrading of the
gas potential of the Hamitabat field ancl the subsequent gas finds at nearby
locations, it was agreed to expand the scope of 1916-TU to include further
exploration in the Thrace basin. This has enabled TPAO to expand its seismic
data acquisition program in 1983 in order to provide detailed seismic coverage
of the locations to be drilled in 1984 under the proposed project.
2.36     Turkey has yet to produce any significant commercial quantities of
gas, and is in the beginning stages of formulating a gas development
strategy. Foreign companies have shown no interest in exploring for or devel-
oping gas reserves, partly because of the lack of an officLal gas utilization
policy and available marketing infrastructure. The essential steps to rectify
this situation include making an inventory of the total available supplies of
gas in the Thrace basin and providing the infrastructure and contractual
framework to enable companies to profitably distribute gas to consumers. The
proposed gas exploration project and the gas distribution project to be
appraised in the near future (and for which a PPF has been provided) would
support such a policy. Additional gas discoveries in the Thrace basin and the
development of the infrastructure required to move the gas from Thrace to the
market would also provide incentives to private companies to participate in
gas exploration in Thrace.

III. THE PROJECT
Introduction
3.01     Exploration for hydrocarbons in Thrace has led to the discovery of
one medium sized gas field and two small oilfields. In addition, in numerous
previous exploration wells, widely spaced over the basin, oil and gas shows
have been encountered. Despite these encouraging indications, past
exploration activity has been slow and sporadic; important geological
parameters, such as quality and distribution of source rocks, reservoir rocks
and geological trapping structures were not well understood in the Thrace
basin. As a result no systematic exploration strategy had been developed.
Instead exploration efforts were focused on SE Turkey where the oil potential
was more promising and better understood.
3.02     More recently, successful exploration drilling on the part of TPAO
has firmly demonstrated the hydrocarbon potential of the basin. It is now
known that, at least in some areas, source rocks and reservoir rocks are
present and geological conditions were appropriate for the expelling and
migration of hydrocarbons from the source rocks to the reservoir rocks.
Furthermore, many geological structures have been identified, several of which
appear to have closures that may have trapped the hydrocarbons, impeding their
further migration. The proposed project aims at assisting TPAO in the
establishment and development of the hydrocarbon potential of their
exploration license areas, by extending assistance in the acquisition of key
exploration data and the drilling of strategic exploration wells. Additional
information on the country's hydrocarbon potential can be found in Annex 3.1.
3.03     TPAO holds 14 licences in District 1, which covers the Thrace Basin;
twelve are located in the northern part of the basin and two in the
central/southern part. Other private companies hold another 14: five are
held by Weeks Petroleum (US) and Turkish partners, five by Demirsu (local
operator), two by Oxoco International (US) and two by Transturk (local
operator). Most of these licences are in the center of the basin. Because of
the depths involved, exploring in these areas is riskier and more expensive
than exploring on most of TPAO's licences, particularly on those licenses
where the Project's exploration drilling is proposed to take place. However,
TPAO is the only active operator. The c,ther companies have remained largely
inactive, due to shortages of funds, lack of technical expertise, or both.
Most of their licences were obtained in 1980, and will have to be surrendered
in the course of 1983, due to non-implementation of minimum work requirements
during the three year exploration period. TPAO is unlikely to acquire any of
these licenses, first because under the new Petroleum Law it will only be able
to hold 12 licenses in a district and, second, because it will have as large
an exploration program as it can handle with its existing licenses. It is
hoped that discoveries by TPAO and the presence of gas distribution infra-
structure would encourage other companies to undertake exploration on the
licenses that are relinquished to the Government.

The Hydrocarbon Potential of the Thrace Basin
a.        Petroleum Geology
3.04     The Thrace Basin is one of many that fringe the Alpine Mountain Chain
in Europe and the Middle East.  Many of these basins are prolific producers of
hydrocarbons (Vienna basin, Pannonian basin, Transsylvanian basin). Some
basins have had a long history of exploration; and the lessons learned there
are useful in developing an exploration strategy for Thrace. The main
prospective area of the basin, measuring some 140 km from east to west and
about 100 km from north to south, is located in Turkish territory (see Map
IBRD 17111). Geological subsidence that led to the basirn as known today
commenced in early Tertiary times, and continued uninterruptedly until very
recent times (Plio/Pleistocene). In the deepest part of the basin up to
10,000 meters of Tertiary sediments are known. Rock sequences so deposited
are mainly sandstones and dark (bitumiLnous) shales.  While a large part of the
Thrace basin underwent rapid subsidence in its initial stage of formation,
several areas, particularly along its edges lagged behind.  When these were
covered by shallow seas, reefal sediments (corals) were deposited. If not
altered by subsequent geological events, such sediments could become highly
prolific reservoirs.
b.       Reservoir Rocks
3.05     There is no scarcity of reserlvoir rocks in the Thrace basin.  Many
sand bearing reservoir intervals have been recognized, the most important of
which are the Hamitabat formation, the Ceylan formation and the Osmancik
formation. The composition and quality of those reservoirs vary widely and
are not yet fully understood. While reservoir qualities related to maximum
productivity of a well are generally mediocre, it has been shown in one
reservoir that hydrofracturing could be successfully applied to substantially
increase this productivity. This wide variation in reservoir quality and
occurrence of gas, as well as a general disinterest in gas prone areas unless
the potential was large, were major deterrents to aggressive hydrocarbon
exploration by the large oil companies
c.       Source Rocks
3.06     Apparent source rocks have been identified from various stratigraphic
intervals. In the Hamitabat field, it is believed that shales within the
Hamitabat formation itself were the original reservoir rocks that provided the
hydrocarbon source for the traps.  In the outcrop areas fringing the southern
part of the basin, formations of the same age, rich in organic material and
with definite source rock potential, have been found as having older
stratigraphical layers consisting predominantly of shales containing very high
amounts of organic matter. Special geological studies are needed, however to
determine the richness of these source rocks, their areal extent and their
efficiency in expelling hydrocarbons under suitable thermal conditions. This
information will have a direct bearing on future exploratiLon strategies to be
employed.



- 21 -
d.       Structures
3.07     There is no scarcity of geological structures capable of retaining
oil and gas accumulations. A review of TPAO's geological maps shows a
bewildering array of simple anticlinal turnovers, fault traps, stratigraphic-
type traps, basement horsts etc. So far, detailed mapping has been restricted
to only a few areas. In several of TPAO's blocks, large gaps exist in seismic
coverage. To arrive at a more complete inventory of trapping structures,
additional seismic data are required.
e.       Past Exploration
3.08     Systematic exploration operations in the Thrace basin started in the
mid-1950's, after the passage of the Turkish Petroleum Law. Several foreign
oil companies and the then newly-created state petroleum corporation, TPAO,
commenced geological and geophysical work. Operations at first focussed on
the northern edge of the basin where reef prospects were quickly recognized.
Later, seismic surveys were profiled in the central, deeper part of the basin.
3.09     The most important foreign operators were Caltex (US), Esso (US),
Gulf (US), Mobil (US) and Shell (Netherlands/UK). Through the sixties and
early seventies, foreign companies dril:Led 37 exploration wells. In the
deeper part of the basin several gas occurrences were encountered in the
Hamitabat and Ceylan formations. However, there was no incentive at that time
to explore for gas in relatively small structures. The overall results showed
that, although there was some oil potential, individual accumulation would be
so small as to be of no interest to the foreign oil companies. By the early
seventies foreign oil companies had left, and TPAO remained the only operator
of importance.
3.10     In 1971 TPAO discovered a gas accumulation in its wildcat
Hamitabat-1. Gas was not economic to develop at that time because the price
was low and there was no ready market at hand nor infrastructure for
distribution to potential consumption centers. Furthermore, TPAO wanted to
find oil to fill the growing gap between domestic demand and supply. As was
the case with most oil companies during this period, TPAO was interested only
in looking for and finding oil; finding gas was no better than finding
nothing. As a result, no further wells were drilled. Little more was done
until the early 1980's, when it was decided to undertake delineation drilling
to confirm the size of the field and to attempt to increase the gas flow by
fracturing the wells, (an operation financed under loan 1917-TU). Between
1980 and 1982, TPAO stepped up its exploration effort; the Hamitabat discovery
was fully appraised and eventually some 0.45 TCF (trillion cubic feet) of gas
reserves were established and further drilling led to oil and gas discoveries
in structures nearby: Umurca, Turgutbey, Tatarkoy. Three hydrocarbon bearing
horizons have by now been established (Hamitabat formation, Ceylan formation
and Osmancik formation).
f.       Geological Uncertainties, Strategy and Prognosis
3.11     Past exploration work in Thrace has now established that the basin
has a considerable exploration potential. The TPAO licences, the only ones
where modern exploration tools have been employed, contain a variety of
targets. Of particular importance are the reef-like prospects, along the



22
northern rim of the basin and on basement highs in its western part, and the
Hamitabat/Ceylan/Osmancik prospects in the deeper part of the basin. So far,
only gas reserves have been established in these prospects, but several deep
wells (awaiting testing) encountered also oil and condensates.
3.12     The principal geological uncertainties that remain to be resolved in
order to comprehensively assess the hydrocarbon potential of TPAO's licences
are the following: (i) the areal extension of each type of reservoir rock and
their composition related in particular to their capacity to store hydro-
carbons at depths greater than 4000 meters; (ii) the areaL extension of oil
and gas source rocks and their composition; and (iii) the distribution of
geological structures and their special. relations to oil and gas source
rocks. A full discussion of these geological issues is given in Annex 3.1.
3.13     A systematic geological study of the remaining TPAO licences has
revealed the presence of at least 15 geological structures that are
practically unexplored. Wells drilled on some of these structures were not
located in an optimum position, yet most provided encouraging geological data,
including oil and gas shows.
3.14     Although large gaps remain in the exploration coverage of TPAO's
licences, a provisional assessment of their hydrocarbon potential has been
undertaken. Results are encouraging. There is a high chance that additional
reserves (on the order of 1 TCF gas) could be present at liamitabat and its
immediate vicinity. Furthermore, the gas potential of al]L of TPAO's licences
could be several TCF. In order to establish this potential acquisition of
additional critical geophysical data and the drilling about 11 key exploration
wells is required.
Project Objective and Description
3.15     The project's main objective is to assess the hydLrocarbon potential
of TPAO's licenses in the Thrace basin as quickly and efficiently as
possible. The second important objective of the project is to strengthen
TPAO's ability to design and implement an integrated basir-oriented
exploration program. On the basis of a thorough review, cf the type and
nature of prospective fields in each of TPAO's licence area undertaken by Bank
and TPAO staff, it was determined that about 30 new exploration wells will
have to be drilled to arrive at a reliable estimate of the total hydrocarbon
potential of the Thrace basin. Of thesie, 75-80% would be directed towards
testing the Hamitabat, Ceylan and Osmancik reservoirs that are known to be gas
bearing in the Umurca and Hamitabat fields, with the remaining directed
towards the evaluation of the oil prospiects in the reef area in the northern
part of the basin. The project would cover the first stage of this
evaluation. It would include the completion of a full seismic grid on TPAO's
licenses of the Thrace basin (which includes most of the prospective areas of
the basin), detailed infill seismic mapping of areas with structures of
particular importance, and the drilling of wells to test about one third of
the most promising structures in four of the most prospective of TPAO'S
lisence areas. It is expected to take about three years to implement. The
final selection of individual prospects for testing will be based mainly on
the following criteria: (i) locations in the basin where the quality of
reservoirs can be reasonably predicted; or (ii) locations which, if



- 23 -
successful, would open up new prospective exploration targets (new plays) or
critical extensions of known plays. At the end of this program TPAO should be
in a position to make a much more accurate evaluation of the basin's
potential, on the basis of which it should be able to design an optimum
program to develop the region's resources. Plans for appraisal/development of
new discoveries would be made as soon as well tests showed the presence of
commercially viable quantities of gas.
3.16     The proposed project comprises the following components:
1.   Seismic Surveys and Seismic Interpretation.
Approximately 1800 line-km of seismic survey would be undertaken
under the project. About 1300 line-km would be used to complete the
seismic coverage of all of TPAO's licence areas to at least 4 km x 4
km grid size. This would enable TPAO to make a basin wide seismic
prospect map and regional seismiLc maps for potential producing
horizons. The other 500 line-kma would be used for infill seismic,
where detailed maps of exploratiLon prospects are needed to identify
the optimum drilling location.
2.   Rehabilitation of Drilling Rigs
The engines and mud processing equipment of three heavy duty (F 320)
drilling rigs owned by TPAO would be upgraded so that the rigs would
be capable of efficiently drill:Lng deep exploration wells.
3.   Exploration Drilling.
The drilling component includes eleven exploration wells in four of
TPAO's fourteen licence blocks iin Thrace. In total there would be
four deep wells (to about 4500 in), four medium wells (to about 3500
m), and three relatively shallow wells (to about 2,500 m).
4.   Casing, Cementing, Completion and Testing Programs.
Casing, cementing and testing would be required for all wells
drilled. Completion and producition testing would be required for all
wells that encounter significantF volumes of hydrocarbons. It is
estimated that five wells would need to be completed for production
testing.
5.   Studies
Two major categories of studies are likely to be required:
(a)  Geological and sedimentological studies will be undertaken in
order to determine: (i) tlhe composition and distribution of
source rocks and reservoir rocks and other geological parameters
that determine the size and production profiles of expected gas
accumulations; and (ii) the lithological composition and
physical parameters of sample cores and cuttings from each of
the proven reseroirs in order to predict reservoir trends; and

(b) After discoveries are made, development studies will be needed
to determine the optimum ways to develop these fields and, if
they are gas fields, to connect them to thLe gas distribution
network.
6.   Technical Assistance
Technical assistance would be necessary to supplement TPAO's staff in
areas where TPAO does not have adequate numbers of specialized
personnel, including the folLowing: mud engineering, high pressure
gas drilling, well completing, well testing, seismic field testing,
advanced seismic data processing and well geological and geophysical
data interpreting. In additiLon, in order to help TPAO remedy its
difficulties in financial planning and budgeting, it is proposed to
provide the services of an expatriate finacial adviser, with
considerable industry experience, over a two-year period. In total
the project would provide about 150 man-months of technical
assistance.
7.   Training
Provision has been made for short and long-term duration courses in
the areas of drilling technology, mud engineering, cementing of high
pressure gas well, and testing and completion procedures. In
addition, short seminars of about one week duration would be held in
TPAO's training center to keep field staff abreast of the latest
developments and assist them in coping with immediate operational
problems. Training would also be provided in advanced seismic
acquisition, processing and interpretation, and in financial
management and organization.  It is also proposed to provide a
language laboratory as a good knowledge of a foreign language is a
prerequisite for gaining access to advanced technical literature and
external training. In total, the Project would provide for 450 man-
months of training.
3.17     Petroleum exploration programs, by their nature, are subject to
modifications as new information becomes available. Therefore, the components
of the Project could, with justification, be significantly altered during the
implementation period, particularly the detailed scope and location of seismic
surveys, as well as the well drilling locations and drilling programs.
Furthermore, some of the prospects have not yet been sufficiently defined to
permit a judicious choice of drilling locations. Therefore, the initial
program in the Project area, to be agreed upon between TPAO and the Bank
during negotiations, would need to be continuously adjusted as the Project
proceeds; it would, therefore, be revised from time to time. Therefore, at
negotriations, assurance have been obtained from TPAO thaLt: (i) the Thrace
exploration and development programs will be submitted for review and
agreement by the Bank on an annual basis, and whenever they are significantly
revised; and (ii) for each well to be financed by the Bank under this Project,
TPAO will present a geological prognosis, benefit-risk analysis and well
drilling program for the Bank's approval, not later than one month before site
preparation is to start at the proposed drilling location. The above
arrangements are considered satisfactory.

Project Implementation
a.       Seismic
3.18     The 1,800 line-km of seismic data acquisition (equivalent to 24 crew-
months) would be carried out by an international specialized contractor under
the supervision of qualified TPAO personnel. The seismic data would be
processed in TPAO's new seismic center (to be commissioned during 1983), along
with the approximately 900 line-km of seismic for the Thrace basin that is
being acquired during the 1983 season under loan 1916-TU. A limited amount of
specialized processing may have to be carried out outside Turkey. TPAO would
be responsible for seismic mapping (aimed at defining drillable prospects),
interpretation/compilation of seismic data, mapping of subtle stratigraphic
traps, and mapping important horizons (throughout the entire basin) in order
to arrive at an early ranking of the license areas.
3.19     TPAO has now sufficient experienced personnel to supervise seismic
data acquisition, and carry out data interpretation and mapping. A Thrace
basin project group, headed by an experienced geologist, has already been
formed in the exploration department. TPAO also intends to hire consultants,
as required, to assist in these tasks. The above arrangements are considered
satisfactory.
b.       Drilling
3.20     An exploration drilling program requires the input of a large number
of specialized services, each of which is generally contracted for on a job-
by-job basis. Among the most important are: (i) electric logging services,
(ii) mud services, (iii) cementing services, (iv) well testing services,
(v) well completion and fracturing services, and, of course, (vi) drilling
services. All of these services will be coordinated and supervised by TPAO,
the company that is responsible for the exploration program. Although in
order to conserve on foreign exchange TPAO has been carrying out many of the
specialized services themselves, TPAO has agreed with the Bank's
recommendation that, for this project, specialized international firms would
be employed to carry out these critical well service activities.
3.21     TPAO would carry out the drilling with its rigs and crew personnel,
under the already well established Thrace District drilling group. The
decision to have TPAO undertake the drilling is based on the technical grounds
that: (i) TPAO is technically competent to undertake the job; (ii) it can do
it substantially more economically than can a foreign contractor; (iii) it can
do it without increasing the size of its drilling department; and (iv) it
would use these same drilling rigs and crews to continue its exploration
drilling program well beyond the end of the proposed project. These reasons
are discussed in greater detail below.
(i)    TPAO is fully capable of implementing the exploration drilling
program in the Thrace basin. In total, it has drilled over 300
wells of all depths since it was established almost 30 years ago,
and has successfully drilling and completing 23 deep (4,000 m)
wells in the Hamitabat gas field in Thrace. Performance has
generally been up to international industry standards. While TPAO
has recently had some drilling and completion difficulties in



- 26 -
Thrace, these difficulties were caused almost entirely by the use
of inferior and often inadequate local substitutes for normally
imported drilling materials (primarily local cement and mud
chemicals) and to a lack of spare parts needed to keep the rigs at
full capacity operation. The problems were exacerbated because the
poorly designed mud-handling and power-train equipment on the new
rigs (bought from Romania in the late 1970's) increased the level
of mechanical failures. A1:L of these problems can be traced to the
unavailability of foreign exchange and the subsequent decisions to
use substandard locally avaiLlable materials and spares rather than
from inappropriate drilling technology or difficult drilling
conditions. In spite of these handicaps, TPAO had demonstrated
good drilling ability and the difficulties can be adequately
surmounted through the import of proper drilling products and
equipment as proposed under this project. Demonstration of the
improved results would allow TPAO to strengthen its drilling
performance overall, by makiing it easier to obtain foreign exchange
for these critical items for its other operations.
(ii)   The use of TPAO's drilling rigs, supported by the hiring of
specialized international service companies to undertake
specialized related work (as opposed to hiring foreign drilling
rigs and specialized service companies), is the most cost-effective
method of implementing the project. The base cost (before price
and physical contingencies) of using foreign rigs with foreign
crews is estimated at $32 million in foreign exchange. TPAO's
comparable full cost rig operation for implementing the project
(including overhead, depreciation and maintenance) is about US$19
million or about 60% of the cost of a foreign rig.l/ Furthermore,
the foreign crews are unlikely to complete the job more quickly
than TPAO, since they would be unfamiliar with the drilling
conditions of the basin.
(iii)  The eleven-well drilling program would represent a time slice
(about three years) of TPAO's long-term exploration drilling
program for the Thrace Basin which, itself, is part of a larger
exploration drilling program throughout Turkey. The Thrace Basin
program is expected to include about thirty exploration wells, and,
if gas is found in a reasonable number of prospects, at least an
additional thrity delineation and production wells over the next
ten years. However, since its overall drilling program is being
somewhat reduced in response to fiscal constraLnts imposed by the
Government, TPAO does not need to expand its drilling department
for the proposed Thrace Basin program.
The US$19 million does include 30% of the cost of the rig rehabilitation,
since the usefulness of the referbished rigs would extend well beyond the life
of the proposed project. However, some of the included expenses are not
out-of-pocket expenses for TPAO, since they would continue as part of the
normal operation of the company even if foreign contractors were used for the
drilling in Thrace.



- 27 -
3.22     In order to ensure the implementation of this arrangement, whereby
TPAO's drilling activity is supported by foreign specialized service
companies, assurances have been obtained that TPAO will hire, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, specialized firms to: perform all the
well services (e.g. mud services, cementing, testing, electric logging,
completions). In addition, should other specialized drilling services be
required (i.e., deviation drilling, fishing, etc.), TPAO will also hire firms
to supervise this work and to train TPAO's personnel.
3.23     The equipment procured for the rehabilitation of the three rigs would
be installed by TPAO, with the assistance of personnel from the manufacturers,
who would also assist in the testing of the equipment before it is
contractually accepted by TPAO. This arrangement is in line with industry
practice, and is satisfactory. The fourth rig, a medium duty type (F200)
would be used for the shallower wells; no rehabilitation would be required for
this rig.
Implementation Schedule
3.24     Initial seismic data acquisition required in the implementation of
this project is already in progress - the 1983 seismic program is being
financed under Loan 1916-TU (para. 2.33). The seismic program under this
project would be carried out during the 1984 and 1985 seasons (from April to
October).
3.25     The necessary rig rehabilitation program would be initiated during
the second half of 1983, in order to permit the drilling program to start in
early 1984. Drilling of 10 to 11 wells would be carried out over 1984-86,
about one year behind the seismic program. The implementation schedule
appears in Annex 3.2.

Project Cost
3.26     The cost of the project is estimated at US$98.9 million, including
contingencies. The project is exempted from custom duties and taxes. The
foreign exchange component is estimated al: US$55.2 million, or about 56% of
total cost. The detailed cost estimate is in Annex 3.3; supporting
assumptions are in Annex 3.4. The cost estimate can be summarized as follows:

The cost estimate is expressed in early-1983 prices, and is based on bids
received by TPAO for materials and services and quotes from suppliers.
Drilling rig costs are TPAO's own costs. The 25% cost contingency for
drilling is reasonable, given that this is an exploration project. All
wildcat wells (wells in new areas) require large contingencies to cover
unknown nature of possible problems.  With regard to technical assistance, the
average man-month cost was estimated at US$18,000 inclusive for seismic,
US$23,000 for drilling, and US$13,000 for the financial adviser. These costs,
while relatively high, reflect the current levels of emoluments given to
senior oil industry specialists.

Items Proposed for Bank-Financing
3.28     It is proposed that the full direct foreign exchange costs of the
project be financed by the Bank. This :Lncludes: (i) equipment and materials
for rehabilitation and drilling of aboul eleven wells; (ii) services required
for logging cementing, completing and testing the wells; (iii) seismic data
acquisition and interpretation program; and (iv) technical assistance,
training and studies required to implement the project. The aggregate foreign
exchange requirements of all these items, including the front-end fee, which
the Government requested the bank to finance, amounts to US$55.2 million. A
Bank loan for this amount is proposed. The allocation of the bank funds is
shown below:

Financing Plan
3.29     The project accounts for about 14% of TPAO's TL 137.4 billion
(US$723.0 million) investment program over the period 1983--86. A financing
plan for TPAO's investment program appears at paragraph 6.2L4.
3.30     Taking into account the anticipated financing patterns of TPAO's
investment program, the Project would be financed as follows:
Project Finanicing Plan
TL Billion        US$ MiLllion        Percent
Internal Cash Generation                   4.2               21.9                 22
Government (Decree 20 funds)                4.1              21.8                 22
Proposed IBRD                             10.5               55.2                 56
18.8              98..9_              100
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government would
promptly provide, or cause TPAO to be provided, on terms arid conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, any additional funds that would be required to
complete the Project. The proposed Bank loan would, theref'ore, cover the full
foreign exchange cost of the project.
3.31     The estimated schedule of disbursements of the Banik Loan appears in
Annex 3.6. The loan would be made to TPAO over seventeen yrears, including a
four-year grace period. TPAO would bear the foreign exchanige and interest
risks. The long maturity is appropriate considering that this is an
exploration project.
Procurement
3.32      International competitive bidding procedures in accordance with Bank
guidelines will be followed in the procurement of seismic contractors, rigs
rehabilitation equipment, casings, tubings, drilling bits, wellheads and
christmas trees, mud products, rig parts and completion equLipment (all
together about US$40 million worth of equipment and services).
3.33     Limited international tendering procedures would lie followed where
only a few suppliers, worldwide, are capable of providing the goods and
services. This would be the case for casing accessories, specialized bits
including core bits), API quality cement and additives, litter hangers, special
chemicals, completion equipment, stimulation products, cementing, logging,
testing and stimulation services, and production testing maLterials (altogether
approximately US$8 million worth of equipment and services). Direct shopping
through TPAO's procedures (with three quotations), which are satisfactory,
would be followed for the equipment for the language laboraLtory, urgent rig
parts and other drilling equipment; each order would cost less than US$100,000
equivalent and aggregate procurement under this category Shall not exceed
US$2.0 million.



- 31 -
3.34     Contract Review:  All bidding packages for works and goods estimated
to cost US$200,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation, resulting in a coverage of about (5% of the total
estimated value of work contracts and 95% of goods contracts. The balance of
contracts would be subject to random post review by the Bank after contract
award. The percentage is high because TPAO is unable to afford the risk of
unexpected misprocurement resulting in cancellation of funds.
3.35     Consultants, and technical assistance personnel would be recruited in
accordance with Bank guidelines, and appointed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank and the borrower.
3.36     Advance contracting (of about $7.0 million) is proposed for the rigs
rehabilitation equipment. This decision was taken in order to enable TPAO to
start drilling in early-1984, which is only possible if orders for the
equipment are placed before June, 1983. Bank agreement for advance
contracting was only given after: (i) it was ensured that TPAO followed
procurement practices consistent with IBRD guidelines; (ii) TPAO and GOT were
advised that the contracts would be awarded at their own risk, and did not
commit the Bank in any way to make a loan for this Project; and (iii) the
Executive Directors were advised of this possibility through the Monthly
Operational Summary. No retroactive finacing would be required.
Reporting Requirements
3.37     In accordance with industry practice and in order to allow the Bank
to reach an informed judgement on the progress of the project, weekly telexes
summarizing the drilling status of the wells including casing, cementing,
testing, and all other auxilliary services should be sent to the Bank.
Monthly reports, covering technical progress of the seismic work, wells,
drilling, well locations preparation, procurement status, and funds
committed/spent should also be provided. In addition, interim and final
reports on drilled wells, completions, testing results, and development
reserve studies would also be submitted to the Bank from time to time.
Finally, comprehensive quarterly technical progress reports and semi-annual
financial status reports would be sent to the Bank during the execution of the
project, as well as a completion report at the end of the project.
Ecology and Safety
3.38     The seismic and drilling operations will take place in a sparsely
populated agricultural area. Geophysical survey lines and drilling locations
would be selected with a view to avoid close proximity to habitation and water
wells, if and when they are present. All water zones including surface source
water will be protected by following oil well drilling standards. TPAO will
contain and clean up any contamination that originated above the surface from
drilling-mud pits.



- 3.2 -
3.39     Exploration drilling in high-pressure gas zones entails some risks of
blowouts and possibly fire. The risk is minimized by using: (i) blowout
preventers; and (ii) sophisticated equipment introduced in the mud logging

IV. PROJECT RISKS AND JUSTIFICATION
Nature of the Risks
4.01     The Thrace basin is highly prospective.  Proven recoverable reserves
are already over 0.4 TCF. There are excellent prospects of finding an
additional 2 TCF of commercially recoverable gas reserves (about 50 MMTOE)
with a total value over the life of the fields of nearly US$10 billion; and
there are possibilities for finding substantially more. However, as with most
exploration projects where the potential range of final results is large and
the probability of each outcome can only be estimated by a rough approxi-
mation, one cannot calculate a meaningful economic rate of return. The
justification for the project, therefore, rests on a qualitative assessment of
three types of risks: geological, technical and economic. After careful
evaluation by TPAO and the Bank, the conclusion reached is that all of these
risks are low, and have been minimized through an appropriately flexible
design of the project.
4.02     The geological risk is that insufficient volumes of hydrocarbons will
be found to justify the exploration expense. The risks, or probabilities, of
finding hydrocarbons in any area represents an overall judgment of the
exploration geologists after they have taken into account the knowledge of
source rocks, reservoir rocks, types of traps available, success with similar
structures in Thrace, and success in similar basins elsewhere in the world.
Annex 4.1 describes these geological factors in some detail, along with
alternative methods of evaluating a basin's potential. At best, then the
probabilities can be taken as indicative, and not as the results of fully
developed, sophisticated statistical models of the basin. With this
understanding, the risks in the four blocks where the drilling is proposed,
can be described as follows:
(i)    In License 2323, there are good chances for finding commercial gas
bearing Osmancik and Ceylan reservoirs in the central and eastern
part of the Licence, where two wells would be drilled. Chances for
finding well developed Hamitabat reservoirs are lower but still
reasonable. In the western part of the License pronounced basement
highs have been mapped on which reefal reservoirs may occur. This
is a new play which needs to be tested; one well would be drilled.
(ii)   In Licence 1978, about 70% of the licence is underlain by shallow
basement which offers reef prospects. The southwestern part is
separated from the shallow basement area by extensive faults which
can be followed into the Hamitabat area. Along one of these
faults, excellent prospects have been mapped, and one is presently
being tested, Delen-1. This well encountered high gas readings in
the Hamitabat formation and in fractured basement rocks. Two wells
would be drilled here. In the northwestern part extensions of the
Tatarkoy structure and the Turgutbey structure have been mapped.
Two additional wells would be drilled here.
(iii) Licence 1945 has one gas field (Hamitabat) and three discoveries
(Tatarkoy, Turgutbey and Yesilkoy) that are potential
gas/condensate producers. In the northeastern part of the licence,



- 34 -
two small oilfields have been found, Osmancik and Devecatagi. A
number of additional, shallow (oil) prospects have been identified;
drilling of these awaits geological and seismic reinterpretation,
now underway. The presence of numerous untested structural leads
at the Hamitabat level makes the area especially prospective. Two
wells would be drilled. There is a high chance that seismic
mapping and reinterpretation will lead to a number new drillable
structures.
(iv)   Licence 2140 is located entLrely in the basinal area; with
Osmancik, Ceylan and Hamitabat formation objectives. One well,
Kaynarca, presently drilling, encountered gas in Ceylan and
Hamitabat reservoirs. A weLl drilled by Caltex, Vakiflar, was
suspended in gas bearing Ceylan reservoirs. The location of the
licence, in trend with the Elamitabat and Umurca fields, makes it
highly prospective. Two weLls would be drilled.
4.03     The problem of most exploration programs is that of finding a balance
between low risk, low reward activities and high risk, high reward ones.
While some risks (such as drilling offshore in the Black Sea) are probably
excessive and should be avoided by TPAO), too cautious an approach could lead
to large regions remaining unexplored, and possible substantial losses, since
large volumes of hydrocarbons may not be found. One needs, therefore, to
balance the geological risks of drilling dry holes against the potential gains
in production that finding new reserves would make possible. In the proposed
Thrace basin program an appropriate balance has been sought by focusing most
of the activities on the short-term objective of proving additional reserves
as quickly as possible (through drilling well understood, low risk prospects),
while aiming some at the long-term objective of finding as much of the
existing hydrocarbons as possible (through evaluating the potential of the
basin as a whole). The former objective would be met by drilling prospects
that are in close proximity to and on trend with the Hamiltabat and Umurca
fields, where the probability of finding hydrocarbons is highest. These wells
would account for 75% to 85% of the drilling program. The latter objective
would be met, first, through studies thtat focus on assessLng the prospects of
areas further away from Hamitabat, where less is now known, and then, through
drilling of prospects that would be further afield from the Hamitabat trend,
or aimed at untested horizons that were similar to proven plays in other
inter-alpine basins. The information gained would then form the basis for
developing a second phase exploration and drilling program for Thrace.
4.04     To minimize the geological risks, the design of the proposed project
has included the following provisions:
(i)    exploration drilling would be limited to only 4 of the most
prospective of the 14 licence areas that TPAO holds in the basin;
(ii)   most of the drilling would be focussed on the lIamitabat-Umurca gas
trend, which has proven productive potential;
(iii)  the entire Thrace exploration program would be reassessed by the
Bank and TPAO on an annual basis; significant new data that might
alter the program would be reviewed as it becomes available;



- 35 -
(iv)   all locations would be evaluated with detailed infill seismic and
fully mapped before drilling was approved; and
(v)    substantive additional basin geophysical studies would be
undertaken before drilling were considered in new gas plays.
4.05     The technical risk is that the Project may not be completed
efficiently due to difficulty in drilling and testing the exploratory wells.
This risk is considered low because: (i) TPAO has already drilled a number of
wells in the basin and is fairly familiar with the geological conditions that
it must work with; and (ii) most of the drilling is fairly straightforward,
and there is little likelihood of encountering abnormally high formation
pressures, which are the primary cause of drilling failures in deep wells.
The project has been designed to minimize the technical risk through: (i)
rehabilitating the rigs that would undertake drilling in Thrace; (ii) ensuring
that imported materials would be used where they are critical to the success
of the drilling operation, (i.e. mud additives and API oilwell cement); (iii)
ensuring that foreign contractors would be used for highly specialized jobs
(such as electric logging, cementing and testing); and (iv) providing training
and technical assistance to TPAO's drilling department.
4.06     The economic risk is that eveni if hydrocarbons are found, the
recoverable quantities will be inadequate to provide an acceptable return on
investment capital required to develop the reserves and bring them to the
market. Although this is often a problem for offshore exploration, where
development costs are very high, it is a problem onshore only when gas
reserves are found far from a potentiaL market. Since a gas distribution
system is already under preparation for the distribution of gas from the
Hamitabat field in Thrace, to the major industrial markets in and around
Istanbul, the cost of connecting new gas discoveries to this system will be
quite low. Fields with productivities as low as two million cubic feet per
day (producing .015 TCF or 350,000 TOE, over 20 years) could be economically
connected to the central distribution grid.
4.07     As there are some oil occurrences (two small fields - Osmancik and
Devecetagi - plus good shows in severaL other wells) oil possibilities should,
obviously, be evaluated. However, due to the absence of any geochemical
study, predictions as to the occurrence and distribution of oil are not
possible at the present time; volumes, in any event, are likely to be small.
In fact, the basin wide geochemical stiudy included in the project scope would
focus on this aspect. Exploration for oil at present would, however, be too
risky, and should only be considered after the studies under the present
project have provided some additional information.
4.08     For the evaluation of the total potential reserves of TPAO's licences
in the Thrace Basin, one needs to take into account proven reserves
(Hamitabat), probable reserves (Umurca, etc.), and possible reserves from
structures that need to be tested, including those to be tested in this
project and those to be tested in the following phase of TPAO's exploration
program.
4.09     For proven reserves, one knows with near 100% certainty that the
Hamitabat field contains at least 0.45 TCF of gas reserves. For probable
reserves, three exploration wells in the general vicinity of Hamitabat



- 36 -
(Turgutbey, Tatorkoy and Umurca) have encountered gas. SiLnce the reservoirs
in these fields are similar geologically to those in Hamitabat and, according
to the seismic data, structures in the trapping area could be similar to that
of Hamitabat, one can put an 80% probability on each of these fields having
total reserves about equal to almost one half those of Harnitabat's; a 90%
probability can then be associated with the finding of an additional 0.2 TCF
of gas, 60% of finding 0.4 TCF and about 50% of finding O. 6 TCF from these
fields where an exploration well has already been drilled and gas has been
discovered.
4.10     For possible reserves from structures that would be drilled under the
proposed project, it is believed that the probability is about 50% for finding
gas in any one location. Using the reasonable assumptions that the
probabilities of finding hydrocarbons were independent in each license block,
and that on average, if gas were found, the total find in the block would be
half the size of Hamitabat (i.e. 0.225 TCF), and that eleven structures would
be tested, the joint probability of finding gas in at least one license (i.e.,
finding 0.225 TCF) would be about 99%, and the joint probability of finding
gas in five of the eleven structures (i.e., 1.1 TCF) would be about 50%.
There would be about a ten percent chance of finding at least 1.8 TCF.
4.11     For the possible reserves in addition to the locations that are
proposed to be tested in this project ait least 15 geological trapping
structures have already been identified.. As there is a large area that has
not been covered by seismic, there rema:Lns a good chance that complete seismic
coverage of TPAO's licences would lead t:o the identification of (conserva-
tively) five additional structures. Furthermore, since there are indications
that the critical hydrocarbon producing geological conditions are also present
(although little is known about their quality), there is a possibility that
all of the traps could hold large quantiLties of hydrocarbons.  However, the
chance that all of the structures would contain hydrocarbons is exceedingly
small. In addition to each needing to have a sealed trap that kept the
hydrocarbons in place once they had arrived, the following preconditions would
have had to occurred: (i) favorable source rocks need to be present nearby;
(ii) the local geothermal history had to allow hydrocarbon generation to take
place; and (iii) the structures must contain reservoirs in the same
stratigraphic level as Hamitabat. Therefore, given the limited availability
of data on the geological conditions and parameters, one ca,:n only put a
probability of about 30% on each structure bearing about half the gas of
Hamitabat.  If the chances of each field having gas were independent, and if
one assumed simply that each structure held either 0.225 TCF or nothing, then,
statistically, the joint probability of finding gas in at 'Least 8 of the 20
structures would be about 10%. The upper bound of expectat:ions would, then,
be another 1.8 TCF for TPAO's licence areas that are not being tested under
the proposed project.
4.12     The entire TPAO licences would, then, have a maximum potential of
about 4.6 TCF; 1.0 from Hamitabat and the fields (like Umurca) that have
already been drilled, 1.8 from the prospects that are proposed to be tested
under this loan, and another 1.8 from the rest of the prospects.

Benefit-Cost Analysis
4.13     Exploration projects have too great a variance in possible outcomes
with too wide a range of probabilities associated with each, to lend
themselves conveniently to economic rate of return calculations. Instead, the
critical factor in benefit-cost analysis is the minimum size of discovery that
is needed to obtain an acceptable economic rate of return to a combined
exploration and development program; (i.e., the minimum discovery that would
pay for exploration program). This minimum size will, of course, depend to
some extent on the timing of the discovery, the cost of developing it, and the
distance from the discovery to the trunk line of the gas distribution
network. If the cost of developing the field is similar to that of
Hamitabatl/, and most of the infrastructure is already in place due to the
development of Hamitabat, then a new field with as little as 0.11 TCF of
recoverable gas reserves would be adequate to provide a 15% rate of return to
the entire project (see Annex 4.1 for details).
4.14     Excluding the first 1.0 TCF of gas (which is associated with past
exploration activity), the expected outcome of the exploration program (which
is, statistically the mean) is an addition to reserves of approximately 1.1
TCF, about ten times the minimum quantity required to give the project an
acceptable internal rate of return, and the probability of finding this
minimum addition to recoverable reserves (i.e., about 0.11 TCF) is above 95%.
Conclusion
4.15     In conclusion, the risks of the Project have been identified and
taken fully into consideration in the design of the project. The geological
risk is managable because the basin has proven hydrocarbon production and the
exploration program, as designed jointly by the Bank and TPAO, maximizes the
probability of finding new reserves. The technical risk is small because the
drilling conditions are well understood, and the proposed project has included
the strengthening of TPAO through the introduction of external technical
support. The economic risk is small because the basin is near the largest
industrial market in Turkey; the costs of distributing additional gas supplies
to this market will be quite low after the trunk pipeline, needed for the
development of existing reserves, is completed. Finally, the overall project
risk is small because the minimum size discovery required to provide an
acceptable economic rate of return is less than one tenth the expected size of
the anticipated discoveries.
4.16     However, in the final analysis the project is justified not because
the risks are small, but because potential benefits to the Turkish economy are
large. The volumes of gas that this project could potentially make available
would have a dramatic impact on the balance of payments and on the energy use
patterns of the potential consuming industries in the highly industrialized
Istanbul environs. It is for this reason that the Project constitutes a
priority component in Turkey's energy program. It is a project for which the
Bank's technical and financial support is highly justified.
The Hamitabat field is to be developed over 1983-85.

V. TH]E BORROWER
General
5.01     Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi (TPAO) was established in 1954
to explore, find, develop, produce and refine petroleum products in Turkey
as well as "store, transport, sell and distribute petroleum and petroleum
products produced by its own resources, or obtained from other sources".
Created by Law 6433 of March 7, 1954, TPAO is structured as a private joint
stock company operating under Turkey's commercial law as well as the Petroleum
Law, also of March 7, 1954. TPAO's subscribed capital at present is TL 10.0
billion (US$52.6 million). TPAO is effectively controlled by the Ministry of
Finance (93.9% of the stock), and the remainder of the stock is owned by
national banks, pension funds and insurance companies (6.1%).
5.02     The Petroleum Law gives TPAO0, as the national oil company,
preferential treatment in terms of the number of exploration licenses that it
can hold; otherwise, TPAO is treated 'Like any other oil company operating in
Turkey, i.e., TPAO is subject to the l:axation regime of petroleum companies
including Decree 20 and Stabilization Fund.
5.03     Unlike private oil companies, however, TPAO has only limited autonomy
and, in several respects, it is treated by the Government like State Economic
Enterprises (SEEs). In particular, it:s investment budget must be approved by
the State Planning Office (SPO); its salary structure is determined in
consultation with the national High Arbitration Committee, and senior
appointments require the approval of the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (MENR).
Scope of Activities
5.04     One can make a distinction between three categories of activities for
TPAO:
1.   Petroleum Exploration and Production:  TPAO started its
activities with the take!-over of two producing fields in S.E.
Turkey from the Mineral Exploration and Research Institute
(MTA). Today, the Batman District in S.E. Turkey remains the
main focus of TPAO's exploration and production activities. In
recent years, promising discoveries have bieen made in Thrace,
and it is expected that this region will take increasing
importance in the coming years. TPAO has also signed joint-
venture agreements with a number of foreign oil companies since
1981, in accordance with the new policy to invite foreign
concerns to explore in lurkey.
2.   Petroleum Refining:  TPAO owns and operates two refineries
located at Batman (S.E. Turkey) and Izmir (S.W. Turkey). The
first processes crude oil produced in S.E. Turkey by TPAO, and,
to a lesser extent, foreign oil companies, while the second
processes imported crude oil. A new refiniery is under
construction near Ankara (mid-Anatolia), but its construction
has been beset by considlerable delays caused primarily by



- 39 -
financing problems, and a slower than anticipated growth in
demand for petroleum products.
3.   Subsidiaries:  TPAO has a majority interest in 6 subsidiaries,
and has equity in 4 other companies ( a list of TPAO's
subsidiaries appears at Annex 5.1). These firms are concerned
with refining and downstream activities (petrochemicals,
fertilizers, wholesale distribution of oil products); one
provides engineering consulting services. Of particular
importance is IPRAS, a fully owned subsidiary of TPAO that owns
and operates Turkey's largest refinery.
5.05     In conjunction with the two Bank lending operations in FY1981 (para.
2.26), it was agreed that TPAO be separated into two distinct entities, one
being in charge of the domestic-based activities, and the other of import-
based activities. This decision had been taken because it was recognized
that: (i) the import-based refining activities were causing severe financial
difficulties to TPAO, with potentially adverse repercussions on petroleum
exploration and production; and (ii) TPAO's management was too thin to oversee
such a wide range of activities. Considerable progress has been achieved; the
responsibility to import crude oil is no longer TPAO's, and the refineries are
now profitable activities. Delays have, however, taken place in the
restructuring of TPAO, because this restructuring has become enmeshed with the
program for reforms of the State Economic Enterprises. The Government,
however, has confirmed its intention to separate the domestic activities from
the import-based ones through the SEE reform and reorganization Decree Law of
May 1983, and has given assurances at negotiations that the formal
restructuring of TPAO would be completed by June 30, 1984.
Organization and Management
5.06     TPAO's Board of Directors consists of seven members plus the
Chairman, who is also the General Manager of TPAO. The Chairman of the Board,
and four of the Board members are appointed by the Government, while two Board
members are appointed by the other shareholders. Although formally the Board
has full responsibility for approving internal policy matters, in fact the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and the
State Planhing Office exercise considerable control over TPAO's activities.
The issue of TPAO's autonomy is also expected to be addressed in the May 1983
decree (para. 5.03 above).
5.07     TPAO's organization chart appears at Annex 5.2.  Under the General
Manager, 3 deputies oversee most of the activities of the company. Moreover,
the Batman District (which incorporates the important exploration, production
and refining activities in S.E. Turkey), the mid-Anatolia refinery (under
construction -- see para. 5.02) and five other support groups also report to
the General Manager. The present organization, which is largely the result of
historical circumstances, is recognized as sub-optimal. TPAO's management is
aware of these difficulties, has made proposals to the Ministry of Energy
covering the reorganization, and is awaiting the reorganization decree before
taking further steps.
5.08     TPAO's management systems, which were perhaps adequate some years
back, no longer reflect the requirements of the large organization it has



- 40 -
become. The areas of management information systems, and planning remain
particularly weak. Recognizing the difficulties, the Bank and TPAO agreed
that the only viable alternative was to appoint management consultants to
carry out a thorough review of the organization, and offer solutions.
Financing to this effect was provided under Loan 1917-TU 11, and the
consultants were expected to carry out the assignment over a fourteen-month
period starting April 1981. However, TPAO has only recently selected and
signed a consultancy agreement with the firm (Arthur D. Little - US). The
results of this study are expected in September, 1983.
Staffing and Training
5.09     As of January 1983, TPAO had an overall staff of- 7,241 (January 1982
- 7,053), including 1,417 professionals (geologists, geophysicists, petroleum
engineers, accountants, etc.), of which about 50% are employed in the
exploration, production and refining activities of the Batman District (S.E.
Turkey), about 25% are at the Ankara headquarters, and the balance in the
refining and pipeline activities (mostly at the Izmir refinery). Because of a
serious erosion in salaries over 1979-81, many experienced staff left TPAO
during that time and many remaining staff were affected by low morale and
motivation. Since 1982, however, salaries have been substantially increased
and morale has improved. No senior staff member has left: TPAO since early-
1982. While there are still some gaps, efforts have been made to fill them
with outside recruitment with some success.
5.10     Aware of the rapid technical progress of the petroleum industry in
recent years, TPAO has been giving increasing importance to training its
staff. As the possibilities of training in the petroleum field in Turkey are
restricted, TPAO is now sending qualified personnel abroad for courses and
seminars in a large range of subjects, from petroleum geology and geophysics
to enhanced oil recovery and gas production technology, a1s well as general
management and petroleum finance and economics. This effort has also been
supported in part, by the Bank which made provision for training programs
under the first two loans. In the proposed project, a new provision has been
made to support training (para. 3.16); TPAO also intends to install modern
facilities for in-house English courses, which are a pre--requisite for
external training.
Accounting, Finance and Audit
5.11     TPAO's books are kept in accordance with the national uniform
accounting code of Turkey of 1969-71, as well as the relevant provisions of
the Petroleum Law and Regulations. Until recently, the financial function was
given little importance in the planning process; however, as severe limits
were imposed by SPO on TPAO's investment budget in recent: years, the
importance of proper financial management and planning has grown.
Nevertheless, TPAO remains particularly weak in capital budgeting and
investment planning, and has inadequate in-house capability in preparing
programs reflecting, simultaneously, its financial and technical capabilities,
/  Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery FLeld Demonstration Project of November
1980.



- 41 -
and the priorities among projects. This weakness is expected to be remedied
gradually through (i) the management consultancy now in progress and (ii) the
provision, under the loan, of a financial adviser/familiar with the procedures
used by oil companies in capital budgeting and financial planning (para.
3.16).
5.12     In accordance with its statutes, TPAO's accounting records are
examined by two auditors, who report to the Board twice-annually, and to the
shareholders annually. In addition, the Governmental Auditing Committee (in
the office of the Prime Minister) performs a continuous audit, by 3
individuals, and submits its findings to the State Economic Enterprises
subcommittee of the parliament. Lastly, since 1980, the Board of Tax
Examiners in the Ministry of Finance conducts an annual audit in accordance
with the requirements of the Bank. While the audit provides a more detailed
breakdown of the aggregated entries appearing in TPAO's financial statements
and shows variances between the current year and the previous year, it does
not provide an independent assessment, and comments only rarely on any errors
or practices that may inaccurately present TPAO's financial situation.
Measures to improve auditing and accountability of SEE's, including TPAO, will
be discussed in the context of reforms being implemented under the Structural
Adjustment Loans. TPAO's internal audit section reports to the General
Manager. It consists of 3 individuals who are mostly concerned with cash
management. This section is currently weak, but is in the process of being
strengthened. The management consultants are also expected to assist in this
regard.
Insurance
5.13     TPAO's fixed assets are insured through national insurance companies
which reinsure abroad, on the basis of replacement values. The coverage also
includes inventories of crude oil and products, and oil in pipelines. TPAO is
protected from major natural disasters, and is also compensated for loss of
revenues. The insurance coverage is satisfactory.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
6.01     TPAO's finances are complex to analyze because of: (i) the range of
its activities, and the lack of separate accounting by profit center; (ii) the
complexity of the Turkish taxation system for petroleum referred to as "Decree
20" for domestic oil, and "Stabilization Fund" for importied oil; (iii) the
high rate of inflation in recent years; and (iv) the largie role that future
investments play in TPAO's capitalization and its earning power, particularly
those related to the full development of the Bati Raman field, if that project
proves viable, and the development of the new gas resources that this project
may provide. When the first Bank loans were made, it was expected that TPAO's
domestic-oil based activities and import-oil based activiities would be separ-
ated during 1981; but, in view of unforeseen delays this action is now only
expected to take place during 1983 (para. 5.05). TPAO's accounts are not con-
solidated with those of its subsidiaries (para. 5.04); therefore, this chap-
ter's review of TPAO's performance in recent years excludes its subsidiaries,
and assesses its future financial perfGrmance on the assumption that TPAO
would maintain separate accounts for the domestic exploration and production
(E & P) activities (including the captive Batman refinery;), and the import-
based activities, until the formal separation takes effect.
6.02     The analysis is based on TPAO's audited accounts,, for 1979, 1980 and
1981, as well as the unaudited accounts for 1982. In 198L and 1982, TPAO re-
valued its assets on the basis of replacement costs, which is acceptable to
the Bank. A new law published in January 1983 requires a]Ll State enterprises
to revalue fixed tangible assets as of December 31, 1982 or a formula as indi-
cated in the law. TPAO's revaluation on this basis is expected to be com-
pleted by July 31, 1983.

b/   Decree 20 and Stabilization Fund.
TPAO's profits increased in real terms over 1979-82, despite an overall
stagnant volume of sales. The main reason for the improved financial
performance is the transfer of the responsibility to import crude oil to
TPAO's subsidiary, IPRAS. Until 1981, TPAO was suffering significant foreign
exchange losses related to the importing of crude oil for its own refineries
and for IPRAS1/. The transfer of this activity to IPRAS was an important part
of the institutional reorganization agreed upon between the Government and the
Bank and aimed at strengthening TPAO financial and management structures
(para. 5.05); the complete separation will have little further effect on the
financial condition of TPAO, since both activities are conservatively
capitalized. The petroleum taxes have an increasing overall impact on TPAO's
finances: in 1982, they accounted for 16% of sales, against less than 3% in
1979. This is due to modifications in the application of Decree 20.
When the responsibility to import crude oil was transferred from TPAO to
IPRAS, the Government also changed thie refining pricing system, so that IPRAS
was compensated directly for any potenatial losses caused by exchange rate
fluctuations. As a result, this probLem has been resolved satisfactorily.

6.04     TPAO's end-1982 balance sheet on a revalued basis can be summarized
as follows:
Summary Balance Sheet of TPAO as of 12/31/82
TL Billion      US$ Million       %
Net Fixed Assets                             245.2            1,313           58

Repre'sented by:
Long-Term Debt                           38.9               208            9

423.1          _                100
As the above table indicates, TPAO's balance sheet is strong, with a
debt:equity ratio of 9:91. The low indebtedness of TPAO is explained by the
absence of development projects in recent years. The long term investments
represent, for the most part, TPAO's equity in its subsidiaries (para 5.04).
The main weakness is its negative workLng capital with the current ratio at
0.83. This is explained mostly by the unavailability of long-term domestic
financing and the high rates of inflatLon in recent years. As a result, TPAO
had to use its working capital to finance part of the local cost of its
investments. The main creditor affected was the Government, as TPAO did not
pay the full amounts due for the petroLeum taxes.  Nevertheless, the lack of
working capital has not affected its overall operations, and TPAO was able to
achieve, broadly, its investment targels in the past two years.
b.       Exploration and Production Acl:ivity (E & P)
6.05     It is expected that TPAO will be reorganized during 1983, so that the
exploration and production activity wiLl be carried out by an independent
unit. The exploration and production activities include: (i) TPAO's
exploration and production functions throughout Turkey (centered in S.E.
Turkey, at Batman, and the important Thrace region); (ii) the Batman refinery
which processes TPAO's crude oil and the royalty crude oil of foreign oil
companies that TPAO purchases from the Government; and (iii) the exploration
joint-ventures of TPAO with foreign oiL companies (which, so far, do not
involve significant outlays, as in mosl: instances TPAO is being carried
through exploration).

6.06     Pro-forma statements for E & P., excluding the Izmir refinery, were
prepared by TPAO on the basis of a reasonable apportionment of joint items
(such as headquarters overheads, working capital, etc.).  The pro-forma income
statements which appear in Annex 6.1 can be summarized as follows:

The E & P activity has been profitable Ln recent years, and, on average, TPAO
was able to finance about 60-80% of the E & P investment program from internal
sources. Again, in recent years, the iinpact of the petroleum tax has grown
from 19% of sales in 1979 to 29% in 1982.
6.07     The Decree 20 petroleum tax can best be described as an excess profit
tax which absorbs the increase in well-head crude oil prices since 1973, and
at the same time compensates the producer for cost increases since then. A
distinction is made between oil produced from wells drilled before 1979 ("old
oil"), oil from wells drilled in 1979 ("1979 oil"), and oil from wells drilled
after 1979 ("new oil"). In order to maintain the incentive to explore, new
oil is taxed only lightly, while old oi:L is heavily penalized. The precise
application of Decree 20 is rather compLex, and is described in more detail in
Annex 6.2.

6.08     TPAO's E & P end-1982 balance sheet on a revalued basis can be
summarized as follows:
Summary Balance Sheet of TPAO's E & P Activities
as of 12/31/82
TL Billion          US$ MILL.ION             %
Net Fixed Assets                      127.4                   682              114

Less:  Current Liabilities            (44.8)                 (240)             (40)
Total                            111.3                  596               100
Represented by:
Long-Term Debt                      3.7                    20                3
Equity                            107.6                  576                97

As the above table indicates, the E & P activity has very little indebtedness,
with a debt:equity ratio of 3:97.  The bulk of the long-term debt is
represented by the two Bank loans, IBRD 1916-TU and IBRD 1917-TU. On the
basis of this somewhat arbitrary division of current assets and liabilities,
the E & P activity lacks liquidity; its current ratio of 0.65 is due primarily
to the absence of available sources of domestic financing. As a result, TPAO
has had to use its working capital in order to finance part of its
investments.  Again, the creditor most afEfected was the Governm-nt, as TPAO
deferred payment on part of the amounts due for Decree 20. As a result,
E & P's operations and investment program were not excessively affected by the
low liquidity. The GOT has agreed to assist TPAO to obtain the long-term
domestic currency financing needed (in conjunction with its other resources)
to implement its approved investment program and maintain a current ratio
of 1.0.
Financial Projections
a.       Basis of the Projections
6.09     Because the E & P activity is to be separated from the import-based
activities during 1983, financial project:ions were prepared for TPAO's E & P
activity only for the period 1983-88. At: negotiations, assurances were
obtained that : (i) from January 1, 1983, TPAO will maintain separate
accounts for the E & P activities; (ii) t:ransactions between the production
and refining units of TPAO would be conducted at market prices 1/; (iii) from
/  At present, some transactions, particularly with the Batman and Izmir
refinery, are conducted on a cost basis, thereby creating an indirect subsidy
from E & P to these refineries. Even if the Batman refinery remains with
E & P, it will be treated as a separate profit center.



- 4 7 -
January 1, 1983, the E & P activity wilL not transfer funds to other
activities or subsidiaries of TPAO; and (iv) the separation plans would
include provisions to restore adequate liquidity to the E & P group.
6.10     The financial projections were prepared at a constant exchange rate
of the TL to the US$ (TL 190 = US$1.00). That i.s because of: (i) the
inherent difficulties in forecasting inflation rates in Turkey at present;
(ii) the constant exchange rate assumpt:Lon would facilitate the monitoring of
TPAO's financial performance in the future; and (iii) cost increases caused by
domestic inflation would be compensated by corresponding local currency price
increases, in accordance with Government: policy. Furthermore, since the
prices at which TPAO sells crude oil are based on international prices, the
financial analysis will not be affected by the use of the constant exchange
rate.
6.11     The projections are based on conservative financial assumptions, and
in particular, no allowance was made for revenues arising from future
discoveries (although there is a high probability of substantially larger gas
production in Thrace), or even from new production arising from the enhanced
recovery project at Bati Raman (as it is still in a pilot stage). However, it
is likely that these two factors will p:Lay an overwhelming role in TPAO's
future, and will have a critical influence on the growth of its earning power
throughout the 1990's. Furthermore, major investments in gas development and
enhanced oil recovery schemes will also radically change TPAO's balance sheet,
its debt-equity structure and its liquidity, along with its earning power.
TPAO's ability to take on new debt burdens and to attract co-financing along
with Bank financing would, of course, be dependent primarily on the ability of
new projects to generate adequate earnings to service this debt. Its
exploration program, which would become a much smaller percentage of TPAO's
investment program, could, essentially, still be financed from profits of
ongoing production activities.
6.12     TPAO's annual investment budgelts and investment programs have been
affected by severe cuts by SPO in recenlt years, because they were overly
ambitious to begin with, and because, as part of the country's the economic
recovery program, investments all by public enterprises had to be curtailed.
The investment program over 1983-88, in Annex 6.2, is based, in the early
years, on a continuation of the existing exploration programs with a moderate
real growth, and the implementation over 1983-86 of the already identified
development projects. No new investments for production were identified for
inclusion in the 1987-88 investment program. This is consistent with the
assumption made in the income statements, that there would be no production
increase arising from new discoveries. Therefore, towards 1987-88,
investments were assumed to drop signifLcantly. In line with oil industry
practice, the investment program will be revised annually as new data is
obtained; it could be substantially modLfied should TPAO make an important
discovery that required substantial resources to develop.

a/ At the constant exchange rate of TL 190 = US$1.00
Despite a decline in crude oil sales, somewhat compensated by increasing gas
sales, the E & P activity is expected to be financially sound until 1986.
Profits are expected to remain at the level of TL 8-11 billion (US$ 40-60
million) over 1983-86, and at end-1986, the debt equity ratio is satisfactory,
taking into account the scope of activities included under E & P. While the
forecast also indicates that beyond 1986 TPAO would incur losses, this is
unlikely to happen in reality, since it is probable that: (i) gas sales would
increase on account of gas discoveries in Thrace; and/or (ii) the tests under
the Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery Project (expected at end-1984) will
demonstrate the feasibility of producing larger quantities of oil. Should
both of the above assumptions turn out t:o be optimistic, T:PAO would have to
reduce its investment program might have to provide direct equity funding to
TPAO to enable it to continue its exploration program.

underlying these projections are in Annex 6.2.

6.15     In the longer run the financial picture of TPAO will depend largely
on factors outside the scope of this report: (i) the development of proven
reserves of gas in Thrace (the next appraisal); (ii) the outcome of the tests
of the Bati Raman enhanced oil recovery program; (iii) the development and use
of new gas reserves in Thrace (the outcome of this project), and (iv) future
international prices for oil. Therefore, in the interest of ensuring that
TPAO's E & P performance will remain satisfactory in the coming years,
assurances have been given that:
(i)     from 1983 onwards, TPAO will finalize its annual investment
program and the corresponding financing plan in consultation
with the Bank before the beginning of the next fiscal year;
(ii)    TPAO shall not incur any new long-term debt unless a
reasonable forecast of. its revenues and expenditures shows
that its aggregated projected net revenues for each full
fiscal year are at least two times the aggregated projected
debt service requirements;
(iii)   TPAO's long-term debt to equity ratio shall not be greater
than 50:50; and its current ratio shall be no less than 1.0.

expenses;
(v)     should TPAO's accounts receivable at any time be in excess of
two months of sales equivalent, GOT would provide, or cause
TPAO to be provided, the amount by which such receivables
exceed such sales at an interest rate not. greater than the
average rate TPAO receives on its outstanding receivables;

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the GOT that:
(i)    The basis for its long-term gas pricing policy will be to tie the
gas price to the comparable cost of fuel oil to the user and take
into account the price incentives that may be necessary to
encourage potential consumers to convert their facilities to gas
use (para. 2.05).
(ii)   It will provide to TPAO, should the need arise, the funds required
to complete the Project (para. 3.30).
(iii)  It will take all actions necessary to complete the formal
restructuring of TPAO by June 30, 1984 (para. 5.05).
(iv)   Should TPAO's accounts receivable at any time be in excess of the
previous two months of sales equivalent, GOT would provide, or
cause TPAO to be provided, the amount by which such receivables
exceed such sales at an interest rate not greater than the average
TPAO receives on its outstanding receivables (para. 6.15).
7.02     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from TPAO that:
(i)    TPAO will review with the Bank, annually, all of its exploration
programs and will take into consideration the Bank's comments
before implementing them (para. 2.25).
(ii)   TPAO will submit its Thrace exploration and development program for
review and agreement by the Bank on an annual basis and whenever
they are significantly revised (para. 3.17).
(iii)  TPAO will prepare and present for the Bank's approval a geological
prognosis, benefit-risk analysis and well drilling program for each
well to be financed by the Bank under this Project not later than
one month before site preparation is to start at the drilling
location (para. 3.17).
(iv)   TPAO will hire, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank,
specialized firms to perform all the specialized well services
(i.e., cementing, testing, electric logging) (para. 3.22).
(v)    TPAO will maintain separate accounts for the E & P activities from
January 1, 1983; transactions between the production and refining
units of TPAO would be conducted at market prices; and, from
January 1, 1983, the E & P activity will not transfer funds to
other activities of TPAO unless agreed to by the Bank (para.
6.09).
(vi)   From 1983 onwards, TPAO will finalize its annual investment program
and the corresponding financing plan in consultation with the Bank
before the beginning of the next fiscal year (para. 6.16).



- 512 -
(vii)  TPAO will conduct its operations so that its long-term debt to
equity ratio shall not be greater than 50:50 and its current ratio
shall not drop below 1.0 (para. 6.15).
(viii) TPAO shall not incur any new long-term debt unLess a reasonable
forecast of its revenues and expenditures shows that its aggregated
projected net revenues for each full fiscal year are at least two
times the aggregated projected debt service requirements (para.
6.15).
(ix)   TPAO will conduct its operation so that at the beginning of each
month it would have working capital including cash, marketable
securities and guaranteed lines of credit equivalent to at least
two months of estimated operating expenses (para. 6.15).
7.03     On the basis of the above assurances, the Projecl: would be suitable
for a US$55.2 million loan to TPAO for a term of 17 years, including a four
year grace period.

PETROLEUM GEOLOGY OF TURKEY
Overview
1.       The geology of Turkey as known today has been shaped by the
interaction of the European continent with the Africa/Arabian platform.
During Cretaceous and Tertiary times both land masses collided or slid
alongside each other giving rise to a series of East-West trending geological
elements, mostly folded mountain ranges; these can be followed from the Alps
proper through eastern Europe (Dinarides, Balkan) through Turkey, Iraq/Iran to
South and East Asia.
2.       As in Europe, several distinct geotectonic elements can thus be
distinguished in Turkey: (a) the thrustecd/folded/uplifted part belonging to
the Alpine system and surrounding most of Anatolia. Sedimentary rock units
are generally tightly folded and separated into different compartments by
extensive fault lines and overthrust planes. Often, the sedimentary sequences
building up these geological units, contain reservoir rocks and locally even
source rocks; however, due to intensive tectonic forces they underwent such
strong deformations, that no hydrocarbons, if indeed formed, could be
preserved. Intrusions of magmatic rocks, while being of interest for mineral
exploration, further downgrade the hydrocarbon potential of most of
Anatolia. In more recent geological times, however, some areas subsided and
received thick masses of sediments, mostly erosional products from the
adjoining mountain areas. Some of these basins are relatively little
disturbed and contain indeed some hydrocarbon potential. One such area in
Anatolia is the Tuzgolu basin some 150 km SE of Ankara where large thicknesses
of Tertiary sediments have been deposited. Another area of potential interest
is Van Golu area, the land area of North Anatolia adjoining the Black Sea; the
Adana basin, the Iskendrun Basin and the Antalya area, all of these basins are
located within the Tertiary fold belt, and all are areas with some hydrocarbon
potential. (b) The second megatectonic unit in Turkey belongs to the Arabian
platform. It comprises the entire area south of the folded ranges and can be
followed from Gaziantep in the west to the Iraqi border in the east. There
are certain elements reminiscent to the oil geology of the Gulf States but
there remain major differences; these will be discussed below.
Basins related to the Alpine fold system
3.       A mountain system like the Alps is often accompanied by sedimentary
basins which were formed during the later stages of mountain building. Such
basins can be of considerable interest as hydrocarbon producers or providers
of geothermal resources. Their geological parameters vary so widely, however,
that no generally valid statements can be made. Rather, the merits of each
basinal area in a fold system has to be considered on their own. Such basins
have also been recognised in several parts of Turkey; the geological prospects
of some of the more important ones are discussed here.
Thrace Basin
4.       A pronounced, well defined geological depression west of Istanbul;
the basin measures 100 km x 140 km; in Tertiary times it received sedimentary
thicknesses in excess of 9000 meters in its deepest part.



- 56 -                          ANNEX 2.1
5.       The architecture of the basin is modified by basement highs and
basement spurs over which sedimentary thicknesses are much reduced.
Exploration drilling has indicated the likely presence of source rocks and
reservoir rocks. TPAO and some industry efforts have demonstrated that the
Thrace basin is an important hydrocarbon bearing province. One gas field
(Hamitabat) is being developed, while several oil and gas occurrences await
appraisal. Proven gas reserves stand at 0.45 Tcf gas, while expectations
would be at least treble this amount. Some small oil fields have been
practically depleted but there is further (albeit) moderate potential for oil
finds.
Tuzgolu Basin
6.       A deep basin, located some 150 km SSE of Ankara.  It covers a surface
area in excess of 5,000 km2. TPAO has operated in this area since 1971;
progress has been sluggish due to extremely difficult and adverse working
conditions (the area partly covered by shallow lakes).
7.       The thickness of the geologi_al section is impressive, being in
excess of 15,000 meters. The oldest kiaown sediments in the region are Permian
Carbonates. The overlying sedimentary column ranges from upper Palaeozoic to
Oligocene; in the center debris from neighboring high areas have been
deposited, mainly siltstones, sandston,es and tuffaceous shales. The upper
part of the geological section contains evaporitic rocks. While such
sequences could provide excellent sealing horizons for hydrocarbons, they do
give rise to serious difficulties in diata acquisition. M[apping of deep
horizons remains a major problem.
8.       Only a few wells have been drilled so far; one well encountered some
gas in Paleocene tuffaceous shales.
9.       In the past there has been sporadic interest by foreign operators,
but little more than geological studies and some seismic work have been
carried out.
10.      Lennox Oil Company (UK) has rescently signed a joint venture
agreement, committing to seismic and exploration drilling.
11.      Geological prognosis:  A deep sedimentary basin with a section in
excess of 12,000 meters. Reservoirs and source rocks are present making the
basin prima facie an interesting exploration objective, not least because of
its proximity to major consuming areas. Operations problems have so far
prevented a proper geological analysis. The basin may have moderate gas (and
oil) potential.
12.      Future work should focus on mapping deeper horizons; geochemical
studies will have to evaluate the oil and gas potential of source rocks
identified.
Adana Basin
13.      Intensive exploration work by foreign oil companies and TPAO has
resulted in the discovery of a small fLeld (Bulgurdas, some 6 million barrels
reserves). The oil has been found in a reef limestone and is believed to have
migrated from underlying Palaeozoic limestones.



- 57 -                          ANNEX 2.1
14.      Extensive further drilling has proven abortive.  In the northern part
of the basin TPAO has identified a structural play, the main objectives being
Palaeozoic limestones of Permian, Carboniferous and Devonian age. These
limestones are overlain by thick mesozoic congomeratic layers. The Tertiary
layers which cap these conglomerates are over 1,000 meters thick with no
obvious potential. The Palaeozoic limestones form the main exploration
objective.
15.      TPAO/Shell are at present concluding drilling operations, TPAO being
the operator.
16.      Towards the south, the Tertiary section thickens rapidly to over
5,000 meters. Geological trapping conditions are generally small and
reservoirs are rather limited. A Shell/TPAO well has encountered some
gas/condensate in a thin Paleocene turbidite, too small however, for
development. Exploration in the Gulf of Iskendrun has been equally
disappointing.
Black Sea Area
17.      The north/central area of Turkey, bordering the Black Sea (Eragli
area) contains some interesting oil geological elements. Future work, in
particular seismic acquisition, may well lead to the identification of
attractive oil geological plays. The oldest known sedimentary rocks are
Jurassic sands and conglomerates; these are the erosion products leveling a
paleotopography. These rocks are overlain by Jurassic/Cretaceous limestones
which give way to thick shales rich in organic matter. The closing
Cretaceous/Tertiary section consists of a thick sequence of flysch and marly
sediments; in addition volcanic activity contributed thick tuffaceous
layers. The composite stratigraphic section measures in excess of 5,000
meters.
18.      Geological trapping structures are anticlines, thrusted anticlines
and fault traps, oil shows have been observed along thrust and fault planes.
The area has some obvious hydrocarbon potential. In order to map the main
objective (Jurassic) a number of high quality seismic lines are needed
initially, possibly to be followed by detail work. Adverse terrain conditions
and rapidly changing formations will make acquisition of high quality data
very difficult.
19.      East of Eregli yet another geological play has been identified; here
up to 5,000 meters of sediments have been measured in a well defined Tertiary
basin (Ulus basin); along its fringes numerous oil and gas seeps have been
observed. On either side of this basin palaeozoic prospects may be present.
Aegean Sea
20.      Interest in the Aegean Sea Basins has greatly increased since
Oceanic's discovery of the Prinos (Greece) field, which now produces some
20,000 b/d. This discovery is located in a narrow, deep younger Tertiary
basin. The prospective section consists of several 100 meters of shales
(source rocks) and sands, overlain by a sequence of anhydrites which form a
regional seal. The overlying sedimentary section measures several thousand
feet.



- 58 -                           ANNEX 2.1
21.      Similar, albeit smaller basins are likely to be present along the
Turkish west coast. (Menderez Basin, Izmir Basin, Edremit Basin). In the
seventies two international oil comparLies (Dorchester and Shell) executed
seismic work in some of these basins. While the presence of a thick
sedimentary section was proven, no exploration drilling followed; possible
trapping structures proved to be too small to be of interest to them.
22.      Despite some remaining hydrocarbon potential no further operations
are planned by TPAO prior to a firm agreement with Greece on the jurisdiction
of the offshore areas.
Antalya Area
23.      This potential prospect is located along the south coast of Turkey.
The area contains several attractive geological features, a deterring factor
is the structural complexity.
24.      A thick Tertiary/Jurassic section, containing source rocks and
reservoir rocks, has been identified; it is overridden by thrust sheets of
clastic sediments and basaltic rocks. In order to map structures at the
prospective Acquitanian/Jurassic levels, high quality seismic is required.
25.      TPAO aims at identifying areas where those thrusted elements are
thinnest. If successful additional experimental seismic lines will be
profiled.
26.      The area has some hydrocarbon potential, albeit moderate.  Resulting
oil or gas accummulations will be small, finding costs and developing costs
will be very high.
Van Golu
27.      The Van Golu area was thought to be a Tertiary basin not unlike Tuz
Golu southeast of Ankara (see para 3.06).
28.      In fact, the geological structure of the area is' similar to the
Hakkari area, some 100 km south of Van Golu. The same objective section as in
Hakkari is likely to be present, but at much greater depths (15,000 feet vs.
10,000 feet). These prospective sediments, albeit prospective, are overridden
by numerous thrust sheets; seismic penetration of which wrill prove very
difficult. If exploration in the Hakkari area meets with success, further
work here will no doubt be called for.
Basins related to the "Arabian Platforn"
29.      The area between the edge of the mountain front and the Syrian-Iraq
border belongs, in oil geological terms, to the Arabian platform.
Stratigraphically, there are some similarities with the prolific oil fields in
the south; these lie particularly in the composition of the middle mesozoic
limestone section. However, rich Juarassic source rocks, so well developed in
Saudi Arabia and Iraq, do not reach as far north as Turkey. Source rocks of
poorer quality have been identified in the Palaeozoic section and,
questionably, in Jurassic limestones. Regional caprocks, so predominant in
for hydrocarbons are plentiful but in many cases migration of oil and gas the



-59-                            ANNEX 2.i
Arabian Gulf countries, are also absent in Turkey. Trapping conditions
antedated the formation of structures, another important difference with the
Arabian Gulf countries.
30.      The main oil prospective area in Turkey is located just south of the
mountain front. Trapping conditions range from small thrusted anticlines
(Diyarbakir area) to large anticlinal upwarps (Rahman area). Production in
this area amounts to 40,000 b/d, remaining reserves are estimated to be of the
order of 120-150 mio bbl. Enhanced recovery in certain heavy oil fields could
raise production to 70,000 b/d.
31.      Present situation:  With few exceptions, the oil fields in SE Turkey
are small and have no surface expressions. Geophysical methods are thus the
only exploration tool available for the detection of such traps. Difficult
surface conditions and rapid changes in rock composition have mostly resulted
in very poor data quality; consequently seismic interpretation was difficult
and often ambiguous.  Oil discovery rates remained low as a consequence; even
the dry hole ratio for development wells has been inordinately high.
Exploration in the oil field area has now come to a stage where the main
structural trends are known. There may be scope for new discoveries, but in
the near future, additions to production are expected mainly from infill
drilling and enhanced oil recovery. There remains one geological play where
TPAO hopes to find major additions to reserves: the Hakkari area in the south
eastern most part of the country. Here, geological formations similar to
those of the producing fields in northern Iraq are expected. Exploration is
rendered very difficult as the prospective rock formations are overlain by
complex thrust sheets consisting of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.
Ongoing geophysical work has succeeded in outlining interesting prospects some
of which will be drilled shortly. The Hakkari area contains considerable
potential, albeit very speculative.
Conclusions
32.      Among the many basins in Turkey only two areas contain significant
hydrocarbon potential. South east Turkey has been densely explored; with one
exception additions to reserves are expected from infill drilling and enhanced
recovery.
33.      Thrace may likely develop into an important hydrocarbon producing
area.
34.      While several other areas contaLin some geological elements favorable
for the generation of oil and gas, exploration is rendered difficult due to
adverse topography, rapid changes in the composition of prospective
formations, generally small size of expected trapping stuctures. Extensive
high cost pe-drilling work will be required. Resulting discovery will likely
to be small; the dry hole ratio will be high.

PETROLEUM GEOLOGY OF THE THRACE BASIN
1.       The Thrace Basin is a pronounced geological unit, one of many which
fringe the Alpine Mountain Chain in Europe and the Middle East. Many of these
basins are prolific producers of hydrocarbons, both oil and gas (Vienna basin,
Pannonian Basin, Transsylvanian Basin). Some of these basins have had a long
history of exploration; lessons learnt there were of great use in developing
an exploration strategy for Thrace. The Thrace Basin is physiographically
well defined. To the north and north east its limit is given by the Rhodope
Massif where crystalline basement rocks are outcropping. To the west the
Basin terminate against branches of the Alpine chains in eastern Greece and
southern Bulgaria; a convenient southern boundary is provLded by an extensive
geological feature more or less paralleling the Marmara Sea Coast line. Most
of the basin is thus located in Turkish territory; small parts may reach into
Greece and Bulgaria. Hydrocarbon potential there is insignificant.
2.       The main prospective area in lurkey measures some 140 km from east to
west and about 100 km from north to south.
3.       Geological subsidence which led to the Thrace basin as known today,
commenced in early Tertiary times, and continued uninterruptedly until very
recent times (Plio/Pleistocene).  In the deepest part of the basin up to
10,000 meters of Tertiary sediments were thus deposited.
4.       It is of great petroleum geological importance that subsidence was
not uniform. Some areas subsided very rapidly and were inundated, from the
south, by branches of the Mediterranean. In those parts of the basin where
subsidence was greatest deep water conditions prevailed; :Large masses of
sandstones and dark (bituminous) shales were deposited. 'The clastic sediments
broke loose from neighboring high areas and were carried along the steep
flanks of the basin into its deepest parts where they were widely
distributed. Such turbidity current deposits are well known to petroleum
geologists; if intercalated or in juxtaposition with source rocks (bituminous
shales) they can form prolific reservoirs (Forties field iLn the UK part of the
North Sea, Frigg field in the Norwegian part of the North Sea, Ventura Basin
in California, Pannonian Basin in Yugoslavia/Hungary). Each of the areas
mexiLioned above coutain hydrocarbon reserves in excess of a billion boe. A
maJjor geo ogical. risk is usually the deve]opment of reser,oir characteristics;
in ideal cases reservoir porosities can reach 30%, but often they lie between
10% and 20%.
5.       While a large part of the Thrace basin underwent rapid subsidence in
its initial stage of formation, several areas lagged behind; when covered by
the sea and where water-depths remained shallow, reefal sediments (corals,
bryozoans) were deposited. Such sediments, if not altered by subsequent
geological events, could retain excellent porosities and permeabilities; under
ideal conditions such geological traps could have productivities of thousands
of barrels per day.
6.       In later geological times, subsidence became slower and successively
shallow marine and continental river sediments were deposiLted; the composition
of these sediments varies widely (sandstones, shales and ;Limestones). The
following geological formations are of importance as oil and gas reservoirs:



- 6L -                           ANNEX 3.1
Hamitabat formation (Upper Eocene):  Arkosic sandstones,
interbedded with dark grey shales. The sandstones are
moderately to poorly sorted often with mediocre reservoir
characteristics; these, however, can be improved by fraccing.
Ceylan formation: (Upper Hocene, overlying the Hamitabat
formation): tuffaceous shales and dense limestones which are
intensly fractured. It is this secondary porosity which makes
the Ceylan formation a good reservoir rock. As it overlies the
gas bearing Hamitabat formation, it is an important secondary
objective. So far three wildcat wells have encountered gas and
condensate from this formtation.
Osmancik formation: (Middle to Upper Oligocene).  A recent gas
discovery at Umurca makes this formation an important
objective. The reservoirs are well developed sands and have
moderate to good porosities and permeabilities.
Source Rocks
7.       No geochemical study has yet been carried out, but source rocks have
been mentioned from various stratigraphic intervals. In the Hamitabat field
it is believed that shales within the Hamitabat formation itself have
reservoired the traps.
8.       In the outcrop areas fringing the southern part of the basin
formations of the same age can be studied; they are rich in organic material
and seem to have definite source rock potential. Here, even older
stratigraphical layers have been observed. These consist predominantly of
shales which also contain very high amounts of organic matter. A geochemical
study will aim at determining the type of these source rocks (gas or oil) and
their efficiency to expel hydrocarbons under suitable thermal conditions.
This will have a direct bearing on future exploration strategies to be
employed. Any shale formation, older than the Hamitabat formation and being
juxtaposed to basement highs, can source basement rocks if porosity (fractured
or primary) is available. Exploration for basement may thus become a major
objective (cf Molde, Yugoslavia).
9.       Possible shale source rocks aleso occur in shallower formations
(Mezardere formation) while thick coal layers have been identified in the
Danishmen formation (Lower Miocene). ThLese rocks are probably too shallow to
have generated any significant amount of hydrocarbons, but this will have to
be verified.
10.      Particular attention will have to be paid to the occurrence of
biogenic gas (methane formed by bacteria at shallow depths); usually such gas
occurrences are not bound to structural trapping conditions. As there are no
direct ways yet to detect areas where such gas, if formed; a careful study of
shallow seismic data is required. Under suitable conditions and with good
seismic data, presence of gas can be surmised by the presence of certain
changes in seismic character.



Structures
11.      There is no scarcity of geological structures capable of retaining
oil and gas accumulations. A glance at TPAO's first regional mapping effort
shows a bewildering array of simple anti.clinal turnovers, fault traps,
stratigraphic type traps, basement horst:s etc. So far detailed mapping has
been restricted to a few areas. In several of TPAO's bloclks large gaps exist
in seismic coverage. In areas of wide grids, says 5 x 5 kn, mapped structures
are shown as large, gentle features with increasingly denser grids, however,
these large features break up into fault: blocks, fault cloisures etc.  It would
appear that in any one field multiple individual reservoirs will be
encountered which makes any development plans dependent on high quality
seismic data
12.      In order to arrive at a full st:ructural inventory, TPAO attempts to
acquire additional seismic data to closet gaps in the data base. Only then can
a rational exploration strategy be attempted.
Geological Risks
13.      With the amount of hydrocarbons; proven (0.45 tcf) it would appear
that there are no geological risks in the course of further exploration. This
is probably a valid statement as far as the occurrence of structures,
reservoir rocks and source rocks is concerned. Sufficient data are now
available, both in the central and northern part of the basin (from subsurface
data) and in the South (from outcrops in the Isiklar mount;ains) which prove
that these important parameters occur throughout the basin.
14.      What is unknown yet, is the regional distribution of source rock and
reservoir rock quality.  In some areas of the basin there has been intensive
volcanic activity which contributed large amounts of tuffaceous material;
where such material is deposited with reservoir rocks, loss of porosity is the
result.
15.      Equally, the quality of source rocks can vary rap:Ldly with attendant
changes in their efffectiveness as hydrocarbon producers.
16.      TPAO intends to address both scurce rock quality and reservoir
quality in a series of studies proposed for financing under this project.
Geological Prognosis
17.      The absence of a coherent structural map covering TPAO's licence
areas, precludes a correct assessment of the basin's overall potential. In
the immediate vicinity of Hamitabat a dense selsmic grid is available.
Although most of the data are of poor to mediocre quality, numerous traps
could be mapped and exploration drilling has been very successful (80% success
ratio). Recently a number of discoveries have been made, as at Tatarkoy,
Turgutbey and Umurca. In several, exploration wells with good oil and/or gas
indications have been recorded, including in Delem, Kaynarca, Kepirtepe and
Yesilgol.
18.      Many structural indications west and southeast of Hamitabat remain to
be detailed by additional seismic. Wells drilled previous:ly in these areas



- 63 -                            ANNEX 3.1
proved the presence of reservoir rocks. While in several of these wells
indications of hydrocarbons were recorded, it is now believed that most of
these old wells were drilled offstructure. While no confident expectation of
oil and gas can be presented now, it has been possible to arrive at an oil
geological grading of TPAO's licence blocks. This grading should assist in
establishing an optimum exploration program for TPAO. Below the main
geological elements of the various licences are summarised. (For easy
reference see map 17111).
TPO 1825
19.      This licence extends into the offshore, reaching close to the North
Anatolian fault Zone.
20.      This area belongs to the southern most, highly disturbed area of the
Thrace Basin and is not further considered here.
21.      On land, in the western part of the licence, a large structure is
present. Drilling by Shell and Mobil indicated the Ceylan formation to be gas
bearing, there has been no penetration of Hamitabat formation. There is a
fair chance that structural closure can be proven at Hamitabat level.
Reservoir development is considered a main risk.
22.      The license is considered speculative with high potential.
TPO 1954
23.      Practically no good quality seismic coverage is available in this
licence. The Corlu structure reaches into the southern part of the licence
but otherwise no direct structural indications are seen.
24.      There is a possibility that fault trends extending from Hamitabat in
a southeasterly direction can be mapped. Similar to Hamitabat, structural
closures could be present against such faults.
25.      In the northeastern part of the licence area, shallow, reef type
prospects may be present.
26.      All these potential trapping conditions will have to be confirmed by
seismic work.
27.      The prospects are speculative but of high potential.
TPO 1978
28.      Most of this licence is underLain by shallow basement; several
reeftype prospects have been drilled but without success.
29.      A narrow stretch in the southwestern part of the licence contains
good, deep Ceylan and Hamitabat prospects. Numerous fault closures are
indicated; two have been tested by Turgutbey-l and Delem-l.
30.      Turgutbey-l recovered gas and condensate from siliceous Ceylan
formation. The Hamitabat formation contains gas bearing sands, but due to



- 64 -                             ANNEX 3.1
adverse hole conditions, no tests were made. Turgutbey, presently drilling,
aims at a full evaluation of the Ceylan and Hamitabat formations.
31.      Delem, some 30 km SE of Turgutbey, contains gas in the Hamitabat
formation. The well is closed in awaiting testing. There is a fair chance
that additional prospects can be mapped. between Delen and Turgutbey.
32.      The licence carries a high ranking.
TPO 2140
33.      The licence is located southwest of a fault zone which runs from
Turgutbey to Delem. At Kaynarca-l, presently drilling, hiLgh gas readings were
recorded from Ceylan reservoirs. The Hamitabat sands are overlain by 40 m of
dark shales, rich in organic material, believed to be source rocks. High gas
readings were recorded from Hamitabat sands.
34.      At Kepirtepe, 10 km west of Kaynarca, presently dlrilling in shallow
formations; high gas readings were recorded. This could well be an indication
of bacterial gas (see para 3.43). Seismic coverage is insufficient for
coherent structural mapping. There is room for additional Ceylan and
Hamitabat prospects. These may be in depth ranges between 4,500-5,000 meters
which may be an adverse factor for reservoir development.
TPO 1881
35.      Hamitabat prospects present, blat at great depths.  There are fault
indications along which Hamitabat (and Ceylan) traps could develop. Little
seismic has been profiled over this licence. Its seismic demonstrates the
presence of trapping conditions and, if good reservoirs can be proven, the
block will be a good prospect.
36.      Average depth of a Hamitabat well is between 4,500 m and 5,000 m.
TPO 2007
37. -    The licence overlies shelf areas; many wells were drilled aiming at
limestone reservoirs. Further work wilL be considered after a re-evaluation
of the existing data base.
38.      It appears, however, that prospects remain marginal.
TPO 2323
39.      A multiprospect licence south of the Hamitabat field and including
Umura. The geological structures are plentiful but complex. Additional high
quality seismic is required to define deep Hamitabat prospects and possible
reef prospects on indicated basement highs. At least three wells are required
to test the potential of this licence (2 deep: 4,500 m, one medium depth
3,000 m).
40.      A high to very high geological ranking is assigned to this block.



- 65-                             ANNEX 3.1
TPO 1945
41.      Includes the Hamitabat field plus the new Ceylan/Hamitabat
discoveries, Tatarkoy, Turgutbey and Yesilgol; oil has been found in reef
limestones at Devecatagi and Osmancik.
42.      The western part of the block is structurally very complex; a full
reinterpretation of seismic data is required, plus additional infill seismic.
43.      For a full evaluation at least two deep tests and three shallow wells
are required.
44.      One of the most prospective of TPAO's licences.
TPO 2216
45.      The licence has oil and gas potential.  In its eastern part
extensions of the Turgutbey and Tatarkoy structures may be present; the entire
block needs to be re-evaluated seismically but particularly its western part
where no prospect evaluation has yet been carried out. In the shelf area
there remain good oil prospects. Two wells at Kavacedere had good oil shows
which, however, could not be tested due to technical problems. A major
problem here is fault delineation, which is rendered difficult due to small
fault displacements and poor seismic data.
46.      The licence carries a high ranking.
TPO 1944
47.      Located in the western part of the basin, where seismic indicates the
presence of several basement highs. In several wells limestones were
encountered overlying metamorphic basement rocks. The central/northern part
of the licence may contain deep Hamitabat prospects which, however, must be
verified by new seismic. In this particular area basement rocks, if indeed
fractured could form an additional objective. If good seismic resolution can
be obtained, three wells need to be drilled to evaluate the block's potential.
TPO 2137, 2136, 2138, 2139
48.      These licences are located in the western and southern part of the
basin. Seismic coverage is generally poor; there are certain geological
factors downgrading the quality of Hamitabat prospects (deposition of
tuffaceous material with Hamitabat sands).
49.      Some 3-4 wells may be drilled if seismic acquisition meets with
success.
Conclusions
50.      The TPAO licences in the Thrace basin contain a wide variety of
geological trapping structures. In the northern and eastern licences
prospectivity is very high, and large additions to gas reserves and to some
extent of oil reserves could reasonably be expected. While no figures can yet
be presented due to the absence of a consistent data base, it seems entirely



- 66 -                            ANNEX 3.L
feasible that the current gas reserves (0.46 Tcf) could be trebled. Equally
there seems to be a fair chance that some small oil fields could be discovered
with reserves of 5-10 mio barrels each.
51.      The western and southern licences are poorly known.  There are
indications of interesting trapping structures which, however, need to be
verified by seismic. It may be that Hamitabat and Ceylan reservoir
deteriorate in quality due to volcanic activity. On the other hand, basement
prospects may well become an additional objective here. Potential is thus
very speculative but could be high.

Project Cost Estimate
1.       The cost estimate is based on data provided by TPAO during
appraisal. It is expressed at early-1983 prices at the exchange rate of TL
190 = US$1.00. Costs are based on: (i) recent bids received by TPAO on
similar works; (ii) TPAO's internal costing system; and (iii) relevant data
obtained from oil companies operating in Turkey.
Seismic Surveys
2.       Two seismic parties will implement the 1984/1985 acquisition
program. The parties will be selected via ICB according to Bank rules. Total
program amounts to 1,800 km; total operating time would be 24 months.

b.       Wells:
4.       It is expected that, under the project, wells will be drilled to
depths of 2,000 m to 4,500 m.  It was assumed, for cost estimation purposes
that there will be 4 deep wells (4,500 m), 4 medium wells (3,500 m) and 3
shallow wells (2,500 m). This assumption is reasonable considering current
data available.
5.       The costs are based on:  (i) the characteristics of the drilling
rigs: (ii) drilling duration of wells recently drilled in Thrace and
consumables used; and (iii) TPAO's updated costs on the basis of earlier
records.

14.      In summary, the estimate of well completions is as follows:
Total Well Completion Estimate
US$ Thousand                TL Million
2 deep wells                                     800                       260
2 medium wells                                   780                       256

Subtotal                                  1,900                       598

d.       Testing Equipment
15.      The estimate includes one complete testing unit, to test and complete
five wells (down hole testing tools surface separator, including gauges and
spare parts). The cost of the testing unit, and the production equipment is
based on recent informal quotes.

e.       Studies:
Geological Studies:
16.      This provision includes the folLowing:  (a) geochemical studies to
investigate the regional occurrence and quality of oil and gas source rocks;
about 2,000 samples will be evaluated in TPAO's laboratory under the direction
of foreign consultants; (b) a sedimentological study to investigate the
characteristics of reservoir rocks encountered so far; attention will be paid
to the regional distribution of such rocks. The work will be carried out by
TPAO under the direction of foreign consultants.
Sedimentological            US$ Million            TL Million
Geochemical                      0.60                    25
Sedimentological                 0.80                    20
17.      Other studies are not yet fully defined, but on the basis of
experience elsewhere, specific studies are expected to be required as more
data develop, for instance, for well completions design and reservoir
evaluations.
f.       Training
18.      The cost of training is based on TPAO's training costs abroad in
earlier projects, and encompasses the main technical, administrative and
financial functions. In all, it is proposed to provide for 450 man-months of
training at a man-month average cost of US$3,333.
g.       Contingencies
19.      Physical contingencies are at 1.0% for seismic, and 25% for
drilling. No physical contingencies are provided for the other items, as they
are provided in the base cost.
20.      Price contingencies both for locall/ and foreign costs are as
follows:
YEAR                 198:3    1984     1985      1986
Price contingency           8.0%     7.5%     7.0%      6.0%
/  The exchange rate of the TL to US is also taken to be constant at
TL 190.0 - US$1.0.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR ECO'NOMIC CALCULATIONS
1.       The exploration program for Thrace, including 1983 seismic program is
US$110 million.
2.       Discovery is made in 1985, and development covers 1985 through 1986.
3.       Four development wells will be drilled costing US$3.5 million each.
Connection to the trunk pipeline costs an additional US$6 million.
4.       Production from 5 wells averages 15 million scfd, for a total output
of .11 TCF over a 20 year period. Production starts at 17 million scfd and
falls to 13 sctd by the end of 20 years.
5.       The value of the gas at the trunk pipeline is $4 per scfd or about
$172 per TOE.

TURKEY
TPAO
Note on TPAO's Finances and
Assumptions Underlying the Financial Projections
I.       Background
1.01     TPAO's finartces are complex to analyze because of: (i) the range of
its activities in the petroleum field and the lack of separate accounting by
activity or "profit center"; (ii) the complexity of the Turkish taxation
system for petroleum referred to as "Decree 20" and "Stabilization Fund";
(iii) the high inflation rates in recent years; and (iv) the present economic
environment in Turkey which, in particular, prevents TPAO from borrowing
domestically, does not enable TPAO to earn interest on its Bank deposits, and
does not enable some of TPAO main cusl:omers to pay for oil products in time,
with adverse implication on TPAO's liquidity. Furthermore, key decisions
affecting TPAO's finances are made by external bodies such as the Ministry of
Energy, the Ministry of Finance and the State Planning Office (SPO), so that
inevitably the range of decisions that: TPAO's management can take is limited.
1.02     TPAO's activities can be classified into three categories:  (i)
domestic exploration and production referred to as E&P; (ii) refining of
imported crude oil in TPAO's refinery at Izmir; and (iii) overseeing the
activities of its 10 subsidiaries (see Annex 5.1). TPAO's E&P activities
include: (i) exploration and development in TPAO's licences throughout
Turkey, production of crude oil and natural gas in southieast Turkey and
Thrace; (ii) processing of TPAO's crude and the royalty crude of foreign oil
companiesL/ at TPAO's Batman Refinery (which only uses domestic crudes); and
(iii) selling of oil products in bulk to a relatively small number of large
customers.  TPAO's activities mainly consist in the refining of imported crude
at TPAO's Izmir Refinery and the privately-owned Atas refinery (the crude oil
is currently imported by TPAO's IPRAS subsidiary).
1.03     In view of the diversity of TPAO's activities, :Lt was agreed when the
Bank loans (IBRD Loans 1916-TU and 1917-TU, both of November 1980) were made
that TPAO's domestic-based activities would be separated from its import-based
activities so that separate accounts would be produced for each activity.
However, the formal separation of TPAO's activities has not taken place yet;
therefore, this analysis focusses on the pro-forma statements of the E&P
Foreign oil companies are required,, by Law, to pay a 12.5% royalty to the
Government, which is in effect received by TPAO in kind, and TPAO, in turn,
makes the payment to the Government:.



- 85 -                            ANNEX 6.2
activities in T    past four years, and the financial projections cover the E&P
activity alone.
II.      The Decree 20
a.       Description
2.01     The Decree 20 has a bigger impact on TPAO's finance than any other
factor.  It was originally created to absorb the windfall profits that came
with the OPEC price increases of 1973. I:n order to achieve this objective,
the Decree 20 absorbs the increase in the value of crude oil and petroleum
products which took place between December 31, 1973 (the base period) and the
current month (the Ministry of Energy notifies on a monthly basis the
producing companies of the prices to be used in applying the Decree). A
distinction is made between oil produced from wells drilled before December
31, 1978 ("old oil"), wells drilled in 1979 ("1979 oil"), and wells drilled
from 1980 onwards ("new oil").
2.02     The Decree 20 is applicable separately to the production, refining
and distribution stages (Appendix 1 of this Annex shows the computation of
Decree 20 in detail). At the production stage, TPAO makes a payment to Decree
20 and also receives "revenues". On the revenues side, the Decree 20 only
applies to old oil. If the old oil is sold directly, Decree 20 (Re) is equal
to the difference between the current production cost (excluding Decree 20
taxes to be paid and net of royalty oil), and the cost in the base period. If
the old oil is refined, then Decree 20 (Re) is equal to the difference between
the cost of oil to the refinery (transfer price) and refining costs (including
Decree 20 taxes to be paid), and the cost in effect during the base period.
Thus, TPAO is compensated for the increase in its costs since December 1973.2/
2.03     At the production stage, TPAO makes payments to Decree 20 (P) as
follows: (i) for old oil, on the basis of the difference between current
well-head price, and the well-head price in the base period, expressed in US$,
converted to TL at the current exchange rate, net of the 12.5% royalty oil to
be paid to the Government in accordance with the Law (in December 1982, the
well-head price was US$34.40/Bbl comparedl to the base price of US$4.77/Bbl in
December 1973); and (ii) for 1979 oil, Decree 20 is equal to 25% of the well-
head value, net of the 12.5% royalty oil. There is no Decree 20 (P) on new
oil, so that producers have an incentive to continue exploring.
/  Assurances are to be obtained at negotiations that from now on, TPAO will
maintain separate accounts for the E&P activity, and that it will not transfer
funds from the E&P activity to other areas.
2/ If the Batman Refinery had been a self-contained financial unit, oil would
be transferred to it at the official selling price (well-head plus transport
cost). In this event, the repayment in the refining stage would include the
full increase in the cost of this oil between 1973 and present. This is what
is done at Atas and IPRAS. The opportinuty loss to TPAO in 1982 was about TL
10,000/ton, or in all TL 1.6 billion (US$9.7 million).



- 86-                             ANNEX 6.2
2.04     At the refining stage, Decree 20 (R) is only applicable to old oil
net of royalty oil, and is equal to the difference between the current c.i.f.
price plus local taxes of imported products (calculated separately for each
product), referred to as the theoretical price,L/ and the one in effect in the
base period, (expressed in US$ and converted to TL at the current exchange
rate). Considering TPAO's Batman's products mix, the December 1982 and
December 1973 c.i.f. weighted average prices were US$283/ton and US$114/ton,
respectively.
2.05     The Decree 20 distribution stage payment for old oil is made of two
components. First, the difference between the current wholesale price (at the
refinery and excluding taxes) and the theoretical import price (excluding
taxes). The second part is the difference between the current theoretical
price and the one of the base period (expre6ded in US$ and converted at the
current exchange rate). This second part, of course, is the same payment as
the Decree 20 payment for the refining stage. For some reason, it has been
included in the Decree 20 refining stage refund. For 1979 and new oil, only
the first component is due.
b.       Example
2.06     In view of the critical importance of Decree 20 on TPAO's finances,
and its different impact on various categories of oil, it is worthwhile to
examine what happened in 1982 (provisional), when the average exchange rate
was TL 170 = US$ 1.00:
1982 IMPACT OF DECREE 20

TOTAL EXPENSES    33,193    75,909       12,852    15,889        4,795      7,832

/  Theoretical price as some of the products are not imported in practice.



- 87 --                           ANNEX 6.2
As the table above indicates, there are wide differences between the gross
margins TPAO obtains depending on the decisions it takes regarding crudes
affectations. This is further complicated by the fact that reference prices
are changed on a monthly basis. In recent years, it has found that its gross
margins were maximized by refining, respectively, royalty oil, new oil, 1979
oil and a fraction of the old oil at Batman, and transfering surpluses of old
oil to other refineries.
III.     Selling Prices
3.01     TPAO's selling prices are fixed by the Government from time to
time. The price at which it buys the royalty crude (para. 1.02) is also fixed
by the Government. Average prices in 1982 were as follows:
Average 1982 Prices
Crude Oil                    Products                    Natural Gas
TiL/Ton         US$/Bbl       TL/Ton          US$/Bbl       TL/MCF        US$/MCF
41,458           36.40       45,494            39.94         951             5.59
One should note that the margin between the price of crude oil and products
does not cover the internal refinery use and losses at Batman (11.6%).
IV.      Liquidity Problem
4.01     In recent years, TPAO has been affected by a serious liquidity
problem on account of: (i) absence of financing from domestic institutions;
(ii) difficulties of certain consumers in paying their debts when due
(particularly TEK, the power utility); (iii) large investments in projects
which have yet to produce benefits (the nmid-Anatolia refinery); (iv) until
early 1982, the importing of crude oil combined with the high rate of
inflation, resulting in high foreign exchange losses. As a result, while TPAO
was able to obtain in certain cases external foreign exchange credits, this
was not the case of TL financing. In fact, an important source of domestic
currency was the non-payment of the funds due under Decree 20. For the E&P
activity, this can be illustrated as folLows:
Decree 20 Funds Due (TL Million)
1980                1981                1982
Beginning Balance                2,992                6,696              10,703
Amount Due                       3,704                5,739               14,214
6,696               12,435              24,917
Payment                           --                  1,732               10,591
Ending Balance                   6,696               10,703               14,326
4.02     As a result, TPAO's overall current ratio was 0.8 both at end-1981
and end-1982, while for the E&P activity, it was at 0.6 in the two years under
consideration. A solution to this problem would only be found once Turkey
overcomes its current economic difficulties.



- 88 -                            ANNEX 6.2
4.03     The Government has not pressed TPAO to pay the amounts owed under
Decree 20. Furthermore, as other SEEs, TPAO has not been able to receive
interest on its Bank deposits. As a result, TPAO deposits (or at a time of
need, receives) considerable amounts in its subsidiaries. As of end-1982, it
had deposits amounting to TL 15.1 billion (US$80 million) with its
subsidiaries. Most of the transactions were with IPRAS, its subsidiary in
charge of the Istanbul Refinery, from which TPAO buys crude oil to be
processed at its Izmir Refinery.
4.04     TPAO's E&P current ratio would increase from 0.6 to 0.9 if amounts
due under Decree 20 were not taken to be current liabilities.
V.       Financial Projections
a.       Basis
5.01     The financial projections are expressed in TL, at the fixed rate of
TL 190 = US$1.00.  The assumptions for inflation, both in TL and US$ are as
follows:
Year                   Inflation (%)
1983                        8.0
1984                        7.5
1985                        7.0
1986-1988                      6.0
b.       Income Statements
5.02     Revenues:  it was assumed thai: the prices at which TPAO sells crude
oil and natural gas would remain the same as those in effect in December
1982. Separate production forecasts were prepared for old oil, 1979 oil, and
new oil, natural gas production, and royalty oil received from tha foreign
companies.
5.03     It was assumed that the Batman Refinery would process 900,000 tons of
feedstock a year, respectively, royalty oil, new oil, 1979 oil and some of the
old oil. One should note that by 1987, TPAO's production together with
royalty oil would not be sufficient to operate the refinery at its capacity,
so that only crude oil from Thrace would be sold directly. In view of the
fact that the incremental production from enhanced recovery at Bati Raman
remains to be confirmed, no allowance was made for it in the forecast. The
detailed schedule of production and revenues appears at Aljpendix 2 of this
Annex.
5.04     Royalty Oil was assumed to be purchased from the Government at the
December 1982 price, i.e., TL 36,106 per ton.
5.05     Production and Refining Costs were assumed to increase by 10%
annually.
5.06     Royalties to be paid by TPAO are at 12.5% of the well-head price.  In
December 1982, it was TL 5,235/ton, and for natural gas it was TL 3.96/SM3.



- 89 -                           ANNEX 6.2
5.07     Decree 20 provisions are based on the prices in effect in December
1982.  The detailed calculation appears aLt Appendix 1 of this Annex.
5.08     Other Taxes were estimated at 3% of revenues (excluding Decree 20 (R)
and "other Revenues").
5.09     Other Expenses are made up mostly of changes in inventories, and
were, therefore, assumed to be nil throughout the forecast period.
5.10     Depreciation/Depletion.  See para. 5.22.
5.11     Interest expenses were calculated in accordance with the debt
schedule (Appendix 3).  TPAO capitalizes however interest until projects are
completed, so that the interest expense in the early years is relatively low.
5.12     Taxes were taken to be 25% of tlhe gross income; this reflects both
TPAO's corporate tax rate (40%) and the deductions permissible under the Law:
Mi)       investment tax credit which varies from region to region
(30% in Thrace, 60% in Batman); the investment during the
year (except for housing and vehicles) is deductible at the
above rate, and the tax saving is taxed at 20%;
(ii)      bonuses paid to personnel;
(iii)     dividends from subsidiaries;
(iv)      interest on State Bonds;
(v)       dividends to shareholders; and
(vi)      exploration write-offs.
In recent years, taxes turned-out to be about 25% of gross income, and this
assumption was made for financial projection purposes.
5.13     Dividends and other bonuses to staff were assumed to be 10% of the
net annual income.
c.       Balance Sheets
5.14     Inventories were assumed to remain at their current lqvel for crude
oil, and to increase by 10% annually for spares.
5.15     Accounts Receivable were assumed to be equivalent to 3 months of
sales (excluding Decree 20) at end-83, declining to 2 months of sales from
1984 onwards.
5.16     Investment in Refining was asstimed to remain constant, so that E&P
would not transfer, nor collect funds from the refining activities of TPAO.
5.17     Fixed Assets:  See para. 5.22.



- 90 -                           ANNEX 6.2
5.18     Creditors include Decree 20 funds due to the Government, and other
amounts due to contractors, suppliers, etc. It was assumed that TPAO would,
during the forecast period, only pay Dlecree 20 if its current ratio exceeds
lO.
5.19     Taxes and Duties Payable were assumed, each year, to be debited by
previous years taxes and credited with current taxes due.,
5.20     Long Term Debt is based on the schedule at Appendix 3 of this
Annex. The new IBRD loan to TPAO was assumed to be at an effective interest
rate of 12%, with a 4-year grace period.
d.       Sources and Applications of Funds
5.21     Investment Program:  At appraisal, TPAO was not able to submit a
realistic investment program over the L984-1988 period. The 1983 program is
based on the budget, as approved by SP0, and for 1984-88, it is based on
continuation of past trends for the ongoing exploration activities and the
specific projects already identified. The investment program appears at
Appendix 4.
5.22     Depreciation is based on the f-ollowing principles:
(i)       for tangible assets, the Ministry of Finance published
detailed guidelines ("Amortisman Cetvelleri" - 1979). For
oil facilities the sitraight line method is used, and the
annual prescribed rates vary between 2% and 33%;
(ii)      for intangible assets, a 27.5% depletion allowance is
allowed, up to the value of the intangible assets; and
(iii)     with regard to the write-off of unsuccessful exploration,
the corresponding amounts are deducted directly from the
"Petroleum Exploration Fund", in fact, included in the
retained earnings, and do not appear in the Income
Statement. They are, however, deductible for tax purposes
(para. 5.12). It was assumed that annual depreciation and
depletion would be equivalent to 10% of TPAO's average
gross assets, during the forecast period.
5.23     Since January 1983, a new Law provides for an anniual revaluation of
assets, in accordance with established coefficients. As only the US$
inflation is reflected in the forecast, the assets are not revalued annually
during the period under review.
5.24     Work in Progress was taken to be 40% of the annuaLl investment
program, plus 75% of the previous year' s balance.
