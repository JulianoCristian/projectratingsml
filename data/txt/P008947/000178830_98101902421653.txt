THRACE GAS EXPLORATION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi (TPAO)
Guarantor:           Republic of Turkey
Amount:              US$55.2 million (including capitalized front-end fee).
Terms:               Seventeen years including four years of grace, with
standard variable interest rate.
Project
Description:         The project objective is to assess the hydrocarbon
potential of the borrower's licenses in the Thrace basin
and to help strengthen the borrower's ability to design
and implement an integrated basin-oriented exploration
program. The project includes completion of infill
seismic mapping of the entire licensed areas, detailed
seismic lines on structures of interest for drilling,
drilling of 11 wells, rehabilitation of three drilling
rigs and technical assistance, studies and training.
Project Benefits
and Risks:           The volume of gas that the project could potentially make
available would have a significant impact on Turkey's
balance of payments and on the energy use patterns of
consuming industries in the highly industrialized Istanbul
environs. While exploration always involves risks, on
balance the overall project risk is small, because the
minimum size discovery required to provide an acceptable
rate of economic return is less than one-tenth the size of
the most probable anticipated discoveries. The geological
risk is manageable because the basin has proven
hydrocarbon production and the proposed exploration
program maximizes the possibility of finding new
reserves. The economic risk is also small since the basin
is near the largest industrial market in Turkey and the
cost of transmission of even small additional quantities
of gas would be quite low.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE TURKIYE PETROLLERI ANONIM ORTAFLIGI
FOR A THRACE GAS EXPLORATION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi (TPAO) with the guarantee of the
Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$55.2 million (including the
capitalized front-end fee) to help finance seismic surveys, rehabilitation of
drilling rigs, exploration drilling, studies, technical assistance and
training. The loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years' grace at
the standard variable interest rate.
I PART I - THE ECONOMY _/
2.       A report entitled "Turkey:  Policies and Prospects for Growth"
(No. 2657a-TU) and the Postscript thereto, were distributed to the Executive
Directors in December 1979 and March 1980, respectively. Updating of economic
prospects has since been undertaken through the continuing work on structural
adjustment loans (SALs) to Turkey and several special economic missions. The
report of a mission to evaluate the investment program and entitled "Turkey.
Public Sector Investment Review" (No. 3472-TU) was distributed to the
Executive Directors in December 1981. The report of a mission to review
Turkey's industrialization and trade strategy entitled "Turkey;
Industrialization and Trade Strategy" (No. 3641-TU), was distributed to the
Executive Directors in March 1982. The report of a mission to review energy
sector policies entitled "Turkey:  Issues and Options in the Energy Sector"
(No. 3877-TU) was distributed to the Executive Directors in March 1983.
Missions to review recent economic developments and analyse the medium-term
prospects, and to study the agricultural sector and the financial system
visited Turkey at various times in 1982. Their findings are reflected in this
section.
3.       Turkey is about as big as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 46 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $1540.
The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural
land), and about 45 percent live in urban centres. Although population growth
is below the median for middle-income countries (2.2 percent per annum), and
despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as well as substantial
emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the Middle
1/ Parts I & II are substantially the same as Parts I & II of the President's
Report on the Second Agricultural Credit Project (P-3593-TU), dated
May 25, 1983.

East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an unemployment
rate currently about 16 percent. There is, however, little or no absolute
poverty, although income distribution is relatively skewed. There are also
considerable regional differences and large rural-urban disparities. Recent
data indicate a probable worsening in income distribution, especially of wage
and salary earners, and a sharp real decline in the minimum wage. Educational
enrollments have expanded greatly but the rate of adult literacy remains
relative low (60 percent in 1975).
Development Strategy Prior to 1980
4.       Turkish development strategy during the 1960s and 1970s aimed at
rapid growth through high rates of investment with the main emphasis on
industrialization. Import substitution was favored over exports, with State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs) playing an important role in the industrialization
strategy as well as in regional development. These policies, supported by
agricultural expansion and growing workers' remittances, helped to bring about
a favorable growth record throughout the First and Second Plan periods
(1963-72). A continuation of these policies in the face of the various
exogenous shocks of the 1970s, including the rise in world oil prices and
stagflation in the OECD economies, helped to maintain growth well into the
1970s, but finally proved unsustainable.
5.       To maintain its growth momentum in the Third Plan (1973-77), Turkey
financed a large part of its investment and import requirements through
reserve decumulation and heavy external borrowing, particularly short-term.
The rapid GNP growth, averaging around 7.7 percent per year in 1973-76, came
to an abrupt halt in mid-1977 as the massive external debt burden led to a
sharp deterioration in creditworthiness, severe shortages of imports and
disruptions in industrial production with a rise in urban unemployment; GNP
growth slowed down sharply to 4.0 percent in 1977 and to a negative figure in
1979. At the same time, domestic inflation accelerated from 24 percent in
1977 to an average of 64 percent in 1979.
6.       By the end of 1979, the rate of domestic inflation had reached over
100 percent and had become an issue of critical importance. Although
international price increases and domestic cost-push factors influenced the
inflationary process, a substantial monetary expansion was the main cause.
The monetary imbalances originated mainly from the Government's budget
deficits and the huge financing requirements of the SEEs. Political and
social unrest aggravated the economic difficulties. It was in these
exceptional circumstances that the January 1980 reform measures were adopted.
The Government's New Policy Priorities and Actions
7.       The Government's program for stabilization and restructuring of the
Turkish economy was initiated in January 1980 and is now entering its fourth
year. The program has involved policy measures which have effects both in the
short- and medium-term. In an effort to stabilize the crisis situation, a
series of urgent measures were introduced to restrict domestic demand. These
measures included enforcing tight credit ceilings by the Central Bank,
reducing the budget deficit through expenditure control and increased
taxation, and restraining growth of wages and salaries. Over the medium-term,
the program is designed to restore a better balance between the public and
private sectors of the economy and achieve sustainable growth. The key



- 3 -
elements of this program are: the adoption of a realistic and flexible
exchange rate and incentives to encourage producers to export; deregulation of
interest rates to reflect market conditions and encourage private savings; the
strengthening of public finances through tax reform; measures to improve
institutional efficiency in key sectors; a rationalization of the public
investment program; and a reform of the SEEs designed to reduce their burden
on the budget and improve their efficiency.
8.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
three structural adjustment loans, involves far-reaching changes affecting all
facets of the Turkish economy. It entails substantial changes in attitudes,
institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which take time and
face considerable resistance. In view of the severity of the crisis, and the
urgent need to bring down inflation and stabilize the balance of payments as
quickly as possible, the Government accepted the need for a temporary
sacrifice of growth and social objectives. Drastic structural changes were
made in the operation of the exchange rate regime, the tax system, interest
rate policy, export strategy, the SEE sector and public investment policy.
9.       The implementation of the program is being carried out by a military
regime which assumed power in September 1980 following a period of sustained
unrest, terrorism and deterioration in the parliamentary process.  This
Government, like previous military regimes in 1960-61 and 1971-73, has
emphasized its commitment to restore civilian rule. A Consultative Assembly
was set up to draft a new constitution, which was overwhelmingly endorsed in a
nationwide referendum in November 1982. New election and party laws are
expected to be promulgated soon, and parliamentary elections are scheduled for
November 1983.
Effects of the Structural Adjustment Process -- 1980-83
10.      The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the program
launched in 1980, and in many cases actual performance has met or exceeded the
Government's own targets. Real GNP, after falling for two consecutive years,
expanded by 4.2 percent in 1981 and 4.4 percent in 1982. Growth has been
mainly export-led, with less than one quarter of the growth in 1982 due to
domestic demand. Demand for consumption increased by 3 percent while fixed
investment grew at a modest 4.1 percent (both in real terms) in 1982, and
depletion of inventories helped to expand supply. Public investment grew
significantly slower than private investment, thus reversing the trend of
previous years. However, unemployment continued to grow in 1981 and 1982, as
employment opportunities did not increase fast enough to absorb the expansion
of the labor force.
11.      Through a combination of fiscal, monetary and income policies, the
Government has been remarkably successful in reducing the rate of inflation.
After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the annual average rate of increase in
the wholesale price index declined to 37 percent in 1981 and around 25 percent
in 1982, which was the program target. However, the degree of credit
restraint needed to reduce inflation this rapidly has had a marked effect on
liquidity in the economy and has helped to maintain interest rates at high
real levels.
12.      Commercial bank interest rates which were deregulated in July 1980
have increased substantially; with inflation gradually coming down, they are



- 4 -
now markedly positive in real terms.  As a result, total bank deposits
increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and in 1981 this trend accelerated,
with total deposits growing by 104 percent and time deposits by 263 percent.
Growth in deposits slowed somewhat in 1982, and the bankruptcy in late June
1982 of a major non-bank financial institution shook depositor confidence and
was followed by a shift of funds into the larger banks. While the Government
has averted an immediate crisis in the banking sector, additional actions to
reform and strengthen the financial sector as a whole are urgently required.
The Government is at present preparing a new banking law which aims to
strengthen the equity position and management of banks.
13.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. The current real interest
rate for non-preferential credits is about 28 percent. These high interest
rates, together with the limited availability of credit, have led to
considerable liquidity problems for the private business sector, particularly
for businesses supplying the domestic market. The banks have taken steps to
lower rates on deposits and the Government has reduced the tax on interest
received from banks with the aim of reducing interest on credit. But the
liquidity problem of the private business sector is compounded by
under-capitalization which had been encouraged by easy access to cheap bank
credit in the past. Tax changes and other measures are under preparation to
encourage the corporate sector to raise paid-up capital to levels commensurate
with those in other countries.
14.      There has been encouraging progress in the fiscal area.  The budget
deficit was reduced from 4.6 percent of GNP in 1980 to 1.2 percent in 1982.
Government expenditures as a percentage of GNP declined from 22.6 percent in
1981 to 21.5 percent in 1982, but the impact on the deficit was offset by a
slower growth in revenues than programmed. The SEE accounts showed a marked
improvement, with net profits climbing to 0.5 percent of GNP in 1982 from 0.1
percent in 1981 and their financing requirements falling from 8.8 percent of
GNP in 1981 to 5.7 percent in 1982. Moreover, supplementary appropriations
were cancelled. Public sector borrowing requirements dropped from a level of
6.5 percent of GNP in 1981 to 5.2 percent in 1982.
15.      On the external account, the flexible exchange rate policy under
which the Turkish lira has been adjusted daily since May 1981, together with
the new export-oriented policies, led to an unprecedented export growth in
1981 when exports amounted to $4.7 billion, or 62 percent higher in dollar
terms than the 1980 level. Increases were concentrated in manufactured goods
which experienced a rise of nearly 120 percent; product groups with the
largest increases included textiles, clothing, cement, iron/steel, and
non-electrical equipment, with the Middle East becoming an increasingly
important market. Exports in 1982 reached $5.75 billion, about 22 percent
increase over 1981, despite a significant decline in export prices,
particularly prices of agricultural products. As in the previous year,
manufactured exports were the major source of expansion, as exporters
continued to make inroads into the Middle East.
16.      A new and rapidly growing source of foreign exchange is income earned
from construction contracts (with a gross value of around $11 billion in 1982)
in the Middle East and North African countries. These activities are also



- 5 -
expected to add to the normal flow of worker remittances, which remained
strong throughout 1981, although declining slightly in 1982, reflecting the
appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis European currencies as well as the
impact of the recession in Western Europe.
*      17.       Imports declined in dollar terms by 2.3 percent in 1982 compared to
1981, due mainly to weaker prices of oil and raw material imports, a stronger
US dollar, a reduction in stocks and the elimination of a risk premium
previously paid by Turkish importers. As a result of these developments, the
current account balance showed a significant improvement in 1981 and 1982,
with the deficit reduced from 5.6 percent of GNP in 1980 to 3.5 percent in
1981 and about 1.7 percent in 1982, well below program targets. By the end of
1981, outstanding external disbursed debt amounted to $17.5 billion equivalent
or about 30 percent of GNP. Multilateral agencies and official bilateral
sources accounted for about two-thirds of the total outstanding. Of the
total, only 12 percent constituted short-term debt, a marked contrast to the
position in 1978 when short-term debt accounted for half of total outstanding
debt.
18.      A modest pickup of growth (4.8 percent) is anticipated in 1983
concurrent with a slowdown of inflation (to about 20 percent), based on a
slight recovery in private investment and higher capacity utilization rates.
The current account deficit is expected to decrease to $870 million in 1983
from $1 billion in 1982, representing a slight fall in relation to GNP
(1.5 percent as against 1.7 percent). These results are based on a 17 percent
projected growth in exports, a marginal improvement in workers' remittances,
(both predicated on a revival of growth in the industrial economies) and a
13 percent growth in imports (required by the upturn in domestic demand).
Medium-term Prospects
19.      It is expected that the draft Fifth Five-Year Development Plan
(1984-1988) will be completed by mid-1983. Projections prepared by the recent
Economic Mission indicate the need for a continuation of the stabilization
program until 1985, which can be followed by a growth strategy aiming at about
6-6.5 percent per annum GDP growth consistent with a manageable balance of
payments.
20.      Two basic assumptions on the sustainability of export growth and on
fiscal discipline have guided the projections. The continued growth of
exports is based on the view that conditions that have made possible the
1981-82 upsurge are not temporary. Specifically, it assumes continuation of a
flexible exchange rate policy, export incentives and import liberalization.
Secondly, it also assumes that the monetary and fiscal policy restraints will
not be relaxed to a point that will revive inflation, thus disrupting the
basic shift in development strategy.
21.      The projections of key economic variables for the period 1983-1990
are presented in Table below. Merchandise exports are projected to continue
to grow at 9.5 percent in real terms into the late 1980s on the basis of a
continuation of present policies for export promotion. Such a scenario would
also require improvement in the pace of import liberalization in order to
reduce the profit bias against exports.

22.       Merchandise imports are projected to grow slowly in real terms
through 1984 and then to pick up from 7-8 percent to an average of a little
over 9 percent for the 1985-90 period in line with the growth of demand.
23.       The current account balance, under these assumptions, would show a
decreasing deficit for 1982-85 as stabi:Lization curtails impolts while
encouraging exports. As growth sets in, the trend would be reversed for the
1985-90 period, and Turkey's current account deficit would increase again.
The terminal year 1990 would show a deficit of $1.8 billion as compared to a
1985 projected deficit of $485 million.
24.       The projected capital account would remain manageable throughout the
projection period given the need to restrain the growth of debt and maintain a
reasonable debt service ratio.  This would permit Turkey to meet the
amortization and interest payments arising from the $9.6 billion of debts
rescheduled between 1978-82 and maintain an exchange reserve equivalent to two
months' imports.
25.       Consistent with this scenario, the projections indicate a GDP growth
of 5 percent per annum for 1982-85 (stabilization period), and a higher figure
of 6.1 percent per annum for 1985-90 (growth period). Achievement of these
growth rates will be necessarily dependent on the growth of the productive
sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing. The achievement of sectoral
growth will depend to a large extent on the Government's determination to
render the public sector more efficient and to create a more favorable
investment climate for the private sector.



-7-
26.      The medium-term scenario presented above assumes an increasingly
important role for private sector investment in line with the policy of
rationalizing public sector investment in the manufacturing sector.
Accordingly, private investment is expected to grow at an average annual rate
of 9.6 percent during 1982-85 and 11 percent during 1985-90. As a corollary,
the growth of public investment will slow down from a high of 7.8 percent per
annum in real terms during 1980-82 to a more moderate 5.0 percent during
1982-85 and eventually to 4.4 percent per annum for 1985-90. This is
consistent with the framework of achieving the medium-term goal of an equal
balance in the ratio of private and public fixed investment by 1990.
Creditworthiness
27.      At the end of 1978, Turkey faced an overwhelming debt burden of
$7.5 billion in short-term debt and $6.8 billion of medium- and long-term
debt. Turkey was faced with service payment obligations (mostly on short-term
debt) of $5.1 billion (including arrears), or nearly three times the value of
merchandise exports in 1977. Following th-. resolution of the 1978 debt
crisis, Turkey pursued a very conservative nolicy of external borrowing which
was restricted almost entirely to long-term borrowing. Auch of this was
arranged through the OECD Consortium for Tur-key and was extended on
concessional terms. Also, between 1978-1980 Turkey rescheduled some
$9.6 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of rescheduling
arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors. Approximately
$6.0 billion of short-term debt, including $2.6 billion in convertible Turkish
lira deposits and bankers credits and $1.2 billion of non-guaranteed suppliers
credits, were consolidated into medium-term loans or partially converted into
Turkish lira obligations. As a result of the these measures, short-term debt
as a percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to
12.5 percent in 1981. Inflows were mostly from official sources -- major
creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Of the total
debt outstanding at end-1981, 87 percent constituted medium- and long-term
debt. Based on the growth scenario outlined earlier, debt outstanding and
disbursed as a percent of GDP is projected to rise from 28 percent in 1981 to
31 percent in 1982 and then fall to 29 percent in 1985 and 26 percent in 1990.
28.      Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the coming
years. Accordingly, the debt service ratio is projected to increase to
24.2 percent in 1982 from about 14 percent in 1981 as a result of a large
repayment of previously rescheduled debt under the earlier OECD agreements.
Projections beyond 1982 show a decline of the debt service ratio to
19.4 percent in 1984, an increase to 20.6 percent in 1985 (again on account of
repayments of rescheduled debt), and then a fall to 18.1 percent in 1990. The
debt burden should remain manageable, provided current policies are
successfully implemented, the export drive is sustained, and Turkey continues
to receive further international support from private and official donors.
29.      On all aspects of economic analysis, the IMF and the Bank have
coordinated closely with each other, and Turkey continues to be in good
standing with the IMF. A three-year standby arrangement in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1,250 million was approved by the IMF's Board and became
effective on June 18, 1980. Under the arrangement, Turkey has thus far made
ten purchases totalling SDR 1,060 million. The present standby is to expire
on June 17, 1983 and a one year extension is being sought by the Turkish
authorities.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
30.      Through May 31, 1983 the Bank/IDA have lent $3,939 million to Turkey,
through 71 projects.  Agriculture accounts for 18 percent of funds lent,
industry and DFCs for 34 percent, power for 13 percent, structural adjustment
and program loans for 26 percent, and urban development, transportation,
education and tourism for the remaining 9 percent.  As of March 31, 1983, IFC
commitments to Turkey totalled about $236 million, of which about $82 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides,a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1983, with notes on the status
of ongoing projects.
31.      The execution of Bank-financed projects in the public sector has been
slow, due in part to weak management, limited coordination amongst ministries,
staffing problems, and the serious external and domestic financial crisis from
1977 to 1979. There has been notable improvement since September 1980.
Nevertheless, problems persist in many cases, reflecting difficulties in
staffing the public sector at-current salaries, over-centralized bureaucratic
structures, and conti-luing constraints on the availability of local funds.
The implementation of private sector projects has generally been more
satisfactory. Recent y, however, the high interest rates for working capital
combined with depressed domestic demand and reluctance of investors to take
the foreign exchange risk, have led to slow commitments under DFC lending.
Disbursements average 53 percent of appraisal estimates (excluding structural
adjustment loans) as compared to 55 percent for Tunisia and 45 percent for
Morocco.
32.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of redirecting the Turkish economy towards a development path placing more
reliance on market forces and adopiting a more outward-oriented strategy.
These objectives also include increasing domestic savings and reorienting a
restrained public investment program to reflect the Government's priorities of
completing ongoing projects faster and emphasizing quick-yielding new
investments with positive balance of payments impact. The main vehicle for
the Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program. Three SALs have so far been approved, and a
fourth is scheduled for consideration by the Executive Directors on
June 23, 1983.
33.      Agriculture, industry, transportation and energy will continue to be
the key sectors for project lending. In agriculture, projects are expected to
emphasize irrigation, credit, and reform of the extension and research
services.  In industry (including DFCs), the emphasis will be on the promotion
of exports, employment, and increasing operational efficiency. Energy
projects underway are for power generation based on domestic hydro and lignite
resources, as well as enhanced oil recovery and oil and gas exploration.
Future projects will emphasize both the oil/gas and coal/lignite sub-sectors.
In addition, transportation projects will focus on developing the
infrastructure to facilitate exports and improve the efficiency of
operations. Projects for industrial training, urban and regional development
and public utilities may supplement these efforts.
34.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work undertaken recently includes studies of the agricultural and financial



- 9 -
sectors. Topics likely to be covered in the future include a review of the
next five-year development plan, employment, SEEs, transportation and the
agro-industrial subsector.
35.      This is the fifth loan to Turkey to be presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year. Other projects being processed include: technical
assistance to SEEs, industrial training, agricultural extension, gas
development, fertilizer production and rehabilitation of the paper industry.
36.      The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt was
9 percent in 1981, and is expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1985; its
share of total debt service payments is projected to increase from about
13 percent in 1981 to about 14 percent in 1985.
37.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, pulp and paper, glass, aluminum,
iron and steel products, meat processing, motor bicycle engines, truck
manufacture, piston rings and cylinder liners, and tourism. It has also
invested in the Turkish Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB). New
investment opportunities are being pursued.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE PETROLEUM SUBSECTOR
Energy Resources
38.      Turkey has substantial untapped hydropower and lignite resources, as
well as more limited, but still important, oil, gas and coal resources and
geothermal potential. Hydropower with potential economic viability is
estimated at about 29,500 MW and corresponds to an annual production of about
100,000 GWh under average hydrological conditions. Only 10 percent has been
developed so far, but this is projected to rise to about 30 percent over the
next 10 years with the completion of hydropower generating plants under
construction or planned. There are also a large number of sites suitable for
small hydropower schemes of up to 20 MW. Proven recoverable petroleum
reserves are about 16 million tons. However, potential reserves that may
become economically recoverable with enhanced oil recovery techniques, which
are currently being tested, could be as high as 30 million tons. Proven
recoverable gas reserves are about 450 billion standard cubic feet (about
10 MMTOE). The first significant domestic gas production is expected to begin
in 1985; production in 1980 was very small. Coal production has also been
declining as operations move to deeper, less accessible seams; in 1980
production was 3.6 million tons (2.4 MMTOE). Proven reserves of economically
recoverable and usable asphaltite and shale oil are insignificant. Proven and
probable lignite reserves are about 7.5 billion tons, but about half of this
is of extremely low quality (950-1,000 kcal/kg). Production in 1982 was about
17.7 million tons, equivalent to about 3.8 million tons of oil.
Energy Consumption and Supply
39.      Total energy consumption was about 33 million tons of oil equivalent
(TOE) in 1980, of which commercial energy consumption amounted to 26 million
TOE. Petroleum made up the most significant share of primary commercial
energy consumption (60 percent), with lignite (18 percent), hard coal
(10 percent), hydropower (11 percent) and imported electricity providing the
balance. Overall, 23 percent of final commercial energy consumption was in



- 10 -
the form of electricity. Non-commercial energy production (primarily
fuelwood, but also other biomass) was also an important energy source,
especially for the household sector.  Per capita energy consumption is likely
to rise rapidly during the balance of the 1980s, in parallel wii-h rising per
capita income.  To meet rising energy requirements, Turkey launched a massive
program in the late 1970s to increase the domestic production of electricity
and lignite. This program has stretched the implementation capabilities of
the public energy agencies and spread their resources over too rnany projects,
with resulting delays in implementation.
Organization of the Energy Sector
40.      The energy sector in Turkey is characterized by the dominance of
Government-owned enterprises and agencies. The Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (MENR) is responsible for the development of energy resources.
Under MENR, the Turkish Coal Enterprise (TKI), the Turkish Petroleum
Corporation (TPAO), and the Mineral Exploration and Research Institute (MTA)
have responsibility for the extraction of fossil fuels and radioactive
minerals.  Identification, design and construction of hydro projects is
entrusted to the State Hydraulic Works (DSI). The Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) is responsible for generation, transmission, and since
November 1982 also for distribution of almost all the electricity sold in
Turkey. The General Directorate of Petroleum Affairs (GDPA) is the operating
arm of the MENR responsible for implementing the Petroleum Law.
Energy Sector Policies
41.      Throughout the 1970s the Government's efforts to maintain domestic
energy prices led to increasingly serious economic problems. The low wellhead
prices set for domestic petroleum production became a major deterrent to
exploration and development by international oil companies. At the same time,
the policy of holding domestic petroleum product prices constant in local
currency terms, despite accelerating domestic inflation and rising world
prices for energy, led to rapidly increasing demand for petroleum and rapidly
increasing imports. Similarly, prices for hard coal, lignite and, to a lesser
extent, electricity, the other major primary energy sources for Turkey, were
also held down, causing serious financial losses to TKI and reduced profits to
TEK. The low prices also discouraged the adoption of effective conservation
measures. The policy of energy subsidies was largely abandoned after the
financial and political crises of late 1979 and early 1980, and since then
most prices of petroleum products have been raised to international levels and
have been maintained at those levels by regular adjustments.
42.      The Government is in the process of developing a program for the
conservation of energy resources by encouraging their more efficient use in
existing and new industrial enterprises. Energy efficiency programs and
legislation are being evaluated. Legislation has been passed allowing for tax
credits for various types of investments in energy efficiency improvements.
The Petroleum Subsector
43.      The high degree of dependence on imported petroleum is a dominant
factor in Turkey's pattern of energy consumption. Petroleum production
reached a peak of 3.6 million tons in 1969, and then declined slowly to about
2.3 million tons in 1982 as existing sources were depleted and not replaced by
new discoveries. Imports rose at a rate of 20 percent per year between 1970



- 11 -
arid 1978, from 4.3 to 14.3 million tons. The oil import bill grew rapidly,
surpassing total export earnings in 1980. However, increases slowed
substantially as foreign exchange constraints limited Turkey's import
capabilities and as economic activity declined. Turkey currently produces
only about 14 percent of its oil consumption, down from 47 percent in 1970; in
1982, imports amounted to about 13.9 million tons. Oil production is expected
to continue declining over the next few years in the absence of significant
new discoveries. However, if the large-scale enhanced recovery projects
involving the two major fields (Bati Raman and Raman) are successful, this
decline could be reversed towards the end of the decade.
44.      Until recently, little attention had been given to examining
alternative resources that would help reduce the energy gap. Gas production,
which is currently negligible, is expected to increase to about 50 million
standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD), or over 0.4 MMTOE per year, when the
Hamitabat field is fully developed in 1986. Once a pipeline is constructed,
additional gas discoveries could be brought to market rapidly. By 1990,
annual production levels of one to two MMTOE (or 125-250 MMSCFD of gas) appear
to be reasonable, and there is a small possibility that production levels
could be as high as 4.0 MMTOE (500 MMSCFD of gas) per year if 5 trillion cubic
feet (TCF) of recoverable gas reserves were to be proven. This would
contribute significantly to the reduction of Turkey's energy deficit.
Petroleum Institutions
45.      The Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO), which was established in
1954, was given responsibility for oil exploration and for production,
importation, refining, transportation and marketing of oil. Petrol Ofisi is
the state economic enterprise that distributes and retails most of the
products refined and imported by TPAO and its affiliates. In addition to its
petroleum exploration and production activities, TPAO owns and operates two
refineries: the first processes crude oil produced by TPAO in Southeast
Turkey, while the second processes imported crude oil; a new refinery is under
construction near Ankara. TEAO also has a majority interest in six
subsidiaries and equity in four other companies; the activities of these firms
include refining and downstream operations. In conjunction with the Bank
loans to TPAO in FY81, a detailed action program was agreed under which TPAO
was to transfer responsibility for importing petroleum and for refining and
marketing imported petroleum and petroleum products. While TPAO has been
relieved of responsibility for importing oil, which was an important objective
of the agreed reorganization, responsibility for refineries that process
imported oil has not yet been transferred. The plan for restructuring TPAO
was absorbed into the broader SEE Reform Law which was passed in May 1983.
The new law sets up five petroleum institutions under a holding company, the
Turkish Petroleum Company (TPK). These institutions cover: (a) petroleum
exploration and production; (b) petroleum refining; (c) oil and gas pipelines;
(d) marine transport; and (e) wholesale and retail product distribution. The
Borrower has agreed that the formal restructuring would be completed by
June 30, 1984 (Loan Agreement, Section 4.06(a)).
Petroleum and Gas Pricing Policy
46.      Since 1979, petroleum product prices have been periodically increased
to reflect world market prices. For oil produced from wells drilled after
1979, crude oil prices have been fixed at international levels which would



- 12 -
provide incentives for exploration by private companies in Turkey. The
Government has yet to adopt an official system for pricing natural gas either
at the well head or at the point of consumption. Until a distribution system
is established to supply gas for fertilizer and power plants, the Government
is encouraging nearby industries to utilize gas by offering small discounts.
During negotiations, it was agreed that the price of gas would be based on the
cost to the economy of fuel oil delivered at the same location (Guarantee
Agreement, Section 3.02).
Petroleum Geology of Turkey
47.      Turkey's proximity to the large Middle East producing areas would
perhaps appear to favor it as an exploration prospect. Indeed, several major
oil companies operating in the Gulf States have at one time or another
undertaken exploration activities in Turkey, the most active of which were in
close proximity to the Iraq and Syrian producing areas, i.e. in Southeast
Turkey. There has also been some activity in the Thrace Basin in western
Turkey, but very little in the remaining parts of the country. Although some
notable successes were achieved, it gradually became clear that very large oil
fields were unlikely to be present in Turkey: by Middle Eastern standards,
the oil fields that were discovered were small and complex, rendering
exploration and production difficult and expensive.
48.      A complete review of the geological data available to date indicates
that among the many basins in Turkey, only two areas contain significant
hydrocarbon potential. The first, Southeast Turkey, has been fully explored
with the exception of Hakkari, where additions to reserves are expected from
infill drilling and enhanced recovery. The second, in Thrace, is likely to
develop into an important hydrocarbon (primarily gas) producing area. While
several other areas contain some geological elements favorable for oil and gas
generation, exploration is rendered difficult due to adverse topography, rapid
changes in the composition of prospective geological formations and the
generally small size of anticipated trapping structures.
Turkey's Exploration Strategy
49.      Turkey's strategy for exploration, previously limited to expanding
TPAO's activities, has been evolving rapidly in the past few years. It now
emphasizes an extended role for private investment in exploration and
development of the country's potential through legal, administrative and price
reforms, through decreasing the amount of acreage that TPAO can hold, and
through encouraging TPAO to look for joint ventures. It has also encouraged
TPAO to operate within its financial and staff capacities, and to focus more
of its energies in those areas in which it has a comparative advantage, such
as in natural gas and heavy oil development.
50.      By the beginning of 1983, five foreign companies held 66 licenses
(some in joint-venture agreements with local companies) covering 3.1 million
ha, local private companies held 44 licenses covering 1.9 milliort ha, and TPAO
held 155 licenses covering 7.4 million ha. Thus, between 1974 and 1982,
TPAO's licensed area decreased from over 90 percent to about 60 percent of the
total licensed area. Furthermore, TPA0 will soon have to reduce its licensed
holding again, since the new Petroleum Law which was enacted in March 1983 has
a provision to reduce the maximum allowable number of licenses that TPAO can
hold in each district from 16 to 12. Four of the new foreign exploration



- 13 -
groups are actively engaged in gathering new seismic data. Exploration
drilling has not yet taken place, but is expected to start by early 1984.
51.      TPAO has also been indicating to all interested investors that most
concession areas presently under its jurisdiction are available for joint
ventures. TPAO has a joint venture program with Shell in two license areas,
and Shell is planning to drill two wells in these blocks in 1983. One
offshore joint venture to drill two wells in the Bay of Iskenderun was
implemented, but no oil was found. In addition, TPAO has just concluded
negotiations with three other foreign companies for joint ventures. While
none of these agreements include a commitment to drill at this stage, they
will all require the foreign partners to undertake significant exploration
data acquisition programs at their expense. Other companies have also
expressed interest, but were not willing to go beyond exchanging letters of
intent with TPAO until the new Petroleum Law was passed. TPAO plans a major
promotion effort to develop additional joint ventures now that the legislation
has been enacted.
52.      TPAO's own exploration strategy has been closely tied to its budget
allocations. Starting in the late 1970s when TPAO acquired a number of
drilling rigs, exploration drilling began to expand so rapidly that its
geologists and geophysicists found it increasingly difficult to provide
adequate support. However, by late 1982, wildcat exploration drilling was
substantially curtailed by budget controls. The 1983 program calls for only
10 wildcat exploration wells, down from about twice that number in 1982. This
has forced TPAO to set clear priorities on its exploration program. The
focusing of its exploration program on the development of Turkey's natural gas
potential reflects TPAO's comparative advantage in this area relative to
foreign companies. The Bank has reviewed the exploration strategy and
considers it appropriate. The current level of exploration investment is
consistent with TPAO's prospects and its technical and financial
capabilities. During negotiations, it was agreed that TPAO would review its
exploration programs annually with the Bank and would take the Bank's comments
into consideration before implementing them (Loan Agreement, Section 4.05).
The Bank's Role in the Sector
53.      The energy work of the Bank in Turkey has included identification of
structural issues encompassing the entire energy sector and the
narrower-focused issues of the individual subsectors. The structural issues
were reviewed in detail during the Energy Assessment mission of 1981. The key
topics highlighted were the effectiveness of energy institutions, energy
conservation and energy planning. The recommendations of the mission
contained in the Energy Assessment Report (No. 3877-TU) were discussed with
the Government in November 1982. An energy action program dealing with these
topics is being developed under the proposed Fourth Structural Adjustment Loan.
54.      The subsector-specific issues have been addressed through project
lending. Prior to 1979, the Bank lending in the energy sector consisted
mainly of projects for electric power. Issues related to the electricity
subsector have been reviewed in the Staff Appraisal Report of the Third TEK
Transmission Project (Report No. 4407-TU, dated May 31, 1983). The Bank's
involvement in the petroleum subsector started in FY79 in response to the
Government's recognition of the critical importance of petroleum imports in



- 14 -
the country's balance of payments. During this review of the petroleum
subsector, two priority areas of attention were identified: (i) the need to
provide a transfer of advanced technology to develop existing resources; and
(ii) the problems of effectively expanding exploration activity in the country.
55.      Turkey had already identified substantial quantities oif heavy oil as
well as significant gas resources, but did not possess the advarnced technology
required to develop them. To provide for this transfer of technology, an
engineering loan was approved in FY79 (S-13-TU) to finance a comparative study
which evaluated alternative technologies for increasing the production of the
Bati Raman oil field, the largest oil field in Turkey. This study was
followed by the Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery Field Demonstration Project
(1917-TU), which is helping to finance the field trials of the C02 injection
method, the technology chosen to increase production. While project
implementation started slowly due primarily to initial delays in equipment
procurement, it is now proceeding smoothly, with the initial testing expected
to begin in mid-1984. A number of international oil companies have shown
interest in lending personnel for the technology panel that will review the
initial results and advise on an optimum strategy. It is believed that the
results will show that the process is still profitable at current petroleum
prices.
56.      The Bank review also identified the need to reevaluate the production
potential of the Hamitabat gas field in Thrace, a field which had been
discovered in 1971 and left undeveloped for almost a decade. As a result, the
second component of Loan 1917-TU was designed to test the usefulness of
advanced fracturing techniques to increase its gas production potential to a
point where development would become economically viable. The reservoir
fracturing tests of the field demonstrated that sufficient gas could be
produced to justify the construction of a transmission pipeline to deliver the
gas to large consumers. As a result, TPAO is developing the field and
planning a transmission pipeline. It is also expanding its gas exploration
program in the Thrace Basin.
57.      Until 1979, petroleum exploration was de facto closed to the private
sector, and the state oil company had not adequately focused its own
exploration program on high potential areas. In its policy dialogue with the
Government, the Bank has placed major emphasis on the need for strategies for
stimulating private sector involvement in petroleum exploration, and the
Government has taken a number of important measures including, on the one
hand, encouraging foreign companies by fixing wellhead oil prices at
international levels and allowing companies to export up to 35 percent of
their new oil and, on the other hand, providing more opportunities to foreign
companies by getting TPAO to reduce its acreage holdings and encouraging it to
enter into joint ventures on the acreage it continues to hold. These new
policies have been instrumental in improving the exploration climate. Between
1978 and 1980, no new exploration activities were undertaken by foreign
companies. Today, five new foreign oil companies have obtained exploration
licenses and have undertaken substantial seismic work; three are planning to
drill exploration wells in 1984. In the last year TPAO has also negotiated
agreements with three companies for joint venture projects. The new Petroleum
Law should further improve the investment climate for foreign oil companies.
While the process of attracting foreign oil companies is now well underway, it
has not produced concrete results as fast as the Bank had originally
anticipated, largely due to the current petroleum market situation which has
greatly reduced the level of exploration undertaken by international companies.



- 15 -
58.      The subsector planning dialogue has helped refocus TPAO's exploration
program on high priority prospects consistent with its limited exploration
budget. The Petroleum Exploration Project (Loan 1916-TU) was designed to
assist TPAO find better leads for its exploration undertakings, primarily
through basin studies, geophysical (seismic) surveys, and the drilling of a
few key exploration wells in Southeast Turkey. Initial project implementation
was slow, and a review of the first round of geophysical surveys and basin
studies showed that the results did not meet original expectations. This new
technical information contributed to the reevaluation of TPAO's exploration
priorities and the shift to gas. In view of the upgrading of the gas
potential of the Hamitabat field and the subsequent gas finds at nearby
locations, it was agreed to expand the scope of the activities supported by
Loan 1916-TU to include further exploration in the Thrace Basin. This has
enabled TPAO to expand its seismic data acquisition program in 1983 in order
to provide detailed seismic coverage of the locations to be drilled in 1984
under the proposed project.
59.      Turkey has yet to produce any significant commercial quantities of
gas, and is in the beginning stages of formulating a gas development
strategy. Foreign companies have shown no interest in exploring for or
developing gas reserves, partly because of the lack of an official gas
utilization policy and available marketing infrastructure. The essential
steps to rectify this situation include making an inventory of the total
available supplies of gas in the Thrace Basin and providing the infrastructure
and contractual framework to enable companies to profitably distribute gas to
consumers. The proposed gas exploration project and the gas distribution
project to be appraised in the near future would support such a policy.
Additional gas discoveries in the Thrace Basin and the development of the
infrastructure required to move the gas from Thrace to the market would also
provide incentives to private companies to participate in gas exploration in
Thrace.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
60.      Exploration for hydrocarbons in Thrace has, to date, led to the
discovery of one medium sized gas field (Hamitabat) and two small oil fields
(Map IBRD 17111). However, oil and gas shows have been encountered in
numerous previous exploration wells in many areas of the basin. Despite these
encouraging indications, past exploration activities were slow and sporadic,
and until recently, no systematic exploration strategy had been developed.
Recently, however, successful exploration drilling by TPAO has firmly
demonstrated the hydrocarbon potential of the basin. Furthermore, many
geological structures have been identified which appear to have closures that
may contain trapped hydrocarbons. TPAO holds 14 licenses in the Thrace
Basin. Although other private companies hold an additional 14 licenses, at
this time TPAO is the only active operator. While large gaps remain in the
exploration coverage of TPAO's licenses, a provisional assessment of their
hydrocarbon potential has been undertaken. There is a high probability that
additional reserves (on the order of 1 TCF of gas) could be present in the
immediate vicinity of Hamitabat. The gas potential of all of TPAO's licenses
could be several TCF.



- 16 -
61.      The project was identified in November 1982 and appraised in
January 1983. Loan negotiations were held in Washington from May 10 to
May 20, 1983. The Turkish delegation was led by Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief
Financial and Economic Counselor of the Turkish Embassy in Washington, and
included representatives of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the
Ministry of Finance, and TPAO. The main features of the loan and project are
provided in the loan and project summary and in Annex III.
Project Objectives and Description
62.      The project's main objective is to assess the hydrocarbon potential
of TPAO's licenses in the Thrace Basin. The second is to strengthen TPAO's
ability to design and implement an integrated basin-oriented exploration
program. In order to arrive at a reliable estimate of the total hydrocarbon
potential of the Thrace Basin, about 30 new exploration wells would need to be
drilled. Of these, 75 to 80 percent would be directed towards testing the
Hamitabat, Ceylan and Osmancik reservoirs which are known to be gas bearing in
the Umurca and Hamitabat fields. The rest would be directed towards the
evaluation of the oil prospects in the reef area in the northern part of the
basin.
63.      The project, which would cover the first stage of such an evaluation,
would include the completion of a full seismic grid on all of TPAO's Thrace
licenses, detailed infill seismic mapping of areas with structures of
particular importance and the drilling of wells to test about one-third of the
most promising structures. Drilling would be restricted to four of the most
promising license areas. It is expected to be completed in three years.
64.      The proposed project comprises the following components:
(i) Seismic Surveys and Seismic Interpretation: Approximately
1800 line-km of seismic surveys would be undertaken to
complete the coverage of all of TPAO's license areas and
clearly identify specific drilling locations.
(ii)  Exploration Drilling:  The drilling component would include
the drilling and testing of 11 exploration wells. Casing,
cementing and testing would be required for all wells
drilled. Completion andl production testing would be required
for all wells that encounter significant volumes of
hydrocarbons. It is estimated that five wells would need to be
completed for production testing. The engines and mud
processing equipment of TPAO's three heavy duty drilling rigs
would be upgraded.
(iii) Studies: Two major categories of studies would be required:
(a) geological and sedimentological studies; and
(b) development studies to determine the optimum method of
developing new fields.
(iv) Technical Assistance, to supplement TPAO's staff in areas
where TPAO does not have adequate specialized personnel.



- 17 -
(v) Training, including courses on drilling technology, mud
engineering, cementing of high-pressure gas wells, testing and
completion procedures, advanced seismic acquisition,
processing and interpretation, financial management and
foreign language training.
A Staff Appraisal Report (No. 4433-TU) dated June 2, 1983, and entitled
"Thrace Gas Exploration Project", is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors.
65.      Since petroleum exploration programs are subject to modifications as
new information becomes available, the components of the project could be
significantly altered during the implementation period. Accordingly, TPAO has
agreed that the exploration and development programs would be submitted to the
Bank for its review and agreement on an annual basis, and any revision to such
program would require the Bank's agreement. Furthermore, for each well
financed from the loan, TPAO would present a geological prognosis,
benefit-risk analysis and well drilling program for the Bank's approval
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.06).
Project Implementation
66.      Seismic data acquisition would be carried out by an international
specialized contractor under the supervision of qualified TPAO personnel. The
seismic data would be processed in TPAO's new seismic center which is to be
commissioned during 1983, along with the approximately 700 line-km of seismic
data for the Thrace Basin that is being acquired under Loan 1916-TU. A
limited amount of specialized processing may have to be carried out outside
Turkey. TPAO would be responsible for seismic mapping (aimed at defining
drillable prospects), interpretation and compilation of seismic data and
mapping important horizons throughout the basin in order to arrive at an early
ranking of the licensed areas.
67.      TPAO now has sufficient experienced personnel to supervise seismic
data acquisition and carry out data interpretation and mapping. A Thrace
Basin project group, headed by an experienced geologist, has already been
formed in the exploration department. TPAO also intends to hire consultants,
as required, to assist in these tasks. The above arrangements are considered
satisfactory.
68.      Drilling would be carried out by TPAO rigs and TPAO personnel;
specialized services would be performed by appropriate firms, which would also
train TPAO personnel. TPAO is fully capable of implementing the exploration
drilling program in the Thrace Basin. It has demonstrated its capability over
the last ten years by successfully drilling and completing 23 deep wells in
the Hamitabat gas field. Its performance has generally been up to
international industry standards. The use of TPAO's rigs is the most
cost-effective method of implementing the project. TPAO's full charge-back
cost of rig operation and maintenance for implementing the project (about
$19 million) is only 60 percent of the estimated cost after international
competitive bidding. The size of TPAO's drilling department would not be
increased above the level required to continue its long-term program for
exploration in Thrace.



- 18 -
69.      To ensure that the drilling program is carried out satisfactorily,
TPAO would hire, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, specialized
firms to perform all the well services (e.g. cementing, testing, electric
logging) and train its staff in the above tasks (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
Implementation Schedule
70.      Initial seismic data acquisition required in the implementation of
the proposed project is being financed under Loan 1916-TU as part of the 1983
seismic program. The seismic program under this project woulcd be carried out
during the 1984 and 1985 seasons (from April to October) The necessary rig
rehabilitation program would be initiated during the second half of 1983 in
order to permit the drilling program to start in early 1984. Drilling of 11
wells would be carried out over 1984-86.
Project Cost
71.      The cost of the project is estimated at $98.9 million, including
contingencies. Physical contingencies have been calculated at 10 percent for
the seismic program and 25 percent for drilling. Price contingencies, for
both foreign and local costs, have been calculated at 8.0 percent for 1983,
7.5 percent for 1984, 7.0 percent for 1985 and 6.0 percent for 1986 onwards.
The project is exempted from custom duties and taxes. The Bank loan,
including the front-end fee, would amount to $55.2 million or 56 percent of
total project costs. The project would account for about 14 percent of TPAO's
investment program ($723.0 million equivalent) over the period 1983-86.
Procurement and Disbursement
72.      International competitive bidding procedures, in accordance with Bank
guidelines, would be followed in the procurement of seismic contractors, rig
rehabilitation equipment, casings, tubings, drilling bits, wellheads, mud
products, rig parts and completion equipment (altogether about $40 million
worth of equipment and services). Limited international tendering procedures
would be followed where only a few suppliers are capable of providing the
goods and services. This would be the case for casing accessories, special
case bits, API quality cement and additives, liner hangers, special chemicals,
completion equipment, stimulation products, cementing, logging and testing
services, stimulation services and production testing materials (altogether
approximately $8 million worth of equipment and services). Direct shopping
through TPAO's procedures would be followed for language laboratory equipment,
rig spare parts and other drilling equipment contracts not exceeding $250,000
each, estimated in the aggregate to cost about $2 million. Consultants and
technical assistance personnel would be recruited in accordance with Bank
guidelines. The Bank loan would finance the full foreign costs of the
following items: (i) equipment and materials for rehabilitation and drilling
of eleven wells; (ii) services required for logging and cementing, completing
and testing the wells; (iii) seismic data acquisition and interpretation
program; and (iv) technical assistance and training. In addition, the full
cost of the proposed studies would be financed.
73.      Advance contracting would be applied for the rig rehabilitation
equipment in order to enable TPAO to commence drilling activities in
early-1984, which is possible if orders for the equipment are placed by June
1983. No retroactive financing would be required.



- 19 -
Ecology and Safety
74.      The seismic and drilling operations would take place in a sparsely
populated agricultural area. Geophysical survey lines and drilling locations
would be selected with a view to avoiding close proximity to habitation and
water wells, if and when they are present. All international water zones
including surface water would be protected by following international oil well
drilling standards. TPAO would contain and clean up any contamination that
originated above the surface from drilling mud pits.
75.      Exploration drilling in high-pressure gas zones entails some risks of
blowouts and possibly fire. The risk is minimized by using blowout preventers
and sophisticated equipment introduced in the mud logging unit to monitor
traces of gas coming out of the hole. TPAO is fully aware of the risks
involved, and has maintained an excellent safety record in recent years by
adhering to API standards.
TPAO's Financial Condition
76.      TPAO's balance sheet (not consolidated with that of its subsidiaries)
is strong, with a debt-equity ratio of 8:92. The low indebtedness of TPAO is
explained by the absence of development projects in recent years. The long
term investments represent, for the most part, TPAO's equity in its
subsidiaries. The main weakness is its negative working capital, with the
current ratio at 0.85. This is explained mostly by the unavailability of
long-term domestic financing. As a result, TPAO had to use its working
capital to finance part of the local cost of its investments. The main
creditor affected was the Government, as TPAO deferred payment on part of the
amounts due for petroleum taxes; thus the lack of working capital has not
affected its overall operations and TPAO was able to achieve broadly its
investment targets in the past two years. The Government has agreed to assist
TPAO to solve its liquidity problem through appropriate financial measures
including the finding of locEl sources of long-term financing
(Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.02).
77.      TPAO's exploration and production activities have been profitable in
recent years, and on average TPAO was able to finance about 60-80 percent of
its exploration and petroleum investment program from internal sources. In
recent years, the petroleum tax has increased from 19 percent of sales in 1979
to 29 percent in 1982. The exploration and production activities have very
little indebtedness. The bulk of the long-term debt is represented by two
Bank loans, 1916-TU and 1917-TU.
Financial Prospects
78.      Because the exploration and production activities are to be separated
from the import-based activities during 1983, financial projections were
prepared for TPAO's exploration and production activities. TPAO has agreed to
(i) maintain separate accounts for the exploration and production activities
and not transfer funds from such accounts to the accounts of any of its other
activities; and (ii) conduct all transactions between its production and
refining units at market prices (Loan Agreement, Section 4.04).



- 20 -
79.      The exploration and production activities are expected to be
financially sound until at least 1986. Profits are expected to remain at the
level of TL 6-11 billion ($30-60 million) over 1983-86; the debt-equity ratio
also would remain satisfactory through end-1986, taking into account the scope
of operations included under exploration and production activities. Bank
forecasts indicate that TPAO could suffer losses after 1986. However, this is
unlikely to occur, since there are excellent possibilities that gas sales
would increase because of additional gas discoveries in Thrace, and further
that the tests (expected at end-1984) under Loan 1917-TU will demonstrate the
feasibility of producing substantially larger quantities of oil from the Bati
Raman field. In fact, it is likely that these two factors will play an
overwhelming role in TPAO's future, and will have a critical influence on the
growth of its earning power throughout thie 1990s.
80.      TPAO's ability to take on new debt burdens and attract cofinancing
along with Bank financing would, of course, be dependent primar-ily on the
ability of new projects to generate adequate earnings to service this debt.
Therefore, to ensure satisfactory financial performance TPAO would:
(i) finalize its annual investment program and the corresponding financing
plan by October 31 of each year and furnish them to the Bank for review and
comment (Loan Agreement, Section 5.07); (ii) agree not to incur any new
long-term debt unless a reasonable forecast of its revenues and expenditures
shows that its aggregated projected net revenues for each full fiscal year are
at least twice the aggregated projected debt service requirements
(Loan Agreement, Section 5.06); (iii) maintain a long-term debt to equity
ratio not greater than 1:1; (iv) maintain a current ratio not less than 1.0;
and (v) maintain a working capital level equivalent to at least two months of
estimated operating expenses (Loan Agreement, Section 5.05). Furthermore,
should TPAO's accounts receivable exceed the equivalent of two months of
sales, the Government would provide, or cause TPAO to be provided with, the
amount by which such receivables exceed such sales, at an interest rate not
greater than the average rate TPAO receives on its outstanding receivables
(Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.02).
Accounting, Finance and Audit
81.      TPAO's accounting records are kept in accordance with Turkey's
National Uniform Accounting Code as well as the relevant provisions of the
Petroleum Law and Regulations.  In accordance with its statutes, TPAO's
accounting records are examined by two auditors who report to the Board on a
bi-annual basis, and to the shareholders annually. In addition, the
Governmental Auditing Committee (in the office of the Prime Minister) performs
a continuous audit and submits its findings to the State Economic Enterprise
subcommittee of the Parliament. Lastly, the Board of Tax Examiners in the
Ministry of Finance has since 1980 conducted annual audits in accordance with
the Bank's requirements. These procedures are acceptable.
82.      Until recently, the financial function was given little importance by
TPAO in the planning process, and its capital budgeting and investment
planning capability needs to be strengthened. TPAO is already receiving
assistance in these areas. The services of a financial adviser familiar with
the procedures used by oil companies in capital budgeting and financial
planning are to be provided under the proposed project.

Project Risks and Benefits                                                                f
83.      The risks of the project have been identified and have been taken
into consideration in the project design. The geological risk is manageable
because the Thrace Basin has proven hydrocarbon production and the exploration
program, as designed jointly by the Bank and TPAO, maximizes the probability
of finding new reserves. The technical risk is small because the drilling
conditions are well understood and the proposed project has included the
strengthening of TPAO through the introduction of external technical support
for specialized operations of the drilling program. The economic risk is
small because the basin is near the largest industrial market in Turkey; hence
the costs of distributing additional gas supplies to this market will be quite
low after the trunk pipeline needed for the development of existing reserves
is completed. Finally, the overall project risk is small because the minimum
size discovery required to provide an acceptable economic rate of return is
less than one-tenth the expected size of the anticipated discoveries.
84.      The geological risk is that insufficient volumes of hydrocarbons will
be found to justify the exploration expense. There are excellent prospects of
finding 2 TCF of recoverable reserves (about 50 million TOE) in the basin as a
whole, and about half that amount in this exploration project. This would be
in addition to the proven recoverable reserves of over 0.4 TCF. To minimize
the geological risks, the design of the proposed project has included the
following provisions: (i) exploration drilling would be limited to only four
of the most promising of TPAO's 14 licenses in the basin; (ii) most of the
drilling would be focussed on the Hamitabat-Umurca gas trend, which has proven
productive potential; (iii) the entire Thrace exploration prc4ram would be
reassessed on an annual basis so that significant new data that might alter
the program would be reviewed as it becomes available; (iv) all locations
would be evaluated with detailed infill seismic lines and fully mapped before
drilling is approved; and (v) substantive additional basin geophysical studies
would be undertaken before drilling is considered in new gas plays.
85.      Exploration projects have too great a variance in possible outcomes
with too wide a range of probabilities associated with each, to lend
themselves conveniently to economic rate of return calculations. Instead the
critical factor in benefit-cost analysis is the minimum size of discovery that
is needed to obtain an acceptable economic rate of return to a combined
exploration and development program (i.e. the minimum discovery that would pay
for the program). The minimum size will, of course, depend to some extent on
the timing of the discovery, the cost of developing it, and the distance from
the discovery to the trunk line of the gas distribution network. However, if
the cost of developing the field is similar to that of Hamitabat, and most of
the infrastructure is already in place due to the development of the proven
Hamitabat gas field, then a new field with as little as 0.11 TCF of
recoverable gas reserves would be adequate to provide a 15 percent rate of
return to the entire project. This should be compared to an expected outcome
of the exploration program (the outcome with a 50 percent probability) of an
addition to reserves of approximately 1.1 TCF, about ten times the minimum
quantity required to give the project an acceptable internal rate of return.
86.      However, in the final analysis the project is justified not so much
because the risks are small, but because potential benefits to the Turkish
economy are large. The volumes of gas that this project could potentially
make available would have a dramatic impact on the balance of payments and on

the energy use patterns of the potential consuming industries in the highly
industrialized Istanbul environs.  It is for this reason that the project
constitutes a priority component in Turkey's energy program.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUME]NTS AND AUTHORITY
87.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Turkiye PetrolleriL Anonim
Ortakligi and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Turkey and the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan and
Guarantee Agreements conform to the normal pattern of loans for petroleum
exploration projects and their more important features have been included in
Part IV of this report. Special features of the Loan Agreement are referred
to in the text and listed in Section III of Annex III. There would be no
special conditions of effectiveness.
88.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
89.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.       STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF MARCH 31, 1983 1/
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360 - Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project: US$44
million loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973. Effective Date:
March 20, 1974. Closing Date: December 31,1983.
The project is expected to be substantially completed by the current
Closing Date of December 31, 1983. As of March 31, 1983, about $35.5 million
has been disbursed of this $44 million loan.
Ln. No. 1023 - Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project: US$148 million loan
of June 28, 1974. Effective Date: June 1, 1976. Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
Progress has been made on the power component in line with the
measures recommended in February 1982. The civil works contracts have been
renegotiated and additional contractors brought in. TEK has delegated site
management to STEAG, a German project rnanagement firm. The main contractor,
Foster Wheeler (FW), has revised the work plan taking into account the use of
erection personnel being made available by the main equipment suppliers. The
revised work plan concentrates maximum effort in completing Unit No. 1 by end
1984. Units No. 2, No.3 and No. 4 would follow at one year intervals. With
the arrangements made through the US EXIM Bank, and the proposed reallocation
of an additional US$6.8 million from the IBRD loan, financing for the FW
contract through end 1983 is assured. Social infrastructure and salary
problems persist. The contract for operation and training for the mining
component expires in July 1983. Decision on renewal has not been taken. The
contract for mine consulting is continuing. TKI has not negotiated frame
contracts for mine equipment maintenance. Maintenance of mine equipment is
inadequate. TKI's ability to mine lignite in sufficient quantities to
adequately supply the power station (17.6 million tons per year) will be
assessed in connection with the appraisal of a supplemental loan tentatively
scheduled for September 1983.
Ln. No. 1130 - Corum-Cankiri Rural Development: US$75 million loan of
June 23, 1975. Effective Date: January 22, 1976. Closing Date:
June 30, 1984.
Satisfactory progress is being maintained except for delayed payment
to contractors by DSI. The Bank has agreed to the Government's request for
reallocation of proceeds so as to provide additional funds for short-term
credit, which is expected to be sufficient to cover needs until a proposed
second agricultural credit project, now scheduled for Board consideration in
June 1983, becomes effective.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Page 4 of 9
Ln. No. 1248 - Agricultural Credit and Agro-industries: US$54.3 million loan
of May 5, 1976. Effective Date: May 11, 1977. Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
The supervised credit and ferryship components are fully disbursed
and the study of TCZB organization and operations has been completed. Due to
reluctance of sub-borrowers to assume foreign exchange risk and availability
of other sources of credit without this risk, only 11 percent of the
agro-industries component has been disbursed. The Government is considering
proposals for dealing with this issue.
Ln. No. 1258 - Balikesir Newsprint: US$7O million loan of May 21, 1976.
Effective Date: October 15, 1976. Closing Date; December 31, 1982.
Although the Closing Date has not been extended, accounts are being
kept open pending settlement of final payments. As of March 31, 1983, $68.4
million, or 98 percent of the total loan amount, has been disbursed. A
project completion report is under preparation.
Ln. No. 1265 - Livestock III: US021.5 million loan of May 26, 1976.
Effective Date: February 25, 1977. Closing Date: March 31, 1984.
The Closing Date has been extended to March 31, 1984 to allow for
utilization of the remaining $6.8 million of undisbursed loan funds. Project
implementation has been satisfactory. However, the increased availability of
locally bred offspring of imported cattle at considerably cheaper prices than
for comparable directly imported cattle, has caused a serious reduction in the
demand for sub-loans. The Bank is currently considering a request from the
Government for restructuring all three ongoing livestock projects to include
financing for the foreign exchange component of loans for sheep and beef
fattening in addition to dzirying; locally bred improved cattle and sheep, as
well as imported ones; and farm machinery and equipment, livestock housing,
pasture and forage production, feeds and other inputs in addition to livestock.
Ln. No. 1310 - South Antalya Tourism Infrastructure: US$26 million loan of
July 9, 1976. Effective Date: March 1, 1978. Closing Date: December 31,
1983.
Project implementation is about two years behind schedule due to
initial difficulties relating to land acquisition and project organization.
At present most project works are either completed or under advanced
implementation. The Closing Date has been extended for the first time by one
year to December 31, 1983. As of March 31, 1983, $10.8 million, or 42 percent
of the total loan amount, has been disbursed.
Ln. No. 1379 - DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey): US$70 million loan of
March 23, 1977. Effective Date: July 21, 1977. Closing Date:
Decembfr, 31, 1982.
The Closing Date for this loan has not been extended, but the
accounts are being kept open for settlement of final payments. As of
March 31, 1983, the undisbursed balance of this loan is t7.0 million.

Page 5 of 9
Ln. No. 1585 - Northern Forestry: US$86.0 million loan of June 5, 1978.
Effective Date: October 30, 1978. Closing Date: March 31, 1986.
Overall physical achievements are about 60 percent of targets. Local
funding, which is almost totally depenclent on timber sales, has been
inadequate due to a depression in the construction industry. Although
equipment procurement is still behind schedule, proposals for foreign
equipment procurement have been agreed, providing for initiation of remaining
procurement in 1983/84 with completion of disbursement expected by early
1986. A management consultant to assist the project implementation is
expected in Ankara shortly.
Ln. No. 1586 - Livestock IV: US$24.0 million loan of June 5, 1978. Effective
Date: October 31, 1978. Closing Date; June 30, 1985.
Implementation of the supervised credit program is extremely slow due
in part to the increased availability of locally bred offspring of imported
cattle at considerably cheaper prices than for directly imported cattle. A
Government request for restructuring of all three ongoing livestock projects
(see Loan No. 1265) is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1606 - Erdemir Stage II Steel: US$95.0 million loan of June 30,
1978. Effective Date: July 30, 1979. Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish Lira have caused serious
financial problems for the company. Proposals to tackle the situation are
being considered by the company and the Government in consultation with the
Bank. Implementation of the main components of the original project is one
year behind schedule with additional delays now expected on some non-critical
support facilities and several additional items recommended by consultants to
improve productivity, quality, and efficiency. A financial plan prepared by
the company is being reviewed.   Extension of the Closing Date to permit
utilization of the remaining loan funds is dependent upon development of a
satisfactory financial plan.
Ln. No. 1741 - Ports Rehabilitation: US$75 million of July 2, 1979.
Effective Date:  January 22, 1980.  Closing Date;  June 30, 1983.
Cumulative loan disbursements of $38.0 million up to Mqarch 31, 1983
were only about 51 percent of the total Loan amount due to initial delays in
tendering, awarding contracts, appointing consultants for port planning study,
and finalizing specifications of a 250-ton floating crane. Physical
implementation is now progressing satisfactorily. Extension of the Closing
Date is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1742 - Grain Storage: US$85 million of July 2, 1979. Effective
Date: January 21, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Prequalification procedures for silo construction contractors are in
progress. The Government is currently examining the merits of possible
adjustments in the project contents to take account of changes in relative
prices and cost increases due to previous delays.

ANNEX II
Page 6 of 9
Ln. No. 1748 - TSKB XIII (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$60
million of July 12, 1979. Effective Date: October 25, 1979. Closing Date;
September 30, 1983.
Delays in committing this loan have resulted due to sub-borrowers'
reluctance to bear foreign exchange risk and cancellation of loan contracts
because of financial distress caused by high interest rates and shortage of
local currency. These financial problems which are endemic in the Turkish
private sector have prevented TSKB's serious arrears position from improving.
The current Closing Date of September 30, 1983 is not likely to be extended.
As of March 31, 1983, about $43.4 million has been disbursed.
Lns. Nos. 1754 and 1755 - TSKB (US$65 million) and SYKB (US$15 million)
Private Sector Textiles loans of September 17, 1979. Effective Date:
February 29, 1980. Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
A lower than anticipated level of commitments (about $38 million or
55 percent of forecasts) still prevails due to depressed conditions in the
textile industry and the sub-borrowers' reluctance to assume foreign exchange
risk. Local consultancy service has been reorganized on schedule, as a
private sector joint venture without further need of the Bank's financial
support.
Ln. No. S-15 - Ankara Air Pollution Engineering: US$6 million loan of
December 12, 1979. Effective Date: April 4, 1980. Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
Out of the five components of this project, only two (Seyitomer Plant
and Air Pollution Monitoring Equipment) have so far been partly implemented,
representing US$0.9 million or 15 percent of the total loan amount. The test
results from the MTA pilot plant showed that investment in a larger scale
pilot plant would not be warranted. The Alternative Technology Study will not
be executed since no feasible processes exist for coke or hot briquetting
manufacture based on Turkish lignite. The Gas Production Study will be
implemented, but the cost for the study might be significantly higher than the
appraisal estimate. Revision of the cost estimates and extension of the
present Closing Date are under consideration.
Ln. No. 1844 - Karakaya Hydropower; US$120 million loan of May 21, 1980.
Effective Date: August 15, 1980. Closing Date: December 31, 1988.
Implementation after initial delays is now satisfactory. The cash
generation covenant was not met for 1982, and is not likely to be met for
1983. This matter is now being pursued with the Government.

Ln. No. 1847 - Sumerbank Textiles Modernization and Rationalization:
US$83 million loan of May 28, 1980. Effective Date: February 27, 1981.
Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
After initial delays of about one year due to delayed loan
effectiveness and staffing problems of the project implementation unit,
project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily and the costs are
within appraisal estimates. The reorganization plan for the Cotton Textile
Division was approved by the Sumerbank Board in March 1982.  Recruitment of
competent personnel for the Cotton Textile Division and the project
implementation unit has been hampered by salary limitations orn State Economic
Enterprises. The situation is expected to improve after the passage of the
SEE reform decree.
Ln. No. 1862 - Livestock V: US$51 million loan of June 6, 1980. Effective
Date: October 22, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Progress on the credit component for livestock development, with the
exception of boilers, is extremely slow. The Government has decided not to
implement the meat processing component due to changes in its investment
priorities, and a request has been received to reallocate the funds.
Implementation of the animal health and breeding components is reasonably
satisfactory. A Government proposal for increasing the types of livestock
credit eligible for financing (see Loan No. 1265) is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1916 - Petroleum Exploration Project: US$25 million loan of
November 24, 1980. Effective Date: June 30, 1981. Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
Project implementation is slow due to delay in contracting consulting
services and initiating technical studies. Acceptable drilling locations have
not yet been identified in southeast Turkey. The Bank has recently approved
the Government's request to extend the scope of the loan to include the Thrace
basin, which has been found to have a highly attractive potential for
hydrocarbon exploration, and to reallocate a portion of the proceeds of the
loan to finance computer equipment for higher quality seismic data processing
needed for the Thrace program. Progress in separation of TPAO's
import-related operations is also behind schedule because of its relation to
the broader issues under consideration in the SEE reform legislation. Energy
audits for five major industries are currently in progress.
Ln. No. 1917 - Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery Field Demonstration Project:
US$62 million loan of November 24, 1980. Effective Date: June 30, 1981.
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project is about one year behind schedule due to initial delays
in equipment procurement and delivery. Bids for the enhanced recovery studies
for other fields are under review, and the studies are expected to start
shortly. The fracturing of the Hamitabat gas field has been completed
successfully and has demonstrated the feasibility of full commercial
development of the field. Progress in separation of TPAO's import-related
operations has also been delayed because of its relation to the broader issues
under consideration for the SEE reform legislation.

Ln. No. 1952 - Labor Intensive Industry Project: US$40 million loan of
March 13, 1981. Effective Date: June 12, 1981. Closing Date:
June 30, 1986.
A poor investment climate still continues to hamper loan
utilization. As of January 31, 1983, subloans totalling $16.8 million had
been approved by SYKB.
Ln. No. 1967 - Second Fruit and Vegetable Project: US$40 million loan of
April 6, 1981. Effective Date: August 1981. Closing Date: June 30, 1986.
Project implementation is proceeding more slowly than projected, but
should improve as a result of experience gained to date: all consultants have
been engaged and are in place. Three of the four Regional Marketing
Corporations will become operational as soon as TCZB's contribution is
received in early May 1983.
Ln. No. 1985 - Fertilizer Rationalization and Energy Saving Project:
US;110 million loan of May 15, 1981.  Effective Date:  August 28, 1981.
Closing Date: December 31, 1986.
The project components of AZOT and IGSAS are progressing
satisfactorily. GUBRE, one of the three beneficiaries, has not yet signed a
contract with an engineering company for project implementation because of
changes proposed in the scope of the project by GUBRE management to further
improve its economic viability.
Ln. No. 1998 - State Industrial Enterprise Finance Project: US$70 million loan
of June 3, 1981. Effective Date: August 27, 1981. Closing Date:
December 31, 1986.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. The Bank is
considering the Government's request for an extension of the deadline for
completion of a study of DYB's future role.
Ln. No. 2093 - Export-Oriented Industries Project: US$100 million loan of
March 5, 1982. Effective Date: May 28, 1982. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Although the special task force for dealing with problem projects is
now functioning relatively effectively, prolonged low capacity utilization
rates in industry and high interest rates make a substantial improvement in
arrears unlikely in the near future. Demand for direct foreign exchange fixed
asset financing has been declining due to reduced private sector investment
demand as a result of current economic conditions and the unwillingness of
sub-borrowers to bear foreign exchange risk. The technical assistance program
for potential exporters has been proceeding on schedule.

Ln. No. 2094 - Erzurum Rural Development Project: US$40 million loan of
March 5, 1982. Effective Date: Novenmber 24, 1982. Closing Date:
June 30, 1987.
Since the loan became effective in November 1982, implementation has
been on schedule for the irrigation, soil conservation, new roads, plant
protection, and veterinary services components.  However, progress is slow
with extension services and recruitment of consultants, and it has proved
difficult to recruit and retain a project manager in Erzurum.
Ln. No. 2131 - Second Fertilizer Rationalization Project: US$44.1 million
loan of May 13, 1982. Effective Date: April 13, 1983. Closing Date:
June 30, 1987.
This loan became effective in April 1983. The Government has
requested cancellation of Part A of the project which relates to GUBRE, one of
the four beneficiary fertilizer manufacturing companies of the project, which
is no longer interested in proceeding with its portion of the project.  The
total loan amount will accordingly be reduced from $44.1 million to $38
million to reflect this cancellation. The other project components are making
satisfactory progress.
Ln. No. 2137 - Highway Rehabilitation Project: US$71.1 million loan of
May 13, 1982. Effective Date: August 13, 1982. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Progress continues to be good. All civil works and procurement
contracts have been bid and feasibility studies have been completed for all
the remaining road sections included in the loan.
Ln. No. 2158 - Structural Adjustment Loan III: US$304.5 million loan of
May 28, 1982. Effective Date: July 16, 1982. Closing Date:
December 15, 1983.
This loan became effective in July 1982. The first tranche of the
loan has been fully disbursed. Release of the second tranche has been
authorized (May 1983).
Ln. No. 2159 - Istanbul Sewerage Project; US$88.1 million loan of
May 28, 1982. Effective Date: January 24, 1983. Closing Date:
December 31, 1988.
This loan became effective in January 1983.
