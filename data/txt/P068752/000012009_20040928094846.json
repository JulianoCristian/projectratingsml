The following are some of the anticipated negative\n            environmental impacts, and measures to mitigate them: wastes\n            resulting from bridge/culvert construction should not be\n            discharged in river channels, to avoid adverse impacts on\n            flood discharges capacity, or original river flows;\n            destruction of river dykes should be avoided to protect\n            flood discharges capacity, particularly in narrower river\n            channels; authorities should be notified should new\n            archaeological sites be discovered; construction working\n            hours should be scheduled to daylight working hours, to\n            minimize noise disturbances; construction sites should be\n            sprayed, to be maintained clean to prevent air pollution;\n            likewise, re-vegetation practices should prevent dusting,\n            while topsoil should be restored; tree planting on road\n            sides should follow construction; transport vehicles should\n            be covered; traffic control shall enforce speed and traffic\n            flows; asphalt smoke discharges could be mitigated by\n            locating asphalt and lime-mixing plants downwind; the\n            cofferdam method should be adopted to effectively prevent\n            turbid water quality, and prevent pollution from\n            construction waste discharges into rivers. Collection and\n            treatment of oil machines should be practiced, thus\n            preventing discharges into water bodies. Domestic sewage\n            produced from the construction camping sites should be\n            centrally treaded, while compost-treated waste may be used\n            as a fertilizer for grasslands, however, non-hazardous solid\n            waste should be stored in pits. Other measures include\n            traffic safety, preventing vehicle overload, hazardous waste\n            disposal management."}, "docdt": "2004-07-19T00:00:00Z"}
