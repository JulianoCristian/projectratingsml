                                                                                    E998
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
                                                                                      v.2

1.1 Significance of the Project Construction and Origin of this EIA


The proposed project is one part of the plan of "Five North-South Lines and Seven

West-East Lines" of China's state highways, as well as the important component of

the first west-east line of Inner Mongolia's plan for "Three West-East Lines, Nine

North-South Lines and Twelve Exits". It is also the main highway section going from

the west to the east planned recently by the autonomous region, as the main

framework of the highways in Inner Mongolia and the main passage connecting

Hulunbeier League and other provinces and regions in the east of China.


After the construction in the Eighth Five-Year Plan Period and the Ninth Five-Year

Plan Period and with the preparatory work of the project, most sections to the east of

Hailar of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway has been constructed or under construction,

and other sections have moved into the stage of preliminary feasibility study.

Currently, only the project of Hailar-Manzhouli section has not been set up for

construction. The proposed project will be linked with Yakeshi-Hailar Highway (to be

approved for construction) in the east, connected with Manzhouli Port in the west, and

bond with Provincial Highways 201 and 202, etc., thus forming a highway network

with State Highway 301 as the main axis and other state, provincial, county and

township roads as branches, which can play important roles in economic construction

along the highway lines.


According to China's environmental protection laws and regulations, EIAs should be

performed for construction projects. Inner Mongolia Communication Department

entrusted Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences (CRAES) to

formulated EIA for the proposed Hailar-Manzhouli Section of state highway

Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway. After accepting the EIA task, CRAES seriously

listened to the introduction to the proposed project by experts and the construction

unit, studied the engineering and related data, performed on-site exploration, image

pick-up and survey on the environmental sensitive areas along the proposed project

line, and complied the TOR of EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-

Manzhouli Highway. The Appraisal Centre for Environmental Engineering (ACEE) of

the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) approved the TOR on

October 14, 2002 (ACEE File [2002]243). According to the TOR and the approval

letter on the TOR of the ACEE, CRAES further formulated this EIA report to submit

to the responsible department for review.

1.6 EIA methods


According to the specialities of the proposed project, this EIA adopts the principle of

representing the line with typical sections, combined with representing the section by

typical point, to feedback the entire highway line. The methods of monitoring,

investigation, calculation and analysis will be used for current status assessment and

the model computation and analogue analysis methods applied for projection

assessment. The noise and air environment assessment will be based on quantitative

analysis using simulation models. The Estimation Method will be used for water and

soil erosion in the eco-environment. Qualitative and semi-quantitative statistical

methods will be applied for impact assessment of social environment, surface water

CHAPTER 2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION


2.1 Routing Scheme and Main Control Points


In the recommended scheme for the project of Hailar­Manzhouli Section of

Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway, the overall routing orientation is from east to west.

The starting point is located at Aobao Mountain of Hailar District, linking with the

Yakeshi-Hailar Section (K397+000) of State Highway of Suifenhe-Manzhouli. The

line goes along old State Highway 301 through Haotetaohai Branch Farm, deviates

from the old line at a distance of about 4km to Bayankuren Town, and passes by the

north side of Bayankuren Town. The Chenbaerhu Qi Interchange is set up on the

north side of Bayankuren Town to connect with Bayankuren Town. The line goes

back to State Highway 301 at 3km to the west of Bayankuren Town, crossing

Morigele River and going along the west side of Huhenuoer Lake along the old line.

A level cross is set up at 11km to the north of East Wuzhuer. The highway goes

through West Wuzhuer Sumu and deviates the old line at Cuogangyakou. It then goes

straight to the west for 15km and reaches the wetlands where the Hailar Bridge and

Xinkai Bridge are set up. The line goes further to the west and through the joint of the

Xinkai River and the lake. The Zalainuoer Interchange is set up to the north side of

the mineral area and the connection line established to link with Zalainuoer Mineral

Area. The highway goes back to the old line at the fence of the Zalainuoer Mineral

Area Hospital, goes through Sanshili Highway Maintenance Squad and Shibali

Herding Team, deviates from the old line at 4km to the east of Manzhouli City, passes

by the north side of the Oxidization Pond, links with Manzhouli Port Road by level

cross, and ended at the new Manzhouli Highway Port. This section routing orientation

is illustrated in Figures 2-3.


The main control points of this section: Aobao Mountain (to the north of Hailar),

Bayankuren, West Wuzhuer, Cuogangyakou, Zalainuoer Mineral Area, Manzhouli,

Manzhouli Road Port (finishing point).


The total length of the line in the recommended scheme is 189.718km, belonging to

plain and slight hilly area. The line goes through Chenbaerhu Town (Bayankuren),

Xinbaerhu Zuo Qi, and Manzhouli City. The connection line with East Wuzhuer is

20km. One 2km-long connection line is set up respectively to link with Chen Qi

Interchange and Zalainuoer Interchange.

2.4.2 Roadbed engineering


     The standard cross section drawing of roadbed is illustrated in Figure 2-4.

(1) Roadbed cross section

For two section, i.e. one from the point 1km to the west of starting point to east side

of Bayankuren Town (K398+000 -- K412+000) and one from west side of Huhenuoer

Lake to West Wuzhuer (K440+000 -- K496+000), with a total of 70km, the old road

is used to construct separate cross-section (the old road is widened as one way with a

new one constructed), with the roadbed width of 12.75m, including 7.5-m driveway,

2.75-m left hardened verge, 1.0-m right hardened verge, and 2x0.75-m earth verges.

The way using old road will be fulfilled completely by widening the two sides on the

base of the old road.


For other sections with a length of 118.423Km, the roadbed width is 24.0m, including

2x7.5-m driveways, 2x2.75-m hardened verges, 2x0.75-m earth verge and 2.0-

m.middle belt.



(2) Roadbed side slope

For sections with general geology, roadbed fill height is less than 8m, the side slope is

with single slope rate, with the rate of 1:1.5. When the roadbed fill height is from 8m

to 20m, the side slope is with fold-line slope rate, with the rate of 1:1.5 when the fill

is higher than 8m and 1:1.75 when the fill is lower than 8m.


Excavating side slope rate is determined based on the soil geologic conditions,

generally being 1:0.5 - 1:1.0. When the fill height is greater than 20m, one platform is

set up for each 10m, with the platform width of 2.0m, 2-m platform at the foot of the

slope, and a water catch at 5m to the slope top.


Specific design is performed for special roadbed sections (i.e. soft bed sections, and

sections with accumulative snow and sand).

                   EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway




(3) Roadbed height

In general, the roadbed height is mainly constrained by pass and bridge net height,

roadbed design flood frequency (1/100) and minimum fill height. The average fill

height is about 1.9m and the maximum excavation depth is about 30m.


(4) Roadbed drainage and its protection

The roadbed drainage facilities include side ditches, drainage ditches, watercatch

ditches, jet flow duct and seeping ditch, etc. When the vertical slope is greater than

4%, all the surface drainage facilities are consolidated with bonded chip stones.


The slope surface is protected with vegetation and engineering work. When the

roadbed fill height is less than 4.0, vegetation protection is applied. When the roadbed

fill height is greater than 4.0, concrete framework and vegetation protection are

applied. Bonded chip stones protect the sections with wetland below under the design

water level. The trench side slope is protected by bonded chip stonewalls or other

forms of measures. The protection of roadbed is illustrated in Figure 2-5.


(5) Treatment of roadbed at unfavorable geological sections

There are mainly soft base (lake and marsh) sections at unfavorable geological

conditions in this project. The bag sand drain and iso-overload prepressing treatment

methods are applied.


For wind-blowing-snow sections, open roadbed and snow storage yard are applied.



2.4.3 Pavement engineering


(1) Natural zoning and earth matrix type

The proposed project is located at Zone VII by highway natural zoning, belonging to

grassland mid-drought area in Inner Mongolia. The fill is mostly high at plain

sections. The excavation is deep at some parts, mostly with sand or bedrock. The

earth matrix is treated as drought type.


(2) Pavement type selection

The climate characteristics in this project area are: small precipitation, big

temperature difference, long winter season and low frost line. Frost heaving is the


                                                  17

                   EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



main factor leading to destruction of the pavement. As bitumen concrete pavement is

soft, having stronger adapting capacity to possible roadbed distortion compared with

cement concrete pavement and being easier to repair incase of destruction than the

latter, it is adopted in this project.


(3) Pavement structure design

The pavement is designed with three layers for the entire line, i.e. 4-cm middle-sized

grain bitumen concrete antiskid surface layer, 4-cm coarse grain bitumen concrete

antiskid middle layer, and 5-cm coarse grain bitumen concrete antiskid lower layer.

The toll stations adopt cement concrete pavement.


The stone resource is rich, and the base along the entire line uses cement to stabilize

chip stones. The demand for anti-freezing is considered in the design. At the separate

cross-section, the original pavement of the driveway of the old line is utilized as base

layer. The surface layer is added on the base layer after width adjustment.


The hardened verge has the same structure as the surface layer. The earth verge in the

entire line uses precast concrete slab as pavement.


(4) Pavement drainage

In order to prevent accumulation of snow and water, the middle belt is set up with

level-type central separation strip which is paved by concrete. The cross slope is the

same as the crown cross slope on both sides, with the rate of 1.5%. The verge cross

slope rate is 3%. The water on the pavement surface is drained through the verges.



2.4.4 Bridges and culverts engineering


The rivers within the region belong to the Hailar River system. The annual

precipitation is small, distributed unevenly over the year, and the annual evaporation

is big. The rivers that the highway line crosses include the Hailar River, the Moergele

River, and the Xinkai River, all of which have no requirement for aviation. All the

bridges are general ones.


There will be 4 big-sized bridges (1326m long), 7 middle-sized bridges (525.5m

long), 18 small-sized bridges (352m long) and 110 culverts.



                                                  18

                 EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



According to the hydraulic, geological and river (ditch) bed characteristics of the

rivers and ditches, and combined with the landform situations, the superstructure of

the big- and middle- sized bridges adopts 20-m, 16-m and 13-m prestress concrete

simple-support cored slabs. The substructure adopts gravity-type piers and ribbed slab

abutment and the base adopts that of drilling pouring posts. The substructure of small-

and middle- sized bridges adopts pillar-type piers and stands (or U-type abutment)

and the base adopts drilling pouring posts.


The patterns of small-sized bridges and culverts are determined based on the

condition requirements of their positions. The small-sized bridges mainly adopt steel

concrete rectangle slabs and cored slabs, and culverts use the patterns of round pipe,

cover plate and box in steel concrete.

2.4.7 Road laying materials and transportation conditions along the line


The distribution of materials along the line for construction of the highway is shown

in table 2-11 and Figure 2-7. There are no sensitive sites such as residences, schools

and hospitals.

(1) Sand and grit

The distribution of sand and grit materials is uneven, including mainly sand and grit

yards at Hailar District and Manzhouli City. The sand and grit yards at Hailar District

have pure clean sand and grit with less mud, good quality and rich reservation, able to

meeting with the engineering requirement. The sand and grit yards at Manzhouli City

have more mud and can be used for base layer of the pavement. The yards can be

easily accessed by roads and vehicles. The transportation condition is well.



(2) Lime

The lime used in this project mainly comes from Xiertala Building Material Factory

and Weigang Trade Company, Ltd. The lime can reach the quality of Grade III. The

transportation condition is well.



(3) Stone

The stone resources are basically distributed on both sides of the line, including

Hailar Beishan Stone Factory, Chen Qi Daqiao Yard, West Wuzhuer Material Yard,

Zhucheng Cement Manufactory Company, Fada Industrial Company, Ltd., and

Shibali Material Yard. The rock character of the stones is mainly magmatite such as

andesite and grayish-green rock., being hard and compact, with complete

specifications, rich reserve and good transportation conditions.

(4) Fillings for roadbed

The earth resource for the roadbed is rich along the project line. The plain and slight

hilly areas are mainly with sandy soil, and the hilly areas from Zalainuoer to

Manzhouli are mainly with chip stone soil. Both can be allocated vertically by the

highway line. The centralized earth borrowing yards will be set up for subsidy of the

earth shortage.


There will be 9 earth borrowing yards and 2 waste earth yards. See Table 2-12 and

Figure 2-8 for details.

      work of borrowing and waste discard are natural ones.



(5) Water supply and power supply

The river and lake resource is rich along the line, with good water quality and

generally without any corrosively. Most of the towns, qi and villages along the line

have tap water supply, and the engineering can be supplied by natural water and tap

water from the towns and qi. The power network has been set up along the line at

present and the supply situation is good.



(6) Steel, wood, cement, bitumen

The steel, wood, cement, bitumen and other materials for this project can be supplied

by Hailar District. The AH-90 road asphalt is used which cannot be substituted by

general bitumen for construction use.



Mixing yards and prefabrication yards are set up along the highway line, especially

located at K426+000, K490+000 and K560+000, all far away from residences and

other sensitive sites.

                        2.6 Analysis of Main Environmental Impact Factors


                        The environmental impacts on along the highway line during the Construction and

                        Operation Periods are multiaspect, mainly including impact of vehicle gas exhaust on

                        air environment; noise impact of mechanical operations and running of vehicles on

                        the two sides of the line; destruction of ecological environment by land occupation,

                        use of earth and stone, water and soil erosion from vegetation removing, etc. Other

                        problems involve socioeconomic, surface water and transport and communication

                        modes issues, etc. The environmental impact matrix is used to analyze the impact

                        types and impact degrees of the environmental impact factors. The results can be seen

                        in Table 2-14.

the ratio being 5.5: 25.8: 68.7



(2) Farming and herding

The Hulunbeier League is the important farming product production base in Inner

Mongolia. The arable land has increased from 150900 ha in 1949 to 1086000 ha in

2000, with the corresponding gross grain yield increasing from 165400 tons to

1754000 tons. In 1989, the League realized self supply of grains under the situation

that the ratio of farming population to non-farming population was 1:1.47.


The livestock production in the League has developed into benefit-oriented pattern. In

2000, the League further developed milk, flesh and grass, by encouraging the farmers

and herdsmen to develop milk industry, and actively introducing and planting good

feed grass. It also realized mechanization of grass harvesting, which ranks the first in

China. Although under the serious natural disaster in the winter of 2000, the total

livestock was 5763000 in the year, increasing by 87000 (1.5%) on the base of the last

year.

3.1.2 Cities and towns and the population distribution along the line

The cities and towns along the proposed project line include: Hailar District,

Chenbaerhu Qi, Xinbaerhu Qi, Xinbaerhu Zuo Qi and Manzhouli City.


Hulunbeier League is located at the northeast of Inner Mongolia, spanning 630km
from east to west, with an area of 253000 km2, or 21.4% of the total area of Inner

Mongolia. The League neighbors Xingan League to the south, links with Heilongjiang

Province to the east, connects with Russia to the north and northwest, and adjoins

Mongolia to the west and southwest.


Hailar District is the capital city of Hulunbeier, locating at the central west part of the

league and in the hinterland of Hulunbeier Grass. It links with Yakeshi City to the

east, and connects with Ewenke Qi to the south and neighbors Chen Qi to the

northwest. At the end of 2002, the total population was 249600, including 23400 of

3.1.6 Traffic environment

(1) Current status of regional comprehensive transportation

The infrastructures construction has had great advancement in Hulunbeier City, but

still lagging behind relatively. There are 4 trunk railway lines, 3 branch railway lines

and 2 liaison railway lines within Hulunbeier League. Two State Highways and 4

Province Highways form the main framework of highways. It also has Hailar Airport,

a national Class 4C airport. Despite the rich mineral resource in Hulunbeier City, the

                                                 37

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


current transportation condition is still the key factor constraining the regional

development of the City.


(2) Overview of current highways and existing problems

The existing highway, starting from Hailar District in the east to Manzhouli City in

the west, is part of State Highway 301. The highway is 203km long, was re-built in

1994 according to Grade 3 highway. After seven years of operation and especially

impacted by the disruption of extra large flood in 1998, the entire service level of the

highway is low and currently being the co-existence of Grade 2 and Grade 3.


The technical criteria of existing highway, such as roadbed height and width,

pavement width, intensity and smoothness, and line vertical slope, are low and the

passing capacity is poor.

1 The roadbed height is relatively low, and the snow and flood proof capacity is

    poor;

2 The bitumen pavement is weathered, and part of pavement has cracking

    phenomenon;

3 The drainage and protection engineering is simple and insufficient, and the anti-

    disaster capacity is limited;

4 Part of sections with unfavorable geological conditions have the problem of frost

    heaving, soft base, saline soil and other highway diseases, to be completely

    innovated;

5 Some sections already being innovated, although having widen the roadbed and

    improved line pattern and pavement status, still have low drainage and protection

    criteria, unable to meet with flood discharge requirement, with low design

    standard in bridge and culvert loading e.g. having low width;

6 Some sections at mountain areas have poor level vertical line pattern, with zigzag

    turns and continuous urgent curves, and have frequent accidents;

7 Many existing line sections have become the streets, e.g. Hailar downtown

    section, Bayankuren Town section, Zalainuoer Mineral Area section and

    Manzhouli downtown section, with many level intersections, leading to disorder

    traffic, which has to be innovated.

3.1.7 Resource utilization

(1) Land resource

The overall characteristic of land resource in Hulunbeier League is its large quantity,

with the land area accounting for 11.9% that of Inner Mongolia. The per capita land

area is 8.82ha with per capita arable land 0.49ha, per capita forest land 4.50ha, per

capita herding grass land 3.08ha, being 11.5times, 4.9times, 27.3times and 16.3times

of national average values.

(2) Mineral resources

The mineral resources are rich in the proposed project area. Nine kinds with 43

species and 370 mineral sites of minerals have been explored or initially explored.

Among the total mineral sites, 116 mines have been explored with total mineral

reserve of 34.8billion tons (97% being coal), accounting for 14.8% and 2.9% of Inner

Mongolia and national explored reserve respectively. The total potential value is
17853.361 billion yuan, or 1.3% of national value, ranking the 3rd in Inner Mongolia.
The explored mineral reserve per territory area in the League is 7048400 yuan/km2,

being 0.7 of the national average and 0.64 of the autonomous region's average. The

main minerals include coal, Au, Ag, Al, Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, cement limestone, sodium

sulfate, natural base, dolomite, fluorite, quartzite, and spring water, etc.


(3) Tourism resource

Hulunbeier League has many kinds of tourism resources with grasslands, forest

landscape, ethnic feeling, and historic relics. The China-Russia and China-Mongolia



                                                 39

                   EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


bordering line is long with numeric ports, having regional advantages of tourism

along the open border. The natural tourism landscape is rich, having landscapes of

grassland, forest, river, lake, mineral spring, rare plant and animal, mountain ridge

and snow, etc. The forest area of Daxinganling Mountains is the largest natural forest

with good protection and complete natural landscape in China. It is also a natural
museum of wild animals. Hulun Lake, with an area of 2339km2, is one of China's 5

large freshwater lakes and called "the Pearl on the Grassland". The wandering rivers

of the Hailar River, the Yimin River and Morigele River have formed a special

beautiful scenic on the grasslands. The bordering river, the Erguna River, also have

beautiful landscapes as well as different feelings on both sides. The ports, borders and

State Gates have formed the main tourism landscape. The exotic atmosphere of

neighboring country, Russia, also attracts foreign and domestic tourists.


Hulunbeier League has developed a batch of important tourism scenic spots including

Hulunbeier Grassland, forests, lakes, ports, minority nationalities, etc., forming the

tourism development framework with the main contents of domestic tourism,

international tourism, bordering tourism, and outbound travel, etc.

3.1.8 Cultural relics resource

An overall survey was once carried out in 1988-1996 for the cultural relics within

Hulunberer City. The survey was accomplished by Inner Mongolia Cultural Relics

Archaeological Institute, Hulunbeier League Cultural Relics Management Station

(former Hulunbeier Cultural Relics Management Committee) and local cultural relic

institutes at qi and counties. The reference historic documents during the survey

include History of the Liao Dynasty, History of the Jin Dynasty, and Hulunbeier

Chronicles, etc.

According to the survey report on cultural relics along the proposed alignment areas,
which was conducted by the Hulunbeier Cultural Relics Management Committee,
there are no important cultural relics and cemeteries along the road construction area.
If cultural relics are found during the highway construction, the Construction Unit
will take joint protective measures with the Hulunbeier Cultural Relics Management
Committee. (See Annex 3)


3.2 Overview of Natural Environment


3.2.1 Geographical location

The proposed project is located in Hulunbeier City of Inner Mongolia Autonomous

Region, starting from Hailar District, through Chenbaerhu qi, Xinbaerhu zuo qi and

Manzhouli City, and ending at New Manzhouli Highway Port.

                   EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


3.2.2 Topology and landform

The project area lies to the west of Daxing'anling Mountains, belonging to Hulunbeier

Plateau landform area. The landform types are complex, including erosive and

denuded low hilly area and denuded high plain (alluvial plain, lacustrine plain and

sandy land, etc.).


(l) Erosive and denuded low hilly area: To the east and southeast of the project area is

the low hilly area of the west foot of Daxinganling Mountains. The elevation is high,

being 700-1000m, with the highest point at Mushroom Mountain at Ewenke Qi

(1706m). The continuous rolling round mountains are mostly comprised of granite,

basalt and rhyolite, etc. The flat mild slope rate is mostly at l0-200m. The north side

of the project, i.e. to the north of the line Fenggang Second Team ­ West Wuzhuer ­

Touzhan Hotel, is Chenbaerhu Mountain with elevation of 650-1000m. The

mountaintop is slightly flat, the valley is wide with the elevation of 650-700m. It is

mainly comprised of igneous rocks such as granite, andesite, quartz trachyte and tuff,

etc. At the west section of the project area and to the west of Hulun Lake and the

Wulegening River, is plateau low hilly area, generally with elevation of 650-1000m,

the mountain body has mainly igneous rocks. The peak of the mountains is bare with

rocks, the top is round, and there are low-lying lands among the mountains. The

valleys and low-lying lands have serious salification and alkalization, with thin

coarse-soil surface layer.


(2) Denuded high plain: The wide alluvial and lacustrine plains from the starting point

to Hulun Lake and the east of the Wulegening River belong to Hulunbeier high plain

area. To the east and southeast of the area lie Daxinganling Mountains (with elevation

of 700-1000m), and to the north are Chenbaerhu Mountains (with elevation of 600-

1000m). The Hailar Platform that the proposed project passes forms the main body of

Hulunbeier high plain. In the project area that the Hailer River flows through, wide

flooding plain is formed on both sides of the riverbed. The river valley is 4-l0km

wide, with meandering watercourse. The low-elevation flood plain is developed,

generally 1-2m higher than the water surface, and over the low plain are mostly

marshes and some oxbow lakes. The Hailar River develops 2-grade terraces. The

primary terrace is linked with flooding plain and has the elevation 5-10m higher than

the flooding plain. The secondary terrace is outside the primary terrace and has the

elevation 30-50m higher than the flooding plain.


In the low area, there are numeric lakes, marshes and wetlands. The area to the north

of the Hailar River has meandering surface relief. The surface elevation gets

increasing from the west to the east. The area to the south of the Hailar River is broad

and level, forming wind accumulative sandy lands along Wulijietu ­ Huangde ­


                                                  41

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


Wugunuoer ­ Hailar West Mountain. Moving and semi-stationary sandy dunes are

scattered in the area. The relative height of the dunes is 5-20m, and windward side

mostly faces the northwest or southwest.

3.2.3 Geological characteristics

The stratums in this project area include rocks in Upper Proterozoic group,

Ordovician system, Jurassic system, Cretaceous system, Quaternary system and

intrusive rock.


The first grade structural unit of this project area belongs to Paleozoic geosyncline

fold zone of Tianshan Mountain ­ Mongolia ­ Xingan. The second grade structural

unit belongs to Erguna Xingkai geosyncline fold system and Xiguituqi Hualixi

geosyncline fold zone, which can further be divided into two third grade structural

units, i.e. Xiguitu anticlinorium and Hailar Mesozoic and Cenozoic era sag.


The fracture structure in the project area develops, in which the fracture activity in the

middle stage of Hualixi and early Yanshan is most obvious and intense.


The small and medium seismic activity is frequent in the project area. In the history,

there are 59 earthquakes with magnitude of 3 or higher, 261 earthquakes with

magnitude of 2.0-2.9, 596 earthquakes with magnitude of 1.0-l.9. The maximum

magnitude is 5. The spatial distribution of the earthquake activity is generally

controlled by Debuergan major dislocation and regional dislocation, mostly occurring

at or nearby the fracture zone. According to China Earthquake Intensity Zoning Maps

(1990), the project area has the earthquake intensity of VI degree.


The unfavorable and special geological conditions in the project area include sand

storm, saline and alkali soil, marsh muddy soil and humic soil, etc. The sand storms

are mainly distributed on the south side of the Hailar River, the sand belt is spread

with nearly east-west belt, mostly being semi-stabilized sand dunes, sand posts and

sand ridges. The land is mainly slight-wet sandy land, with sand chains. The saline

and alkali soil, mainly being alkali soil, is mainly distributed at river valley low lands,

lake basin low lands, and closed-flow low lands. The component is mainly lake and

marsh sediments in Holocene series. The marsh muddy soil and humic soil is

distributed in the flooding land of the Hailar River, mainly with alluvial and sediment

mixture in Holocene series. It then was transformed into marsh environment. The

main components are powder-fine grit and muddy soil, having rich organic matters,

and with the thickness of 2-5m.

3.2.5 Hydrology

The surface water system of the proposed project area belongs to that of the Erguna

River, which is the upper source of the Heilongjiang River. The Haier River and the

Dalaneluomu River merges at nearby Abagaitu Mountain and forms the Erguna

River. The mainstream of the river is the boundary river between China and Russia,

with the right and left banks respectively belonging to China and Russia. The main

surface waters include the Hailar River and Hulun Lake. The regional surface water

system is shown in Figure3-2-1.


a. Hailar River: The river originates from the west foot of Jieleqilaoshan of

Daxinganling Mountains in the Yakeshi City. The elevation is 1322m, the river length
715km, and the watershed area 54537km2, accounting for 1/3 of the Erguna River

water system. It flows through 6 cities (qi), including Yakeshi City, Ewenke Qi and


                                                43

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


Manzhouli City. When the Hailar River flows from east to west to Abagaitu Mountain

in the north of Zalainuoer, it merges with the Dalaneluomu River, and turns direction

to the northeast. This is then called the Erguna River. The Hailar River watershed has

the form of fan, the river network is centralized at the east half, the outer margin is

semi-circular, and the river valley has U type. On both sides of the river are terraces

with relative height difference of 20m. The river valley is wide at 3-5km, with flat

slope. The shearing force of downstream is weak. The main branch of the Erguna

River include Moergele River on the north side and the Yimin River and the Huihe

River, etc. on the south side.


b. Hulun Lake water system: It is one component of the Erguna River water system

and used to be one of the origins of the Erguna River. Only after the impact of earth

crust movement, the lake area subsided, the lake water level decreased, the lake water

stopped flowing out, temporarily disconnected with the Erguna River, and formed

independent water system. In late 1950s and early 1960s, the lake water level

increased, the lake water surface expanded, the lake water again flowed into the

Erguna River through the Dalaneluomu River, and the lake then became outflow

water system. In late 1960s and 1970s, the lake water level decreased and the lake

again stopped flowing out. From 1984, the lake level again increased and the water

flowed into the Erguna River and finally into the sea. The water systems of Hulun

Lake and the Erguna River some times are interconnected and form a common water

system and sometimes are independent. But in general, the lake belongs to the outflow

water system of the Erguna River. The main branches of Hunlun Lake are the Krlulun

River and the Wuerxun River.

3.2.6 Natural disaster

(1) White disaster

The white disaster is caused by heavy accumulation of snow that covers the herding

grass and makes the animals not able to obtain food and finally die of hunger. The

regional livestock farms are areas with serious and frequent white disaster, which has

resulted in serious loss in livestock production in the region.


(2) Drought disaster

The project area is located in inland high plateau, controlled by drought continental

air mass for 7-8 months each year. The annual average precipitation is 250-350mm,

with decreasing trend from east to west. On the other side, the evaporation is 1400-

1900mm, much greater than the precipitation. The drought possibility is very high

mainly in the spring. In some years, small precipitation in the summer and autumn can

cause drought in the two seasons, thus affecting the yield of herding grass. The




                                                 44

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


drought can also reduce the river and lake water amount and shrink the scope of

wetlands, limiting the activities and habitats for rare wild animals.


(3) Black disaster

After the ice slush or ice freezing in the rivers and lakes formed in early winter, there

is less snow or even no snow for continuous days, which makes difficult for the

humans and animal to drink water, and the grass farms unable to be utilized without

water, forming "black disaster". The black disaster can affect the production of

herding for some degree.


3.3 Surface Water Environment Baseline


3.3.1 Overview of surface water environment

(1) Hydrology

The main highway sections of the proposed project are located in the Hailar River

           basin. The highway goes along the mainstream of the Hailar River. The east

           part of section spans across the Morigele River of the branch stream of the

           Hailar River at nearby Huhenuoer, and the west part of the section spans

           across the Xinkai River.


The Hailar River originates from the west foot of Jieleqilaoshan of Daxinganling

Mountains in the Yakeshi City. The origin lies at east longitude 122 28 and north

latitude 49 57 , with an elevation of 1300m. The river length is 715km, and the
watershed area 54537km2, accounting for 1/3 of the Erguna River water system. The
annual run-off is 3.13billion m3, annual maximum flow 1800m3/s, annual minimum

flow 0, and annual freezeup period 150d. It flows through 6 cities (qi), including

Yakeshi City, Ewenke Qi and Manzhouli City. When the Hailar River flows from east

to west to Abagaitu Mountain in the north of Zalainuoer, it merges with the

Dalaneluomu River, and turns direction to the northeast. This is then called the

Erguna River.


The monthly averaged flows of the Hailar River for years are shown in Table 3-3-1.

The Morigele River originates from the west foot of Daxinganling Mountains. The

origin lies at east longitude 121 00 and north latitude 50 03 , with an elevation of
1040m. The river length is 319km, and the watershed area 4987km2. The river flows

through the whole Chenbaerhu Qi in the direction from northeast to southwest, with

the watershed area being flat and wide. The river slope is small and the waterway

twists and turns, especially called "the first zigzag water on the earth". On both sides

of the river are beautiful grasslands and good natural meadows. The river flows into

Huhenuoer Lake at the downstream, and flows out of the lake before merging into the

Hailar River.


The Xinkai River is a man-made canal constructed from June 1965 to September

1971, replacing the old stream way of the Dalan'eluomu River. It starts from the foot

of Heishantou Hill to nearby Shazishan Hill, with a length of 16.4km. Across the

canal, the drainage inlet gate and outlet flood detection gate have been established.

When the water level of the Hailar River is higher, the water flows through the Xinkai

River into Hulun Lake,. Otherwise, when the water level of Hulun Lake is higher, the

water flows through the Xinkai River into the Hailar River.

The total wastewater discharge was 21.2 million t in Hailar District in 2000, including

9.5 million t industrial wastewater. Total COD discharge was 8260 t, all discharged

into the Hailar River.

3.3.2 Current status monitoring for surface water

(1) Monitoring sections

Three monitoring sections were set for surface water along the proposed highway line.

The detailed positions of them are shown in Table 3-3-3 and Figure 3-3-1.


    Table 3-3-3 Position of Monitoring Sections for Surface Water Environment

Note: During the monitoring period, the Morigele River was frozen and cut-off, and thus the

monitoring data in the in level water period in the autumn in 2001 are referred. As there have been

no major change in the environment along the river and there are no new polluters, the water

quality has no major change.



(2) Monitoring time and frequency

The monitoring of current status of surface water was carried out from December 6~8,

2002.


Monitoring in 3 continuous days, with one sampling a day.


(3) Monitoring items and analysis methods

Considering the characteristic pollutants in the wastewater and the characteristics of

the regional surface water, 4 items (factors) are selected for monitoring, i.e. pH, SS,

COD and oil. The analysis methods are shown in Table 3-3-4.

(1) Assessment standard

The Class III standard of Surface Water Environmental Quality Standards (GB3838-

2002) is adopted for surface water assessment.


(2) Assessment method

Single Pollution Index Method carries out the assessment.

                                            Pi=Ci/Si

Where,          Pi ----pollution index for assessment factor i;

       Ci----concentration value of assessment factor i;

         Si----assessment criterion for assessment i.

For pH:

                          Pi= (7.5-Ci) / (7.5-Ssd)           (Ci 7.5

                           Pi= (Ci-7.5) / (Ssu-7.5)            (Ci 7.5)

Where,          Ssd----lower limit of pH stipulated by the standard;

The rivers under monitoring have been polluted by organic pollutants obviously. All

the COD values exceed national standard value, belonging to Class V or worse water

body. The reasons for the water quality pollution of the rivers include:

(1) The Morigele River is a river flowing through the grasslands, with small river

    run-off. The rotten matters from riverbed scouring and non-point sources, feces of

    cattle and sheep, and drinking water by plenty of cattle and sheep in the rivers

    have contributed to the increase of organic pollutants in the rivers and the high

    concentrations of COD measurement.

(2) The water pollution is serious in the Hailar River under drought period with very

    small flow, affected by industrial and residential wastewater discharge from

    Yakeshi, Dayan and Hailar cities along the river. The problem has been paid high

    attention to by various levels of governments. A plan of integrated control for the

    river basin has been formulated, and treatment engineering projects will be kicked

    off from now on. The aim is to obviously improve the water quality in the river in

    2 to 3 years.

(3) The Xinkai River is the flood drainage river for Dalai Lake. The natural

    eutrophication in Dalai Lake has led to high COD concentration in the lake. Also,



                                                49

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


    in the freezing periods, the ice accounts for a big proportion in the total water

    volume, having obviously resulted in further enrichment of pollutants.


3.4 Air Environment Baseline


3.4.1 Survey of current status

3.4.1.1 Topology and landform

Along the highway line of Hailar-Manzhouli Section are low-relief hills and

undulating Hulunbeier High Plain. On the south side of the highway is Hailar river

valley, and there is an east-west stabilized and semi-stabilized sand belt on the south

bank of the Hailar River. The surface relief along the line is high in the east and low

in the west, with the elevation of Hailar District in the east being around 610m, and

the lowest elevation at Zalainuoer (nearby Dalai Lake) being about 550m. From

Zalainuoer to Manzhouli City, the relief increases and reaches an elevation of about

600m at Manzhouli.


3.4.1.2 Main polluters

The regions that generate air polluters along Hailar-Manzhouli Highway Section

include Hailar District, Bayankuren Town and Manzhouli City.


There is a non-agricultural population of 226000 in Hailar District. The main air

polluters include: industrial coal-burning boilers in large enterprises such as Hailar

Thermoelectric Plant, most of which have installed dust collectors for boilers and the

emission of smoke dust and SO2 is up to the standard; small heating boilers in some
enterprises and institutions, residential areas and hotels and restaurants, only a small

amount of which have installed dust collectors with dust emission in compliance with

the national standard; low-chimney air pollution from residential stoves. The pollution

in Hailar District belongs to coal-smoke pattern. The centralized heating area reaches
2.5 million m2 in the district, which in combination with the use of liquefied

petroleum gas (LPG) has greatly alleviated the air pollution in the district, making the

air quality basically meet with Class II standard requirements. The annual emission of

smoke dust and SO2 was respectively 14280 t and 9633 t in Hailar District in 2002.


There is a population of more than 10000 in the town area of Bayankuren Town.

There are not many industrial enterprises in the town. The air polluters mainly include

small heating boilers and low-chimney emission from residential stoves. The air

quality can meet with Class II of national air quality standard.


There is a non-agricultural population of 151000 in Manzhouli City. The main air

polluters include: Lingquan Power Plant which has waste gas emission in compliance


                                                 50

                 EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


with national standards; industrial and heating boilers in Zalainuoer Coal Mining

Company, the old enterprise that has out-of-date dedustors equipped on the boilers

and the smoke dust dedusting rate of less than 50%; and some small industrial and

heating boilers in small enterprises and institutions and low-chimney air pollutant

emissions from residents. The city is of smoke-dust pollution pattern. After the

expanding construction of Manzhouli City Guangming Thermoelectric Company, the
centralized heating area of the city will reach more than 1 million m2, so as to improve

somewhat the air quality, making it basically meet with Class II standards. The annual

emission of smoke dust and SO2 was respectively 4442 t and 3725 t in Manzhouli City
in 2002.


3.4.1.3 Air environmental functional zoning

Class 2 standard of Ambient Air Quality Standards (GB3095-1996) is applied for

Hailar District, Bayankuren Town and Manzhouli City along the proposed project

line.

3.4.2 Current status monitoring for air environment

3.4.2.1 Layout of monitoring sites

According to the requirements of the TOR for this EIA, representative sensitive sites

within 200m along the project line are selected for monitoring of current status of air

environment. The monitoring sites and monitoring items are shown in Table 3-4-1 and

Figure 3-3-1.

3.4.3 Current status assessment for air environment

3.4.3.1 Assessment factors

The assessment factors for current status of air environment are TSP and NO2.

3.4.3.2 Assessment standard

The assessment of TSP and NO2 adopts Class II standard of Ambient Air Quality
Standard (GB3095-1996). The assessment criteria are shown in Table 3-4-3.


         Table 3-4-3 Air Environmental Quality Assessment Standards Unit: mg/m3

       Valuing time                       TSP                               NO2

3.4.3.3 Assessment methods

(1) The rates and times of exceeding the allowable limits for individual items are

calculated.

                   EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


(2) Single Pollution Index Method is adopted to perform the assessment. The formula

is as follows:


                                            I i = C i / S i

Where,           Ci ----concentration of pollutant i;
     Si ----assessment standard of pollutant i;

     Ii<0.5 means clean;
          0.5< Ii<1 means basically clean;
          Ii>1 means already polluted.


(3) The pollution load coefficients of individual pollutants are calculated to identify

main pollutants. The formulae are as follows:

                                  Ki=Ii/I×100%                I= Ii


Where, Ki----load coefficient of pollutant i;
           I ---- sum of load coefficients of all the pollutants.

3.4.3.5 Conclusions

(1) The daily averaged TSP concentration in the assessment area is below the national

    standard limit. The one-time NO2 measurement at one monitoring site exceeds the
    allowable value. This is mainly caused by special weather conditions (temperature

    inversion). The ambient air quality in the assessment area is basically clean and

    basically meets with national Class II standard.

(2) As seen from the statistics table of pollutant load coefficients of individual

    pollutants, the load coefficient of NO2 and TSP in the assessment area is basically
    60% and 40%, showing that the pollution of NO2 is slightly heavier than that of
    TSP, which is a result of special one-time measurement values.


3.5 Noise Environment Baseline


The main noise source is traffic noise. The noise monitoring siting principle is "using

individual points to represent the entire line". Reprehensive residents and hospitals at

sensitive sites along the highway line are selected for monitoring of current status of

noise environment. See details as follows.

3.5.1 Monitoring points

According to the noise sensitive sites within 200m to the central line of the highway
and their function requirements, 5 monitoring points are identified for noise
environment monitoring. See Figure 3-3-1.

3.5.2 Monitoring item

The monitoring item: equivalent sound level.

3.5.3 Monitoring time and frequency

Monitoring time: January 15~16, 2003.
Monitoring frequency: two time intervals respectively representing the daytime and
night.

3.5.4 Monitoring and analysis methods

The monitoring and analysis are based on Urban Ambient Noise Measurement
Methods (GBIT14623 93). The noise is assessed using continuous equivalent sound
level and statistical sound level (L1O, L50, L90).

3.5.5 Monitoring results

The positions of noise monitoring points are listed in Table 3-5-1, and the monitoring
results are shown in Table 3-5-2.

(2) Assessment results

The monitoring results are shown that the daytime noise at Haotetaohai Brach Farm,

the Fifth Team of Haotetaohai, West Wuzhuer Sumu and Yihe is ranging between

45.6~64.4 dB (A), and night noise between 39.5~54.7 dB (A). The noise

environmental quality can meet Class 4 limit values. The daytime noise at the

enclosure of Zalainuoer Mineral Area Hospital is ranging between 63.5~65.2 dB (A),

and night noise between 50.7~54.6 dB (A), higher than Class 1 standard limit. This is

mainly contributed by heavy highway traffic of Zalainuoer Mineral Area on the south

side of the hospital.

Based on satellite RS and GIS techniques and in combination with field survey, the

ecological landscape types have been investigated within the project region, with the

survey scope of 11470.0ha, which covers the area within 300m to both sides of the

highway and that within 100m around the borrowing and waste earth yards. The main

landscapes are grassland landscape, wetland landscape, forestland landscape, sand

landscape, human building landscape, and arable land landscape. The area of the

landscapes is shown in Table 3-6-1 and Figure 3-6-2.

(2) Landscape distribution and characteristics

The first landscape in the project area is grassland landscape, with a total area of

7386.6 ha, or 64.4% of the total assessment area. The grassland is the main

component of Hulunbeier Grassland area, forming important base of landscape in the

area. Continuous and large grasslands, with small number of patches, characterize the

landscape. It is classified into high, middle and low coverage grassland. The high

coverage grassland has biggest area, accounting for 96.7% of the total grassland

landscape area and distributed over the wide hills and high plains in the area. The

middle and low coverage grasslands have small area, only accounting for 3.3% of the


                                                 58

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


total grassland landscape area and distributed nearby the residential areas and other

plots with more human activities.


The second landscape is wetland landscape, characterized by huge wetland area,

relatively centralized distribution, a good number of patches forming the wetland

landscape, rich bio-resources, high biodiversity and bio-productivity, and sound

stability of ecosystem structure. The wetland ecosystem includes Huhenuoer Lake,

Benpo Lake, Erka Wetland, the Morigele River, the Hailar River, the Xinkai River

and their flooding lands, etc., with a total area of 3235.2ha, accounting for 28.2% of

the total assessment area. The wetland landscape can be classified by vegetation form

and wetland type into lake wetland, river wetland, riverbank shrub forest wetland,

reed and weeds marsh wetland, river and lake lowland salina. There is a big marsh

wetland on the sides of the Morigele River, growing with dense reeds. Erka Wetland

has rich aquatic vegetation, shrub vegetation, marsh vegetation and meadow

vegetation, etc., with integrated ecosystem structure.


The forestland landscape includes mainly pinus sylvestris var mogolica, man-made

forest, sand small arbor forest, etc., with an area of 26.3ha, accounting for 0.23% of

the total assessment area.


The sand landscape has an area of 170.3ha, accounting for 1.48% of the total

assessment area. This includes bare sand landscape and stabilized and semi-stabilized

sand landscapes. The patches are small in area and the landscape has high degree of

fragmentation. There is a bare sand landscape distributed in belt form along the Hailar

River, and there are also patch-form sand lands by State Highway 301 and on the

grasslands, being moving sand dunes or semi-stabilized sand dunes.


The area of human building landscape is 673.3ha, accounting for 5.87% of the total

assessment area. This kind of landscape does not have big proportion in the project

assessment area, and mainly includes residential areas of cities, towns and sumu, and

landscape of highways, natural roads and construction land uses. Examples are

Bayankuren Town (city and town landscape, the capital of Chenbaerhu Qi) , Taohai

pasture land (residential area), and Old Highway 301 from Hailar to Manzhouli.


The arable land is mainly dry-farming farmland, with an area of 72.5ha or 0.63% of

the total assessment area.

3.6.2 Survey of vegetation

Hulunbeir Environment Mornitoring Station has moninitored the vegetation of this
assessed area for years. By field investigation and analysis of series samples from


                                                 59

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



percific area in different period, the Station has accieved much valueable data, which
helps to discribe the general vegetation situation of the assessed area.
(1) Plant resources

Based on an overview of the plant resources in the project area, there are a total of

440 species of wild advanced plants, respectively belonging to 240 genera and 66

families. The plant families and genera are rich but with less variety, many genera

being monotypic or oligotypic genus. The Compositae family has most numerous

varieties with 71 species. At the next places are Gramineae, Leguminosae and

Rosaceae families. The first 4 families cover 41% of all the species, and the first 10

families have a percentage of 65%. There are 23 families that contain only one

species. The genera of Artemisia and Potentilla have most species, each having 16

species. The genus of Carex, Allium, Iridaceae, Vicia, Astragalus, Saussurea and Poa

are next to them, all having 5 species. Each of other genera has less than 5 species.

There are few rare plants or endangered plants under key conservation. But pinus

sylvestris var mogolica is a national protection species, which is tolerant to drought,

frost and low nutrient and grows fast. The species is mainly founded on the stabilized

sand dunes in the medium stream of the Hailar River. It grows more easily in the east

rather than in the west. There are no pinus sylvestris var mogolica within 200m along

the project line.


Among the plants in the region, 305 species are medicinal plants, including 32 species

of common Chinese medicines and 10 common Mongolian medicines. There are also

50 species of good meadows, 20 edible wild plants and 32 fancy species.


There are 24 cultivated plants, mainly being potato, carrot and tomato.


(2) Flora composition

The grasslands in the project area are located in Middle Asia sub-zone of Eurasia

grassland plant zone, typical of grasslands in the mesothermal grassland belt. The

geographical composition of the flora in the region is complex, with 20 types. There

are 226 flora of wide-area temperate zone (Pan Arctic, Palearctic and East Palearctic),

accounting for more than half of the total. There are 99 (22.5%) grassland flora

mainly with Dawuli-Mongolia species. 17.25% are flora with East Asia, Northeast

China and North China composition. 10 species are East Siberia flora and only a few

are Europe-Siberia and northern Xinganling Mountains. 2 species are Arctic circle

and Arctic alpine flora. As seen from the flora composition, the project area is mainly

of grassland, plus developed wetlands, and deeply affected by broad-leaved forests of

Siberia and East Asia.


(3) Plant types and distribution


                                                 60

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


The assessment area belongs to typical grassland belt of Hulunbeier High Plain. There

is also lakeshore plain, alluvial plain, flood plain, sand hill and hilly lands. The variety

of the topology has led to complexity and diversity of vegetation types in the region.

From the viewpoint of zonal rules, the representative vegetation is typical in the

region. Also, affected by local topology and other non-zonal factors, there are

distributed intrazonal vegetation, such as meadow, salinization and sand vegetation,

etc.


a. Typical grassland vegetation

Typical grassland is zonal vegetation in the region, widely distributed in the

fluctuating high plains and including Stipa grandis, Chinese wildrye, Stipa krylovii

and Artemisia frigida, etc.


Stipa grandis is the most stable top-level community among the typical grasslands. In

respect of landscape physiognomy, primary Stipa grandis grassland has been

developed and kept good conditions in less utilized areas.


Chinese wildrye is perennial rhizome grass of Gramineae family, with wide ecological

range. Therefore, Chinese wildrye can often be found in various kinds of ecological

environment, and play subdominant role in most vegetation types.


Stipa krylovii is non-zonal vegetation in the project area, distributed in surroundings

of lakes, residential areas and livestock farmers. It is formed by degradation of Stipa

grandis due to over-grazing, and is more xerophytic than Stipa grandis grassland.


Artemisia frigida is a result of gradual degradation of Stipa grandis and Stipa krylovii

grasslands, distributed at the edge of lakes, nearby the residential areas, the middle

and top of hills, and other over-grazing areas. The total area of this kind of grassland

is small in the project area.


b. Sand vegetation

The sand vegetation is distributed over stabilized and semi-stabilized sand dunes in

the project area, growing with trees such as pinus sylvestris var mogolica, Malus

baccata and elm. Pinus sylvestris var mogolica is evergreen mesophytic needle-leaved

arbor, distributed continuously on the sand areas nearby the Hailar River. Malus

baccata and elm are small arbor forest, often growing at dune valleys and northern

slope and wetting areas.


c. Meadow vegetation



                                                 61

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


Meadow vegetation is intrazonal vegetation. There is a large area of wetland, covered

with developed meadow vegetation including Carex, weed and salinized meadow.

The weeds and salinized meadow are distributed in the river flood lands.

d. Shrub vegetation

The shrub vegetation is mainly distributed along the banks of the Hailar River. The

Salix microstachya var. bordensis (Nakai) C.F.Fang is the advantageous species and

the community structure is stable. The herbage under the shrubs is dense, mostly

being marsh vegetation such as Carex.


e. Marsh vegetation

The marsh vegetation in the project area is mainly reed marsh, distributed in seasonal

or perennial pools zones at low flood lands of Erka Wetland in Manzhouli. The reed is

tall and dense, pure in plant composition, and distributed in large-area single

dominant species. All the community patches are small in area, some are independent

and others are mosaic in the marshlands.


f. Aquatic vegetation

Aquatic vegetation is scattered in the shallow waters on the shore of the lakes and

rivers. The submerged plant includes Potamogeton pectinatus. The floating plants

include Nymphoides paltata, Potamogeton distinctus, Polygonum and Lemna minor,

etc.

3.6.3 Survey of wild animals

According to the record of field observation carried out for more than 20 years by
Hulunbeir Environmental Morintoring Station, a basically analysis of information on
wilid animals of the assessed area is as follows.


There is a record of 226 species of wild animals (vertebrates) in the assessment area,

           including 37 fishes, 10 amphibians and reptiles, 38 mammals and 141

           birds.


(1) Fish and amphibians and reptiles

There are found 37 species of wild fish in the water system in the project area,
belonging to 5 orders and 9 families, respectively being 3 families in Cypriniformes
order, Salmoiformes order, Gadidae family of Cadiformes order, Petromyzonidae
family of Petromyzoniformes, and Perciformes order.


5 species of amphibians, including Rana amurensis, Rana nigromaculata,

Salamandrella keyserlingi, Bufo raddei and Rana chensinensis, are found and widely

distributed in the assessment area. In some hillocks, Bufo gargarizans is also found.

Reptiles are mainly distributed in sand dunes, including Eremias argus, Takydromus


                                                 62

                    EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


amurensis and, Lacerta vivipara, but with small numbers. There are two species of

snakes, i.e. Elaphe dione and Agkistrodon ussuriensis.


(2) Mammals

There are 6 orders, 14 families and 38 species of mammals, mainly with small ones

and no large carnivorous and herbivorous animals. Among the 38 species of

mammals, Rodentia and Carnivora orders have most species, accounting for more

than one half. Insectivora and Chiropiera orders are next to them. In addition, some

national Class II key protective animals, such as Procapra gutturosa, Lutra lutra and

Otocolobus manul, were once found along the project line before 1990, but very

unusual afterwards.


(3) Bird resources

Among the 141 species of birds recorded in the project area, palearctic species and

dispersed species account for 61% and 39% respectively. If classified by ecological

patterns, water fouls account for 47.5%, Non-Passeriformes 73.8%, and prey birds

10.6%.


Among 141 species of birds, there are 6 species of national Class I key protective

birds, i.e. Grus leucogernaus, Grus japonensis, Grus monacha, Otis tarda, Ciconia

ciconia and Ciconia nigra. There are 6 species of national Class II key protective

birds, i.e. Platal leucorodla, Cygnus cygnus Cygnus, C. columbianus, Aquila rapax,

Aquila heliaca, Milvus migrans, Buteo hemilasius, Buteo buteo, Buteo lagopus,

3.6.4 Survey of soil environment

The typical soil types in the project area include dark Castanozems soil, meadow soil,

bog soil, saline soil, and Aeolian soil, among which dark Castanozems soil is zonal

soil, and meadow soil, bog soil, saline soil, and Aeolian soil are intrazonal soils.


(1) Dark Castanozems soil

Dark Castanozems soil is widely distributed in the project area. It is widely found in

the high plains and river terraces and denuded residual hills, etc. with obvious zonal

distribution. The natural vegetation is typical grassland vegetation, comprised of

xerophytic herbaceous perennids. The main plant is tussock grasses, with root grasses

next to them. The community establishment plants are mainly Stipa grandis, Leymus

chinensis, Cleistogenes squarrosa (Trin.) keng, Koeleria cristata (L.) Pers, annual

meadowgrass (Poa), etc.


(2) Meadow soil

There is little distribution of meadow soil, mainly at the plots with low-level

groundwater, such as river valley lowlands and lakeshores. The groundwater level is

generally 1~3m. The main vegetation is mainly hygrophilous meadow vegetations,

including Sanguisorba officinalis L., Leymus chinensis, Carex, etc.


(3) Bog soil

There is a little distribution of bog soil in river flood plains and river furiotile

lowlands. The groundwater level is generally below 1m, being seasonal accumulated

water of the surface. The surface vegetation is mainly hydrophilic swamping

vegetation or meadow vegetation. The communities include Carex, Phragmites

australis, mat grass, etc.


(4) Saline soil

Saline soil is distributed in the river valley lowlands, lakeshores and closed-flow

depressions in the project area. It has small area and overlays with saline meadow soil

and alkali soil. The vegetation is mainly saline plant, mostly being saline meadow

communities, including Suaeda corniculata (C.A.mey.) Bunge, Iris lactea

Pall.var.chinensis (Franch.) Koidz., etc. The vegetation coverage is generally low.


(5) Aeolian soil

Aeolian soil is distributed over sand dunes and sand hills in the project area, being

divided into 2 sub-classes, i.e. stabilized Aeolian soil and semi-stabilized Aeolian soil.

The stabilized Aeolian has developed for long, with high vegetation coverage,

generally greater than 30%, and with organic content of 1~2% or so. The semi-



                                                  66

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


stabilized Aeolian has a thin humus coloring layer on the top, with low organic

content, generally below 1%, and with low vegetation coverage.

3.6.5 Survey of main eco-environmental problems

(1) Grassland degradation

The area is one typical livestock breeding ecological region. During last several

decades, the population has grown rapidly in the project area, the number of livestock

is increasing, the pressure on the grassland is getting greater and greater. The pastures

are commonly over grazing and under poor management. Affected by unreasonable

utilization such as over-exploitation of medicinal materials and natural disasters such

as drought pests, the grassland ecosystem has been under interference exceeding the

thresholds, resulting in destruction of grassland resources, wide degradation and

desertification of grasslands, and great reduction of good pastures.


(2) Soil salinization

The lakeshore wetland, bog wetland and butterfly lowland as well as plots with poor

drainage system are sensitive zones of soil salinization in the project area. As clearly

seen from the satellite TM images, there exists obvious distinct between the salinized

soils and the surrounding landscape after the grassland degradation in the lakeshores

and flood plains. In recent years in particular, as the climate is drought, many lakes

has been extinct, forming greyish-white salt incrustation on the surface and having
obvious landscape characteristics. At present, there is an area of 55.1 km2 with

obvious soil salinization in the assessment area.


(3) Soil erosion

The soil erosion in the assessment area includes mainly water erosion and wind

erosion. The soil erosion in the assessment area at present belongs to slight erosion

(below Level II). As the current status survey shows, there occurs slight water erosion

at slope zones with destructed vegetation and natural roads of gentle slopes.


The grassland in the assessment area belongs to high sensitive zone of wind erosion

desertification, with serious soil wind erosion. According to the current status survey,

wind erosion often occurs in the desertification zones and soil bare zones after

vegetation destruction during dry and windy seasons in the spring and autumn.


(4) Desertification

There is 170.3ha sand land in the project area. Along the river shores of the Hailar

River, are obvious sand dunes, mostly stabilized or semi-stabilized sand dunes.

Additionally, there are sporadic sand patches on the grasslands and nearby the

residential areas, with low vegetation coverage. They are badly stabilized duo to wind

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


erosion, and the topsoil is activated. In the high plains within the project area, there is

a large area of sand soil and dark Castanozems soil zone, with sand layer deposit

underlying the thin topsoil. The soil is loose and extremely liable to wind erosion and

desertification after destruction of vegetation and occurrence of breaches in

grasslands, thus being potential desertification areas.


(5) Pollution impacts

Most plots in the assessment area are grasslands and wetlands, with wide land and

rare population. The economy depends mainly on traditional livestock production,

without major "three wastes" pollution, despite pollution discharge in some town area.

3.6.6 Sensitive assessment of regional habitats

Eco-environmental sensitivity mainly refers to the types and possibility of the

occurrence of regional eco-environmental problems. In the project area, the landscape

ecological structure is mainly grassland and wetland. The wetland vegetation has

diverse vegetation types, rich habits and species, many rare protective birds and huge

ecological function. Compared with this, the grassland ecosystem has simpler

structure, low ecological function, and the anti-interference capability is relatively

low, with a small fluctuation of eco-environment able to cause a deep change of

ecosystem. In recent years, with human exploitation of natural resources, the

degradation and desertification of grassland and destruction of wetland, the biological

habits have been seriously affected, the biodiversity threatened, regional ecosystem

become very fragile, and the sensitivity of the habitats to unfavorable interferences

increased.

3.6.7 Summary of current status of ecology

(1) The occupation of natural ecosystems such as grasslands, meadows, marshes,

    shrubs, rivers, lakes and sand lands in the proposed project area is biggest,

    accounting for 94.3% of the total, construction lands such as towns, farmers and

    herdsmen residential areas, traffic roads account for 5.87%, and farming planting

    land use accounts for 0.63%. The land use functions of the project area are mainly

    in the natural condition, with a few towns, residences, industrial and traffic land

    uses, and fewer farming planting lands. The land resources are relatively rich in

    the project area.


(2) The natural landscape in the project area is mainly typical grassland landscape of

    Hulunbeier Grassland. Under the grassland matrix and background, there

    distribute a large area of rivers, lakes, marsh wetlands, with grasslands and

                                                 68

                   EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



     wetlands accounting for 92.6% of the total project area. The grassland landscape

     and wetland landscape patches are small in number, huge in area, high in linkage

     degree, playing decisive roles in stabilization of regional ecosystem. The

     grasslands and wetlands have diverse plant varieties and vegetation types, rich

     animal resources, especially with many national key protective rare animals.


 (3) The regional economy is mainly traditional livestock production, with a long

     history. The current primary productivity of pastures is decreasing, but the natural

     system characteristics of the pastures still remain unchanged, with sound eco-

     environment. However, the regional eco-environment has also obvious fragility,

     with high sensitivity to external unfavorable interference. The sand dark

     Castanozems soils and stabilized and semi-stabilized sand dunes are potential

     desertification areas. The regional soil belongs to slight water erosion area and

     slight salinization area. However, due to big sandy characteristic of the soil, the

     drought climate and windy weather, the region belongs to serious wind erosion

     area.


 3.7 Natural Reserves


 According to investigation at Hulunbeier Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB),

 and browsing of related materials, there are no national or Inner Mongolian natural

 reserves along Hailar-Manzhouli Section line.


 The distribution of national and Inner Mongolian natural reserves in Hulunbeier City

 is shown in Figure 3-7-1 and Table 3-7-1.

 Note: The natural reserves No. 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 are far away from the project.



 The national rare fowl wetland reserves in Hulunbeier City include Dalai Lake

 Natural Reserve and Huihe River Natural Reserve.


 (1) Dalai Lake Natural Reserve

 The area is located among Xinbaerhu You Qi, Xinbaerhu Zuo Qi and Manzhouli City,

 with east longitude of 117 00 ~117 41 and north latitude 48 30 ~49 20 . The total

 area is 740000 ha. It was list among the world's important wetlands of Wetland

 Convention in 1992.


 The wetland ecosystem is formed from the Dalai Lake water system, integrating the

 lake, river, marsh, shrubbery and reed pond. It is a comprehensive natural reserve to

 protect wetland ecosystem, typical grassland ecosystem and the numerous water fowls

 and rare and endangered species that inhabit, breed or migrate in Dalai Lake area. The

 wetland has typical characteristics of wetlands in the arid grassland zone, i.e. having

 good primitive character and natural character.

                 EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


There are 74 families and 653 species of wild seed plants and 30 species of fish in the

reserve. There are 6 orders, 13 families and 35 species of mammals, including 3

species of national Class II protective mammals, i.e. Procapra gutturosa, Lutra lutra

and Otocolobus manul. There are 292 species of birds recorded, including 9 species of

national Class I protective birds (Grus japonensis, Grus leucogernaus, Grus monacha,

Larus relictus, Ciconia nigra, Aquila chrysaetos, Aquila heliaca, Otis tarda, and

Haliaeetus leucoryphus) and 43 species of national Class II protective birds. It is the

largest breeding base of Anthropoides virgo population in China, and the important

dak for migrating water fowls in Northeast Asia and Australia.

The functions of Dalai Lake are to provide physical base of herding, fishery, urban

water supply and tourism, and to provide a good habit for numeric birds. This

proposed project passes by at around 19km to the north of the natural reserve.


(2) Huihe River Natural Reserve

Huihe River Natural Reserve is located in the southwest of Hulunbeier City of Inner

Mongolia, lying in the administrative areas of Ewenke Nationality Autonomous Qi

and Xinbaerhu Zuo QI. It is 22.5km from the northern boundary of the reserve to

Hailar City, and the reserve is also linked with Honghuaerji Mongolian Scotch Pine

Forest Park in the south. The geographical coordinates are
N48 10 ~49 17 ;E118 30 ~119 45 .


The Huihe River, the main river in the reserve, is the tributary of the Yimin River.

The river valley is wide, with low relief, and forms a huge marsh. The water surface
area within the reserve is 22.09km2, with 115 small lakes. The watershed area is 54.68
km2, mostly being alkali lakes.


There are 60 families, 199 genera and 344 species of plants in the reserve, including 1

family, 1 genus and 2 species of Pteridophyte; 2 families, 2 genera and 2 species of

gymnosperms; and others (angiosperms). There are 31 species of fish in the Huihe

River, belonging to 5 orders and 8 families. There are 3 orders, 5 families and 10

species of amphibians and reptiles, with numerous Rana amurensis and Rana

nigromaculata. On some hillocks, there are Bufo raddei and Bufo gargarizans. The

protection focuses are: rare and endangered birds, wetland ecosystem, meadow and

grassland vegetation, and sand land Mongolian Scotch pine forest. There are 8 species

of national Class I protective birds, and 28 species of national Class II protective

birds.

3.8 Summary


(1) According to the current status of surface water, the rivers under monitoring have

been polluted by organic pollutants obviously. All the COD values exceed national

standard value, belonging to Class V or worse water body. The reasons for the water

quality pollution of the rivers include: The mainstream Hailar River accepts industrial

and residential wastewater along the river and has serious water pollution under

drought period; The Xinkai River is the flood drainage river for Dalai Lake. The

natural eutrophication in Dalai Lake has led to high COD concentration in the lake.

Also, in the freezing periods, the ice function has obviously resulted in further

enrichment of pollutants. The Morigele River has small river run-off. The rotten

matters from riverbed scouring and non-point sources, feces of cattle and sheep, and

drinking water by plenty of cattle and sheep in the rivers have contributed to the

increase of organic pollutants in the rivers and the high concentrations of COD

measurement.


(2) The daily averaged TSP concentration in the assessment area is below the national

standard limit. The one-time NO2 measurement at one monitoring site exceeds the
allowable value. This is mainly caused by special weather conditions (temperature

inversion). The ambient air quality in the assessment area is basically clean and

basically meets with national Class II standard.


(3) The current status monitoring data of ambient noise show that the residences along

the project line can meet with Class 4 noise standard, and the ambient noise quality at

Zalainuoer Mineral Area Hospital cannot meet with Class 1 standard requirement, as

the hospital is close to the highway.


(4) The current status assessment of eco-environment shows as follows:

a. The land use functions of the project area are mainly in the natural condition, with

    a few towns, residences, industrial and traffic land uses, and fewer farming

    planting lands. The land resources are relatively rich in the project area.

b. The natural landscape in the project area is mainly typical grassland landscape of

    Hulunbeier Grassland. Under the grassland matrix and background, there

    distribute a large area of rivers, lakes and marsh wetlands. The grassland

    landscape and wetland landscape patches are small in number, huge in area, high

    in linkage degree, playing decisive roles in stabilization of regional ecosystem.

    The grasslands and wetlands have diverse plant varieties and vegetation types,

    rich animal resources, especially with many national key protective rare animals.

c. The regional economy is mainly traditional livestock production. The eco-

    environment is good, but has also obvious fragility, with high sensitivity to


                                                 72

     external unfavorable interference. The sand dark Castanozems soils and stabilized

     and semi-stabilized sand dunes are potential desertification areas. The regional

     soil belongs to slight water erosion area and slight salinization area. The region

     belongs to serious wind erosion area.


 (5) Environmental protection targets along the line

 According to current status of social environment and natural conditions of the project

 area, the main environmental protection targets along the highway are identified,

 including grassland, wetlands, related rivers, and residents along the highway line.

 See Table 3-8-1.

4.1.1.2 Impact on economic bases

The proposed highway will connect Hailar District and Manzhouli City. Hailar

District is the political, economic, cultural and social activity center of Hulunbeier

City. Manzhouli City is an important port city of Hulunbeier, locating at the center of

Northeast Asia Circle comprised of northeastern China, Siberia region of Russia,

Mongolia, Japan, Korea and DPRK, and at the joint of external and internal markets,

thus being the pivot of the development of northeastern economy and tourism.


Communication and transport is a comprehensive and leading base industry for the

development of national economy. The proposed highway will play important roles in

the inter-regional economic development and material exchange.


The proposed project will bring about important long-term positive impacts on the

development of regional economy.


4.1.1.3 Impact on economic, industrial, and labor structure

The construction of the proposed project will bring along the urban and rural

construction along the line, promote the exploitation and utilization of land and

resources. At the interconnections and inlets/outlets of highway from/to the nearby

towns, new industrial and commercial zones can be developed.


The tourism in the project area will develop rapidly. The demand for transport of

energy, raw materials, building materials and passengers is great, the construction of

the proposed project will promote increase of proportions of the secondary industry

(mainly industrial and building materials sectors) and tertiary industry (mainly

transport, commerce, finance and issuance sectors) in all the three industries.


The construction of the proposed project will increase a plenty of employment

opportunities, and thus alter the employment structure. The number of employees and

urban individual laborers will increase somewhat.

4.1.2 Impact on employment and unemployment

4.1.2.1 Employment

The construction of the proposed project will increase following employment

opportunities:

1       11.2 million labor days will be needed for construction of the highway, thus

        can increase a great number of employees. Workers who will directly serve

        the construction project will also be needed.




                                                 76

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


  2         The project will speed up local economic development and thus greatly

            increase the transportation. This can lead to a good many employment

            opportunities.

  3         The regional economic development will indirectly increase the employment.

  4         In the Construction Period, great quantities of road materials will be

            purchased, thus promoting development of related industries along the line

            and increase employment opportunities.


  In an all, the construction of this project will directly and indirectly increase a lot of

  employees.


  4.1.2.2 Unemployment

  As the construction of the highway will occupy a plenty of lands, part herdsmen may

  lose their rangeland. According to related stipulations on construction project in

  China,       the local governments and construction unit will be responsible for the

  settlement of work or re-allocate new rangelands for them. There should be no

  problem in this issue.

  4.1.3 Impact on emigration

  In the routing of the project line, towns and villages should be avoided as far as

  possible in order to reduce removal. As the local village density is low, the removal
  amount of residences is small, with a requirement of removal of 358m2 houses. The

  types and quantities of removal are shown in Table 4-1-1.

                    Table 4-1-1 Types of Removal and Quantities of Removal

  In respect of removal settlement, local governments and village committees will be

  responsible for the settlement nearby original sites. The construction unit will pay the

  compensations for removal, to build new houses. This can avoid large-scale long-

  distance removal, and minimize the social impacts from the removal as far as

  possible.




                                                      77

                   EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


In order to implement the settlement smoothly, the construction unit will set up

specific personnel and institution, formulate corresponding settlement measures and

implementation plan, and coordinate with local governments and other related

departments. The compensations will be calculated for each households to be

removed, in consideration of detailed requirements of them and in accordance with

relevant documents, policies and standards of local governments.


As the removal work is small as the removal is nearby, it should not bring about

unfavorable impacts on the residents to be removed as long as the work is carefully

planned and carried out. In a long term, the living conditions of these residents can be

updated and improved.

4.1.4 Impact on public facilities

(1) Impact on local transport

As part of the proposed highway will utilized original State Highway 301, the local

transport may be affected in the Construction Period, which can be alleviated through

building construction access roads and reasonably allocating construction time.


In the comprehensive transport system in the impact area, highway transport plays an

important role. This proposed communication construction project will greatly

improve local highway transport status, reduce traffic accidents, enhance running

speed of the vehicles, and greatly enhance the service level of the highway.


The construction of the proposed project will also greatly promote improvement of

local tourism conditions.


(2) Impact on public facilities along the line

The following principles will be abided by for the important electric and

communication facilities: the routing should be carried out to avoid removal of

electric and communication facilities as far as possible. No major communication

facilities will be removed, except for some village electric and communication

facilities. In the whole project line, there will be 10 power transmission sequences, 11

high- voltage lines, 700m long, -distance cable, 800m translation communication

lines, and 12 cross communication lines to be removed (see Table 4-4-1).

4.1.5 Impact on social security

(1) Impact on social stability

Hulunbeier City is a minority agglomeration with Mongolian as the main body and

Han people with the most population. After more than 50 years of construction, the

regional socioeconomic development has achieved huge advance, and the minority

has also obtained huge development in economic, cultural, education and public


                                                  78

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


health fields. All the nationalities are getting along very well and the society is stable.

The construction of this highway will play important roles in pulling up the economic

development along the line, improving the travel conditions, further enhancing

exchange and communication between the minorities in the border area, promoting

unity of all the nationalities, and maintain the social stability.


(2) Impact of construction persons from the outside on local residents

The Construction Period will last for 3 years. Persons from the outside will be

employed besides local people. Therefore, personnel management for the construction

team should be strengthened to avoid their impacts on the living of local residents.

4.1.6 Impact on cut-offs

(1) Impact on residents on both sides of the highway

The highway will go through some villages and pastures and produce in convenience

to the production activities of local herdsmen, and the communication and liaison of

the herdsmen and among the sumu. The design of the project has already considered

pathways for herdsmen and tractors, so as to alleviate impacts of the highway on the

traffic cut-offs. Based on public consultation survey, pathways and passenger

overpasses are increased from 30 to 47 and culverts from 104 to 110, compared with

original design.

(2) Impact on livestock

The highway will have some impact on the livestock breeding when going through

the pastures. During the construction documents design phase, these impacts should

be fully considered and sufficient pathways reserved. It is suggested that the pipe

                                                 79

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


culverts in the pasture areas be changed to decking culverts, so as to facilitate the

livestock to go through the highway.

4.1.7 Impact on hydrology

4.1.7.1 The impact on surface water

There will be 4 big-sized bridges (totaling 1326m), 4 middle-sized bridges (525.5m),

and 18 small-sized bridges (totaling 352m) along the project line.

There were once uprivers of different depths (20-190cm) in Erka Wetland during

extra big flood period (flood in a century) in 1998. The design of bridges has

considered the flood drainage on both sides of the roadbeds, with bridges and culverts

set up at ditches and rivers with water flow in the drought seasons. The design

parameters are under the case of one flood in a century and the spans expanded

somewhat.


On the basis of original feasibility study, some adjustment are suggested for the

wetland sections, as follows:

(1) Adding 4-20m middle sized bridge at K546+500;

(2) Adding 4-20m middle sized bridge at K547+840;

(3) Adding 4-20m middle sized bridge at K548+060;

(4) Adding 6-20m big sized bridge at K550+900;

(5) Replacing 24-20m big-sized bridge with 30-20m middle sized bridge at

    K550+150, and the length of the bridge is increased by 20 percent. The central

    post number being K551+620.


After this adjustment, the total length of bridge will be 480m longer, which can meet

with the flood drainage requirements of the Hailar River and the Xinkai River, and

avoid runoff cut-offs of the rivers and wetlands as the result of construction of the

proposed highway. The set-up of the bridges and at Erka Wetland Section is

illustrated in Figure 4-1-1.


4.1.7.2 The impact on the groundwater

Reasonable design scheme and engineering measures will be considered and adopted

for bridge base and ground base during the Design Period in order to reduce the

impact on the groundwater.


According to the hydraulic, geological and river (ditch) bed characteristics of the

rivers and ditches, the superstructure of the bridges generally adopts 20-m, 16-m and

13-m prestressed concrete simple-support cored slabs. The substructure of big-sized

bridges adopts gravity-type piers and ribbed slab abutment and the base adopts that of

                                                 80

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



drilling pouring posts. The substructure of small- and middle- sized bridges adopts

pillar-type piers and stands (or U-type abutment) and the base adopts drilling pouring

posts. The base adopting that of drilling pouring posts could occupy less area and

lower the impact on groundwater.


The roadbed at wetland section is about 3-4m high and the underside of the roadbed

is rubbles with diameter 10-30cm.It can lower the impact on the groundwater. The

roadbed of the highway in wetland section is shown in Figure 4-1-2.



4.2 Surface Water Environmental Impact Analysis


4.2.1 Polluters analysis

The highway construction can be divided into the Construction Period and the

Operation Period. In the Construction Period, the water environmental pollution is

mainly from sewage discharge of constructors and the SS nearby the construction

sites of bridges construction. In the Operation Period, the water pollution is mainly

from water washing of vehicle exhausts and from the sewage at service areas.

4.2.2 Water environmental impact in the Construction Period

The following impacts can be produced on river downstream water quality from

bridge construction:

    The construction machineries contain oily wastewater that may yield oil pollution

    of rivers when it is discharged in to the rivers.

    The construction materials such as bitumen, oil and chemicals can pollute the

    waters after being washed by the rainfall if not properly managed.

    The sewage and garbage from constructors can be directly discharged into the

    rivers and pollute the river water if the management is not strengthened.

4.2.3 Water environmental impact in the Operation Period

(1) Bridge surface rainfall runoff pollution projection

a. Bridge surface rainfall pollutant concentrations

The discharge of initial rainfall into the water body can have some impact on the

water quality. This EIA refers to monitoring data and document materials of other

highways. The pollutant concentrations of bridge surface rainfall are shown in Table

4-2-1.

b. Bridge surface rainfall runoffs

According to local climate characteristics of Hulunbeier City, and based on the line

strike of the proposed highway, topology characteristics and the positions of the

rivers, the lengths and surface runoffs of the highway sections that have impacts on

surface water are determined and shown in Table 4-2-2.

c. Highway surface rainfall runoff pollution

The rainfall in the region is concentrated in June to August, accounting for 70% of the

total annual precipitation. This belongs to high water period with larger water flow.

The discharge of initial rainfall into the water body can have some impact on the

water quality. The impact should stop as the rain stops therefore belonging to short-

term impact. Bridge surface rainfall runoffs has less impact on the water quality of the

river.


(2) Sewage impact of service areas

According to the feasibility study of the proposed highway, a service area will be

setup at Chen Qi. As the scale and facilities of the service area has not been




                                                  82

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


determined, the impact is performed by analog to other Class I highway service areas

in Inner Mongolia.


It is supposed that the park, oil station, maintenance center, restaurant, shop, toilet and

lavatory are set up in Bayankuren Service Area (K425+000), with main functions of

traffic management and maintenance.


The population the service area in supposed to be 20 employees, and the passengers

can be converted to permanent population of 200 people. The living water use is
150L/d for each person, and the daily total sewage is calculated at 33m3 in the service

area, including dinning, offices and bathrooms washing water and faces. The sewage

concentrations are: CODCr=500mg/l, BOD5=220 mg/l, Oil=100mg/l, and the pollutant
discharge intensities are: CODCr=16.5kg/d, BOD5=7.26 kg/d, oil=3.3kg/d.


Therefore, the sewage from the service area must be treated before discharging in to

the surface water. It is suggested that comprehensive treatment facilities be set up for

living sewage and oily wastewater (see Chapter 7), in order to guarantee the

compliance with Class 2 requirements of Farmland Irrigation Water Quality

Standards (GB5084-1992) (COD 300, SS 200mg/L, oil 10mg/L).


(3) Conclusions

    The main impacts the proposed project in the Operation Period are main initial

    rainfall, but with small amounts of pollutants and thus no major impact on the

    characteristics of the original water body.

    The living and oily wastewater sewage from the service area in the Operation

    Phase should be treated to meet with Class 2 requirements of Farmland Irrigation

    Water Quality Standards before discharge.


4.3 Ambient Air Impact Projection and Assessment


4.3.1 Ambient air impact in the Construction Period

The air pollution of the highway in the Construction Period comes mainly from the

following linkages: (1) resuspended dust from lime-soil mixing, bitumen concrete

mixing and vehicle transportation; and (2) bitumen smoke from bitumen concrete

preparation and on bitumen laying on the road surface. Detailed analysis is as follows.


4.3.1.1 Resuspended dust

In the Construction Period of the highway, land leveling, pile driving, surface laying,

materials transportation and loading, and material mixing are linkages that can

generate resuspended dust, with the most important sources being from vehicles


                                                 83

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


running and construction operation (concrete mixing and cement unloading, material

feeding, etc.).


(1) Resuspended dust from vehicles

With reference to similar projects, in the construction zones, most transport vehicles

run on earth access roads that have much dust, and thus the road dust resuspension is

serious. In particular, in the process of concrete, the lime-soil transport vehicles will

have obvious impacts on both sides. According to related documents, the TSP
concentration will be greater than 10mg/m3 at 50m downwind of the highway side,
while it will be greater than 5mg/m3 at 150m downwind of the highway side.


(2) Resuspended dust from construction operation

Among the construction resuspended dusts (land leveling, earth borrowing, loading of

road materials, lime-soil mixing, etc.), the resuspended dust from lime-soil mixing is

most serious. The lime-soil mixing has two types, i.e. road mixing and station mixing

(central mixing). Table 4-3-1 provides monitoring results of resuspended dust from

lime-soil mixing of similar highways. As seen from the table, both road mixing and

station mixing have impact within 100m downwind. When adopting station mixing,

the resuspended dust impact within 100m downwind is serious, and the TSP
concentration will be 0.5mg/m3 or so at 150m downwind.

To sum up, in the Construction Period, the resuspended dust will have some impact

on the ambient air along the line, with the impact scope within 200m of the

construction site. Among various construction activities, the lime-soil mixing and



                                                 84

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


vehicle transportation are most important sources of resuspended dust. They can have

obvious impact within 100m downwind of the construction site.


4.3.1.2 Bitumen smoke

The proposed highway will adopt bitumen concrete pavement, with an area of
3452038m2 of bitumen concrete cover. In the construction of the bitumen pavement,

the bitumen smoke is another important pollution source, in addition to resuspended

dust. It is mainly generated from the processes of bitumen cooking, mixing and

pavement laying, among which bitumen cooking has the largest emission of bitumen

smoke. In the bitumen smoke, the main toxic and harmful substances are THC, phenol

and 3, 4-BaP.


There are generally two methods of bitumen cooking. One is generally adopted by

large highway construction projects and adopts closed-type mixing process with dust

collectors. The bitumen is transported to laying construction sites by sources without

heat or high-temperature containers. The other melts the bitumen with open pots in

the cooking shed, then directly lay the pavement. The latter is generally used for

highway repairing and has obviously greater impact (both in degree and scope) than

the previous. The generation amount of bitumen smoke is directly related to the

mixers. Put Italian-made MAZY-type equipment (160t/h) as an example, the exhaust

height is about 20m, and the measurement results are shown in table 4-3-2 and Table

4-3-3.

As seen from the monitoring results, if the type of mixers is properly chosen, the

close-type plant-mix process can have small impact of bitumen pollution on the

ambient air.


In addition, according to related materials, the impact distance of bitumen smoke is

about 100m downwind from bitumen laying.




4.3.2 Ambient air impact in the Operation Period

4.3.2.1 Climate and pollution meteorological characteristics

(1) Climate characteristics

The project area belongs to mesothermal zone continental climate. The overall

characteristics are: The winter is cold and long, the summer is warm and short, the

spring is dry and windy, and the autumn sees rapid temperature decrease and has early

frost. According to data of Manzhouli Meteorological Station, the annually averaged

temperature is -1.3ºC, and the historic extreme highest and lowest temperature is 37.8

ºC and -42.7ºC respectively. The annually averaged frost-free time is 110d. The

annually averaged precipitation is 299.5mm, and the annually averaged evaporation

l454mm. The leading wind direction is in SW direction. The annually averaged wind

speed is 4.4m/s, and maximum wind speed 40m/s. The light resource is rich, with

c. Air pollution coefficients

The pollution coefficients of ESE and E direction in the four seasons and the whole

year are all great. The maximum value in the winter and the whole year reaches 5.42

and 4.32 respectively. In the summer, the pollution coefficients in ENE and E

direction are also high, being 2.16 and 2.23 respectively.


d. Air stability

Pasquill classification method was adopted to perform statistics of air stability on the

base of meteorological data in recent 5 years. The results show that the frequencies of


                                                  87

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


Category D in the four seasons and the whole year are all highest, being 52.86%,

57.48%, 55.12%, 37.89% and 49.86%, respectively. In the autumn, the frequencies of

Category E and Category F are also high, being 25.36% and 22.43%, respectively.


e. Distribution of joint frequency of wind direction, wind speed and air stability

The distribution of joint frequency of wind direction, wind speed and air stability in

the project area is obtained on the base of meteorological observational data in recent

5 years. See Table 4-3-5 and Table 4-3-6 for details.


f. Low-altitude temperature field characteristics

Low-altitude air temperature detection was once carried out in Hailar region at the end

of 1980s. In summer season, the temperature inversion occurs after the sunset and

disappears before the sunrise in Hailar region. The elevation of inversion cap is

averaged 183m, the thickness 159m, and strength 2.2ºC/100m.


In winter season, the temperature inversion layer has low bottom, with great thickness

and strong intensity. It already occurs before the sunset and disappears a long time

after the sunrise. The elevation of inversion cap is averaged 236m, the thickness

205m, and strength 3.62ºC/100m.


If considering the latitude and compared with Hailar, there should also be strong air

temperature inversion along the highway line. However, as the topology is wide and

flat, local climate becomes windy, with more neutral and unstable weathers, and the

frequency of the inversion weather and the strength of the inversion should be less

than that of Hailar.

(2) Determination of model parameters

From the above figures, it can be seen that the impact of NOx concentration is mainly

nearby the highway (between 0-40m from the highway sides). In the long future in

2030, the NOx concentration on the sides of the highway does not exceed the Class 2

standard stipulated in GB3095-1996.

Common machineries for highway construction include electric generators,

excavators, bulldozers, Land levelers, road compressors, spreaders, cranes, and

transport vehicles, etc. Analog monitoring results of these construction machineries

are shown in Table 4-4-1.

4.4.1.2 Noise environmental impact analysis

The following formula is adopted to estimate the noise impact of construction

machineries in the Construction Period:

                              Loct (r) = Loct (r0) - 20lg   r 

                                                             r0 - Loct

Where,

   Loct(r)--Octave band noise pressure level at the projection point generated by

            point noise source;

   Loct(r0)-- Octave band noise pressure level at reference position r0;

   r--Distance from projection point to noise source, m;

   r0--Distance from reference position to noise source; m;
     Loct--Noise attenuation resulted from various factors (including attenuations

            from noise shelter, barrier, air absorption and earth surface effect, etc.

            See text of Technical Specifications for Environmental Impact

            Assessment).




                                                95

                 EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


 If the octave band noise pressure level (Lw oct) of noise source is known and the

 noise source can be regarded as on the earth surface, then

                                 Loct (r0) =          - 20lgrL   - 8
                                                w oct          0


Because the machineries on the construction fields have different operational

conditions, the noise level ranges from 75 dB to 100dB. With the increase of distance

to the construction machineries, the noise level is decreasing. The noise level at

different distances for main construction machineries is shown in Table 4-4-2.

Compared the estimation results with the reference standards, the impact scopes of

various machineries in the daytime are all within 50m. The noise will be below 70

dB(A) beyond 50m, and below 60 dB(A) beyond 100m.


The impact scope at night is greater. The noise will be 55 dB(A) only beyond 100m

for most construction machineries, and it can reach 55 dB(A) only beyond 300m for

land levelers, mechanical loaders and other high-noise machineries.


The noise impact of construction is limited in the Construction Period and will

disappear once the construction is finished. Also the construction noise has

intermittent or sporadic (e.g. pile drivers) characteristics, and will not have serious

impact if the construction stops at night.

for the existing State Highway 301, the daytime/night traffic flow ratio is 0.83 : 0.17at

Hailar Bei, and 0.875:0.125 at Manzhouli.

The traffic flow of Zalainuoer Mineral Area section of the old Highway 301 will be

split after the project is put into operation. According to the Feasibility Report, the

traffic flow from Zalainuoer to Manzhouli dominates 52.7% of the total. The traffic

flow of the old highway will reduce by 73.65% if the diversion percentage of the new

Highway 301 is 50%. With the decrease of traffic flow, the noise impact of the old

highway on the Mineral Area Hospital will be greatly lowered.

2.3dB(A) respectively.


The long-term noise projection at night at West Wuzhuer exceeds the standard value

by 2.9dB(A). The projected noise levels at other residential areas call meet with the

national standards.


b. Hospital

The medium-term noise projection at night at Mineral Area Hospital exceeds the

standard value by 4.1dB(A), and the long-term noise level in the daytime and at night

exceeds by 5.37dB(A) and 6.27dB(A), respectively. To reduce the noise impact, six

lines trees are planning to be planted between the road and hospital.

4.5 Ecological Environmental Impact Projection


The ecological impacts of highway construction include those in the Construction

Period and Operation Period. The highway itself will occupy land permanently, and

the construction of the highway will lead to soil compaction, plant striping, species

extinction and decrease of vegetation coverage, duo to human activities such as roller

compaction of machineries and vehicles, trampling of constructors, and land

occupation of construction materials. Ecological patches will be generated in the

original continuously distributed landscapes, causing physical abnormality of

landform, surface temperature and humidity, interfering with the breeding and

migration of surface vegetation and wild animals, altering the land uses patterns and

functions, and changing the ecological landscape pattern along the highway line.

4.5.1 Impact on ecological complexity of regional natural system

The impact of the engineering project is within 300m of the two sides of the highway,

with total direct impact area of 11383ha, permanent land occupation by the

engineering of 1084ha or 9.52% of the total assessment area. The main body of the

regional natural system is typical grassland vegetation, with intrazonal vegetation,

such as meadow and marsh, distributed under the typical grassland vegetation. The

impact of the engineering on the regional natural system is the direct occupation of

grasslands and wetlands, which could decrease the productivity of the natural system

in the region. The project will have much smaller impact on the productivity of other

grasslands and wetlands that are not directly occupied by the project. Therefore, the

impact of the engineering on the productivity of regional national system is

acceptable.


Only a proportion of 9.52% grasslands and wetlands out of the assessment area will

be changed, while other 90.48% of grasslands and wetlands will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the role of main body of grasslands and wetlands in the region will not be

altered, and the implementation and operation of the engineering will not generate

major impacts on complexity of regional natural system.

4.5.2 Land use and livestock production loss

4.5.2.1 Land occupation

The permanent land occupation will be 1084ha, including grasslands, wetlands,

farmlands, and other land uses. Among the occupied land, there will be 634.6ha high

plain grasslands, and 230ha hilly grassland.




                                                107

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


4.5.2.1 Livestock production loss

The grasslands to be occupied are all natural herding pastures. The change of pastures

into highway lead to structural variation of land uses in the project area, and cause

reduction of herding lands, decrease of grass yield and loss of livestock production.


The present grassland along the proposed highway line is mainly of high and medium

coverage. Calculated at an average of fresh grass yield of 3000 kg/ha, there will be a
reduction of about 259.4x104kg fresh grass annually along the highway line due to the

permanent land occupation. In addition, the temporary land occupation during the

Construction Period will destruct somewhat the vegetation, and there will be no grass

grown within 10m of the construction site. Beyond 50m, the grass coverage will not

decrease greatly, but the composition of plant species will be affected, making annual

and biennial plants with low utilization value as the main body. This kind of impact is

within the short term and reversible, and the vegetation on the temporally occupied

lands will start to be rehabilitated after the end of construction. The vegetation

rehabilitation will start with annual and biennial plants and can finally reach the

original top-level population in 10 years. If calculated at a restoration period of 5

years and suppose that the fresh grass yield in the vegetation destruction area is 50%
of that in normal grasslands, the total fresh grass loss in 5 years will be 648.5x104 kg.

4.5.3 Landscape impact analysis

The landscape in the proposed project area is comprised of grassland ecosystem, river

bog and wetland ecosystem, forestland ecosystem, sand land ecosystem, arable land

ecosystem, and human building (including roads, industries and mineral mining,

residence, etc.) ecosystem. The quality of landscape ecosystem depends on the

interaction among natural environment, various kinds of animals and plants and the

human society.


The mosaic dominance method is adopted to analyze the landscape impact of the

project.


The following formulae are used to calculate the dominance:

                        Number of mosaic i
      Density Rd=                                     ×100%

As seen from Table 4-5-1, among the mosaics in the project area, the Do of grasslands
is highest, being 60.4%. In addition, the landscape proportion (Lp) of grasslands is
64.0%, and the occurrence frequency Rf 85.1%. This states that the grassland is the
control composition in regional eco-environmental quality. However, the natural

environmental characteristics also determine that the grassland ecosystem has obvious

fragility and has weak anti-interference ability.


The implementation and operation of this proposed project will change certain current

land uses. Based on the dominance calculation model, the dominance of various land

uses after the implementation of the project is calculated and shown in Table 4-5-2.

According to Table 4-5-2, the local land use patterns will make change after

implementation and operation of the highway engineering. The dominance of human

building (mainly roads) mosaic will increase from 10.8% to 14.0%. The dominance of

grassland and other mosaics will only have small changes and the dominant role of

grassland will not change. This indicates that the implementation and operation of the

proposed project will not have major impact on the quality of natural system in the

assessment area.

4.5.4 Ecological impact analysis in the Construction Period

4.5.4.1 Impact of temporary land occupation on grassland vegetation

(1) Loss of biomass

Temporary land occupation is required for building construction access roads and

living camps and piling materials, etc. in the construction of highway. The total area

of temporary land occupation will be 539ha. The building of construction access

roads and living camps and pilling of construction materials will destruct surface

vegetation, and the machineries rolling and constructors trampling will lead to loss of

vegetation biomass in the Construction Period.


(2) Waste gas impact

The excavation of earths and stone and vehicle transportation will bring about

resuspended dust that can naturally settle on the leave blades of surrounding

vegetation, obstruct the stomas, affect the respiration and photosynthesis, and have

negative impact on the growth of plants. The exhaust of construction machineries

contains NOx and other harmful gases, which can destruct the leaf tissue of sensitive

plants, lead to discoloration spots. The construction resuspended dust and exhaust

cannot the plant growth during the construction year.


(3) Rehabilitation period

This kind of impact is in short term and reversible. After the end of construction, the

vegetation on the temporarily occupied land will start to rehabilitate. Also, in the

design, it is required that the topsoil be re-covered on the surface of side ditches, side

slopes and earth borrowing pits. It is favorable to the vegetation rehabilitation. When

the vegetation on temporally occupied land is rehabilitated to the surrounding

vegetation, the impact can be finally eliminated. Generally, the side slopes can be

rehabilitated quicker due to human grass planting and watering. The rehabilitation of

construction access roads may be slower as the soil has been compacted and formed

bare land. Without external interference, the rehabilitation to original top-level

vegetation will require a time of 8~10 years.

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway




4.5.4.2 Impact on wild animals

The animal resources in the project area include fish, amphibians and reptiles,

mammals and wild birds, etc.

(1) Fish, amphibians and reptiles

During the construction period of the highway, the temporary land occupation and

destruction of vegetation due to the earth and stone excavating, material piling and

constructors living will have unfavorable impact on the varieties and quantities of

rodents, amphibians and reptiles along the line, making them migrate to surrounding

areas with less interference and adapt to and live in the new environment. After the

end of construction, the varieties and quantities of rodents, amphibians and reptiles on

the temporarily occupied land will gradually be rehabilitated.


(2) Mammals

There are some large and middle wild animals in the region. Two sections of the

proposed highway from the starting end to West Wuzhuer will utilize old roads as

separated cross sections. Within the region, there have been many human activities,

with large traffic flows and great human interference, and there are few large and

medium wild animals that are fear of human interference. From West Wuzhuer to

Erka Wetland, the human activities are fewer, but there are also few large and

medium wild animals. The construction of the highway during the Construction

Period may affect the ways of migration, scope of feeding and the habits, but as the

large and medium mammals have been few, the impact of highway construction on

them should be low.

(3) Birds

The mechanical noise, human activities and vegetation destruction in the Construction

Period will all affect the habitation and breeding of birds in the construction zones and

nearby areas, making obvious change of varieties and species of the birds in the

region. The impact on the birds will vary among different species. The sparrows and

swallows that accompany the man will increase while others will decrease. The

highway will have a long way through the wetland, which may affect local wild

animals (see Section 5.1.5).


To sum up, the highway will have obvious impacts on small animals such as rodents,

amphibians and reptiles. However, this impact should be temporary, will disappear

gradually after the end of construction, and will not affect their living and population

quantity. As there are currently few large, mammals along the line, the construction of

the engineering will have small impact on large mammals. The construction will have

major impacts on the birds along the line, especially on the birds habilitate and act in

the wetland along the line. The construction will occupy and destruct the original


                                                111

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


habitats and existence environment of the birds, forcing them to flee to other places.

After the construction, some birds may return to the region, but others especially

those that are more sensitive to human interference will migrate to other places.


4.5.4.3 Impact on soil environment

The impacts of the engineering construction on the soil environment will on the

aspects of soil salinization, soil erosion and soil desertification, etc.

(1) Soil salinization

At present, there is a common phenomenon of soil salinization surrounding the small

lakes along the highway line due to low groundwater level, over grazing and

numerous human activities. The destruction of vegetation along the line due to

engineering construction will deepen the salinization degree around the lakes. But

because the salinized soil along the line is small in area, the impact area resulted from

project construction will not be great compared with the whole project area.


(2) Soil desertification

The soil possibly impacted by the project would be to the east of the Hailar River in

the area from West Wuzhuer to Erka Wetland. The soil of this section is mostly sand

dark Castanozems soil with strong sandy characteristic. The over-grazing has made

the pasture vegetation at slight and medium degradation. After the destruction of

vegetation and top soil due to the engineering construction, the soil particles will be

brought away by wind erosion, with sandy matters remained in the earth surface, thus

forming desertification. There are also distributed sand dunes nearby the Hailar River

that are currently stabilized and semi-stabilized ones with good vegetation coverage.

The activities of road construction, earth excavation and bridge building, etc. will

destruct the sand dune vegetation, and probably mobilize these stabilized and semi-

stabilized sand dunes to form moving sand dunes. The wind erosion of 1ha bare sand

can affect 3ha grasslands nearby. The construction of this sub-section of highway may

aggravate the desertification trend. In addition to adopting grass grids to fix the sand

at the side ditches and side slopes of the highway, it is suggested that enclosed

cultivation of vegetation be implemented on the sand lands along the line and that

measures to protect the sand lands formulated, so as to alleviate the destruction of the

fragile local eco-environment and prevent land desertification.


According to the surveys, the soil water condition is good. Therefore, although there

exist conditions of soil desertification in the project area, so long as the top soil is not

destructed and grassland vegetation and sand land vegetation are well protected, the

highway construction will not lead to serious soil desertification and sand dune

mobilization.




                                                112

                   EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


(3) Soil erosion

The soil erosion from the engineering construction is supposed to occur at roadside

slopes, side slopes of earth borrowing yards and waste earth yards, and natural roads

on the gentle slopes and hillocks. In these areas, when the vegetation is seriously

destructed with bare soil exposed, the wind erosion will occur in drought and windy

spring days, and water erosion happen in rainy summer days. As the area does not

belong to serious water erosion area, there should be no major water erosion problem

as long as the vegetation protection on slopes is highlighted in the construction

procedure. However, the area belongs to serious wind erosion area, the earth

excavation and filling will lead to many bare lands, which may aggravate current soil

wind erosion along the line.


For the excavation of hills and hillocks and filling of roadbed earth at low lands, when

high steep slopes are formed on the roadsides, terraces will be required to be set up by

the constructors. When the slope is greater than 20m, one terrace with the width of

2.0m should be set up for each 10m. Collection terrace will be set up at the bottom of

the slope and water cut-off ditch at 5m to the top of the slope. The roadbed water

drainage facilities include side ditches, drainage ditches, cut-off ditches, swift ducts,

and seepage ditches, etc. When the longitudinal slope is greater than 4%, all the

surface drainage facilities should be consolidated by masonry sliced stones. When the

roadbed filling height is less than 4.0m, the slopes will be protected with grass

planting, and when the height is greater than 4.0m, the grass planting should be

combined with concrete grids. For Bayankuren-Huhenuoer section and Erka Wetland

section, masonry sliced stones will be adopted below the design water level. The road

trench slopes will be protected by masonry stonewalls, etc. All these measures can

effectively reduce the water erosion and wind erosion of the roads. It is suggested that

the constructors adopt section-by-section restoration method. This will implements

timely grass planting immediately after the construction of one highway section and

speed up the rehabilitation of the vegetation.


(4) Environmental impact of material yards, earth borrowing yards, waste earth yards

and Living Quarters for Construction

     There will be a total of earthwork of 8150682 m3, and stonework of 999362m3

for the proposed engineering. There will be set up one sand-gravel yard (see Table 2-

11, II-1), 2 self-exploring stone yards (see Table 2-11, IV-2 and IV-2), 9 earth-

borrowing yards and 2 waste earth yards (see Table 2-12), 8 Living Quarters for

Construction. No sensitive spots such as residences are found along the line from

earth borrowing yards and waste earth yards to highway.




                                                 113

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


The impacts of self-building material yards, earth borrowing yards, waste earth yards

and Living Quarters for Construction include:

a.   Occupying pastures in the Construction Period, causing a yield annual reduction

     of 245000kg fresh grass. After the end of construction, with the gradual

     rehabilitation of vegetation, the impact on pasture yield will gradually be reduced.

b. Destructing landforms and affecting the landscape along the line. The impact on

     the landscape will be small if the resources are reasonably exploited and land

     leveling and vegetation rehabilitation are properly carried out after the

     construction.

Destructing the vegetation and generating soil erosion.

There are 8 Living Quarters for Construction along the line, which are located at

K420+900, K426+000, K432+900, K477+700, K490+000, K544+900, K560+000,

K575+600B respectively according to the primary design. Because K544+900 is just

in Erka Wetland, after negotiating with the design unit, this encampment of

construction is moved to K538+750.

4.5.5 Ecological impact analysis in the Operation Period

4.5.5.1 Impact on animals

(1) Cutting off animal pathways

There are wild animals and domestic animals. The highway operation will cut off

pathways of some wild animals, and affect communication of species. Especially in

the section of K511+849~K549+949, which will be newly built in the grasslands and

wetlands, the highway may have some cut-off impacts on the communication of wild

animals. The main animals in the region are fish, amphibians and birds, and several

bridges and culverts will be built, therefore, the cut-off impact on the animals will be

small.


In the sections that utilize old highways, there is already cut-off on the animals. The

animals have got used to the cut-off of pathways. When the road is widened, the cut-

off degree will be increased. Therefore, the utilization of old roads will have less cut-

off impact on the animals. Because the large and medium wild animals along the

highway line are small in number, the highway as a barrier will not have major impact

on the migration of large and medium wild animals. Among the large and medium

mammals that are acting along the line are most domestic breeding animals, such as

horse, cow and sheep, etc., which activities can be guaranteed by setting up bridges

and culverts and specific passages to alleviate the negative impacts. In addition, the

impact on the domestic animals may become less when they get used to the new

environment in some time.


                                                114

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway




(2) Doing harm to animals

According to on-site investigation, many groups of Melanocorypha mongolica are

currently flying over or resting on the roads, and are liable to striking by the vehicles.

Because the proposed highway is of Class I and the design running speed is 100km/h,

the rapid vehicles have high possibility of striking the flying or resting birds. Also the

possibility that some small reptiles and rodents are rolled to death when they cross the

highway is high.


(3) Surprising wild animals

After operation of the highway, the traffic noise will permanently affect the animals

nearby. The noise from the running vehicles can directly scare and disturb the birds

and other animals in the region, having certain impact on their habitation and

breeding. This may force the animals to flee away from the region, resulting in

reduction of animal varieties and quantities along the line. In the wetland and lake

areas through which the highway goes, the birds are concentrated, and there are in

particular many national protective birds. The running vehicles could seriously affect

the habitation and activities of them. It is suggested that marks of prohibiting sound

horns set up at the highway section, so as to reduce the scaring and disturbing of the

wild animals.


4.5.5.2 Impact of land use patterns change on mini climate

The operation of the project will thoroughly change the land use patterns in the

project line area, making the underlying surface of original grasslands and wetlands

obviously changed. The increase of surface roughness and decrease of grassland and

wetland area will change local surface temperature. The highway surface will absorb

more radioactive energy from the sun, and the vehicles will charge more heat and

gases. This will result in some heat island effect on the highway and the temperature

of the highway surface will be 3~8ºC higher than that of grassland surface. However,

because there are the Moergele River, the Hailar River, the Huhenuoer River and Erka

Wetland, etc. nearby the highway line, the wetland area is large with and much

evaporation, the adjustment ability of mini climate in the project line area is strong,

and thus the humidity and temperature of the mini climate will not change obviously.

4.5.6 Impact of species intrusion

The proposed project line starts at Hailar District and ends at Manzhouli City.

Manzhouli is an important port; foreign species transferred through international

shipping will first arrive at this port. These foreign species may establish the their

own communities if the environment is suitable and begin to disseminate afterwards.




                                                115

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


The foreign species carried on the vehicles may settle and disseminate along the sides

of the highway.


The foreign species often have harmful impact on the system and structure of the

ecosystem, and endanger the local species, especially rare and endangered ones,

causing the loss of biodiversity. Some foreign species can even bring about huge harm

to local society and economy.


At present, the foreign species are often introduced into China by the following ways:

intentional introduction, unintentional introduction with human activity, introduction

with other animal and plant species, introduction by tourists, and natural importation.

In order to avoid harmful impact from foreign species introduction, preventive and

control measures should be adopted (see Section 8.2.5).


4.6 Solidwaste Environmental Impact Analysis


4.6.1 Construction Period

Based on the engineering analysis, the solidwastes generated from the proposed

project will be mainly from the Construction Period, with the following kinds:

engineering construction waste earth, building garbage, and living garbage of the

constructors.


(1) Construction waste earth

According to the accounting of earthwork of this project in the engineering analysis,

the project will require net import of earth, with the earth filling greater than the earth

excavation. In order to avoid ecological impact by plenty of earth excavation, the

earthwork within the project should be balanced. There is finally a problem of waste

earth. Two waste earth yards will be set up which sites in low-relief area. Their

locations are indicated in Figure2-8. Before the siting of waste earth yards,

notifications to the local residents, government and negotiations with the public have

been put into effect. The local residents and government agreed the site selections of

the waste earth yards, and the waste earth yards have passed professional

examination.


The accounting of earthwork of the project is shown in table 4-6-1.


           Table 4-6-1 Earthwork Accounting of the Proposed Project Unit: 1000 m3

                 EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


   Item          Excavation        Earth filling               Waste earth       Waste stone

 Quantity          35.735               341.638                 103.027           115.909



According to the environmental protection measures requirements, the waste earth

should be timely compacted, covered with vegetation and conserved by necessary

protective engineering. By doing this, the ecological impact will be small.


(2) Living and building garbage

The living garbage of the constructors refers to various solidwastes from living places

of the constructors, including food wastes, residues, food packaging materials, etc.

The per capita living garbage is calculated at 1.0Kg/d. The building garbage mainly

refers to removal wastes along the highway line, waste earth and stone during road

breaking, and waste materials in the construction procedure, etc.


The amount of living and building garbage produced from this project during the

Construction Period will be small. They will have no negative impacts on the

vegetation and land uses after the end of construction, if properly disposed.

4.6.2 Operation Period

The solidwastes in the Operation Period mainly come from living garbage generated

from the staff active areas in the Service Area and other service facilities.


The project will set up one service area, with small amount of solidwastes. The impact

of the solidwastes on the surrounding environment will be very small if adopting

proper pollution control measures (e.g. central collation and periodical clearance). See

Section 8.3.6 for detailed measures.

4.6.3 Summary

(1) Environmental protection measures will be adopted and necessary protective

    engineering set up for waste earth yards in the Construction Period.

(2) There will be very small amount of living and construction garbage in the

    Construction Period, and there will be no negative impacts on the vegetation and

    land uses, etc. after the end of the construction.

(3) In the Operation Period, environmental sanitation departments will clear the

    garbage on both sides of the highway, and the impact of the solidwastes on the

    surroundings will be very small.

4.7 Pollution Risk Analysis for Dangerous Goods


After the highway is put into operation, there will be possibility of traffic accidents.

For the vehicles loaded with toxic, harmful, inflammable or explosive matters, in

particular, once the traffic accident happens, the impact on the environment will be

great. Considering that the risk of dangerous goods transportation is the emergency of

traffic accidents, it can be prevented through certain management measures. In order

to timely control possible occurrence of accidents, fire control institutions should be

set up with professional personnel and monitoring instruments equipped, in order to

timely eliminate and control the pollution. The transport units should strictly abide by

national and sectoral norms and procedures on the transportation of the dangerous

goods, equip the transport vehicles with preventive measures and necessary facilities,

and normalize the labeling. It is important to train the practitioners with professional

techniques and perform traffic safety education for the drivers. Once the traffic

accident occurs for a dangerous goods vehicle, it should be timely informed to fire

control and environmental protection departments. Major pollution accidents from

traffic accidents should be reported level by level to national administrations. The risk

of transportation of dangerous goods in this project will be small if adopting proper

measures.


4.8 Accumulative and Indirect Impact Analysis


4.8.1 Accumulative impacts

The highway network in the proposed project area is shown in table 4-8-1 and Figure

4-8-1. The main environmental problems of the network construction include: social

environmental impact, water environmental impact, ambient air impact, noise

environment impact and ecological impact in both construction and operation periods.


Adopting corresponding environmental protection measures can minimize the

environmental impacts of the network construction. The network projects will occupy

a land area of 405.27ha. Considering that the network will be constructed on the base

of existing natural roads or sand gravel roads, the new occupation of land will be

small. The roads will be dispersive, and the accumulative impacts will be small.

4.8.2 Indirect impacts

The construction of the proposed project will lead to change of industrial structure

and economic types in the project area and finally bring about indirect impacts on the

regional environment.


Considering that it is difficult to determine the spatial and temporal scopes and

quantitative impact results in the EIA, this EIA only performs analysis in combination

with current economic types and future industrial structure.


The current bearing capacity of State Highway 301 is low and cannot guarantee and

meet with requirements of the safe pass of large freight cars. The construction of

Hailar-Manzhouli Section will provide a speedy and safe transportation passage for

the locality. The possible beneficial enterprises or enterprise groups include:

Manzhouli Import Timber Processing Industrial Estate, Changfu Group, Zalainuoer

Coal Mining Company, Fulun Paper Company and Chenming Paper Company, Non-

ferrous Metal Mineral Resources Development Project of Xinbaerhu Qi, and Hailar

Vegetables and Fruits Export Production Base. The basic situations of the beneficial

enterprises are as follows.


(1) Manzhouli Import Timber Processing Industrial Estate

50% import goods from Manzhouli Port are timber. Manzhouli Import Timber

Process Industrial Estate has now more than 10 timber processing enterprises. 50% of

the timber products and semi-products are sold to Dalian and Tianjin for export. The

process wastes or by-products are transported to Zalantun and other places to serve as

raw materials for pulp production. Most of the products are transported outside by

roads.


(2) Changfu Group

Changfu Group has invested in Chen Qi to produce liquid milk, with most of the

products sold to Russia, Mongolia and inland, and part of the products sold to

Southeast Asia.

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway




(3) Zalainuoer Coal Mining Company

Zalainuoer Coal Mining Company produces fluid oil and other products, most of

which are sold to Hailar District and other areas farther than Hailar.


(4) Fulun Paper Company and Chenming Paper Company

Fulun Paper Company produces shopping bags. Chenming Paper Company mainly

produces cultural paper.


(5) Non-ferrous Metal Mineral Resources Development Project of Xinbaerhu Qi,

The project produces silver, lead, zinc and mineral powder. The products are mainly

sold to inland areas.


(6) Hailar Vegetables and Fruits Export Production Base

The base mainly engages in process, storage and preservation of vegetables and fruits.


In addition, the improvement of regional traffic conditions will be favorable to absorb

new investments and new enterprises.


The improvement of the transport and communication will provide good conditions

for the above enterprises. While the expansion of the enterprises is implemented, new

environmental problems will be generated, and total pollutant discharge increased.


It is suggested that the new building and expanding of the enterprises in the project

area should strictly implement the system of EIA, to ensure the pollutant discharge in

compliance with the standards. The current water quality of the Hailar River in the

drought period is serious; the comprehensive control plan has been developed. The

water quality will be obviously improves as various treatment projects have been

initiated in succession.


As about 13km of the road will be built passing across the erka wet land, the building

of the road will naturally benefit the development activities at the fringe of the

wetland. The development may not directly reduce the area of the wetland, but it will

surely impact the function of the wetland, will reduce the activity area of animals in

wetland. Strictly policy must be made by the government to restrain the development.

This policy will cover the protected scope of the wetland. No development is allowed

within the scope. Limited requirement will also be given to the development at the

fringe of the wetland to ensure the environment impact is acceptable. As known, this

policy is under planning nowadays.

4.9 Traffic Safety Analysis


The current highway from Hailar (north) to Manzhouli (port) is about 206km, with

90% being Class III highway. The pavement structure is under bituminous surface

treatment, and the bearing capacity is insufficient. After nearly 10 years of operation

and impacted by destruction of catastrophic flood in 1998, the highway has had

serious diseases such as pavement ageing, depression and net crack, etc., with weak

anti-disaster capacity and poor service level as a whole, difficult to guarantee the

passage safety of large goods vehicles, especially in the spring. With the economic

development and ever increasing of urbanization, there are a total of 20km highway

sections within Bayankuren (capital of Chen Qi), Zalainuoer Mineral Area and

Manzhouli City, having formed streets in urban areas. In addition, the crosswise

interference along the current highway line is less, the running speed is fast and the

pavement is relatively narrow, and vicious traffic accidents have happens frequently.

The statistics of traffic accidents at Hailar-Manzhouli of State Highway 301 in 1998 ­

2002 is shown in Table 4-9-1.

CHAPTER 5 ERKA WETLAND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
ASSESSMENT
Erka Wetland is located within Hulunbeier City, Inner Mongolia, with east longitude of

117 45 ~118 16 and north latitude 49 17 ~49 41 . The total area is 52800 ha.


5.1 Erka Wetland Current Status Assessment


5.1.1 Landform

The landform of Erka Wetland is mainly comprised of lakeshore plain, alluvial plain, river

flood plain, sand land and sand hill, high plain, etc. The lakeshore alluvial plain is distributed in

the south of the region. The two sides of Binzhou Railway are river alluvial plain by the Hailar

River, which are then submerged by Dalai Lake water and transformed into flat area with sand

as the main content. The alluvial plain is mainly distributed in the wide delta formed by the

Erguna River and the Hailar River and the flat area on the east side of the Erguna River, being

sandy plain areas. The landform of river flood plain is mainly distributed nearby the

Dalan'eluomu River, with low relief and developed marsh. The sand land and sand hill are

mainly distributed in the south part of the area, the north side of the Hailar River, and the

northeast part of Cuogang Pasture. The sand land to the north of the Hailar River is within

alluvial plain of the Hailar River. The sand dunes and sand hills are distributed in belt pattern,

mostly stabilized by vegetation; the edges have obvious sand hills with low vegetation

coverage. The high plain landform is only distributed at Haolinte Hill (or named Tuweiba

Mountain) on the north side of Binzhou Railway.

5.1.2 Soil

The soil in the area includes mainly salinized meadow soil, salinized Castanozems soil,

meadow bog soil, alkalized meadow soil, meadow alkali soil, meadow Castanozems soil,

alkalized Castanozems soil, Aeolian soil, and sandy Castanozems soil.


In the areas to the south of Binzhou Railway and the west of the Xinkai River are mainly

salinized meadow soil, scattered with salinized Castanozems soil and meadow bog soil. The

northern area to the east of the Xinkai River is mainly alkalized meadow soil, scattered with

meadow alkali soil. In the southern area with high relief, there are mainly distributed meadow

Castanozems soil, salinized Castanozems soil and alkalized Castanozems soil. On the north side

of the Hailar River, are mainly sandy Castanozems soil and Aeolian soil. The river flood plain

have mainly meadow soil and bog soil.

5.1.3 Hydrology

The main rivers in the region are the Hailar River, the Erguna River and the Xinkai River. The

Hailar River originates from the west foot of Jieleqilaoshan of Daxinganling Mountains in the



                                                     125

Yakeshi City. It flows from east to west, accepting the water from other rivers along the line,

and into Hunlunbeier Highland when nearby Yakeshi. When flowing near to Abagaitu

Mountain in the north of Zalainuoer, it merges with the Dalan'eluomu River, and turns

direction to the northeast. This is then called the Erguna River.


The small lakes in the area are mainly distributed in the terrace on the north side of the Hailar

River and the east side of the Erguna River. The lakes are parallel to each other, and vertical to
the Erguna River. There are more than 10 lakes with the area of over 1km2, including Benpo

Lake, Yihenuoer, Chagannuoer, and Galute, etc. In addition, there are also some seasonal lakes

along the Hailar River and the Erguna River.

5.1.4 Landscape ecology patterns

Erka Wetland landscape is mainly comprised of wetland landscape and sand wetland landscape.


5.1.4.1 Wetland landscape

Wetland landscape is the most important landscape in Erka Wetland. The wetland ecosystem

includes the Hailar River, the Erguna River, flooding lands and surrounding lakes. A large area

of river-type, marsh- type and lake-type wetland is formed at the joint of the Hailar River and

the Erguna River. The wetland is continuously distributed, with large area and less patches. The

wetland has rich aquatic vegetation, marsh vegetation, meadow vegetation and salinized

meadow vegetation, etc., with integrated ecosystem structure and normal ecological functions.

It has been the settling, breeding and migration habitat of birds, as well as the a major stop for

the migration of birds. The animal and plant diversity and landscape diversity here are high.

The wetland landscape can be classified by vegetation form and wetland type into riverbank

shrub forest wetland landscape, reed marsh landscape, reed and weeds marsh wetland

landscape, salinized meadow landscape, river wetland, and lake wetland, , river and lake

lowland salina.


(1) Riverbank shrub forest wetland landscape

Riverbank shrub forest wetland landscape is mainly distributed in the flooding plain to the north

of the Hailar River, and on the two sides of the Erguna River. It is the main landscape type in

Erka Wetland, distributing in narrow belt and crumby form among the flooding wetland and

sand dunes along the rivers. Beyond the riverbank shrub forest wetland on the north side of the

Hailar River, are sandy shrubs and then Stipa krylovii grassland, with the main vegetation of

Salix microstachya var. bordensis (Nakai) C.F.Fang.


(2) Reed marsh landscape

Reed marsh wetland is mainly found on the wide river flooding plains to the south of the Hailar

River, ranging from Erka Guard to the east of Tuweiba Mountain. It is distributed in crumby

form in the river and lake dense areas, and has a distribution of single dominant species to the



                                                     126

                      EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



north side of Tuweiba Mountain. The area has dense reed and wide water area, with good

conditions for the breeding of birds. However, the over-fishing has resulted in negative impact

on the inhabitation and breeding of birds. The main plant type is reed community, and there are

also submerged aquatic vegetation, floating aquatic vegetation, marsh vegetation, and other

kinds of vegetation.


(3) Reed and weeds marsh wetland landscape

The reed and weed meadow is distributed mainly in three major lots. The first lot is located to

the south of Binzhou Railaway and to the east of Zalainuoer. The second lot is located to the

north of Binzhou Railway and to the south of the Hailar River. The third lot is located to the

north of Cuogang Pasture. These three lots all have large-area reed and weed meadows

continuously distributed, with flat and wide topology, and are important pastures.


(4) Salinized meadow landscape

The salinized meadow landscape is mainly distributed in the numerous lakes and lakeshore

lowlands to the north of the Hailar River and to the east of the Erguna River. The salinized

meadow vegetation is mainly comprised of mesophytic perennial grasses.


(5) River landscape

The main river landscapes include the Hailar River, the Erguna River and the Xinkai River, etc.

The Hailar River belongs to the downstream river in the region. It is called the Erguna River at

Abagaitu. The Xinkai River interlinks the Hailar River and Dalai Lake. The Erguna River is the

border river between China and Russia. The Hailar River and the Erguna River are most

important surface water bodies in the region, with rich water, and wide and deep stream channel

and sailing courses. There grows mainly Salix micranthus on both sides of the rivers, with good

natural conditions.


5.1.4.2 Sand Landscape

The sand landscape is widely distributed. One sand ribbon lies on the alluvial plain to the north

of the Hailar River and is parallel to the Hailar River. Another sand ribbon lies to the south of

the Hailar River and is also parallel to the Hailar River, being the west end of Hailar Sand

Ribbon. In the sand landscape, bare sand land and stabilized and semi-stabilized sand land are

inter-distributed. The patches are numerous in number and the landscape has high degree of

fragmentation. According to vegetation type and landform composition, the sand landscape can

be classified into three types, i.e. sand Mongolian scotch pine landscape, sand shrub forest

landscape, and bare sand landscape.


(1) Sand Mongolian scotch pine landscape

Sand Mongolian scotch pine landscape is only distributed on the sand lands on the north side of

the Hailar River, about 1km to Cuogang Pasture. It has the characteristics of the grassland, with



                                                    127

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



high degree of closing. The shrub vegetation and grassland vegetation are developed.


Sand Mongolian scotch pine (pinus sylvestris var mogolica) was once distributed very wide on

this sand land in the previous days. Duo to cutting and over-grazing, the                 sand Mongolian

scotch pines have basically disappeared in this area, despite for some lots on the west side of

Hailar Sand Ribbon.


(2) Sand shrub forest landscape

Sand shrub forest landscape is widely distributed on both sides of the Hailar River, basically in

the continuous form, but also with fragmental patches. The area has fluctuating sand dune

landform, with well-grown sand shrub forest and sandy herbaceous plants. As the area has high

groundwater level, relatively humid climate, natural rehabilitation of vegetation in the sand

lands as well as stabilization of sand is possible, as long as over-grazing is controlled.


(3) Bare sand landscape

There is not much bare sand landscape in the region. It is concentrated on the sand ribbons

nearby Cuogang Pasture and on the south side of the Hailar River, basically distributed

continuously. It is generally inter-distributed with sand shrub forest landscape. The patches are

numerous and fragmental and basically distributed on semi-stabilized sand ribbons. The annual

herbaceous plants on the sand lands are basically eaten by cows and sheep, making the sand

dunes difficult to be stabilized. The main plant types on the bare sand ribbons are annual

herbaceous plants, such as Agriophyllum pungens, Corispermum and Xanthium sibiricum

Patrin ex Widder.

5.1.5 Plant resources

5.1.5.1 Compositions of phytogroups

Based on the survey on Erka Wetland, there have been found 257 species vascular plants,

respectively belonging to 57 families and 165 genera. Among the plants, there are 1 family, 1

genus and 2 species of ferns; 2 families, 2 genera and 2 species of gymnosperms; and others

(angiosperms). The number of Gramineae species is maximum (38 species), with Compositae,

Leguminosae, Rosaceae and Ranunculaceae next to it. The genus of Artemisia has maximum

number of species (12 species), and the genera of Potentilla, Carex, Allium, Polygonum and

Poa have 6~9 species respectively.

The life-form compositions of the plant in the area include needle-leaved evergreen trees,

broad-leaved summer-green trees, shrubs, semi-shrubs, perennial herbs, and annual and biennial

herbs. The number of each species is as follows: perennial herbs (171 species, 66.54%), annual

and biennial herbs (67 species, 26.07%), trees (2 species), shrubs (10 species), and semi-shrubs

(7species).


The water ecological types are divided into water borne, hygric, humid mesophytic,

mesophytic, drought mesophytic, medium xerophytic, and xerophytic. The mesophytic plants

are richest with 85 species. This, in addition to humid mesophytic and drought mesophytic

types accounts for 45.13% of the total.


There are a proportion of 56.81% of Pan Arctic, Palearctic and East Palearctic speciesin the

area, indicating the characteristics of wetland vegetation. There are 24.9% grassland floras

mainly with Dawuli-Mongolia species, which have been the main composition of grassland

plants. There are also a proportion of East Asia and Europe-Siberia species. These indicate that

broad-leaved forests of East Asia and Lingbei forests also affect the vegetation in this area.

Therefore, the plant flora composition is complex.


There are 164 species of medicinal plants, including 32 species of common Chinese medicines.

There are also 45 species of good meadows, 27 grasses (Gramineae), 16 fancy species, and 21

edible wild plants.

5.1.5.2 Overview of vegetation

Erka Wetland is not only large in area, but also with good conservation and diverse types. The

wetland vegetations include hydraulic, marsh and meadow plants with 44 communities. Typical

grassland vegetations are represented by Stipa grandis, and there are also two degradation

systems, i.e. Stipa krylovii grassland and Gymnocarpus frigida grassland. Sandy land

vegetations are plant complex of grass shrub area, semi-shrub area, forest and wetland. There

are 5 sand grassland communities, 3 semi-shrubbery communities, 3 sand shrub communities,

and Pinus sylvestris.

5.1.6 Wild animal resources

There is a record of 226 species of wild animals (vertebrates) in Erka Wetland, including 37

fishes, 10 amphibians and reptiles, 38 mammals and 141 birds.


(1) Fish and amphibians and reptiles

The water systems in the assessment area include the Hailar River, the Moergele River, the

Xinkai River, Huhenuoer Lake, Benpo Lake and Erzi Lake. There are found 37 species of wild

fish in the water system in the project area, belonging to 5 orders and 9 families, respectively

being 3 families in Cypriniformes order (Cyprinidae, Cobitidae, Siluridae), Salmoiformes order

(Salmonidae, Esocidae), Gadidae family of Cadiformes order, Petromyzonidae family of

Petromyzoniformes, and Perciformes order (Eleoyridae,Channidae). The Cyprinidae family of

Cypriniformes order is absolutely dominant. Except 2 species of Salmonidae family,2 species

of Siluridae family, 3 species of Cobitidae family, 1 species of Channidae family and 1 species

of Esocidae family, others all belong to Cyprinidae families.


The habitats in the assessment area are comprised of grasslands, rivers, lakes and sand dunes.

According to the survey data, 5 species of amphibians, including Rana amurensis, Rana

nigromaculata, Salamandrella keyserlingi, Bufo raddei and Rana chensinensis, are found and

widely distributed in the assessment area. In some hillocks, Bufo gargarizans is also found.

Reptiles are mainly distributed in sand dunes, including Eremias argus, Takydromus amurensis

and, Lacerta vivipara, but with small numbers. There are two species of snakes, i.e. Elaphe

dione and Agkistrodon ussuriensis.


(2) Mammals

There are 6 orders, 14 families and 38 species of mammals. Because the assessment area is

mainly grassland and wetland landscape, the mammals are mainly with small ones and no large

carnivorous and herbivorous animals. Among the 38 species of mammals, Rodentia and

Carnivora orders have most species, accounting for more than one half. Insectivora and

Chiropiera orders are next to them. The main mammals include Hemiechinus dauuricus,

Ochotona Daurica, Marmota bobak, Meriones unguiculatus, Microtus brandti, and Vulpes



                                                     130

corsac, etc. In addition, some national Class II key protective animals, such as Procapra

gutturosa, Lutra lutra and Otocolobus manul, are seldom seen currently, duo to human

interference and over-hunting.


(3) Bird resources

The birds in the assessment area belong to east grassland sub-area, Mongolia-Xinjiang area of

Palaeoarctic realm, with typical species of east grasslands settle and breed here. These species

include Anser anser, Cygnus Cygnus, Tadorna ferruginea, Anthropoides uirgo, Otis tarda,

Syrrhaptes paradoxus, and Melanocorypha mongolica, etc. Because the area is neighbored with

Daxing'anling Mountains sub-area, some representive species in Daxing'anling sub-area have

soaked into Erka Wetland. In addition, some species in Changbai Mountain sub-area have

disseminated to the north. Some summer migratory birds are also found. This decided that the

birds here have the characteristics of both Mongolia-Xinjiang area and northeast area. The main

body of the birds is comprised of summer migratory birds and resident birds.


Among the 141 species of birds recorded in the project area, palearctic species and dispersed

species account for 61% and 39% respectively. If classified by ecological patterns, water fouls

account for 47.5%, Non-Passeriformes 73.8%, and prey birds 10.6%.


Among 141 species of birds, there are 6 species of national Class I key protective birds, i.e.

Grus leucogernaus, Grus japonensis, Grus monacha, Otis tarda, Ciconia ciconia and Ciconia

nigra. There are 6 species of national Class II key protective birds, i.e. Platal leucorodla,

Cygnus cygnus Cygnus, C. columbianus, Aquila rapax, Aquila heliaca, Milvus migrans, Buteo

hemilasius, Buteo buteo, Buteo lagopus, Aegypius monachus, Circus cyaneus, Circus

aeruginosus, Circus cyaneus, Pandion haliaetus

Falco cherrug, Falco rusticolus, Falco peregrinus, Falco amurensis, Falco tinnunculus, Grus

grus, Grus uipio, Anthropoides uirgo, Numenius borealis, Nyctea scandiaca, Athene noctua and

Asio flammeus.


1) Seasonal distribution of birds

The migratory birds account for absolutely most of the birds in the assessment area. According

to statistics, the number of migratory and non-migratory (resident) birds respectively accounts

for 91.5% and 8.5% of all the birds. Because the area is wide in territory and scarce in

population, and has rich baits, the summer migratory birds have the biggest proportion (about

68%), the travel birds have the proportion of 21%or so, and others are winter migratory birds

and resident birds.


2) Ecological geographic distribution

There three kinds of birds in the assessment area, i.e. water fowls, birds of prey and singing

bird. According to habitat types, it can be discussed as follows.



                                                     131

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway




a. Water sheds

Swimming bird is typical bird type in the habitat. The Aythya fullgula, Cygnus Cygnus, Anas

cygnoides, Aythya ferina, and Tadorna ferruginea, etc. are acting in the watershed, mainly

distributed in the shore environment of the water wetlands such as Huhenuoer Lake, Erzi Lake,

Benpo Lake and the Morigele River, etc.


b. Lakeshore and river-shore marshes

The water fowls are main representatives in this habitat, although there are some swimming

fowls (river ducks) and near-water Passeriformes order birds. Common species are: Grus

leucogeranus, Grus japonensis, Grus grus, Ardea cinerea rectirostis, Platal leucorodla, Vanellus

vanellus, Anser anser, and some river ducks and Motacilla, etc. These kinds of habitats have

no bankers, are with shallow water, and are generally sinker marshes.


c. Reed and willow shrub forest marshes

The ecological birds composition is most complex, because there are not only the feeding

places but also breeding and sheltering sites. The swimming fowls include: Anas

poecilorhyncha zonorhyncha, Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos, Cygnus, Anas cygnoides,

Anser anser, etc. The water fowls include: Grus leucogernaus, Grus japonensis,Grus monacha,

Grus monacha, Grus uipio, Ardea cinerea rectirostis, Ardea purpurea manilensis, Botaurus

stellaris, and Capella megama, etc. Other birds include: Locustella, Panurus biarmicus, Circus

cyaneus, and Asio flammeus, etc.


d. Grassland

The typical birds are Melanocorypha mongolica, Eremophila alpestris, Alauda arvensis,

Charadrius, Oenanthe oenanthe, Otis tarda, Anthropoides uirgo, Buteo hemilasius, Aquila

rapax, and Buteo lagopus, etc.


e. Sand dune shrubs

This habitat is distributed nearby Cuogang Pasture, mainly with sand dunes and having some

shrubs. The reprehensive birds are Lanius collurio, Cuculus canorus, Caprimulgus indicus,

Perdix dauurica, and Riparia riparia, etc.


f. Residences

This kinds of habitats include residential areas and nearby farmlands. The main species are

some human-accompanying species, such as tree sparrow, house sparrow, Petronia petronia,

Hirundo rustica, Hirundo daurica, Apus apus, Pica pica, Upupa epops, and Corvus, etc.


g. Ice covered lakes in the winter

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



In the winter nearby ice-covered rivers, lakes or ice eyes, there are Nyctea scandiaca and other

birds finding food.


3) Migration and grouping of birds

Because the area is the important dak for migrating water fowls in Northeast Asia and

Australia, and considering that there is large area of well-developed wetland ecosystem, the

migratory birds are the main bird composition in the assessment area.


a. Winter migratory birds

The winter migratory birds stay here from October each year until May next year. Among the

winter migratory birds, the migration of Nyctea scandiaca and Buteo lagopus, etc. is sporadic,

while that of Calcarius lapponicus, Plectrophenax nivalis, and Cardurlis hornemanni is

grouping.


b. Traveling birds and summer migratory birds

Traveling birds and summer migratory birds account for most of the migratory birds. Main

traveling birds include: Numenius borealis, Calidris temminckii, Calidris ruficollis, Anas acuta

acuta, Aythya fullgula, etc. They are all grouping migration.


The migration of summer migratory birds has the following characteristics: despite that some

migrate here for breeding, a good many stop for a short time and will continue to fly to the

north. Examples are Cygnus, Anatidae and many cranes.


5.2 Erka Wetland Environmental Impact Analysis


5.2.1 Impact on ecological integrity of wetland

The wetland in the region is concentrated with distribution of biodiversity. The special

conditions of the wetland are essential conditions for the living of water fowls and fish. The

wetland also plays irreplaceable roles in self-restraining water source, purifying water quality,

controlling soil desertification and salinization, preventing flood disasters, and maintaining the

stability of ecosystem, etc.


The main impacts of the highway construction on the wetland are reducing the area of wetland

by going through the wetland; decreasing the connectivity of the wetland.


The perturbation of construction machineries and constructors and the discharge of the

pollutants in the Construction Period will disturb the structure and function of wetland

ecosystem in the construction area, pollute the water body, destruct and disturb the wetland

vegetation and soil. The perturbed scope of soil is basically within 50~100m along the highway.




                                                     133

                        EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



Suppose that the impact area is within 200m on both sides of the highway, the total impact area

will be 528ha, or 0.62% of the total area of Erka Wetland.


The following alleviation measures are adopted in project design:

  The line has to go through Erka Wetland due to the limitation of local geographical position.

The shortest route, which divided the wetland into two parts, has been chosen in the design

stage, and there will not be any other highways in Erka Wetland.

  Bridges will be set up over all the rivers (ditches), which have water in drought seasons, and

some culverts will be built. On the basis of Feasibility Study, 1 big ­sized bridge and 3 middle-

sized bridges are added, and the original big-sized bridge will be lengthened by 20%.

  Rubbles with diameter 10-30cm will be blanketed in the underside of the roadbed in the

highway section with soft earth and silts.



5.2.2 Impact on vegetation

The scope of perturbation on the wetland vegetation and soil by temporary land occupation of

the proposed highway will be within 50~100m along the line. The resuspended dust from

earthwork and stonework excavation and from vehicle transportation will naturally deposit on

the leaf blades of surrounding plants, block the leaf stoma, affect respiration and photosynthesis

of the plants. The construction machinery exhaust contains NOx and other gases, which can the

destruct of leaf tissues of sensitive plants and cause discoloration and harm spots. The

construction resuspended dust and tail gas can only influence the plant growth in the current

year. This is short-term and reversible impact. After the end of construction, the vegetation of

temporary land occupation begins rehabilitation; the topsoils will be recovered on roadside

ditches, side slopes and earth borrowing surface, as the project design requires. This will

facilitate rehabilitation of vegetation. The impact of construction temporary land occupation

will disappear when the vegetation is restored to be consistent with surrounding vegetation.


The plant communities of the same ecological characteristics are maintained on the south and

north sides of the project line. Therefore, the project line will not have obstacle impact on

regional plant migration basically, unable to cause the decay of regional plant population. The

perturbation scope on wetland vegetation will be within 50~100m of the project line. Suppose

that the impact area is within 100m on both sides of the highway, the total impact area will be

264ha, or 0.31% of the total area of Erka Wetland.

5.2.3 Impact on wild animals

The animal resources in the project area are mainly fish, amphibians and reptiles, mammals and

wild birds.




                                                      134

                        EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



5.2.3.1 Construction Period

(1) Fish, amphibians and reptiles

During the Construction Period , the construction of bridges will have direct unfavorable impact

on the varieties and quantities of amphibians, reptiles and fish along the line, making them

migrate to surrounding areas with less interference and adapt to and live in the new

environment.


(2) Mammals

In the region of Erka Wetland, there are few large and medium wild animals. The construction

of the highway during the Construction Period may affect the ways of migration, scope of

feeding and the habits, but as the large and medium mammals have been few, the impact of

highway construction on them should be low.


(3) Birds

The mechanical noise, human activities and vegetation destruction in the Construction Period

will all affect the habitation and breeding of birds in the construction zones and nearby areas,

making obvious change of varieties and species of the birds in the region. The construction of

bridges and highway will seriously destruct the habitats of the birds in the area. The occupation

and destruction of habitats, human activities and construction noise, etc. will directly fright and

disturb the birds in the area, force them to avoid the construction zone and migrate to other

places. In addition, the bridge construction, grouting and piling, and river cut-off, etc. can bring

quantities of soil into the water body, leading to the increase of water turbidity nearby the

construction area and the deterioration of water quality. The aquatic organisms in the lakes and

then part of the waterfowls may be affected, due to the food chains. However, this impact is

only in short term, the quality will be gradually restored, and the impact will be gradually

eliminated after the end of construction.


5.2.3.2 Operation period

(1) Fish

The highway line will go through the wetland for a length of 13.2 km. According to local

hydrological conditions, 8 big and medium bridges and some culverts will be set up. The

bridges will adopt circular piers to reduce the obstruction on the water flow. The design flow

area of the bridge accounts for 94~95% of the total length of bridge. It will have no obvious

negative impact on the hydrology at the wetland section, and thus only have small impact on

the fish.


(2) Amphibians and reptiles

The amphibians and reptiles are widely distributed in the project area, and their own activity

scope is small. The bridges and culverts built over the rivers and ditches in the wetland area can

serve as the passage of the amphibians and reptiles for their inter-communication. Therefore,



                                                      135

                        EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



the operation of the project will not lead to the migration obstacle of activities of the

amphibians and reptiles and the resulted species decay.


(3) Mammals

There are a very small number of large and medium wild animals along the highway line.

Among the large and medium mammals that are acting along the line are most domestic

breeding animals, such as horse, cow and sheep, etc., which activities can be guaranteed by

setting up bridges and culverts and specific passages to alleviate the negative impacts. In

addition, the impact on the domestic animals may become less when they get used to the new

environment in some time.


(4) Wild birds

After operation of the highway, the traffic noise will permanently affect the animals nearby.

The noise from the running vehicles can directly scare and disturb the birds and other animals

in the region, having certain impact on their habitation and breeding. This may force some birds

to flee away from the region, resulting in reduction of animal varieties and quantities along the

line. The bird impact is within the scope of 100m along the highway, the impact area about

264ha, or 0.5% of the total wetland area.


It is suggested that marks of prohibiting sound horns set up at the highway section, so as to

reduce the scaring and disturbing of the wild animals.

5.2.4 Impact on Hydrology

The highway goes through Erka Wetland on the north side of Zalainuoer Mineral Area at K540-

K553. The main rivers in the area are the Hailar River and the Xinkai River.

(1) The Hailar River

The design flooding frequency for the bridge spanning over the Hailar River is flood in a

century (extra big flood in 1998). Considering the error in the calculation, the length of bridge

is increased by 20%, i.e. setting up a 480m bridge, with 24~20m.


(2) The Xinkai River

The highway section that crosses the Xinkai River is located at the intersection of the river and

lake, with large water surface. Considering that the project should not reduce the water surface

and is able to split part of water flow of the Hailar River, the length of 620m is set for the

bridge.


(3) Wetland

The low relief of the wetland section can lead to the confluence of the Hailar River and the

Xinkai River at the wetland. In order to facilitate interchange of the waters on both sides of the

roadbed, in addition to respectively set up bridges over the Hailar River and the Xinkai River,



                                                      136

                      EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



bridges will also be set up over the rivers and ditches that have water during the drought

seasons. The spans will be properly longer. The total length of the bridges is 1640m, accounting

for 12.4% of the total length of this section. Besides, about 10 culvert are set within the wetland

as additional measure. These briges and culverts can meet with the flood drainage requirements

of the Hailar River and the Xinkai River. Refer to Table 5-2 and Figure 5-1.

0.035% of the total wetland area.


(2) Analysis of quality

Dalai Lake Wetland is a wetland ecosystem with the main components of lake, river, marsh,

shrub and reed pond formed by Dalai Lake water system. It has 9 species of national Class I

protective birds, and 43 national Class II protective birds.


Huihe Wetland is a wetland ecosystem comprised of the Huihe River and numerous small

lakes. It has 8 species of national Class I protective birds, and 28 national Class II protective

birds.


Erka Wetland is comprised of the Hailar River, the Xinkai River, river flooding land and

surrounding lakes. It has 6 species of national Class I protective birds, and 26 national Class II

protective birds.


Compared with Dalai Lake wetland and Huihe Wetland, the geography and hydrology of Erka

Wetland have no special characteristics.


(3) Summary (refer to 8.2.6 and 8.3.6)

1 Hulunbeier has a big area of wetlands, among which Erka Wetland accounts for 4.6% of the

    total. Most wetlands (Dalai Lake Wetland and Huihe Wetland) have been listed as

    protection zones.

2 Compared with other wetlands, the geography, hydrology, and animals and plants of Erka

    Wetland have no special characteristics.

3 The impact area of this project only accounts for 1.5% of the area of Erka Wetland.

4 The construction of the project will bring about negative environmental impacts on Erka

    Wetland. But the impacts are relatively small and can be minimized by adopting proper

    environmental protection measures.


5.2.6 Experts' comments and suggestions:

Three experts were invited during the preparation of the EIA Report and the following

comments and suggestions were given.


1. Comments by MS. Tao Li (senior engineer)

  1 Cygnus Cygnus

Large-sized swimming birds, national Class II key protective bird. They are discovered in the

west and south sides of Benbo Lake. Reed field is their breeding ground. The noise from the

construction of the highway and the bridges and from the operation of the highway will have

impact on them.


They seek food in the shore and reed field. Their main foods are the stems, leaves and seeds of

aquatic plants. The construction of the highway can increase the turbidity of the water body

chiefly and has little impact on the growth of aquatic plants, so it does not disturb the food

sources of Cygnus Cygnus.


  2 Anthropoides uirgo
Large-sized water fowls national Class II key protective animal.


They inhabit in wide grassland, meadow bog, reed-swamp, reed pond, lake, river valley, semi-

desert and lake meadow in plateau, and sometimes in farmland. In most time they live in small

group or a family but in couple only during the breeding stage. They often live in shallow water

field or nearby Chinese wildrye with high relief. No Anthropoides uirgo was found during the

investigation along the line. Local herder proved that a small amount of them were seen. The

construction and operation of the highway will disturb them and make them migrate to places

far away from the highway.


Their main food is small-sized fish, shrimp, frogs, polliwogs, aquatic insects, tender lives of

plants, grass seeds and crops like corn and wheat which are being fed when they are walking.

Because of the multiplicity of their food, the impact on their food seeking should not be much

influenced by the destroying of water transportation due to the project construction.


Their breeding stage is from April to June. They usually do not build nests and thus lay eggs

directly on the naked but dry alkaline soil in Chinese wildrye. Sometimes they build nests in the




                                                      139

                        EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



grass near water or in the swamp. They breed once a year with 1-3 eggs laid (2 eggs in most

cases). The highway construction may have some impact on the baby birds hatching, so proper

education such as forbidding picking up eggs and hunting illegally is needed for the

construction team. The hatching places should be avoided as could as possible unless there are

no other choices.


  3 Otis tarda

National Class I key protective animal, which is in the list of red paper for endangered bird. The

population is very small mainly due to grassland exclamation, human disturbance, herding and

illegal hunting. They belong to large-sized terrestrial birds living in wide grassland, meadow

and semi-desert area, and sometimes emerge in the river shores, lake shores and nearby wet or

dry meadows, but have not been found during the EIA investigation of this time.


The natural disposition of Otis tarda is cowardice, so it is difficult to be close to them but easy

to disturb them and drive them faraway from the construction zone. Of course, this kind of

influence is temporary. The operation of the highway will produce noise which will compress

the activity space of the birds to the area beyond 300m away from each side of the highway,

and this kind of influence is long-term.


The main foods for Otis tarda are tender leaves, sprouts, tender grass, seeds and grain of plants,

as well as locusts, grasshoppers and frogs, etc. Constructions of the project and the land

occupation will destroy the surface vegetation and the food sources of them. However because

of the multiplicity of their food, the impact on their food seeking is not too much.

The breeding stage of Otis tarda is May to July. Their nests are in the shallow cote on wide

grasslands, or in natural sunken cotes, or built by parent birds. So we can find that the

construction time May to October will have impact on them.


The old Highway 301 is a place with many human activities, perhaps this kind of birds have

already left this area, as they usually live in the areas with few human activities. No Otis tarda

was seen during the field survey and we can conclude that the impact on them is not very large.

(1) Falco rusticolus

Middle-sized bird of prey, national Class II key protective animal. The local Falco rusticoluses

are winter migratory birds and can be seen in winter occasionally.

This kind of birds is mostly distributed in Erka Wetland, and the west and south sides of Dalai

Lake, with scarce quantity.

Large-sized bird of prey, national Class II key protective animal.

They habit in wide plain, meadow, hungriness and wasteland grassland in highland and foothill

and mainly act in the daytime.


The main food sources are citellus, gerbil, pika, hare, phrynocephalus, takydromus, snake,

birds, baby antelope, rotten flesh and the body of animals.


The breeding stage is April to June. Their nests are in cliffs, the top of hilllock or rock,

sometimes on the ground or in the dry grass stack and in the hill slope. They are migratory birds

or Travelling birds.


Their nests are usually in higher places so that the highway construction almost will have no

impact on their breeding. But running vehicles and the construction at night may have some

short-time impact on their habitation.


  3 Buteo hemilasius

Large-sized bird of prey, national Class II key protective animal. They habit in open swampland

and sandbank area. They always live alone, fly in the sky or stand in a high place on the ground

being on watch for quarry. The natural disposition of Buteo hemilasius is wit and difficult to

approach. However, they are not afraid of vehicles, will not fly away even when the vehicles

are only 10m away. They are easy to be induced and killed. Therefore, construction workers

and the divers should be properly educated to prohibit hunting these birds.


The main food sources are hare and rodents. When breeding, their nests will be high above the

ground, thus their seeking food and breeding will not be affected by the construction of the

project.


Integrating the two experts'comments on the impact of the project on water fouls, it can be

concluded that the highway construction will have some impact on the habitats and breeding

activities of Cygnus Cygnus and Anthropoides uirgo. To most grass birds of prey, the main

influence is that their habitation will be disturbed by the reciprocation of the vehicles. But when

considering the little amount of traffic flow at night, the impact on birds is limited. As most key

protective birds have multiplicity in their food source, the impact on food seeking due to the

plants destroying along the line is very small. But the highway construction will have the effect

in dispersing the bird along the line temporarily.

(1)As Erka Wetland is not permanently fully flooded ­ during dry periods, there are small lakes

and pools, and patches of grassland/reed beds ­ the consultant suggested creating artificial

pools that would permanently hold water. However, a discussion with project officials and

consultants revealed this is impractical. Hence, it would seem the best mitigation measure

would be protection of existing small lakes/pools along the project route through Erka.

Management may be advisable, if this can improve these habitats.


(2)Eco-tourism could be developed at these protected lakes and pools. If successful, this could

result in benefits to wetlands extending well beyond the project area ­ by demonstrating that

protected wetlands (with protected birds and other wildlife) can generate money; and through

education, encouraging people to help protect wetlands and their wildlife. As well as targeting

tourists from outside the area, a reserve (or reserves) with visitor facilities could become a

valuable place for local people. Both giving them an opportunity for recreation (at Erka, we met

two local men who were watching birds, and taking photos), and helping with

conservation/environmental education, especially for school children.


(3)It would seem essential to ensure that there are no highway-related developments that

damage the wetland ­ especially on the fringes, on land that is rarely or never flooded.


(4)In case power lines or telephone cables are later strung beside the highway: measures will be

needed to ensure birds do not fly into them (and perhaps die).


(5)Care is required with the highway section crossing the Hailar River. Similar measures to

those at Erka can be introduced during the construction phase; this should not be too

troublesome as this stretch of highway is short.


(6)The EIA suggests that after the highway is constructed, there should be mitigation for

destruction of vegetation through planting some local tree and shrub species, and sowing grass

seeds. This seems wise; wildlife would perhaps benefit most if there are concentrated areas of

trees/shrubs. As noted during a discussion, tree planting by the roadside may be inadvisable, as

it may result in greater problems with snowdrifts.


The experts have some suggestions on the environmental protection measures as follows:

(1) Management should be strengthened in the Construction Period. Before the construction,

construction access roads should be constructed and construction vehicle route properly defined

to forbid their arbitrary driving. During the construction, the construction scope should be

specified and any constructive activities should be controlled strictly within the scope, and the

destruction of vegetation around the construction areas is prohibited. In the Construction

Period, the forest and plants on the requisitioned lands especially the plants in sandlot should be

protected as far as possible.

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



(2) After the end of construction, each part of the destroyed area due to the project construction

should be leveled, loosened by plough as soon as possible. In proper seasons, tree species and

grass seeds, which are suitable to the local ecological environment, should be cultivated to

recover the natural landscape. Toward the destroyed arbors and shrubs due to the construction,

compensation rules should be established and should reflect the practical loss. In-situ or

allopatric compensation is regarded as the best method.


(3) During the highway construction, all the construction activities should avoid the wild

animal's habitation and the behavior disturbing or destroying the wild animal's living area is not

allowed. Excessive catching and hunting wild animals is forbidden. The construction time

should avoid the season like gale in the spring. The construction efficiency should be enhanced

to shorten the construction time. It is also important to minimize the destroying of natural

vegetations.


(4) When the highway construction is finished, unified arrangement, clearance and renovation

are needed for the temporarily occupied lands and the affected areas due to the construction.

According to the different land situation and local ecologic environmental plan along the

highway, corresponding measures are asked to taken to recover the vegetations and prevent

desertification. The measures taken should be differentiated by the different types of occupied

land when recovering the vegetations and prevent the desertification. If it was farmland before,

it should be reclaimed to farm; if it was grassland before, the emphasis is to recover the

previous vegetations; if it was fixed or semi-fixed sandlot, the main task should be recovering

the previous vegetations. Mechanical sand barrier is the main way for flowing sandlot, in

combination with shrubs and herbs growing in sand, so as to recover the previous vegetations,

prevent the desertification, while improving the ecological environment along the highway.


(5) Eco-toutism could be developed at the part of the road in wetland, measures should be

considered for this.

Development at the fringe of the wetland should be well controled to protect the wetland.


5.3 Conclusions and Suggestions


1 The landform of Erka Wetland is mainly comprised of lakeshore plain, alluvial plain, river

    flood plain, sand land and sand hill, and high plain, etc. The soil in the area includes mainly

    salinized meadow soil, salinized Castanozems soil, meadow bog soil, alkalized meadow

    soil, meadow alkali soil, meadow Castanozems soil, alkalized Castanozems soil, Aeolian

    soil and sandy Castanozems soil. Erka Wetland landscape is mainly comprised of wetland

    landscape and sand wetland landscape.

2 Based on the survey on Erka Wetland, there have been found 257 species of vascular plants,

    respectively belonging to 57 families and 165 genera.

                     EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



3 There is a record of 226 species of wild animals (vertebrates) in Erka Wetland, including 37

  fishes, 10 amphibians and reptiles, 38 mammals and 141 birds.

4 Measures should be taken during the project design period to lower the construction impact

  on the integrality of Erka Wetland, vegetations, wild animals and the hydraulic conditions.

5 The area of Erka Wetland is a small portion of Hulunbeier Wetland, so the characteristics of

  hydraulic conditions, geography, animals and plants do not have particularity compared

  with other wetland. The construction of the project will bring unfavorable impact on Erka

  Wetland. But since the impact is relatively small, proper environmental protection measures

  may minimize the impact.

CHAPTER 6 WATER AND SOIL CONSERVATION SCHEME

6.1 Harm of Water and Soil Erosion Caused by Highway Construction


In the construction of the highway project, on the one hand, the land is imposed and the original

facilities of water and soil conservation are damaged and, on the other hand, a lot of earth and

stone is excavated, moved away, and filled up in the project construction. That may easily cause

water and soil erosion. Concretely speaking, that may damage the original facilities of water

and soil conservation (such as forest land, grassland, terraced fields, etc.) and the local

ecological environment to a certain extent, make environment deteriorated, result in the vicious

circle of the ecological system, and aggravate the original water and soil erosion. In the zones

with larger slope rates and bad geologic structures, the bare side slopes are often produced at

excavating surfaces and filling sites after excavating so that the collapses and slippery slopes

are easily caused by rainwater beating. Because of improper construction and using over

volume of explosives for blast work implementation, stratums become loose and then the

collapses and slippery slopes are produced. Discarded residues from the construction occupy

farmland and cause water and soil erosion. In the construction, a lot of earth and stone is

excavated and stacked at random, and the remainder is dumped at random too. Upon strong

raining, they are carried to the downstream to occupy farmland, damage land, reduce the soil

fertility, thread people life, deposit and raise river bed, increase flood and water-logging

disaster, silt up reservoirs, and make water resources deteriorated more and more severely.


6.2 Current Situation of Water and Soil Erosion


(1) Rating standard of water and soil erosion

The Classifying and Rating Standard for Soil Erosion Intensity (SL190-96) is implemented.

According to the announcement of "Major Prevention Divisions for Water and Soil Erosion in

the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region", the areas involved in the project to be implemented

belong to the major prevention divisions for water and soil erosion in the announcement issued

by the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.


The type of water and soil erosion in the areas involved in the project is the wind-force erosion.
The background values of the soil erosion modulus are 3800 t/km2·a for the desert zone of Xin
Zuo Qi, 1100 t/km2·a for Chen Qi, 1000 t/km2·a for Manzhouli City, and 1000 t/km2·a for the

other zones of Xin Zuo Qi, respectively.


The area of water and soil erosion in the highway construction areas is 466.5 hm2 38.4% of the

total area of the project construction areas. The current situation of water and soil erosion is

given in Table 6-2.

6.3 Analog Experimental Formula and Parameters


(1) The highway construction area

Based on the different types of the factors and status of turmoil of surface water and soil

conservation, the analog area measuring method and the analog material calculation, and the

following experimental formula are used:

                                                MS =F·A·P

                                             MS´=F· (A-1) ·P
where MS -- annual erosion amount in the projection period (t/a);
       MS´-- annually increased erosion amount in the projection period (t/a);
        F -- accelerated erosion area (km2);

        A -- accelerated erosion coefficient (3.5 for plain area, 6.0 for wind and sand area, 4.5

                for hill area, and 6.0 for middle and lower mountain area, respectively);
        P -- original landform soil erosion modulus (t/km2·a).




                                                      146

(2) Discarded residue from engineering

Based on the analog analysis of discarded residue run off along the lines of highways to be built
and already built, the experimental formula of the ratio of running off over discarding is used for the
discarded residue from the project construction:




where MS -- total running off amount of engineering discarded residue in the projection
               period;

        MSi -- running off amount of discarded residue in ith year;
        Wj -- amount of engineering discarded residue in jth year (0 1-j n);
          -- the ratio of running off over discarding of engineering discarded residue within the

                projection year range and, based on the analog investigation, the ratio of running

                off over discarding for the lower mountain area is 1%;

        i -- the projection year of water and soil erosion
        j -- 0 1 ...n, n the year range of water and soil erosion.


6.4 Total Amount of Newly Increased Water and Soil Erosion


Based on the construction plan of the principal engineering design requirements of the project

and the integral evaluation of the factors in the construction areas, such as geology, landforms,

vegetation, and rainfall, etc., the water and soil erosion amounts are determined for each area of

the project, and the total amounts of newly increased water and soil erosion are calculated.

Based on the calculation of the water and soil erosion amounts for the above areas, the

projection value of the newly increased water and soil erosion amount is 97772.4 tons. Refer to

Table 6-3.


Based on the analysis of the origins, types and distributions of water and soil erosion in the

project construction for the recommended lines, and the calculation of the area occurring water

and soil erosion and the projection of the water and soil erosion intensity, the soil erosion

amount to be potentially produced during the Construction Period is determined as 128803.8

tons, the original landform soil erosion amount 31031.3 tons, and the newly increased soil

erosion amount 97772.4 tons.

It is indicated that the water and soil erosion intensities during the construction are 6~10 times of

the values before the construction. Therefore the prevention of water and soil erosion will be very

important during the Construction Period. By using timely and tightly excavating lands and pilling

up roadbed, on the one hand, the water and soil conservation factor my be increased to reduce water

and soil erosion; and, on the other hand, some peripheral water and soil conservation measures

should be adopted to prevent water and soil erosion to be produced by the construction from

impacting the external places. However, in 3~5 years after the highway is put into operation,

because of improving the drainage equipment and recovering the vegetation (including man-made

greening and naturally recovery) the water and soil erosion intensities which have been increased

during the Construction Period shall be recovered to the level as before the construction. And

because the road surface is classified to the high level highway and greening work of road

appearance is going to be done, water and soil erosion along the highway line shall be less intense

than the level before the construction. Therefore, the increase of water and soil erosion during the

Construction Period will be very hard to be absolutely avoided. However it will be only transient.

From the long-term view, the highway construction will be finally favorable to reducing the local

water and soil erosion.


6.5 Measures for Water and Soil Conservation


Based on the ecological environmental impact analysis, in 3~5 years after the highway is put into

operation, because of improving the drainage equipment and recovering the vegetation the water

and soil erosion intensities which have been increased (the level of 6~10 times) during the

Construction Period shall be recovered to the level as before the construction. However, the

prevention measures for water and soil erosion should be taken during the Construction Period to

minimize water and soil erosion impact during the project construction.

6.5.2 Implementation plan of water and soil conservation scheme

(1) Organization/leadership and supervision/management

The Highway Headquarters is in charge of organizing and implementing the water and soil

conservation scheme of the project to coordinate the water and soil conservation scheme and

the major engineering, to ensure the synchronous implementation, complement at same period,

and simultaneous check and acceptance for each of the water and soil conservation design and

facilities and the major engineering. The Highway Headquarters should entrust the

corresponding design institutions to undertake the engineering drawing design of water and soil

conservation. And the corresponding design contents and requirements should be determined in

the form of the contract in the construction bidding. In implementation, The Highway

Headquarters should supervise the implementation of the water and soil conservation

implementation scheme by the bidding and construction institutions, participate and guide the

check and acceptance work of the water and soil conservation facilities, entrust the qualified




                                                    154

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



inspection and control agent to undertake the inspection and control, and, simultaneously,

accept the supervision of the local forest and water administrative authority institutions.


(2) Technical and financial assurance measures

In the construction bidding, the emphasis should be given to the comparison of the technical

quality and awareness of environmental protection and water and soil erosion of the

construction teams. The construction contractors should adopt diverse effective measures to

prevent unnecessary soil erosion occurring during utilizing and occupying lands and to prevent

the materials excavated by the engineering construction and other waste residues from

depositing                  in                    rivers                      and         wetlands.


The measures listed in the water and soil conservation scheme should be designed by the

qualified design departments and shall become the construction basis of water and soil

conservation of the next phase as long as they are approved by the corresponding authority

agents. The contents of water and soil conservation should be considered in the phases of the

bidding design and engineering drawing design. During the Construction Period, the

construction units should undertake the construction rigorously according to the design and the

construction inspection and control agents should undertake the inspection and control for the

construction, including the water and soil conservation. After the water and soil conservation

work is completed, it should be examined by the water and soil conservation institutions, and

finally checked and accepted along with the major engineering.


According to the requirements of the construction progress, the measures of the water and soil

conservation engineering should be implemented by the construction contractors who are in

charge of the corresponding individual engineering; the vegetation measures may be undertaken

by the experienced units that are entrusted by the owners. If any projects are sub-contracted to

the other contractors, the sub-contractors should undertake the implementation of the

corresponding water and soil conservation scheme.


The design schemes for each of the individual water and soil conservation measures should be

all examined and approved. And the construction units have to carry on the construction

rigorously according to the design requirements. After the construction is completed, the check

and acceptance work should be done according to the design requirements.


The implementation institutions and the construction units should allocate the necessary funds

to the technical trainings and the monitoring and research of water and soil erosion, etc., and

select the professional technical persons of water and soil conservation to participate the

construction inspection and control work.

The investment for water and soil conservation work should be incorporated into the

investments for the engineering project. Some costs are the cross ones for other engineering

components, such as greening work of filling side slopes, transportation and stack of temporary

discarded residues, etc. All capital for water and soil conservation should be incorporated into

the total budget of the project through the construction drawing design.

CHAPTER 7 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS OF
PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER

7.1 Engineering Analysis


7.1.1 Origin of the engineering

Manzhouli Port, the second largest port in China, has set up a border check station, but has no

goods transfer and unloading facilities. The trucks from Russia are not allowed to go beyond

Hailar, and those that will be transported to other places in China should be moved onto

Chinese trucks. After the construction of Haihar-Manzhouli Highway, with the growth of trade

volume, it is necessary to set up a physical distribution center (PDC). Considering that Hailar is

located at the central position among the 5 ports of Russia and Mongolia borders, the PDC is

determined to be set up at Hailar, located at Haidong Industrial Estate. The State Highway 301

goes through the estate, and Binzhou Railway goes by it. The geographical position of the PDC

is illustrated in Figure 7-1.



7.1.2 Land acquisition and construction scale

The total land area occupied by the PDC is 24.6ha. In light of the designed annual treatment

capacity of 0.8~1 million t of handling capacity of the Center in the short term (the design year

is 2013), it has calculated preliminarily that area of land acquisition of the Center would be
80000m2.


The construction area of house buildings is about 9,000 m2, including comprehensive offices,

various storages (heating warehouse, refrigerated warehouse and simple storage), motels and

auxiliary facilities, etc. The storages shall be ordinary storage with 8m heights piling three-layer

of goods. The height of refrigerated warehouse is 3.6m. The layout of the plant area of PDC is

illustrated in Figure 7-2.


Areas of various structures (including loading platform, loading yard and parking lot, etc) are
about 8,000 m2. The main buildings are shown in Table 7-1, and main equipment in Table 7-2.


Asbestos products will not be used in the structures of physical distribution center (PDC). The

Haidong PDC will not set a commodity checking institution as there are already such kind of

institutions in Hailaer and Manzhouli. The trade adminstration department has set two

commodity checking institution at Hailaer and Manzhouli. All inport merchandise will be under

checking at Manzhouli, while all export be checked at Hailaer. Quarantine operation is adopted

at both places as a most important part of the checking process.

7.1.3 Pollutant generation and prevention and control measures

(1) Wastewater

a. The wastewater from the offices, motel and restaurant will be 20t/d (supposing 100 people,

    and daily sewage discharge of 0.2 t per person), with the main pollutants of COD, BOD5,
    SS and oil. The wastewater from the restaurant will be treated to separate oil.

b. The discharge of cleaning wastewater and washing wastewater from the gas station will be

    about 3t/d. The main pollutants are oil, COD and SS. Oil Separation Tank will be set up in

    the gas station to perform oil separation treatment.


                                                                                  Municipal

c. In order to prevent oily wastewater or wastewater with toxic substances from discharging by

accident, a special emergency site will be set in the PDC. Cofferdams will be established

around the site. Slow slope in the way from and to the site will be set, being convenient for the

vehicles and preventing the wastewater from flowing outside the vehicles. The floor should be

flushed after the oil-carrying vehicles enter and leave the emergency site. The oily wastewater

will be discharged into the pipes after treatment by the oil-insulating pools. The flushed

7.2 Overview of Haidong Industrial Development Estate


(1) Foundation

On September 29, 2002, Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region approved to establish

"Hulunbeier City Haidong Industrial Development Estate" (briefly called Haidong Estate

hereafter). The estate is located at the eastern suburb of Hailar District, with 6.0km away from
the downtown area and a taotal land use of 26.0km2.


(2) Topology

The estate lies in the Hailar River basin where the surface relief is high in the east and south

and low in the west and north, the maximum elevation difference 9m, and the maximum frozen

soil depth 2.42m. The Hailar River flows by the northern end of the estate. The groundwater in

the estate is very rich, with the buried depth of 5~50m. The groundwater quality can meet with

national drink water standard. The area is comprised of alluvial, slope-wash and wind-deposited

sand, grit and clay, with good geographical conditions.



                                                                                     161

                         EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway




(3) Planning scope

The land use of Haidong Estate is to the south and north sides of State Highway 301, ranging

from 1268km of State Highway 301 in the east to 1276km in the west, and from 38.4m to the

north of Binzhou Railway in the south to 100m to the south of flood protection dike of the south
bank of the Hailar River in the north. The total land use area is 26.0 km2.


(4) Residents and enterprises distribution

The estate topology is flat and wide, with State Highway 301 and Binzhou Railway going

through the middle part and south end of the estate respectively in east-west direction. There are

currently two villages, i.e. Fuzhu Village and Lianhe Village, with a total population of more

than 1300. There are some village-owned enterprises and private enterprises surrounding the

villages, and there are also a few enterprises, including chlor-alkali factory and organic

fertilizer factory, etc. distributed to the south side of the estate. Most of the land in the estate is

un-utilized wild grass ground.


(5) Overall planning

The State Highway 301 divides the whole estate into southern and northern zones. The overall

planning of Haidong Estate is illustrated in Figure 7-4.


To the south of State Highway 301 are Class I Industry Processing Zone, Class II Industry

Processing Zone, Physical Distribution Storage Zone and Comprehensive Service Zone. The

Storage Zone is located on the north side of Binzhou Railway and distributed along the line.

Others are basically processing zones.


To the north of State Highway 301 are administrative, commercial and cultural centers of the

estate, including Residential Zone, Administration Zone, Commercial and Service Zone, High-

Tech R&D Zone, Recreation Zone and Comprehensive Service Zone.


The storage land use can be divided into three parts and is distributed to the north of Binzhou

Railway. The total area of storage land use is 111.72ha, accounting 4.4% of the total land use.


7.3 Environmental Impact Analysis


7.3.1 Social environmental impact

(1) Impact on the economy

Hailar District is the political, economic, cultural and social activity center of Hulunbeier City.

Manzhouli City is an important port city of Hulunbeier, locating at the center of Northeast Asia

Circle comprised of northeastern China, Siberia region of Russia, Mongolia, Japan, Korea and




                                                       162

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



DPRK, and at the joint of external and internal markets, thus being the pivot of the development

of northeastern economy and tourism.


After the construction of the PDC, it can provide services of goods transfer and storage,

favorable to the border trade between China and Russia and Mongolia. The construction of this

PDC will bring about long-term favorable impacts for the regional economy.


(2) Impact on labor employment

The construction of the PDC will increase the following employment opportunities:

a. Constructors of the PDC;

b. Additional employment opportunities for the purchase of materials in the Construction

    Period;

c. Additional employment opportunities duo to the development of communication and

    transportation.


(3) Impact on migration

The current site for PDC is blank, without need of migration and removal for the center.


(4) Impact on communication and transportation

The designed annual treatment capacity of the PDC is 0.8~1 million t in the short term (the

design year is 2013). Duo to the goods transportation, there will be an increase of 100~150

vehicles (calculated by large freight vehicles) of daily traffic flow.

7.3.2 Water environmental impact

The wastewater is discharged into Hailar MWWT Plant, with the treatment capacity of

20000t/d, through the municipal sewer system. After the central treatment, the wastewater can

meet with Class I requirements of Wastewater Comprehensive Discharge Standard (GB8978-

1996) and is finally discharged into the Hailar River.


Considering that the wastewater generation from this project is small, it will have only small

impact on the water quality of the Hailar River.

7.3.3 Air environmental impact

One boiler will be added in the project. The emission of waste gas from the boilers will meet

with the limit values for the Second Phase stipulated in Boiler Air Pollutants Emission Standard

(GB13271-2001). The main pollutants include smoke dust, SO2 and NOx.


The emission of this project is small and will have small impact on the regional air

environment. It is suggested that central heating be adopted, since there have been a plan in

Haidong Estate to set up heating pipes utilizing Hailar Thermoelectric Plant.

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



7.3.4 Noise environmental impact

(1) Construction Period

The main machineries for construction include excavators, bulldozers and transport vehicles,

with the noise source intensity of 80~90dB(A). The impact scopes of various machineries in the

daytime are all within 50m. The noise will be below 70 dB(A) beyond 50m, and below 60

dB(A) beyond 100m.


The impact scope at night is greater. The noise will be 55 dB(A) only beyond 100m for most

construction machineries, and it can reach 55 dB(A) only beyond 300m for land levelers,

mechanical loaders and other high-noise machineries.


There plant area of the PDC is wide blank space, without sensitive sites such as residences. The

construction noise will not have serious impact on the environment.

(2) Operation Period

The noise sources of the PDC in the Operation Period are mainly operational noise of boilers

and pumps, etc. and running noise of transportation vehicles.


The following control measures are suggested for the control of noise:

a.  Performing reasonable layout, to make the high noise sources as far away from the plant

    boundary as possible;

b. Selecting production equipment with low noise generation;

c.  Controlling the high noise equipment by insulation and attenuation measures;

d. Notifying the maintenance staff to repair as soon as possible in case of occurrence of

    abnormal noise.


By adopting the above measure, the noise impact on the engineering area can be reduced to

ensure the compliance with the national plant boundary noise level limits.

7.3.5 Solid waste impact

The final disposal of solidwastes includes three kinds of methods, i.e. incineration, recovery

and reuse, landfilling. The arbitrary piling of the solidwastes will lead to soil environmental

pollution. The solidwastes will possibly infiltrate into the groundwater with the rainfall, and

further affect the growth of aquatic and terrestrial animals and plants.


The solidwastes generated from the engineering include waste package and living garbage, etc.

The solidwastes will be collected by classifications. The wood boards, paper boards and other

recoverable goods will be collected for sale, while the garbage that cannot be recovered will be

collected and disposed periodically by municipal departments.




                                                     164

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



It is suggested that specific storage facilities or piling sites be set up in the plant area. The

storage sites of solidwastes should be indicated with conspicuous marks.

7.3.6 Indirect impact

After the PDC is put into use, the goods handling capacity will increase, and the traffic flow in

the region will increase. The main environmental protection targets from the PDC to Hailar-

Manzhouli Highway line are shown in Table 7-4.

(1) Overview of Yakeshi-Hailar highway

The State Highway 301 will go through Haidong Estate. Currently, the Yakeshi-Hailar section

of State Highway 301 is under construction, planned with 25.5m-wide hardening pavement and

4 intersections at the estate.


The Yakeshi-Hailar Highway starts from the west outlet of Yakeshi City and ends at Hailar Bei,

with a lenth of 82.969km. The main technical indicators are shown in table 7-5.

                        EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



(2) Water environmental impact

The starting point of Hailar-Manzhouli Highway is about 15km to Haidong PDC. It spans over

the Hailar River with a 360m-long big-sized bridge.


The tail gas from the freight vehicles could be washed by the rainfall into the Hailar River. As

the PDC-induced traffic flow is not high (100~150vehicles/d), and the river water flow in the

rain seasons is great, the impact on the water body is small. It will also stop immediately after

the rain stops, thus belonging to short-term impact.


(3) Air environmental impact

After the construction of the PDC, with the increase of transportation vehicles, the emission of

vehicle tail gas wills somewhat increase. According to the projection of traffic flow and PDC-

induced traffic flow in the Feasibility Study Report of Yakeshi-Hailar Highway, the source

intensity of NOX is 0.33mg/m.s. The air environmental projection is performed using the
formula in Section 4.3.2, and the results are shown in Figure 7-5.

            Figure 7-5 Air Environmental Impact Projections at Tuanjie Village (2013)

It is seen from the above figure that the impact of NOx concentration on Tuanjie Village will be
mainly nearby the highway (roadside ~ 40m). The projected NOx concentration nearby the
highway at Tuanjie Village section will not exceed Class 2 of GB3095-1996 in the Operation

Period (target year 2013).


(4) Noise environmental impact

According to the projection of traffic flow and PDC-induced traffic flow in the Feasibility

Study Report of Yakeshi-Hailar Highway, the noise environmental projection is performed

using the formula in Section 4.4.2. The results are shown in Figure 7-6.

         Figure 7-6 Noise Environmental Impact Projections at Tuanjie Village (2013)


As seen from the projection results, after the construction of the PDC, the noise level in the

daytime at the residential houses of Tuanjie Village on the side of the highway will be near to

the national standard value, while that at night exceed the national standard. Therefore, the

residential houses within 35m to the highway sides should be removed. According to on-site

reconnaissance, 5 households will be removed, and the total removal cost 100,000RMB.


(5) Eco-environmental impact

The transportation line goes across the Hailar River, the two sides of which are currently

100~150m wetlands. The wetlands belong to flood plain wetlands and are distributed in belt

form. These wetlands have no particularities compared with those at other sections. Under

normal transportation conditions, there will be no negative impact on wetland eco-environment

in Hailar.

CHAPTER 8 MEASURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION

8.1 The Situation of Existing Loan Projects by the World Bank in Inner Mongolia


The Trade and Transportation in Inner Mongolia Project is the 3rd highway project utilizing the

World Bank loan. The previous two projects are respectively highway project of three provinces

already completed and Laoyemiao-Jining Speedway under construction. The experience in EIA

and environment protection of these two projects is important for the smooth implementation

and efficient management of this proposed project.

IMCD regards that the following points had important role in the implementation of mitigation

measures and would like to continue the good practice in the next project.


1. During the bidding, the environment protection scheme and measures should be included in

the bidding documents in order to require the contractor to conform the items relevant to

accomplishing the environmental protection measures.

2. The corporation of the project should contact with local health and anti-epidemic institutions

before the contractor and the constructors entering the construction sites in order to better

publicize and carry out the countermeasures about health and anti-epidemic. By this means,

epidemic diseases may be well prevented.

3. The encampment of construction needs necessary disinfecting, washing and sanitation

checking. The garbage from constructors needs classification according to the environmental

requirements.

4. Each construction department should arrange one professional vice manager responsible for

the environmental protection work. He will accomplish the environmental protection scheme

and measures, read-in the Project Season Report, and complete the daily record of their

environmental protection work.


8.2 Measures for Environmental Protection in Design Phase


8.2.1 Social environment

(1) The lines avoid passing major environmental sensitive sites (Hailar District, Chenbaerhu

    Qi, Zalainuoer Mineral District, and Manzhouli City)


(2) The pavements and tractor roads should be considered in the engineering design to facilitate

    herdsmen walk and tractors passage and thus reduce the impacts of the highway on mutual

    isolation (refer to Table 4-1-2).

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



8.2.2 Surface water environment

(1) The bridges and culverts should be rationally built to prevent blocking water stream and

    ensure surface runoff, and prevent resulting in flood disasters (refer to Table 2-8).


(2) The domestic sewage and production wastewater in the service areas should be treated. It is

    suggested that the oil-insulating treatment for wastewater containing oils be performed, and

    the septic tanks for domestic sewage be built. The process flow diagram recommended is

    shown in Figure 8-1.

8.2.3 Ambient air

(1) The temporary facilities, such as blending stations, bitumen mixing stations, should be built,

    according to the local dominant wind directions and sub-dominant wind directions, to the

    leeward and at places beyond 200 m away from the sensitive sites, such as resident areas,

    hospitals, etc. (K404+000, K409+700, K493+400, K505+500, K557+800). And the

    blending stations should have good sealing property.


(2) It should be prohibited to build the temporary facilities, such as blending stations, bitumen

    mixing stations, in Huhenuoer Lake (K430+000-K438+000), Benpo Lake (K526-K532),

    and Erka Wetland (K540+000-K553+200).

8.2.4 Noise environment

(1)   The materials sites, blending stations, and bitumen mixing stations should be built away

      from resident areas, hospitals, Huhenuoer Lake, Benpo Lake, and Erka Wetland

      (K404+000, K409+700, K493+400, K505+500, K557+800, K430+000-K438+000, K526-

      K532, K540+000-K553+200) at distances of more than 200 m.


(2)   The traffic signs to prohibit vehicles from using horns should be established in the areas,

      such as resident areas, hospitals, Benpo Lake, and Erka Wetland (K404+000, K409+700,

      K493+400, K505+500, K557+800, K430+000-K438+000, K526-K532, K540+000-

      K553+200).


(3)   There are one hospital and four villages along the lines. The measures (e.g. migration)

      shall be adapted to reduce the impacts of noise. The villages exceeding noise standards of

      the long term in 2030 are given in Table 4-4-10.

8.2.5 Eco-environment

(1)     In the engineering design, the balance of earth and stone should be reached as far as

    possible, the mountain areas should be selected as waste earth yards, and occupation of

    grasslands should be avoided. The earth borrowing yards shall occupy grasslands of high




                                                     169

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



    yields as less as possible. And the protection embankments shall be built in the grassland

    areas to reduce the land occupation.


(2)     To protect the grassland tourism resources, it is suggested that the earth borrowing yards

    and waste earth yards should not be allocated within the fields of vision along the lines and

    should be allocated on the mountain rear sides, and that soil should be extracted as level as

    possibly and, then, the recovery measures should be taken and grass should be planted (refer

    to Figure 2-8 and Table 2-11).


(3)     The protection engineering of the road bases and the drainage engineering of the

    highway should be rationally designed to prevent soil erosion and water and soil loss.

8.2.6 Erka Wetland

(1) The centralized construction sites, such as mortar blending stations, should not be

    established in the wetland area. The required materials shall be transferred from the

    construction sites located in other road lines.


(2) In the construction of the road surfaces, the schedule and construction machines should be

    rationally arranged to avoid construction at nights and centralized construction of the large-

    scale machines.


(3) The temporary land in the wetland area should be occupies as less as possible to reduce the

    impacts of the construction on the ecological environment of the area as far as possible.


(4) Cross section should not be allocated at the wetland area to prevent vehicles from going

    down the line.


(5) The signs not to use horns should be established in the road section after the highway is put

    into operation.


(6) Before the construction, construction access roads should be constructed and construction

    vehicle route properly defined to forbid their arbitrary driving.


8.3 Measures for Environmental Impact Prevention in the Construction Period


8.3.1 Social environment

(1) Migration

The dismantling and moving volumes of the project will be small. Houses and buildings of 358
m2 shall be required to dismantle and move (refer to Table 4-1-1). Before the construction of the

project begins, the Office for Land Imposing and Dismantling and Moving should be founded.



                                                     170

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



The national compensation policies on land imposing and dismantling and moving shall be

propagated. The resettlement problems for herdsmen who will be imposed their lands shall be

resolved and the buildings to be dismantled and moved shall be compensated. In the migration

process, the customs and religious belief of the minority nationalities should be respected.


(2) Shift of Power Transmission and Communication Lines

Before the construction of the project, the coordination work with the power and

communication institutions should be actively undertaken.


In the mark sections of the power transmission line shifts, the safety supervisor should be

assigned for each mark section. The obvious safety warning lines should be established in the

construction sites. And the symbol lights attracting eyes should be installed at nights. The local

herdsmen, travelers, and livestock should be prohibited to enter the construction sites.


(3) Local Communication and Transportation

1 Before the construction begins, the local roads to serve as the transportation passageways

    should be consolidated and remade or the pavements should be built through.

2 In the construction periods, if the roads are required to be partially blocked, the pavements

    should be built to be connected with the original roads.

3 In the construction periods, if the local roads are damaged, they should be repaired upon the

    end of the construction, or the reparation should be paid to the locals who shall repair them.

4 The transport vehicles should avoid the local traffic rush hours, reduce their environmental

    impacts on noise and air in the areas along the lines, and reduce the traffic accidents.


(4) Land Utilization

a.  The construction management should be enhanced. The construction practices should be

    undertaken in the designated construction areas. And the random occupation of grasslands

    should be prohibited;

b. The construction vehicles shall go on the designated roads and be prohibited to go on the

    grasslands at random.


(5) Cultural Relics and Historical Sites along Lines

According to the initial investigation, along the reconstruction project route, there are no

cultural relics found in the construction. If any cultural relics found in the construction, the

building work must be interrupted with the cultural relics control departments noticed. The

building work must not continue until the excavation and arrangement are completed.


In the active coordination of the highway building department and the relics protection

department, action in accordance with the national laws for protecting cultural relics, the project

construction will not produce effects on the cultural relics concerned along the route.



                                                     171

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



There have to be the articles on the cultural relic conservation and normal work procedures in

the tender invitation proposals of each road section of the project. And there should also be the

corresponding articles on the supervision and inspection and control of the cultural relics in the

tender invitation proposals of the inspection and control.

8.3.2 Surface water environment

(1) Bridge and Culvert Engineering

There are a few rivers along the highway lines to be constructed. They are seasonal rivers. The

construction in the cofferdam method should be adapted to effectively prevent turbid water

quality produced by the construction, and construction refuse from falling to the rivers to

pollute water bodies.


The mud residues excavated from excavation of the bridge piers, and wastewater from washing

and brushing construction materials (e.g. sand and stone washing and brushing) should not be

re-discharged into rivers. The temporary precipitation pools should be built to precipitate them,

and mud residues should be put at the low-lying sites outside the river embankments.


(2) Machine Work

a. Sewage from construction machines which contains oil should be collected and then treated

(collected into waste plastic tanks and then transferred out for treating), and should not be

discharged into the water bodies.


b. The stack sites for the construction materials, such as bitumen, oil materials, chemical

substances, etc., should be located outside the riverbeds and equipped with canvas for

temporarily covering purpose.


(3) Construction Camping Grounds

a. The construction camping sites should not be located beside the water bodies. The sewage

from constructors needs collecting and discharging into the cesspit; the feces can be composted

as fertilizers for the meadow. The sewage can water the meadow, and arbitrary discharging of

wastewater without strict management is forbidden.


b. Each construction worker is required to have the medical and anti-epidemic examination

before they enter the construction area. The sanitation and anti-epidemic work should be

enhanced in the construction camping sites during the rain season to prevent disease spreading.


c. It should be prohibited that the waste stuff and construction materials are discarded and

stacked beside water bodies and wetlands to prevent pollution and block of the water bodies.




                                                     172

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



8.3.3 Ambient air

(1) Materials Transportation

a.  The roads of the materials sites should be frequently sprinkled to maintain the road surfaces

    moist. When wind speed is higher than 5 m/s, the transportation and load and unload of

    powdered materials should not be performed.

b. The materials transportation roads and construction sites should be periodically sprinkled

    (twice a day, each in morning and afternoon respectively), especially near the plaster blend

    stations, and the road surfaces should be timely cleaned to prevent a secondary raising dust.

c.  When transportation of unpackaged materials goes through the grasslands and resident

    areas, the measures to prevent transportation raising dust should be taken, and the transport

    vehicles should be going at a speed of less than 40 km/h on the roads; the transportation in

    a lump way should be adapted for lime, and powdered materials should not be over loaded.

    The raw materials to easily produce a raising dust, such as cement and lime, etc., should be

    stored in an airtight work shed, or a windbreak and waterproof measure should be taken for

    their storage.

d. The vehicles for transportation of construction materials should be covered to reduce

    falling apart as far as possible. The transportation of powdered coal ash should be loaded

    and transferred in a wet way.

e.  When going through the areas with a higher population density and the sensitive
    sites K404+000 K409+700 K493+400 K505+500 K557+800 K430+000-
    K438+000 K526-K532 K540+000-K553+200 , the vehicles of materials transportation

    should decrease their speeds to reduce the impacts of raising dust. Also the signs of speed

    limits should be established at the sensitive sites/areas where the vehicles of materials

    transportation go through.


(2) Construction Work

a.  The advanced blend equipment for bitumen and concrete should be adapted. And the

    bitumen melting and mixing should be done in airtight containers. The bitumen preparation

    in an open simple way should not be used.

b. In the construction of road bases, individual layers should be timely rammed and sprinkled

    to reduce dust. And the construction pavements and unpaved roads should be frequently

    sprinkled to reduce dust pollution.

8.3.4 Noise environment

1 It should be done to rationally arrange the construction activities, shorten the construction

    periods as far as possible, and reduce the impact time of construction noise. The

    construction machines with big noise should be avoided being simultaneously used in the

    same area, especially those sites near the noise sensitive sites, i.e. only one machine being

    used at a time interval within a road section of 50 m. The piling and demolition work shall



                                                     173

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



   not be allowed at night (from.10:00 pm to 6:00 am) The following machines shall be

   limitedly used at nights: loading machines, vibrators, pounded drilling machines, and

   concrete mixers with a higher noise.


2 Because there are resident areas, hospitals, Benpo Lake and Erka wetland road sections

   (K404+000, K409+700, K493+400, K505+500, K557+800, K526-K532, K540-K553+200)

   near the lines, the construction machines with a strong noise should not be used at nights

   (from 10:00 pm to 6:00 am).


3 The workers operating the construction machines and on-site construction persons should

   control their working hours or take personal protection measures (e.g. with safety helmets

   and earplugs).


4 The main transportation lines should be away from the sensitive sites, including villages and

   hospitals, as far as possible.

8.3.5 Eco-environment

(1) Do not expand earth borrowing volume and range of the earth borrowing yards at random,

     and decrease the excavation surfaces as far as possible; earth should be discarded

     according to the designed capacity of the waste earth yards, and do not exceed the range.


(2) After the finish of the construction, the temporary construction bridges should be timely

     removed, and the construction pavements should be cleared away and removed and

     vegetation should be recovered.


(3) At the earth borrowing yards, the farming mellow soil of the original land surface should be

     piled up aside and stored before the excavation and, then, filled back and removed after

     the finish of the construction to recover the original land surface. The construction

     duration is three years and the annual effective construction duration is only about six

     months. Because there exists severe wind erosion in the areas, it is suggested to divide up

     the excavation and assign a part to each in the regional sites and, for the excavated region,

     to timely carry on leveling work, to cover topsoil, to recover vegetation, and not to wait

     for the end of the whole engineering to do so.


(4) The residue blocking dams should be built at the waste earth yards. The discarded earth

     should be stacked in a trapezoid way, the stocked earth and stone should be dammed

     firmly and the top of the stocked earth should be leveled as far as possible to decrease rain

     washing and brushing. The blind pipes should be installed and the outer edges should be

     pilled up with cobble gravels to eliminate permeating water. When the construction is

     performed at the waste earth yards, topsoil should be firstly stacked aside, discarded earth



                                                     174

                      EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



     should be timely and firmly pressed and, after discarded, the top surface should be filled

     back with mellow soil, with a covering thickness of 30-50 cm, to satisfy the basic

     requirements of plant growth.


(5) At the materials sites, the stripped vegetation and topsoil should be separately stacked

     before exploiting. The exploiting ways which minimally change the landforms, such as

     the whole exploiting or parallel exploiting, etc., should be adapted to avoid producing

     deeper pitfalls and bigger excavating slopes and to facilitate filling repeat-soil back and

     recovering vegetation after the work is completed.


(6) For the temporarily occupied lands, the vegetation and farming land recovery should be

     undertaken as soon as possible after the engineering is completed. It should be done to use

     while leveling, greening, and re-farming. For greening work, the locally appropriate plants

     should be mainly chosen. For seeds, the sheep grass seeds may be adapted. It is suggested

     that grass seeds be sowed in mid June since there are light winds and good water

     conditions in the season to ensure a higher germination percentage.


(7) In the construction, the normal driving routes should be determined to prevent vehicles

     from husking grasslands and persons from trampling at random.


(8) The diverse pollutants to be produced during the construction should be properly dealt with

     to prevent serious pollution of ecological environment.


(9) In the sandy land area of the eastern coast of the Hailar River, a grass square frame sand-

     firm method shall be adapted on roadside slopes and side ditches. It is suggested to carry

     on the closed afforestation on sandy lands along the road lines.


(10)     The propagation of the corresponding regulations to the construction persons should be

     enhanced. The actions to destroy ecological environment, such as fishing and hunting,

     etc., should be absolutely prohibited.


(11)     Trees on temporarily occupied lands shall not be cut down as far as possible.

8.3.6 Wetland eco-environment

(1) In the construction, diverse temporary land should be occupied as less as possible.


(2) In the construction, land should be occupied as less as possible, the normal driving routes

    should be determined to prevent vehicles from husking grasslands and persons from

    trampling at random, and diverse pollutants to be produced during the construction should

    be properly dealt with to prevent serious pollution of ecological environment.



                                                    175

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway




(3) In the construction of the wetland sections, the temporary construction bridges and

    construction pavements should be built in the properly selected construction durations, and

    they should be timely removed and cleaned after the construction is completed.


(4) The construction camping sites should not be built in the Erka Wetland. It is absolutely

    prohibited to discard and stack waste stuff and construction materials beside the wetland to

    prevent pollution of the wetland.


(5) The environmental management and supervision institutions should be established and

    strengthened, and the whole process of the project construction should be permeated with

    the environmental inspection and control; The national and local laws, regulations, rules,

    and technical requirements and standards should be observed, and the ecological rules for

    the construction persons of the project areas and management and operation persons after

    the project completion should be developed as well. The major contents of the ecological

    rules include observing the regulations on the natural resources protection and ecological

    protection, and not undertaking activities which result in disadvantageous impacts on the

    regional ecological environment, such as farming, fishing, hunting, etc.


(6) In the wetland mark section, at least one engineer of inspection and control should be

    designated to be in charge of the inspection and control work of environmental protection

    work.

(7) The construction scope should be specified and any constructive activities should be

    controlled strictly within the scope, and the destruction of vegetation around the

    construction areas is prohibited. In the Construction Period, the forest and plants on the

    requisitioned lands especially the plants in sandlot should be protected as far as possible.

(8) All the construction activities should avoid the wild animal's habitation and the behavior

    disturbing or destroying the wild animal's living area is not allowed. Excessive catching and

    hunting wild animals is forbidden. The construction time should avoid the season like gale

    in the spring. The construction efficiency should be enhanced to shorten the construction

    time. It is also important to minimize the destroying of natural vegetations.



8.3.7 Solid wastes

(1) It is suggested that garbage cans should be put in every construction area to collect

    domestic refuse to be generated.


(2) Because of small amounts and simple components of domestic refuse, it may be centrally

    and periodically transferred and land filled on site.




                                                     176

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



(3) It is suggested to coordinate with the local administrative institutions on construction

    rubbish to be generated from dismantling and moving along the highway lines. The

    appropriate sites of the second party should be determined. In dismantling and moving and

    road destroying, the surface removing stuff should not be stacked along the lines.

    Coordinated with the environmental inspection and control in the construction, the proper

    stack sites should be chosen. The leftover waste materials to be generated in the

    construction shall be dealt with by the construction units themselves.


8.4 Measures for Environmental Impact Control in the Operation Period


8.4.1 Surface water environment

(1) The integrated sewage treatment facilities should be installed in the service areas. It is

    suggested to adapt the cycle process for wastewater treatment to ensure that wastewater

    discharged out reaches the second level standard in Farmland Irrigation Water Quality

    Standards (GB5084-1992). The sewage treatment flow diagram suggested is shown in

    Figure 8-1.

(2) The highway fee collection stations should fully play their roles and simultaneously

    function the inspection and control. It should be absolutely prohibited that those vehicles

    with any revelation, unpackaged overloading go on the highway to prevent missing goods

    on the highway from polluting water bodies and wetlands.

8.4.2 Ambient air

Grass shall be planted on the both sides of the highway to clean and absorb pollutants in the

vehicles exhausts and, simultaneously, to beatify the environment and improve the landscapes

along the highway lines.

8.4.3 Noise environment

(1) Measures for Traffic Noise Prevention and Comparison and Selection

The common noise prevention and control measures are as follows: sound insulation barrier,

greening, building removal, sound insulation windows, and engineering avoiding, etc.

(2) Management Measures during the Operation Period

a.  Those vehicles exceeding the nationally allowable noise standards should not be allowed to

    go on the highway. The Allowable Noise Standards for Motor-Driven Vehicles (GB1495-

    79) is listed in the following table:


Table 8-2 Allowable Noise Standards for the motor-driven vehicles (GB1495-79)

b. The bass horns should be used for all vehicles on the highway. And it should be prohibited

    to use horns at nights.

c.  The traffic management should be enhanced. When vehicles pass through the noise

    sensitive sites or areas, including Haotetaohai and its fifth production team, West Wuzhuer,

    Yihe, Mineral Area Hospital, Erka Wetland, and Benpo Lake, it should be prohibited for

    the vehicles to use horns.

d. The highway maintenance should be enhanced to maintain the road surfaces at an optimal

    status.

e.  The construction planning along the highway lines should be controlled. The sensitive

    buildings, such as resident houses, schools, and hospitals, should not be built within 200 m.

f.  As mentioned at chapter 4, trees should be planted at the right side of the road when

    passing by the Mineral Hospital to reduce the noise impact.

8.4.4 Eco-environment

(1) The routine management work for vegetation recovery along the lines should be

    undertaken: periodically going on a tour of inspection of vegetation recovery and adapting

    corresponding remedial measures for the sections with bad recovery situation. Each part of

    the destroyed area due to the project construction should be leveled, loosened by plough as

    soon as possible. In proper seasons, tree species and grass seeds, which are suitable to the

    local ecological environment, should be cultivated to recover the natural landscape. Toward

    the destroyed arbors and shrubs due to the construction, compensation rules should be

    established and should reflect the practical loss. In-situ or allopatric compensation is

    regarded as the best method.

(2) When the highway construction is finished, unified arrangement, clearance and renovation

    are needed for the temporarily occupied lands and the affected areas due to the construction.

    According to the different land situation and local ecologic environmental plan along the

    highway, corresponding measures are asked to taken to recover the vegetations and prevent

    desertification. The measures taken should be differentiated by the different types of

    occupied land when recovering the vegetations and prevent the desertification. If it was

    farmland before, it should be reclaimed to farm; if it was grassland before, the emphasis is

    to recover the previous vegetations; if it was fixed or semi-fixed sandlot, the main task

    should be recovering the previous vegetations. Mechanical sand barrier is the main way for

    flowing sandlot, in combination with shrubs and herbs growing in sand, so as to recover the




                                                     179

                        EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



    previous vegetations, prevent the desertification, while improving the ecological

    environment along the highway.

(3) The propagation and education of environmental protection and corresponding legality

    should be strengthened to increase awareness of ecological environmental protection and

    cultivate good habits to conscientiously maintain ecological environment.


(4) The functions of the quarantine and obstruction of the border and customs should be further

    enhanced to stop invading of the invading species, to enhance the entrance check work of

    diverse traffic facilities (trains, vehicles, etc.), baggage carried by tourists, and diverse

    goods, and to prevent accidentally bringing foreign living things.


(5) For the part at Erka of the road, eco_tourism measures should be undertaken. These

    measures include setting parking area, building path into the wetland and setting instruction

    boards, etc.




8.4.5 Solid wastes

(1) It is suggested that garbage cans should be put in the service areas to centrally collect

    domestic refuse. After the domestic refuse is collected by the environmental health

    institutions, it shall be transferred to the nearby refuse transfer station and then further

    transferred from the station to the refuse treatment sites. The transportation from the refuse

    transfer station to the refuse disposal sites should be done by the airtight refuse transport

    vehicles in order not to result in significant impacts on the surrounded environment.


(2) Because vehicles go through the both sides of the roads along the lines, white refuse will be

    generated which will result in impacts on the landscape and environment of the both sides

    of the roads along the lines. It is suggested that the refuse of the both sides of the roads

    along the lines be periodically cleared away and transferred by the environmental health

    institutions.

8.4.6 Traffic management


(1) Strengthen the traffic management and provide good driving conditions. Periodically and

    randomly perform check of vehicles noise and exhausts. If those vehicles do not satisfy the

    noise and exhaust emission standards, they should be prohibited to go on the roads.


(2) Perform public propagation and education to let public know the vehicle noise and

    atmospheric pollution and corresponding regulations and policies.

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



8.4.7 Dangerous goods risks

(1) Implement the report and management system for the vehicles transporting the dangerous

    goods. Vehicles have to hold the travel permit to be signed and issued by the

    communication and transportation management institutions in order to go on the roads.


(2) The transport vehicles should be equipped with airtight and solid containers and obvious

    symbols and fire devices. The carriers should receive the necessary working training.


(3) The transport vehicles should be operated under directing and dispatching by the traffic

    management persons. Under the meteorological conditions (rain, fog, etc.) under which

    traffic accidents easily occur, those vehicles should not be allowed to go on the roads.


(4) If possible, also carry on the dynamic monitoring for the vehicles transporting the

    dangerous goods to facilitate to quickly decide the responses when accidents occur and to

    timely inform the local fire departments and environmental agencies.



8.5 Strategy protection measure

The Hulunbeir municipal goverment is now planning to set up a general protection plan of Erka

Wetland. The plan aims to determine the scope of the protection area, strengthen the

management of land using, and will give limits to human's behavior and economic

development within or near the area. The building of this road will be also taken into

consideration when making the plan.

Chapter 9 Alternatives of the Project Construction


9.1 Determination of Starting and Ending Points


9.1.1 Starting point of the line

The starting point of this project is the end of Yakeshi-Hailar Highway (the west side

of Aobao Mountain).

9.1.2 Finishing point of the line

Manzhouli new highway port is one of China's biggest land ports; it is also the end of

State Highway 301. The determination of finishing point at this port will facilitate

highway network linkage with Russia, speed up circulation of border goods trading

and international material communication, and fully play the trunk function of the

state highway.


9.2 Comparison of Construction Alternatives


In the feasibility study, two line corridors have been proposed. According to on-site

investigation on the main control points, and on the basis of consultation with local

governments and related departments along the line, five possible construction

alternatives (A, B, C, D, E) have been identified. These alternatives are: Bayankuren

bypass the town section (Option A Line), Huhenuoer Lake section (Option B Line),

partly utilizing old roads (Option C Line), along Binzhou Railway line (Option D

Line), and Manzhouli bypass section (Option E Line). In the Positive Line, part of the

sections will be newly built and most part of sections will utilize the old roads in the

line of strike.

9.2.1 Bayankuren bypass the town section (Option A Line)

Option A Line lets the line passing Chenbaerhu Qi bypass Bayankuren Town from the

south. The length of the section (AK line) is 13.00km, starting from AK00+000

(Positive Line K412+000.00) to end post AK13+000.00 (Positive Line

K425+669.01). This is comparable to the positive Line length of 13.67km. Therefore,

the length of Option A Line is 670m shorter than that of Positive Line. As the

through-traffic line, either Option A Line or the Positive Line should be newly built

with 24-m integrated-type roadbed.

cost of Positive Line is 4,547,000 RMB higher than Option A Line. However,

because Option A Line revolves Bayankuren Flood Prevention Dam, local

communication departments and Chenbaerhu Qi government wish to adopt the

Positive Line.

9.2.2 Huhenuoer Lake section (Option B Line)

The option is proposed based on the cut-off of the line. Option B Line starts from the

north side of Chen Qi, passing through the north of Bayankuren Town and

Chagandaobu, and joins with the Positive Line at 15km to Huhenuoer Lake. It starts

from BK00+000 (Positive Line K416+000) and end with BK33+958.541 (Positive

        Recommendation                      Recommended



Hulunbeier City Tourism Bureau ahs planned Hulunbeier as grassland tourism and

resort area, with the north side of Huhenuoer Lake as the core zone. This tourism area

is ecological tourism area, the adoption of Option B Line would destruct the whole

tourism area. Former State Planning and Development Commission (SPDC) have

approved the plan of the tourism and resort area, and the preparatory wok has been

thoroughly carried out. Considering this factor, and also considering that local

government do not support the line, this option is proposed without comparison of the

same depth.

9.2.3 Cuogang ­ Zalainuoer Mineral Area section (Option C Line)

(1) Option C Line

This optional line is proposed based on the curve cut-off of line. Affected by

Zalainuoer gob and development plan, the highway line can only go by the north side

of Zalainuoer Mineral Area, i.e. the junction of the Xinkai River and the lake. The

recommended line goes from Cuogangyakou to the west, and the alternative line goes

to the south from Cuogangyakou along the old road, passing through south side of

Cuogang Pasture, crossing the Hailar River and Binzhou Railway, then going along

Binzhou Railway line until Hubei Village, crossing to the right of Binzhou Railway at

Hubei Village, passing Gaolintege, joining with the positive line at 2km to the east of

intersection of the Xinkai River and the lake, and finally linking with the Positive

Line.


The option line is 57.674km long, starting from CK00+000 and ending at

CK57+674.15. The length of corresponding Positive Line is 37.5km. Option C Line is

20.174km longer than the Positive Line. The previous 45km of Option C Line can

utilize old roads as separate roadbed, while the corresponding Positive Line should

newly build 24-m integrated-type roadbed.

a. Comparison of engineering work

Option C Line partly utilize old roads, but the zigzag line is 20.174km longer than the

Positive Line, and with more cost of 0.209 billion RMB. It will also need to newly

build two bridges over Binzhou Railway.


According to comparison of engineering work and investment cost, the Positive Line

is better than Option C Line.


b.Comparison of eco-environment

  . Line position

The Positive Line deviates the old roads from Cuogangyakou and goes straight to the

west, bypasses the north side of Benpo Lake, goes westward to the wetland, spans

CK57+674.15. The length of corresponding Positive Line is 37.5km. Option C Line is

20.174km longer than the Positive Line.


  Economic comparison

In comparison of cost of investment, Positive Line can save about 210 million RMB

than Option C Line.

  Comparison of Positive Line (K511+849-K540+000) and Option C Line

(CK0+000- CK44+874)

The Positive Line section K511+849-K540+000 is 28.15 km long, being newly built

highway. The line goes through the pastures in the west of Cuogang and bypasses the

north side of Benpo Lake at nearby K530.


Option C Line section CK0+000-CK47+000 is 44.87 km long, utilizing and expanded

old Highway 301.


Considering the new area of land occupation, the Positive Line requires a new land

occupation area of 67.56ha, while Option C Line needs 53.8ha. The Positive Line

occupies 13.76 ha more area than Option C Line. Additionally, duo to the utilization

of old roads, Option C Line may have less environmental impact than Positive Line in

the Construction and Operation Periods.


  Comparison of Positive Line (K540+000-K549+349.502) and Option C Line

(CK44+874-CK57+674.150)

After Positive Line goes into the wetland, until the east side of the Hailar River, the

highway section is about 4.5km long. It is the second bottom on the east side of the

Hailar River, with relatively flat topology, distributed with less-fluctuating stabilized

sand dunes. The willow shrubs (including Salix viminalis L., etc.) are the main

vegetation, and under the willow shrubs and among the shrubs are rich mesophytic

weeds. There are seasonal accumulated water at local enclosed-flow low lands and

ditches, and the section with accumulated water is 300m long. At the section about

400m to the east bank of the Hailar River, are willow shrubs and Carex marshes,

growing with dense willow shrubs and herbages. The section has seasonal water

accumulation, starting from the Hailar River Bridge and on the west bank of the

Hailar River, and ending at the outlet of wetland. In this section area, there are

distributed Phragmites australis marsh, Carex marsh, Deyeuxia angustifolia, Agrostis

gigantean and weeds marshes. The length of this section is about 4.8km.


Option C Line goes into the wetlands after crossing Binzhou Railway on the west side

of Hubei Village. It passes Gaolintege (Tuweiba Mountain) and joins with the

Positive Line at 2km to the east of intersection of the Xinkai River and the lake. It is

12.8 km from Binzhou Railway to the joint with Positive Line. The landform of this

section is river and lake flood plains among the Hailar River, the Xinkai River and


                                                188

                  EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway


Erzi Lake. The topological relief is low and the marsh wetlands develop well,

distributed with many small river ditches, river branches and small lakes. There is a

large scope of water accumulation in the section area, and the river ditches, river

branches and some small lakes even have perennially accumulative water. The main

plants include Phragmites australis (Cav.)Trin.ex Steudel, Carex marsh, Deyeuxia

angustifolia, Agrostis gigantean and weeds marshes. These vegetations are inter-

growing and dense, and have been the habitats of many birds. The section will also

goes through the drink water source of Manzhouli City, with the water source wells

and water transmission pipes distributed in the scope from the north part of

Gaolintege (Tuweiba Mountain) to the side of the Hailar River.


In comparison of the characteristics of wetland sections that Positive Line and Option

C Line pass, the Positive Line is 9.3km long from the wetland to the joint with Option

C Line. Among this section, 5.1km has seasonal water accumulation and serious

swampiness, others are terraces of the east bank of the Hailar River with relatively

high relief and have slight swampiness. Option C Line is 12.8 km long from the

wetland (after crossing Binzhou Railway) to the joint with Positive Line. The whole

section is marshland with seasonal water accumulation, and distributed with river

ditches and river branches. The swampiness is serious.


The length of the two optional sections is basically the same, but Option C line has

more serious swampiness, poor construction conditions and goes through the drink

water source of Manzhouli City. Therefore, the Option C has more negative impacts

than Positive Line, including impacts on wetland landscape structure, wetland natural

connectivity, wetland vegetations, wetland animals, and drink water source.


  Comprehensive comparison

In comparison of Positive Line (K511+849-K540+000) and Option C Line

(CK0+000- CK44+874), Option C Line has less environmental impact. In comparison

of Positive Line (K540+000-K549+349.502) and Option C Line (CK44+874-

CK57+674.150), Positive Line has less environmental impact. Considering that

Option C Line would go through Erka Wetland with serious swampiness and would

go through the waster source of Manzhouli City, in comprehensive comparison,

Positive Line will have less impact than Option C Line.


Comprehensively considering the engineering, economy and environment factors,

Positive Line is superior to Option C Line.

9.2.4 Along the railway line (Option D Line)

This option is proposed according to the orientation of railway line. Option D Line

starts from Fengdou Seed Multiplication Farm on the east side of Hailar, passing

through the area between Hailar and the airport, crossing the Yimin River at the south

to Team 1 of Heping, going along the West Mountain protective forest until reaching

Xiaoliang. From Xiaoliang to Cuogang Town, the option line is basically parallel to

Binzhou Railway. It passes through Daliang, Wugunuoer, Wulanqiu, Wangong,

Qiuling and Heerhongde, and joins with Option C Line at the south side of Cuogang

Pasture. Afterwards, it is the same as Line C, finally joining with the positive line at

2km to the east of intersection of the Xinkai River and the lake.


The Option D Line is 170.28km long, and the corresponding Positive Line is 169.4km

long. The Option D Line is 1 km longer.


In comparison of the engineering geology, the two options belong to two different

corridors. The recommended Positive Line is located on the north side of the Hailar

River and Option D Line on the south side of the Hailar River. The Option D Line is

located on the sand belt at Hailar-Cuohgang distributed from the east to west, and thus

the sand prevention engineering work would be great. In addition, most of the Option

D Line area is currently semi-stabilized sand land, with sandy plants growing well.

The implementation of Option D Line will lead to destruction of vegetation and

further the desertification. Option D Line is along the railway and near to Hailar

District. It is favorable to the form of the highway circling Hailar District. But 120km

of the total line is sand dune with severe desertification. The ecology is fragile. The

outbound distance is somewhat large since there is scarce material along the line.


Therefore, from both aspects of engineering geological conditions and environmental

impact, the recommended line is the best option.

9.2.5 Manzhouli bypass section (Option E Line)

The recommended line goes through the north of Manzhouli City, deviates from the

old line at 4km to the east of Manzhouli City, passes by the north side of the

Oxidization Pond, and links with Manzhouli Port Road by level cross. The Option E

Line goes along State Highway 301, and passing through the downtown of

Manzhouli.


Option E Line and the recommended line are both located in the hilly areas and the

mountain front slopes. They have similar engineering geology, mainly with andesite

and reduced stone soil.


In comparison of the cost of investment, Option E Line can save about 55 million

RMB than Positive Line.


Option E Line is 1.16km shorter than Positive Line and can use the old Highway 301.

But many sections have turned into urban streets along the line, with great transverse

disturbance. Therefore, Positive Line is recommended after comparison.

9.2.6 The Feasibility of utilizing old State Highway 301

Most of sections from the starting pint to Cuogangyakou of Hailar-Manzhouli

Highway will utilize old State Highway 301 or basically be in the same line of strike

as the original highway.


The recommended Positive Line disports with old Highway 301 at Cuogangyakou

section, and goes straight to the west. Option C Line partly utilizes old Highway 301,

deviates the old road at 6.8km to the east of Zalainuoer Railway Station, and goes

through Erka Wetland to the north of the Mineral Area. Both the Positive Line and

Option C Line avoid Zalainuoer Mineral Area. The following reasons determine that

the highway line cannot go through Zalainuoer Mineral Area along the old road:


(1) Poor underground conditions of old Highway 301

The mine of Zalainuoer Mineral Area was built in 1902. Currently, the subsidence

zone of the area is big, and the subsidence zone is even moving downward. In the

scope of Zalainuoer Mineral Area, the old Highway 301 spans, from west to east, the

boundary of 4 mines respectively in Beixie Mine, Tiebei Mine, Lingdong Plan Area

and Tienan Plan Area.


According to Report on the Loss from Coal Mine Subsidence in Zalainuoer Mineral

Area, the old Highway 301 passes through North Subsidence Zone and Tiebei

Subsidence Zone. In North Subsidence Zone was caused by exploitation at Beixie

Mine Fields of Xishan Mine, with maximum subsidence 5.9m, maximum level move

1.4m, maximum sloping distortion 73.6mm/m, maximum level distortion 28.4 mm/m

and -26.1 mm/m. In Tiebei Subsidence Zone, the maximum subsidence is 3.0m,

maximum level move 0.6m, maximum sloping distortion 28.5 mm/m, and maximum

level distortion 10.8 mm/m and -10.3 mm/m. The geological condition in the Mineral

(2) Insufficient space for highway land use

The existing Hailar-Manzhouli Highway was built on natural roads on the grassland.

It was expanded according to Grade 3 highway criteria in 1994. To the nouth side of it

lies the water transmission pipeline of the second water source of Manzhouli in the

section of Zhalainuoer Mineral Area. The pipeline is about 10m to the highway slope

base at the nearest distance. The Binzhou Railway is on the sorth side of the highway.

The space between old Highway 301 and Binzhou is reserved for the expanding

construction of complex line of Binzhou Railway. The proposed highway is of Grade


                                                194

1, with 24m-width pavement, and the current pavement width cannot meet with the

land use width requirement of Grade 1 Highway.



9.2.7 Comparison of Construction Project with "No Construction Option"

The necessity of projection construction is as follows:

a.  The proposed project is one part of the plan of "Five North-South Lines and

    Seven West-East Lines" of China's state highways, as well as the important

    component of the first west-east line of Inner Mongolia's plan for "Three West-

    East Lines, Nine North-South Lines and Twelve Exits". It is also the main

    passage connecting Hulunbeier City and other provinces and regions in the east of

    China. The construction of the project is necessary for the improvement of the

    state trunk highway system and adaptation to the state strategy of Great Western

    Development.

b. Manzhouli is China's biggest land route port. The proposed project will directly

    connect with Manzhouli Port, and link current highways and highways under

    construction in Hulunbeier and three provinces in Northeast China to form a

    highway (or express) network. This will promote port development, flourish

    border trading, and facilitate formation of international great land passage in

    northeast Asia.

c.  Hulunbeier has rich tourism resources. The proposed project will bring about the

    development of tourism and local economy.

d. The current highway is of Grade 3, and has been seriously harmed duo to

    multiyear operation and destruction of natural disasters. The implementation of

    this project will enhance the grade of the highway, and thus meet the increasing

    need of regional traffic flow.


The implementation of this project will have some social environmental, water

environmental, ambient air, noise environmental, and eco-environmental impacts in

the Construction and Operation Periods, which have been discussed in previous

chapters. The implementation of this project will attract traffics from highways in

surrounding areas. This additional traffic flow has been considered in the Feasibility

Report.


"No Construction Option" means no implementation of rebuilding and expanding
construction of Hailar ­ Manzhouli Highway. Compared with the Construction
Project Option, this option will not have environmental impact problems in the short
term. But in the long term, with the growth of traffic flow, the section may become
the "bottleneck" of the state trunk highway. The increasing of traffic flow and the
deterioration of disease of original highway will lead to more traffic accidents and
more human harms and economic loss. Also, the traffic jam will cause air and noise


                                               195

pollution on the environment in some sections.


Therefore, the Construction Project Option is better than "No Construction Option".

Chapter 10 Public Consultation

As one of the important infrastructure constructions, the highway construction plays

an important role in the society, economy and people's life. While bringing social and

economic profits, it may result in some disadvantageous impacts on local resident life

and ecological environment. In order to widely collect the opinions of the local cadres

and masses against the highways to be constructed and gather the public concerning

on building highway, the public opinions along the highway line to be built were

investigated simultaneously with the environmental investigation along the line.


10.1 Investigation Scope, Contents and Methods


10.1.1 Investigation scope and object

The investigation scope mainly included those towns and villages located on the both

sides of the highway to be constructed and directly impacted. The investigation

objects included representatives of the task parties (such as responsible persons of

town and village governments, affair offices, village committees, or resident

committees), common masses (including farmers, herdsmen, parcel residents, etc.),

and masses to be directly influenced by the highway (including dismantling and

moving households) in order to make the investigation results more accurate.

10.1.2 Investigation contents

In the investigation, the following contents were collected:

(1) The investigation objects' concerning on the highway to be constructed;

(2) The investigation objects' concrete requirements and opinions against the line

     routes and design; and

(3) The local social and economic status, human and cultural features including folk

     customs.

10.1.3 Investigation methods

The investigation was performed mainly in the forms of holding meetings and

providing questionnaires for the public consultation.


(1) Public Consultation Investigation Meeting

On the phases of the EIA TOR and EIA Report, the public consultation investigation

meetings were held in Hailar, West Wuzhuer, and Manzhouli Cities, respectively. The

meeting communiqués were published on the local newspapers and the EIA TOR or

EIA Report was provided for public review in advance a week before the meetings.

(2) Public Consultation Questionnaire

First, the main issues of the highway construction project were introduced to the

investigation objects, including basic background, project scale, line route,

advantageous and disadvantageous impacts on the localities. Then, the investigation

objects filled up the questionnaires or presented oral opinions voluntarily. Finally, the

summary and analysis were performed after sorting out and submitting. The format of

the public consultation investigation questionnaire is given in Table 10-1.

a.   There are the local herdsman mostly on the left side of the line and the grassland

     on the right side. It is expected to reserve the pathways for cows and sheep and

     grass-threshing cars.

b. Because there are many cows and sheep to go to the places where there are water

     resources along the line, it is suggested to reserve the pathways for them to avoid

     traffic accidents.

c.   Because it is often strong raining in summer season and road surface is covered

     by water after raining, it is suggested reserve enough culverts.

d. Because the grasslands may be destroyed severely during the construction period,

     it is suggested to control land range occupied by the construction and to level the

     lands and sow grass seeds after the construction.

e.   To protect the grassland tourism resources, it is suggested that the waste earth

     yards should not be allocated within the fields of vision along the line and should

     be allocated on the mountain rear, and that soil should be extracted as level as

     possibly and, then, the recovery measures(Refer to Table6-4) must be taken and

     grass mast be planted.

f.   To protect the wetlands, it is suggested not to allocate the level crosses at the

     wetland areas to prevent vehicles from going down the line.

g. The costs for environmental protection (land-leveling, grass-planting and

     recovery, and pavement- and passenger-overpass-bridge-cleaning after the

     construction, etc.) should be included in the project budget.

h. Because of strong snow in winter season, it should be considered in the design to

     avoid snow remaining on the road surface.

i.   It is suggested that some of small culverts are replaced by the plate-covering or

     big ones to facilitate herdsmen' traveling.

j.   For herdsmen' dismantling and moving due to the highway construction, they

     would agree to do that if the houses are rebuilt.


They hope that the project can be implemented as soon as possible to improve the

local traffic situation and promote the local economy.


The above issues were forwarded to the highway design institution. And the design

institution will consider the public suggestions and carry on the associated

adjustments on the original design phase. The number of culverts is increased form

104 in original design to 110, and the pathways and passenger overpasses from 30 to

47.

The associated solution suggestions against the concrete issues proposed by the

public are described in the Chapter 8 on the environmental protection measurements

of the report.

    10.2.2 The Public Consultation Questionnaire

    The two hundred questionnaires were distributed to people of the diverse social levels

    along the highway line. Their ages, educational levels, and nationalities are given in

    Table 10-4.

From the table it may be seen that all of the people surveyed agreed with the highway

construction project and line scheme, and thought the highway would be favorable to

the local economic development and the living quality improvement; 7.7% of the

inquirees knew the highway construction policies and the compensation policies for

dismantle and move, 48.7% knew some, and 43.6% did not know; for occupying

some of grassland and farmland and dismantling and moving some buildings because

of the highway construction, 43.6% of the inquirees had objection, 48.7% did not

  have, and 7.7% did not know; for the land-imposing, dismantling and moving, and

  resettlement, 12.8% of the inquirees obeyed that and 87.2% obeyed under some

  conditions; among the noise, vehicle exhaust gas and resuspended dust, 53.8% of the

  inquirees considered there is big noise impacted by the highway construction; for the

  environmental impact during the expected construction period, 84.6% of the inquirees

  would accept that, 12.8% did not care, and 2.6% hardly accepted; among the three

  measures to reduce the environmental impact, i.e. highway greening, sound barrier,

  and keeping distance from the villages, 69.2% of the inquirees selected the highway

  greening.


  For the other comments and suggestions, 21 persons, 10.5% of the total inquirees,

  proposed some suggestions that piling earth matrixes should be done on sites,

  grasslands should be occupied as less as possible, grassland ecological protection

  should be emphasized, and pollution from traffic roads should be reduced.


  10.3 Summary


(1) Through the public consultation investigation, the project significances and potential

   disadvantageous impacts and protection measures to be adapted were understood by

   the residents of the towns and villages which are located on the both sides of the

   highway line to be constructed; the public opinions and suggestions against the

   project were collected and forwarded to the design and operation management

   institutions simultaneously to ensure to be implemented.


(2) The project was supported and understood by the residents along the highway line.

   The public surveyed considered that the highway construction would be favorable to

   the local economic development and the living quality improvement.

11.4Implementation of Environmental Measures


In order to guarantee the smooth implementation of various environmental protection measures,

in the Project Preparatory Period and Construction Period, the following measures should be

considered:

a) The EIA reports and Action Plan should be dispatched to tendering units as the tendering

documents. The tendering units will formulate the tendering documents according to the

environmental protection program.


b) While Inner Mongolia Department of Communication signs the contract with the

construction contractors, the Environmental Action Plan should be put as an annex to the

contracts.


c) Each contractor should assign a person responsible for the environment. Before the

construction, Inner Mongolia Department of Communication should organize the construction

environmental protection staff to hold workshops to discuss and understand the environmental

protection measures.


d) Before the construction, the construction environmental protection staff should provide

environmental protection training to the construction workers.

CHAPTER 12 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
EXPENDITURE ESTIMATE AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

12.1 Environmental Protection Expenditure Estimate


According to the environmental protection program, environmental monitoring program and

personnel training, etc., the estimate of the environmental protection expenditures of the

proposed project is shown in Table 12-1. All the expenditures will be accounted in

corresponding documents ("funding source" column) to facilitate implementation. Considering

that water drainage and roadbed engineering has been listed in the Feasibility Study Report as

the main engineering expenditure, except for these two measures, the total amount of

environmental protection expenditures will be 10.863 RMB, accounting 0.5% of the total

investment of the project.


                                                                      Table 12-1 Estimate of Environmental Protection Expenditures

CHAPTER 13 CONCLUSIONS

13.1 Current Environmental Status Assessment


13.1.1 Social environment

Hailar District and Manzhouli City in the project area are the economic and communication

center in the east of Inner Mongolia, to be developed to the zone bringing along the surrounding

economic development. However, the present economy along the line is still weak and the

resources have not played their full roles.

(1) The main industry is livestock production, the per capita income at the average level of

    Inner Mongolia.

(2) The project area is multi-nationality settlement area, with Han, Meng, Man, Ewenke, Hui

    and Korean nationalities, etc.

13.1.2 Surface water environment

Affected by municipal wastewater discharge and eutrophication of Dalai Lake, the Morigele

River, the Hailar River and the Xinkai River are in organic pollution at present, with COD

concentration exceeding the national standard.

13.1.3 Ambient air

The ambient air quality in the assessment area is clean, with NO2 and TSP meeting with Class 2
standard requirements.

13.1.4 Noise environment

The ambient noise is 45.6~63.5dB(A) in the daytime and 39.2~54.6 dB(A) at night at the

residential areas along the project line, meeting with Level 4 standard.

13.1.5 Eco-environment

1 The natural landscape is mainly Hulunbeier typical grassland, distributed with large rivers,

    lakes and marsh wetlands.

2 The animal and plant resources are rich in the region. In Erka Wetland through which the

    project line goes, there are 6 species of Class I national protective birds, and 26 species of

    Class II national protective birds.

3 The land functions in the project area are mainly in natural conditions, with a few towns and

    residential areas. The land resources are rich.
4 The soil erosion grade in the project area: water erosion 1000~3800 t/km2·a, mostly being

    slight grade. The soil erosion is mainly wind erosion, with the degree of Grade II~IV, and

    mainly with Grade II.

13.1.6 Wetland

(1) The highway line goes through Erka Wetland. The length of the wetland section is 13.2km.

(2) The soil in the wetland area includes mainly salinized meadow soil, salinized Castanozems

    soil, meadow bog soil, alkalized meadow soil, meadow alkali soil, meadow Castanozems

    soil, alkalized Castanozems soil, Aeolian soil, and sandy Castanozems soil.

(3) The landscape is mainly comprised of wetland landscape and sand wetland landscape.

(4) Based on the survey on Erka Wetland, there have been found 257 species vascular plants,

    respectively belonging to 57 families and 165 genera.

(5) There is a record of 226 species of wild animals (vertebrates) in Erka Wetland, including 37

    fishes, 10 amphibians and reptiles, 38 mammals and 141 birds (including 6 species of Class

    I national protective birds, and 26 species of Class II national protective birds).


13.2 Environmental Impact Assessment of the Project


13.2.1 Social environment

The project construction will have good economic benefits, powerful anti-risk ability. The

project is feasible.

(1) The construction of the project is the need of establishing the main framework of national

    highway network, state highway layout and Inner Mongolia highway network. It is also an

    important act of the central government to improve the infrastructure in Inner Mongolia.

    The project will have obvious social and economic benefits, play pivot roles in the regional

    development of commerce and trade, industry, agriculture and livestock production,

    communication and tourism, and bring along the economic development along the line.

(2) The land acquisition area will be 1083.65ha (pasture and wetland 66.1%; forest land 0.3%;

    bare land 17.3%; current roads 14.4%; dry land 0.6%; sand land 1.2%). The routing of the

    project line is reasonable, avoiding the cities alongside. Economic compensation and

    resettlement will be provided for land acquisition and demolition and moving. The life of

    the herdsmen will not be obviously affected.

(3) Effective engineering measures will be implemented to protect the water conservation

    facilities, surface water system and highway network along the project line, and facilitate

    the production and traveling of local herdsmen.

13.2.2 Surface water environment

(1) The rainwater of the bridge surface in the Operation Period of the project will not have

    major impact on the water quality in the Morigele River, the Hailar River and the Xinkai

    River. The current water quality of these rivers can be maintained.

Living sewage from service areas, management agencies, toll gates and maintenance zones and

the vehicle washing water from service areas must be treated to meet with the national

standards before discharge.

There will be very small risk possibility of accidents with serious impacts at the water bodies



                                                      225

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



and wetlands. But effective preventive measures should be adopted to avoid the accidents.

13.2.3 Ambient air

The wind speed is big, and the air diffusion ability is strong in the project area. The tail gas

from the vehicles will have no obvious impacts on the ambient air quality in the Operation

Period.

13.2.4 Noise environment

(1) In the Operation Period, the traffic noise will have obvious impact on the villages along the

    line. If the residential houses are near to the highway line, the ambient noise will partly

    exceed the standard value.

(2) If the measures in Table 8-1 are adopted, more sound insulation windows for residential

    houses if exceeding the standard, the ambient noise quality at the villages along the

    highway line will meet with the national standards in the long term.

13.2.5 Eco-environment

(1) The land acquisition for the project construction will not have obvious impact on the

    structure of land uses in the areas along the line. The permanent land occupation of the

    engineering will not have major impact on the biomass, and will have no influence on the

    types and characteristics of regional eco-environment.

(2) In the Construction Period, the land occupation by the engineering, the temporary land

    occupation and the land use of earth borrowing yards, etc. will bring about some loss of

    vegetation in a short term. The vegetation rehabilitation, reclamation of earth borrowing

    yards and planting of drought-proof forests, etc. can compensate and restore the original

    vegetation.

(3) The implementation of greening works, drought-proof forests and water conservation forest

    in the land use area of the project will facilitate the construction of green passage works in

    the region.

(4) The occupation of pastures in the project will worsen the decreasing trend of grass yield

    along the line. The adoption of land resource protection measures will minimize these

    impacts.

(5) After the highway is put into operation, the impact on wild animals and plants will be

    mainly in Erka Wetland section.

13.2.6 Wetland

(1) Erka Wetland has rich animal and plant resources. The operation of the proposed project

    will mainly affect the birds, but have less impact on fish, amphibians, reptiles and

    mammals.

(2) The impact scope of the highway on the birds will be within 300m on both sides, with the

    impact area of about 792ha, or 1.5% of the total wetland area. After the operation of the




                                                     226

                       EIA for Hailar­Manzhouli Section of Shuifenhe-Manzhouli Highway



    highway, some birds may flee far away the highway line area. The adoption of effective

    engineering measures can minimize the impact.

13.2.7 Alternatives Comparison

According to the comparison of environmental impacts between alternatives for different

sections, the Positive Line option has the smallest impact on the environment. This

recommended option by the EIA is in consistence with the recommended option in the

Feasibility Study.

13.2.8 EIA in the Construction Period

In the Construction Period, the sewage and garbage from the construction camps and the

construction of bridges will affect the water environment. Large-scale mechanical operation,

material transportation, lime-soil mixing and bitumen-mixture mixing, etc. will result in serious

responded dust and noise pollution in the areas along the highway line. The large-scale earth

borrowing will also destruct vegetation and deteriorate soil erosion.


Although the environmental impacts in the Construction Period are in short term,

environmental measures must be adopted according to the environmental protection program

(see Table 11-3) in the Construction Period, so as to minimize or alleviate the environmental

impacts in the Construction Period.


13.3 Overall Conclusions


The construction of Hailar ­ Manzhouli Highway will have outstanding socioeconomic benefits

and thus have been widely supported by the public. The routing of highway line is reasonable,

with the route avoiding cities and towns such as Hailar District, Bayankuren Town, Zalainuoer

Mineral Area and Manzhouli City. In the Operation Period, the impact of the project on the life

of people is mainly noise impact. Duo to the geographical position, the line has to go through

Erka Wetland, which may generate some impact on the wetland ecology. It is suggested that

environmental prevention and control measures be implemented in accordance with the

environmental protection program, including implementation of highway conservation works,

water drainage works, overall greening scheme, rehabilitation of vegetation in temporary land

uses, and demolition and moving of nearby houses. This can effectively protect human living

environment in the area along the line, and control the impacts on soil erosion and the birds.


In a word, the construction of this proposed project is feasible in respect of environmental

protection.
