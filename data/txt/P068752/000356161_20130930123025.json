Inner Mongolia Highway\n            and Trade Corridor Project for China were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: international independent audit of current\n            traffic volumes and projected traffic growth. This project\n            has highlighted the optimistic estimation of current traffic\n            and estimated traffic growth; a major economic factor in the\n            evaluation of the viability of transport infrastructure.\n            Reduced and more focused use of international supervision\n            consultants for the shorter, more specific or specialized\n            technical tasks. The contribution of the international\n            consultant (IC) was mainly related to project management\n            support and training. Proper soil compaction or\n            consolidation, adequate drainage and sufficient insulation\n            must all be considered at design stage in order for a road\n            to survive long winters. Design of projects should also take\n            into consideration climate changes which could mean higher\n            rainfall and colder winter temperatures. Further efforts\n            needed to overcome institutional barriers and achieve better\n            coordination across department involved in road transport.\n            The inclusion of reform or policy related issues within a\n            project often face problems because their implementation\n            often falls outside the jurisdiction of the implementation\n            institution. Internal delays in the approval of variation\n            orders have led to late payments to contractors, hence\n            delays in finalizing contracts."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
