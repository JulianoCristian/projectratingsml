Resettlement\n            planning will be based on property values, and compensation\n            standards in compliance with China's laws and\n            regulations, and with the Bank's operational directive\n            on involuntary resettlement, to improve, or at least restore\n            the living standards, and income of project affected people\n            (PAP). The use of local natural resources, and animal\n            husbandry practices will continue as possible, as will\n            related secondary and tertiary industries, and, in addition,\n            compensation and subsidies shall guarantee income\n            restoration, and living standards of affected people.\n            Whereas it is expected land acquisition overall, will have\n            minor impacts, compensation will be paid in cash, in\n            accordance with consultations held with affected people,\n            contrary to land replacement, which was viewed negatively.\n            For practical purposes, compensation for land losses will be\n            determined at market value prices, prior to relocation. The\n            report further stipulates public facilities will continue\n            providing services, and the cost for water and electricity\n            has been included in the compensation for house\n            reconstruction expenses. Moreover, housing reconstruction\n            shall take into account prior habits, suitable for\n            agricultural requirements, and, new housing will be take\n            place prior to demolition, thus, no temporary housing will\n            be required. Vulnerable groups will be able to choose the\n            construction sites, and fields to be redistributed\n            preferentially. Conditions of animal husbandry are key\n            factors influencing its efficiency, and production,\n            therefore education in agricultural, and animal husbandry\n            science and technology will be reinforced, to enhance the\n            labor force capacity. Furthermore, medium and small scale\n            enterprises will be expanded or developed, according the\n            local environment market conditions, seeking to mobilize the\n            local economy."}, "docdt": "2005-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
