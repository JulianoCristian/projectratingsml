1. 
Country and Sector Background 
The strategic objectives for China according to the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of 
November 2002 are to: 
·
Improve the investment climate; 
·
Accelerate the transition to a market economy; 
·
Address the needs of disadvantaged groups and underdeveloped regions; and 
·
Facilitate a more sustainable development process. 
In this strategic context, the CAS recommends Bank intervention in the following areas of the 
transportation sector: 
·
Financing economic infrastructure in key growth corridors, including seaport and 
external trade corridors and corridors serving western provinces; and to reduce inter- and 
intra-regional development disparities. 
·
Financing infrastructure to serve poorer communities, thereby improving productivity in 
rural areas; and  
·
Facilitating the development of institutions necessary for managing the infrastructure 
network and planning in China’s rapidly growing market economy.  
Exports have played an important role in China’s strong economic growth in recent years. However, 
because internal transport costs are high, coastal provinces have benefited more from this growth than 
have inland provinces. Costs are high in part because of distance, but also because of inefficient or 
inappropriate pricing and weak intermodal logistics. If inland provinces are to have a meaningful share of 
China’s booming export trade, access to these provinces must improve, and constraints on the 
transportation of goods must be overcome.

Development objective. 
The main objective of the project is to promote and sustain the development of 
China’s cross-border trade between China on one hand and Russia and Mongolia on the other by 
improving transport infrastructure and logistics. These improvements, in turn, will lower transport costs, 
increase income from external trade, and raise incomes in Inner Mongolia, the country’s third-largest 
province and one of the poorest provinces of the western region.  
Key performance indicators.
 The principal outcome or impact indicators selected for monitoring progress 
in achieving the project development objective are: 
·
For the Hailar-Manzhouli Highway (HMH) and the Border Roads for Trade (BRFT) 
components
:
—
Traffic time (projected to be reduced by at least 50% after HMH completion) 
—
Traffic volume, especially of trade cargo (projected to increae by 100% after HMH 
completion) 
—
Cargo diversion rate from the overburdened rail mode of transport (projected at at least 10%) 
 
·
For the Cargo Transfer Terminal (CTT) 
-
volume of cargo passing through the CTT 
(projected to increase by factor of four by 2008).  
·
For the Institutional Strengthening and Training (IST) component  
-
improvement in 
efficiency and capacity of local governments to manage the HMH and BRFT 
infrastructure facilities and promote border trade, measured in numbers of staff trained 
who remain in the jobs for which they received training (projected at at least half those 
trained). 
Besides investment in transport links to Russia and Mongolia and expanding highway network capacity in 
the relatively poor northeastern corridor of Inner Mongolia, the main challenge of the project is to 
strengthen institutional capacity and policy development capability in logistics for trade between China 
on one hand and Russia and Mongolia on the other. Technical assistance will be provided to help setting a 
foundation for further capacity improvement of Inner Mongolia, particularly Hulunbeier League, to plan, 
facilitate, and expand international trade.  
The proposed project is designed with the clear objective of maximizing the use of transport infrastructure 
to promote international trade through Inner Mongolia in general and Hulunbeier League in particular. It 
will help accelerate the general development of Hulunbeier League, preparing it to cope with the 
increasingly important role the central government has assigned to it to be the country’s main contact 
point for trading with Russia. In so doing, the project aims to: (i) improve the capacity of transport 
infrastructure and network planning to handle the significant increase in the volume of international 
freight traffic along China’s northeastern border; (ii) develop a freight transfer and trade facilitation 
program to meet the growing demand for cross-border trade; and (iii) provide technical assistance to the 
Inner Mongolia Communications Department (IMCD) and Hulunbeier to build their capacity to plan, 
facilitate, and manage increasing demand for transportation of international trade traffic. 
3. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement 
The roles of the cities of Manzhouli and Hailar have increased in importance as trade between China and 
its neighbors expands in this era of trade liberalization and globalization. Border trade between China and 
Russia has been growing at about 20 percent per year for the past 4–5 years, although from a relatively 
low base. Trade statistics in 2002 showed about 10 million tons of freight moved between the two 
countries—9 million by rail and 1 million by road. At estimated growth rates of 20 percent for the next 
five years and 10 percent for the subsequent five years, the trade volume is expected to reach 30 million 
tons by 2009 and 42 million tons by 2013. With such a significant increase in trade volume expected,

A
serious consideration must be given now to investment in transport links and facilities to move and handle 
cargo in Hulunbeier.  
Manzhouli, as a result of the blossoming of trade between China and Russia, has become the second-
largest international land port in China after Shenzhen (near Hong Kong). Despite its importance, it is 
essentially a border checkpoint and has no cargo terminal except for some private facilities belonging to 
large importers and exporters. Small shippers and traders that do not have their own premises need 
common loading and unloading facilities. 
Furthermore, Russian trucks, which carry about 90 percent of cargo crossing the border by road, are not 
permitted in Chinese territory beyond Hailar; cargo for destinations beyond Hailar has to be carried by 
Chinese trucks. A terminal for transferring cargo between Russian and Chinese trucks and between modes 
(road and rail), and for distributing and consolidating cargo in the Hulunbeier area, is necessary for 
promoting trade. 
Trade and Transport in Hulunbeier, Inner Mongolia 
Hulunbeier has a total land area of 253,000 sq. km (80 percent the size of Vietnam), but with a 
population of only 2.7 million, it is one of the most thinly populated areas of China. However, it is 
strategically important because of its long border with Russia (1,048 km) and Mongolia (676 
km). It has five border crossings with Russia and two with Mongolia. All but one of the border 
crossings are seasonally open with bilateral arrangement. The exception, the Manzhouli 
crossing, was upgraded in 1996 to function as an international land port. Currently about 60 
percent of trade between China and Russia passes through the land port of Manzhouli. Russian 
trucks are allowed to travel about 200 km into China from Manzhouli to Hailar (capital of 
Hulunbeier League), while Chinese trucks are allowed to travel 500 km into Russia from the 
Zabaykal’sk checkpoint across from Manzhouli. The Russians and the Chinese recently have 
negotiated a reciprocal deal and the Chinese have agreed to prepare road and freight transfer 
facilities in the next 1–2 years so that Russian trucks can travel 500 km into China. Imports from 
Russia to China consist of mainly raw materials— timber and minerals—while exports to Russia 
are agricultural and consumer goods. Hulunbeier’s economy relies heavily on this foreign trade, 
which makes up about 40 percent of Inner Mongolia’s foreign trade. The following table 
summarizes a few key features of Hulunbeier’s economy.

The CAS identifies the strengthening of regional integration and competitiveness through a well-
functioning transportation system as a key objective in the transport sector. The project will help meet the 
sector-related CAS objectives of facilitating trade (domestic and international), improving regional and 
market integration, and fostering the development of western regions, whose development lags behind 
that of coastal areas. One of the critical features of the proposed project is the expansion of the transport 
route between China and Russia. As a multilateral organization, the Bank has the unique capacity to liaise 
with other countries across the border and is in a good position to advise China on this critical 
undertaking. 
4. Description 
The project includes the following components:  
·
Component 1
—Hailar–Manzhouli Highway. 
Expansion of highway capacity by 
upgrading or constructing about 177 km of HMH. The component is estimated to cost 
about US$172 million, of which US$70 million will be financed by the World Bank;  
·
Component 2—Border Roads for Trade.
 Upgrading and rehabilitation of about 413 km of 
the highway network, sections identified either as key links for international trade 
facilitation at smaller border crossings with Russia and Mongolia, or as critical missing 
links in the highway network. The component aims to improve transport access to four 
other seasonal land ports between China and Russia and China and Mongolia. The 
component is estimated to cost about US$51 million, of which US$18 million will be 
financed by the Bank. 
·
Component 3—Cargo transfer terminal and trade facilitation program.
 Development of 
facilities and trade regime designed mainly for China’s import and export trade with 
Russia and Mongolia, but also meeting the requirements of potential trade in transit 
shipped through Chinese seaports to other countries. The primary purpose of the CTT is 
to facilitate the consolidation, distribution, and trucking of cargo. The component is 
composed of: (i) construction of a transfer station in Hailar housing facilities for 
transferring cargo between transportation modes (rail and road) and between Chinese and 
Russian trucks as well as for warehousing; and (ii) carrying out of a diagnostic study on 
measures to promote cross-border trade between China and its land-locked neighbors.  
The study could later form a foundation to further improve a process for the quick and 
convenient inspection and clearance of cargo by customs and quarantine authorities; and 
to develop an internationally accepted trade documentation and practices for importers 
and exporters, transportation carriers, banks, and insurance companies.  The component 
is estimated to cost about US$26 million, and will be financed locally. 
·
Component 4
—Institutional strengthening and training.
 Various technical assistance and 
training aiming to improve the quality of development zone planning, trade promotion, 
and transportation efficiency, as well as project management, environmental monitoring, 
and supervision of highway construction. The component is estimated to cost about 
US$1.2 million and will be financed by the Bank.

6. Implementation 
Technically, IMCD has overall responsibility for project preparation and implementation. It will be 
directly responsible for formulating, implementing, and managing the project. However, administratively, 
the local government of Hulunbeier has responsibility for making local arrangements related to 
environmental safeguards, land acquisition, and resettlement arrangements for project-affected people. A 
project management office has been established in the Hulunbeier branch of the IMCD in Hai Man (the 
HMPMO), headed by a deputy director general of IMCD and co-chaired by the mayor of Hulunbeier. The 
HMPMO will assume overall implementation and coordination responsibility for all components and 
every aspect of the project.  
The CTT component will be developed and operated in the first instance by the Hulunbeier government. 
Depending on demand, various facilities in the terminal may be leased and operated by the private sector. 
The project will be implemented 2004
–2009. Overall direction of the project at the central level rests with 
MOC in Beijing. The Bank loan will be lent to the borrower, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which will 
on-lend the loan proceeds to Inner Mongolia.  
7. Sustainability 
The strong commitment of the central, provincial, and local Hulunbeier governments to the project is the 
main indication of the sustainability of the project. Furthermore, the project has national importance 
because it is part of the State Council’s plan to expand border trade with Russia through the Hailar–
Manzhouli corridor. For their parts, MOC and the government of Inner Mongolia already have approved 
RMB 790 million and RMB 500 million, respectively, as the state and provincial contributions to the 
project.  
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
OED’s recent assessment of the Bank’s transport portfolio in China highlights a high level of client 
satisfaction with investments in the highway sector. The overall performance of the Bank’s highway 
portfolio in China has been satisfactory; nevertheless, a number of issues have arisen during project 
implementation. These include a lack of coordination among organizations and levels of government that 
has been detrimental to implementation of the policy agenda, especially for improving road safety, and 
issues with infrastructure design as well.  Two ongoing Bank-financed highway projects in Inner 
Mongolia, the Inner Mongolia component of the Tri-provincial Highway Project, and the Inner Mongolia 
Highway Project, have provided relevant lessons, which the design of the proposed project has taken into 
account: 
·
Client ownership and coordination among various levels of government units must 
improve.  
The
 
task team ensured that all relevant government units, including various ministries, 
Hulunbeier government, IMCD, and other organizations involved, participated in project 
preparation to foster a sense of ownership as well as create continuity for implementation.
 
·
Rushing the engineering design without carrying out a thorough geological survey leads 
to many design variations during implementation.
 
The proposed project has tried to ensure

A
that the design institute has enough time to complete a thorough survey and carry out design work 
properly.  
·
A
weak local supervision team causes quality control during implementation to suffer.
 
The project team discussed supervision at length with the Hulunbeier project management office 
to ensure that the client takes site supervision work seriously and that the local supervision team 
recruited through national competitive bidding is of good quality. 
·
Rushing through the procurement process in order to start construction quickly 
does not leave sufficient time for bidders to prepare good bids.
 The task team for 
this project insisted on giving bidders sufficient time to prepare good bids and established 
procedures that do not allow the client to shorten the bid period without good reason.
