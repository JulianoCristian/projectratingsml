Objective of RAP and Terms in Land Acquisition and 
Resettlement 
 
The RAP has been compiled according to the relevant laws and regulations of 
the PRC and localities as well as the World Bank’s Implementation Outline 
for Involuntary Immigrants (OD4.30). Its objective is to ensure that the 
impacted people can get benefit from the proposed highway project so that 
their living standard can be raised or at least can be restored to that before 
the impact of the project. 
 
The acquisition of land and other properties may impact whoever lives on 
them. The impacted people include those whose life or income is impacted by 
the land acquisition and resettlement for the project, including: 
 
1.  those whose buildings (such as houses, the buildings of an enterprise or 
unit, or other public buildings) or land (such as courtyards, cultivated land, 
pastures) or other properties of which who have the ownership, right or 
economic benefit are acquisitioned either partially or completely; 
2.  those who use the above building or other properties, or whose production 
or management, jobs, living environment are impacted; 
3.  those whose living standard is impacted by land acquisition for the project. 
 
Consequently, we can define the impacted population as follows. 
The impacted population is composed of those, 1. whose life has already or 
will be impacted by the project; 2. whose buildings or land (such as 
courtyards, cultivated land, pastures) or other movable or immovable 
properties of which who has the ownership, right or economic benefit are 
acquisitioned either permanently or temporarily; 3. whose production or 
management, jobs, living quarters are impacted.

An impacted object may be a person or a juristic one of a company or a 
public organization. Whether a person is impacted does not depend on 
whether he or she has been registered or approved legally to work or live in 
an impacted area, nor does it depend on whether he or she has the ownership 
of the properties. Therefore, the impacted people include all those who are 
impacted by the project: 
 
1. whether they have the legal right of acquisitioned properties; or  
2. live in the impacted area without a legal approval.  
 
If a number of persons or a family jointly own or use a piece of acquisitioned 
land or other properties, they will get compensation according to the 
seriousness of the impact on their right and living standard. The definition of 
impacted population is directly related to the negative impact of the project 
instead of the ownership of these properties or other things. 
 
All the impacted peopl
e’s living standard should be raised or at least restored. 
They should get compensation for the loss in properties at least equal to that 
calculated based on repurchase cost and for no reason should the 
compensation be deliberately deducted or underestimated. 
 
Resettlement includes the following aspects. 
 
1.  to rearrange the living areas; 
2.  to arrange the jobs for the impacted people; 
3.  to restore or compensate for the impacted productive resources, e.g., land, 
working places, trees and infrastructures; 
4.  to eliminate the other negative impact from land acquisition, e.g., 
environmental pollution; 
Page  8

fi\03
127.5  39.9  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
5.  to restore or make compensation for the public or private enterprises, and  
6.  to eliminate the negative impact on cultural facilities or public properties. 
 
To restore means to make restoration of the impacted people’s productive 
resources, so that they will carry on their production or management at least 
on the original levels before the construction of the project and maintain their 
life style. 
 
The RAP is intended to make a plan for the impacted people to be resettled 
and their life restored, so that their losses will get compensated for and their 
living standard will be raised or at least maintained to the original level 
before the construction of the project. Therefore, restoring measures will be 
introduced in this RAP for the impacted people to raise their income or at 
least maintain the previous level, and for the productive resources and public 
properties, infrastructure and cultural facilities to be improved or increased 
or at least maintained the original levels before the construction of the 
project.

Chapter 1  Brief Description of the Project 
 
1.1  Introduction 
 
One of the Highway Network Components of the World Bank-financed Inner 
Mongolia Highway and Trade Facilitation Project, the Genhe-Mangui Class III 
Highway (hereinafter referred to as the Highway), starts from the end point of 
the forest protection road of Genhe City, going through Jinhe Town, Alongshan 
Town, and Mangui Town. The Highway stops at the border between Mangui 
Town and Mohe County of Heilongjiang Province. The total length of the 
Highway is 263.3 km, and it includes 2 big bridges with the total length of 234 m, 
65 medium and small bridges with the total length of 1408.5 m, 287 culverts, 8 
grade crossings between highway and railway, and 46 grade crossings between 
highways. The Highway was designed according to Class III highway in heavy 
hilly area, and the design speed was 30 km/h. Its subgrade width was 7.5 m, and 
the traveled lane width was 6.5 m. 
 
As one section of a vertical from
 “four horizontal, four vertical and twelve exit” 
of Hulun Buir City highway network planning, the proposed Highway is an 
important road from Genhe City to Mohe County. It plays a key role in 
economic development of Hulun Buir City, especially Genhe City. 
 
The existing road from Genhe to Mangui is a special forestry road, which is low 
in the technical standard. It is apparently unable to meet the increasing needs for 
transportation, and to keep abreast of the economic and tourist development in 
those areas. In order to bring the State’s strategies of developing the West into 
force, carry out natural forest protection project, improve the present traffic 
conditions, accelerate the resource exploitation and tourist development in the 
areas along the alignment, and avoid or reduce forest fire, the Highway is in 
urgent need of construction.

1.2  Project impacted areas 
 
The Highway goes through Genhe City of Hulun Buir City. There are 1 
prefecture-level city, 1 county-level city, and 3 towns. For details, please refer to 
the following table:

1.3  Minimization of land acquisition and resettlement 
 
The IMAR’s governments at all levels pay great attention to the land acquisition 
and resettlement. When preparing the Resettlement Action Plan for the Project, 
it has been considered that all PAPs and units should receive reasonable 
compensation and be well resettled. As soon as the resettlement starts, the 
implementation will be carried out in accordance with the RAP to minimize the 
Project impact. A series of measures will be taken to rehabilitate or reconstruct 
the affected residents, units and enterprises, infrastructure as soon as possible. 
Even when the civil construction of the Project is initiated, further efforts, such 
as technological innovation and strengthening the management of construction, 
can be made to mitigate negative impacts on the affected areas and convenience 
the PAPs’ work and life. 
 
The construction of the development projects usually involve land acquisition,  
housing relocation, and displacement, and affect local people’s production and 
living conditions. When the different route alternatives were compared, much 
Page  11

110.6  49.8  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
n\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
attention was paid to the impacts of the projects on local society and economy. In 
order to minimize the land acquisition and displacement, in the determination of 
the alignment, the design institutions prevented the highway from directly 
passing through the residential spots, used cultivated land as less as possible, and 
minimized housing relocation.  
 
As early as the techno-economic feasibility study and the preliminary 
engineering design for the Project, based on the Design Norm of Highway Route 
combined with the terrain along the route, the departments concerned planned 
and designed the route alignment according to the principles such as 
economizing on land, reducing the cultivated land acquisition, not taking high-
yield land and minimizing the building relocation. They solicited opinions from 
the local governments and villagers in the affected areas, and decided the route 
alignment scheme on the basis of repeated comparison of different route 
alternatives. Therefore, the Project impact on the cultivated land, housing and 
units and enterprises has been reduced as much as possible. 
 
During the Project planning and construction stages, the following principles will 
be applied to reduce Project impact on production and living conditions of local 
residents. 
 
A.  Recognize the impacts and inconvenience brought upon by the construction 
of the Highway, and adopt measures such as building elevated pass-way or 
underground passageway for those residential concentrated areas; when passing 
through a township town, parallel local roads will be provided; and all highway 
pass-ways will be designed to accommodate farm-use vehicles and transporting 
animals. For those affected irrigation canals, they will be restored in order to 
ensure the normal farming activities will not be adversely affected. 
 
B. Collect basic information, analyze local socio-economic conditions, and 
combine local actual condition to develop a feasible RP so as to reduce the

110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
impact of construction and ensure that the living standard of the affected people 
won’t decrease because of the Project. 
 
C. Strengthening internal monitoring and external monitoring on resettlement 
implementation; and setting up an effective feedback system in order to solve 
problems in timely fashion in resettlement implementation. 
 
D. Enhancing Public Awareness and Participating: Before Project construction, 
construction schedule notices will be posted in Project impact areas and 
resettlement areas. Meanwhile, the compensation policies of land requisition, 
house removal and resettlers’ relocation will be published, which will be 
monitored by the PAPs. During construction, priority will be given for using 
local materials, local transportation means and local labor forces, so affected 
people can obtain additional benefits from the Project. 
 
1.4  Policies and objectives for the RAP preparation 
 
Policies
 
1)  The Land Administration Law of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and 
its Implementation Regulations 
2)  The IMAR Implementation Regulations of the PRC Land Administration 
Law 
3)  The PRC Forestry Law and the IMAR Administration Regulations 
4)  World Bank’s OD 4.30 Involuntary resettlement 
 
Objectives
 
1)  Involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible, 
exploring all viable alternative project designs. Where displacement is 
unavoidable, the effective measures should be taken to minimize the impacts of 
the land acquisition and housing relocation on local people’s production and life.

110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
2)  At the project preparation stage, socio-economic survey should be conducted 
and resettlement plans should be developed. 
3)  Resettlement should be based on the concrete objects affected and 
compensation standard, with the aim that the living standards of the Project-
affected persons (PAPs) can be improved, or at least restored to their  former 
levels. 
4)  Community participation in planning and implementing resettlement should 
be encouraged
 
 
5)  All the PAPs will benefit from the Project. 
 
1.5  Principles of resettlement program and safeguarding of PAPs
’ 
entitlements 
 
Principles of resettlement program
 
1.  Make sure that the impacted units and individuals can raise or at least keep 
their original living standards in the shortest possible time. 
 
2.  Anyone who loses his or her houses should get new ones, and should be 
resettled in a nearby place. 
 
3.  Resettlement plans, sites of new houses, standards and building areas, as well 
as the corresponding compensation standards should be determined after the 
impacted people’s opinions have been asked. 
 
4.  For all the impacted buildings, the other compensation should be calculated 
based on the current substituting price without the consideration of depreciation 
charge. The objects in the houses to be demolished belongs to the owners of the 
houses. 
 
Safeguarding of PAPs’ entitlements

110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
Therefore, a series of measures will be taken to safeguard the entitlements of the 
affected people: 
 
1. Ensure that all PAPs receive compensation at replacement cost for their total 
loss due to the project, and are well resettled and rehabilitated so that they can 
share the benefits of the project;  
 
2. Special care will be taken for the vulnerable groups (including the poor 
households, the households having the disabled members, the households headed 
by the women, and the households where the aged live alone), such as assistance 
in building and moving into their new houses, and receiving specific 
compensation. 
 
3. Help those whose houses are relocated select their new sites and build their 
new houses, and make them harmonize with the new environment as soon as 
possible; 
 
4. The implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement will be monitored 
and evaluated (M&E) by the independent monitoring institute. The 
representatives of the PAPs will participate in the resettlement and the PAPs 
have avenues for redressing their grievances.

Chapter 2  Socio-economic situation of Project-affected 
areas 
 
2.1  The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) 
 
The Project Area, the IMAR is situated in the northern frontier of China. It 
stretches 2400 km from west to east and 1700 km from north to south, traversing 
northeast, north and northeast China. The IMAR covers an area of 1.183 million 
km
2
 or 12.3 % of the country's territory, and its land area is the third largest in 
China. The Region is surrounded by eight provinces and regions in its south, east 
and west, and Mongolia and Russia in the north, with a borderline of 4200 km. 
 
The total population of the IMAR is 23,790,000. There are Han, Mongolian, Hui, 
Manchu, Tibetan, Korean, Tahur, Olunchun and some other nationalities. The 
Mongolian Nationality is the main body in the IMAR. In 2002, the GDP in the 
IMAR reached 173.248 billion yuan, the annual average income per urban 
citizen was 6051 yuan, and the annual average net income per farmer or 
herdsman was 2086 yuan. The IMAR has national iron and steel and coal 
production bases. In addition, it has industries of forest, farm and animal 
production processing, electricity, machinery, chemicals, electronics, textile, 
sugar, paper making and light industry. It has developed agriculture and animal 
husbandry. The Region is a national production base of cash grain, oil and sugar, 
and also an important animal husbandry base, ranking top among the five major 
pastoral areas in the State. 
 
2.2  Hulun Buir City 
 
Hulun Buir City is situated in the northeast of IMAR, between longitude 
115°31
 126°04
 E. and 47°05
 53°20
 N., stretching 630 km from west to east.

110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
It covers an area of 253,000 km
2
 or 21.4% of the IMAR’s territory. The City is 
surrounded by Xing’an League in its south, Heilongjiang Province in the east, 
Russia in the north and northwest, and Mongolia in the west and southwest, with 
a borderline of 1685.82 km. In 2002, its population was 2.676 million with 35 
minorities, accounting for 15.9% of the total population. 
 
The land area of Hulun Buir City accounts for 11.9% of the IMAR’s area. Per 
capita land (8.82 hectare), per capita cultivated land (0.49 hectare), per capita 
forest land (4.50 hectare), and per capita grassland (3.08 hectare) are 11.5 times, 
4.9 times, 27.3 times and 16.3 times of the corresponding indicators in China 
separately. As shows the rich land resources and potentials to develop. Except 
for the sand land, rock land, bare land, swampland, and saline and alkali land, 
accounting for 1.8% of the City’s area, which are difficult to be developed, the 
other 98% of land can be utilized easily. The land availability percentage of the 
City is higher than that in whole IMAR, 80.7%, and much higher than that in 
whole China, 65%. The quality of land resources is high in IMAR and China. 
The organic content here is 4-6% so land is suitable for agriculture and animal 
husbandry. 
 
The City is one of the important farm production bases in IMAR. The cultivated 
land increased from 15.09 hectare in 1949 to 108.6 hectare in 2000, and in the 
same period, the grain production output increased from 165,000 tons to 
1,754,000 tons. The agricultural technology is an important fact in agricultural 
development. The agricultural mechanization in the family farms has been 
accomplished in Hailar Reclamation Area and Great Xing'an Mountains 
Reclamation Area. Fine varieties of farm products, such as wheat, soybean have 
been developed, and every year 70% of the farm product are exported to foreign 
countries, ranks first in IMAR. 
 
The animal husbandry of the City is becoming benefit-oriented, Sanhe Cattle, 
Sanhe Horse, Hulun Buir fine-fleece sheep and other fine varieties of livestock 
Page  17

have been bred. Through returning land for farming to grassland, the problem 
of lack of fodder grass in Lingxi Area has been resolved. Lots of cattle and sheep 
from the pasturing areas were fattened in the farming areas, miming areas, 
reclamation areas and suburban areas. In 2000, the annual livestock number 
reached 5.763 million, and the animal husbandry production system focusing on 
milk, meat, and grass has been formed. 
  
The industry sectors of the City are relatively complete, and its production 
structure is becoming appropriate gradually. The industries of forest, coal, 
electricity, textile, dairy products and construction materials are the mainstays 
of industry production with local national characteristics. Now Hailar, 
Manzhouli, Zhalantun, and Yakeshi are the centers of the industries of farm and 
animal husbandry product processing, forest, timber processing, machine 
manufacturing. The City's industry is beginning to be intensified and formed 
economic groups. The state-owned, collective, individual, stock-holding, privately 
owned, jointly managed sectors have diversified the City’s economy. In 2000, the 
value-added of industry of the enterprises at township level and above in the City 
was 1.438 billion yuan. 
 
The City is rich in tourist resources, such as prairie, and forest landscape, ethnic 
scenes, ancient and modern sight spots. Long Sino-Russian and Sino-Mongolian 
borderline and lots of ports are potential resources which can be developed as 
new tourist attractions. The prairie, forest, rivers, lakes, mineral springs, rare 
animals and plants, mountains, and ice and snow made the City’s natural 
landscape very beautiful. Besides, Barag Mongolian Nationality, Buliyate 
Mongolian Nationality, Tahur Nationality, Ewenki Nationality, and Olunchun 
Nationality still retain traditional production, habits and customs, and colorful 
ethnic festival celebrations. The City’s tourist industry, with the characteristics 
of Hulun Buir prairie, forest, rivers, ports, and ethnic customs and manners, has 
evolved a style of domestic tourism, international tourism, frontier tourism, and 
foreign tourism.

Chapter 3  Project impacts 
 
3.1  Brief account of the survey 
 
In order to know exactly and completely the impacts of the land acquisition and 
resettlement of the Highway, before the compilation the RAP, between October 
and November 2005, the investigation team, which was composed of the 
personnel from the related departments in Genhe City, conducted the detailed 
survey of impact inventory including population, houses, land, and 
infrastructure, according to the range determined by the Hulun Buir Highway 
Reconnaissance and Design Institute.  
 
3.1.1  Impact inventory survey 
 
Impact inventory survey were divided into: land acquisition survey, the Project 
affected people survey, house demolition and attachment survey, scattered tree 
survey, rural production and living facility survey, special facility survey, etc.. 
The detailed survey methods are described as follows: 
 
Land acquisition survey
 
It was conducted according to the present conditions of land used, the cultivated 
land, grassland, forest land, housing plot will be registered separately. Various 
lands survey were done by the design institute adopted GPS positioning system 
of whole world, the results were registered and counted up as every village and 
every piece of land, by 1: 2000 actual survey topographic maps. 
 
Affected people survey
 
It was registered and counted up as numbers of actual Project affected persons. 
Affected persons of land acquisition are registered and counted up as real 
number of land acquisition households. The items to be investigated included

relationship with household head, sex, age, nation, occupation, level of education, 
and technical level, etc., especially ethnic minorities. 
 
House demolition and attachment survey
 
The methods to check house property certificate, land-use certificate and 
combined with site actual condition survey were adopted. All land attachments 
and accessory facilities belonging to the resettles were registered and counted up 
one by one. 
 
Special infrastructures survey
 
The items Surveyed and counted up included water conservancy, power facilities 
and communication apparatus affected by the Project. 
 
In order to analyze the Project impact and prepare practicable RAP, the 
relevant departments organized by Genhe City surveyed socioeconomic 
conditions of the affected towns and resettlers in the affected areas. The survey 
adopted the methods of collecting present statistic data and surveying samples on 
field sites. According to the survey results, local socioeconomic situations and the 
villagers’ actual production and living conditions were analyzed carefully. 
 
General conditions of the areas affected by Project, socioeconomic situation and 
development plan
 
Collecting related documents and statistical data from the departments of plan 
and price of local governments including GDP, national income, gross output 
value of industry and agriculture, fiscal revenue, income level, agriculture 
product and by-product, price information needed, and livestock number. The 
information could reflect generally the local socioeconomic conditions. 
 
The present condition of production and living for local villagers in the affected 
areas

Determining various indexes to judge production and living for local villagers in 
the affected areas, and surveying samples of effected items due to land 
acquisition and house demolition. 
 
3.1.2  Socioeconomic survey 
 
Documentary research
 
Documentary research was aimed to understand the history and current 
situations of the Project affected areas. It is a base and precondition to carry out 
a field survey.  
 
Field survey
 
According to the survey outline and questionnaires, survey of the villagers was 
conducted on site, and public meetings were had. 
 
Because of different socioeconomic background and characteristics, different 
projects have different major issues. It is necessary to define the major social 
issues, which are important to the preparation and implementation of the 
Project, according to the characteristics of the Project. Then those issues would 
be investigated, and analyzed, and planning would be made. Based on the 
Project’s features, the major social issues were determined as follows: 
resettlement; highway project and local socioeconomic development; and 
minorities. For details, please refer to the related sections of this report. 
 
3.2  Land occupation 
 
All the land to be occupied by the Project is 197 mu of state-owned forest land, 
no land will be acquired for the Project.

3.7  Project-affected people 
 
The population affected by the house demolition of the Project is 42 persons in 22 
households. Because some of the affected houses are discarded ones and the 
original residents now live otherwhere, usually only one person (household head) 
in each of such households is calculated as Project-affected people. Since the land 
to be occupied by the Project is state-owned forest land, and that land isn
’t 
contracted by the forestry workers, there are no people affected by land 
occupation. 
 
3.8  Analysis of the socioeconomic impacts 
 
There were 3 big changes of Chinese rural land system. The first change 
happened just after the funding of the P.R.C--during democratic reform 
movement (1950). Feudal ownership of land was perished and small peasant 
private land ownership became the most popular land ownership. The second 
one happened in agricultural cooperation movement (from the middle 1950’s to 
the end of the 1950’s). Small peasant private land ownership was changed into 
farmer collective ownership. The third one happened at the end of the 1970’s and 
at the beginning of the 1980’s. This change does not alter the previous collective 
ownership. But land ownership and land operation right are detached, which 
partly changes the land application system. Farmers begin to contract for 
Page  27

110.6  49.8  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
fl\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
collective land (including cultivated land, forest, pasture and wasteland) by 
household. The State stipulates that land in the rural areas and suburban areas, 
except otherwise provided for by the State, shall be collectively owned by 
farmers including land for building houses, land and hills allowed to be retained 
by farmers. 
 
The term for contracting for the cultivated land is 15 years and the term for 
contracting other kind of land is decided by owners and contractors in the form 
of contract. The state issued a policy for a new round land contract: land 
contract further prolongs 30 years in the 1990’s after the 15-year contract term 
expired in the 1990’s. The revised P.R.C Land Administration Law reflected this 
policy. For the state-owned forest area, since its function has changed from  
exploitation of forest to protection and management of forest, now the forest 
land is no longer contracted by the staff members of forestry bureau. 
 
Chinese formal rural organization network has been well developed. It plays an 
important role in technology dissemination and information transmission in 
farmers’ daily life. The project preparation and implementation, especially the 
resettlement and rehabilitation, well relate to the formal rural organization 
network. 
 
The People’s Commune was set in Chinese rural area in the latter part of the 
1950’s and the People’s Commune system made administration extend to the 
grass-root units. The production of a production team had to be decided by the 
higher authorities. The base of the rural organization structure: production 
team---production brigade---people’s commune---county thus was formed due to 
the People’s Commune. The present Chinese rural organization structure was 
also formed in early 1980’s. It was changed into county (banner) – township 
(Sumu) - administrative village (Gacha) – villager group which has gone on since 
then. Under this structure, administrative organs are set in county (banner) and 
Page  28

fi\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
township (Sumu), and administrative village and villager group belong to self-
government organizations. 
 
In recent years
 the original administrative functions of township governments 
have been gradually changed into service functions. However, the rural formal 
organization network is relatively stable. In order to adopt Genhe
’s 
administrative structure to the characteristics of mainly state-owned forest areas 
with non-agricultural population, its local organization network is city – 
town/township/street community – resident’s committee/residential area. 
 
According to the actual situations of the affected area, and based on the rural 
land system and organization network, the impacts of the Project are analyzed as 
follows: 
 
Positive impacts
 
1.  Accelerating local economic development during Project construction 
During Project construction, priority will be given to purchasing local 
construction materials and using local labors and technical services. In addition, 
related industries such as agricultural sideline product supply and development 
of tertiary industry will be accelerated to some extent. 
 
2.  Accelerating local economic development after Project completion 
‘Giving priority to road construction in order to become rich’ has become social 
common view in the Project area. The Project will bring the advantages of local 
vital communications line into full play. It speeds and facilitates not only 
transporting and selling the products of local agriculture, animal husbandry and 
sideline to the outside but also circulating the interior goods. Its swiftness, 
convenience, time-saving and money-saving thus will develop local economy, 
increase income of local farmers and herdsmen, and improve local people’s 
living standards. Furthermore, areas near the Project area will also benefit from 
the convenient transportation due to the completion of the Project.

110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
 
3. Improving the socioeconomic development of Genhe City 
Genhe
 City’s latitude is among the highest in China and located in the north of 
IMAR. The Project goes through north areas of the Genhe City, so the Project 
will perfect the main trunk highway in the City, and get through a key trunk 
highway linking Mohe County of Heilongjiang Province. The Highway will 
promote the trade and tourist development along the alignment, and will be 
beneficial to the socioeconomic development of Genhe City. 
 
Potential Negative impacts
 
Some adverse impacts will appear due to Project construction. Therefore, full 
consideration has been given to the potential negative impacts during Project 
designing. The plans to mitigate the negative impacts have been worked out.  
 
The possible negative impacts will be mainly on house demolition: although 
house demolition has been minimized as far as possible in Project designing, 
some house demolition is unavoidable. 
 
The Project owner and design institute have taken some measures to mitigate the 
potential impacts. As for resettlement impacts, RAP has been well prepared, and 
will be well carried out. People suffering house demolition due to the Project will 
be provided with replaced houses or compensated in cash so as to protect 
affected people’s interest. 
 
At present non-agriculture industry has become farmers’ vital income resources. 
In general, they go outside to do their jobs. Some of them are engaged in trade 
and transportation. Some farmers take the advantage of slack season to work 
outside while other farmers work all the year round outside. Investigation shows 
that usually one laborer per household works outside as a worker or tradesman. 
In some cases all the laborers in a household go into non-agriculture industry.

3.9  Stakeholder Analysis 
 
Project stakeholders are people or sectors whose benefits directly or indirectly 
relate to the Project and who are directly or indirectly influenced by the Project 
success. The groups engaged in border trade, people along the proposed 
alignment and in peripheral area, communications sectors, governments at 
various levels, sectors concerned, and designing and consulting agencies are all 
the stakeholders. Their demands for and attitudes toward the Project directly 
and indirectly affect the Project success. 
 
Among the stakeholders, people engaged in border trade, urban people along the 
alignment, farmers and herdsmen along the alignment, and people employed in 
highway transportation are main stakeholders while people in peripheral area 
are minor stakeholders. Among people along the alignment, a few people will be 
adversely affected by the Project house demolition. 
 
(1) The urban people along the alignment 
The Project will improve production conditions and investment environment, 
enhance local economic development and increase 
local people’s income. 
 
(2) The residents along the alignment 
The Highway will make local residents get in and out, transport and sell farm 
products conveniently. Income from catering trade along the highway will 
increase. They can take the advantages of Project construction to develop and 
utilize the local stone construction materials, and obtain more employment 
chances. Since only a little state-owned land will be used by the Project, it won’t 
have any adverse impacts on local people’s income. Through house relocation, 
the affected people will have opportunities to improve their houses or get cash. 
 
(3) The People employed in highway transportation 
Page  31

The completion of the Project will improve the traffic conditions, and thus make 
things convenient for people employed in highway transportation 
 
(4) The People in peripheral area 
The Highway will provide the peripheral area with convenient transportation 
conditions due to its swiftness and integral service function. It will cut down the 
transportation time, reduce the transportation costs, make the full use of 
resources of different regions, and facilitate the material and cultural exchange.

4.2  Main ethnic minorities 
 
The main ethnic minorities in the Project-affected areas include Mongolian, 
Manchu, Hui, Tahur, Korean, and Ewenki Nationalities. They are described as 
follows: 
 
Mongolian Nationality
 
 
IMAR is a minority autonomous region with the Mongolian Nationality as its 
main body. Mongolian people in the Project area rely mainly on animal 
husbandry. Mongolian people have lived with the Han Nationality in pastoral 
area for a long time. They are similar to Hans in language, production, and 
habits and customs. 
 
Mongolians and Hans work on animal husbandry, and are also engaged in other 
businesses together. Adapting to new development tendency, more Mongolians 
are engaged in secondary and territory industries. 
 
There is no obvious difference in habits and customs, and religion between 
Mongolians and Hans living in the same area. Usually there is no necessity to 
make such d
ifference. The Mongolian Nationality is defined as ‘main body’ in 
the IMAR. Chief local leaders are the Mongolians. The Mongolians have higher 
political and social status in the Project area. Mongolian villagers have more 
non-agriculture employment chances.  
 
The Mongolian nationality and the Han nationality live together over a long 
period of time and share Chinese northern dialect. Some aged Mongolians can 
speak Mongolian. 
 
Manchu Nationality

ungarumlaut\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
 
Manchu Nationality live mainly in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang Provinces, with 
the rest found in provinces of Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, Xinjiang, 
Shandong, Fujian Provinces. They also scatter in cities such as Beijing and 
Shanghai. Manchu Nationality have their own spoken and written language. 
Manchu characters were established in the end of 16th century. Manchu 
Nationality began to use Chinese Language when they moved to south of the 
Shanhaiguan Pass (east end of the Great Wall) in 1640s. 
 
Manchu Nationality believe Shamanism, and are also affected by Buddhism. The 
traditional costumes of male Manchus are a narrow-cuffed short jacket over a 
long gown with a belt at the waist to facilitate horse-riding and hunting. They let 
the back part of their hair grow long and wore it in a plait or queue. Women 
coiled their hair on top of their heads and wore earrings, long gowns and 
embroidered shoes. Following the Manchus' southward migration, the common 
people came to wear the same kind of dress as their Han counterparts, while the

4.3  Aoluguya Ewenki Nationality Township 
 
One of the three branches of the Ewenki ethnic group, the Yakute tribe settled at 
Aoluguya ("place with lush poplar trees" in Ewenki) Township in the north part 
of Genhe in 1965, after leaving Ergune River valley along the Sino-Russian 
border. They used to live mainly on hunting and reindeer raising for food and 
income. 
 
However, their living methods resulted in a sharp decline of wild animals and 
environment degradation in the area. Mushrooms and bryophyte on which 
reindeer mainly feed have almost disappeared in the area due to overgrazing. 
Meanwhile, Aoluguya is under increasing flooding threat as a result of reckless 
logging in the area. 
 
The decision to move out of the forest was made after full consultations between 
the hunters and local authorities. The moving in 2003, or called ecological

immigration, has improved the productivity and livelihood of the 169-member 
tribe. 
 
The new Aoluguya Township is located in the western suburbs of Genhe, about 
two kilometers from the city center. There are new houses with modern facilities 
for the Yakute families, together with the reindeer stables which cover an area of 
about 16,800 square meters surrounded by dense forest. Reindeer raising will 
still be a major income for Yakute people, although the reindeer is kept in 
stables instead of the traditional way of raising them in the wild. They can also 
take advantage of their unique culture to develop tourism. So far, 92 Yakute 
people have been employed to work for tourism, handicrafts product 
manufacture, forest protection, etc. 
 
Through resettlement, their living standards have been improved and their 
traditional culture has been protected. The proposed Highway won
’t go through 
the new Aoluguya Township and they won’t be affected adversely, on the 
contrary, they will benefit from better, faster, and safer traffic condition. 
 
4.4  Woman 
 
4.4.1  Rights women can be summed up 
 
It has always been a basic state policy of China to promote equality between men 
and women. China now has built a complete legal system concerning the 
protection of women's rights and interests, and promotion of gender equality, 
based on the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and with the Law of 
the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of 
Women as the main body and various separate laws and regulations, local 
regulations and administrative rules adopted by various government 
departments as supplementary provisions. The legitimate rights women can be

 (1) Women enjoy equal political rights with men. Women have the right, 
through various channels and in various ways, to administer state and social 
affairs, and enjoy equal rights to vote and stand for election. People's congresses 
at all levels should include appropriate numbers of women, and leaders from

4.4.2  Women organization 
 
The All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) is the largest NGO in China 
dedicated to promoting gender equality and women's development. It has an 
organizational system that covers women's federations and group members at 
various levels, and enjoys wide representation and mass involvement. The 
ACWF and local women's federations play a significant role in uniting and 
motivating women to participate in the country's economic construction and 
social development, encouraging them to take an active part in the democratic 
management and supervision of state and social affairs, and representing and 
safeguarding the rights and interests of women as a whole. In recent years, 
government departments have cooperated with women's federations and other 
NGOs to organize all kinds of activities to effectively utilize social resources for 
the promotion of gender equality and women's development. 
 
In order to give full play to women's role in the rural economy, government 
departments and women's federations at all levels have jointly organized 
activities to encourage rural women to acquire knowledge and learn science and 
technology, and compete in their development and contributions, so as to bring 
their role in invigorating and developing the rural economy into full play. 
 
4.4.3  Women and the economy 
 
The state has made the guarantee of equal employment opportunities between 
women and men and the sharing of economic resources and results of social 
development the top priority for the advancement of gender equality and the 
development of women, and has worked out and adopted a series of policies and 
measures to ensure that women can equally participate in the economic 
development, enjoy equal access to economic resources and effective services, 
enhance their self-development ability and improve their social and economic

status. As the economic status of Chinese women improves, they are playing an 
increasingly significant role in the economic sphere. Women have become an 
important and indispensable force in invigorating and promoting the rural 
economy. Females account for more than half of all workers in agriculture, 
forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries and water conservancy. 
 
4.4.4  Women and Poverty Elimination 
 
The Outline for the Development of Chinese Women puts forth the main goals of 
reducing the extent of poverty among and the number of poor women, and calls 
for more support for poverty-stricken women in the country's western 
development strategy, so that women will be the main receivers of poverty-
reduction resources and the direct beneficiaries of the achievements of the 
poverty-reduction efforts. The state poverty-reduction program has made it 
clear that the government strives to further motivate women in the poverty-
stricken areas to engage in household sideline production and the "courtyard 
economy," launch labor-intensive and other poverty-reduction projects that are 
particularly suitable for women, and organize women to learn practical skills 
and enhance their ability to shake off poverty and become well-off. 
 
Since 2001, the Chinese government has made sex indicator a component of the 
poverty monitoring work in rural areas, and stressed that attention should be 
paid to gender equality in the poverty-reduction work. Rural women have been 
helped to get rid of poverty by way of provision of small-sum credit loans, labor 
export and pairing-off assistance. 
 
4.4.5  Social status of women 
 
Women of the project areas have rather high social status, basically gender 
equality is realized. On the division of work, women are mostly in charge of 
housework, with limited opportunities to go outside, so that the chances for them 
Page  41

to undertake administration work are low. It is the same situation as those other 
parts of China, including Han people. On family position, women and men are 
equal. Important family affairs will be decided after consultation between both 
sides of men and women. The project will provide women with good transport 
services, and women will have more chances to obtain jobs like men. 
 
4.5  Main conclusion 
 
There is no ethnic minority inhabited in the areas along the proposed highway, 
and the proportion of ethnic people in total population is below 15%. The ethnic 
people have lived with the Han Nationality in pastoral area for a long time. They 
are similar to Hans in language, production, and habits and customs. All ethnic 
groups will benefit from transport improvements. Besides, the Project won
’t 
involve land acquisition, and all the people affected by house demolition will be 
non-agricultural population. As non-agricultural residents, members of ethnic 
minorities will be affected by the Project in the same ways as Han residents, and 
women will be affected by the Project in the similar ways as men. Therefore, no 
ethnic group-specific measures are necessary to mitigate specific adverse 
impacts. The implementation of RAP will safeguard the interests of ethnic people 
and women.

In order to assure the PAPs to be benefited from the Project, the involuntary 
resettlement is an inseparable part of the engineering design. Therefore, the 
following measures should be taken according to the relevant World Bank 
policies, especially resettlement requirements: 
 
1)  It should avoid or minimize the involuntary resettlement in a desirable scope, 
while taking all feasible replacement plan into consideration. 
  
2)  All involuntary resettlement should be included in the development projects 
which must be realized, while adequate funds should be provided to the PAP, 
who should  have chances to be benefited in the Project. Thus, the PAP should: 
 
a)  obtain all compensations for their losses at replacement value before the 
resettlement; 
b)  being given assistance in the course of relocation, and in the transition period 
of moving to the new sites. 
c)  develop a strategy for enhancing or at least rehabilitating their previous living 
standard, income capability, and production level. Special attention must be paid 
to the necessity of the vulnerable group. 
 
3)  Encourage the mass participation in the process of planning and the RAP 
implementation, through the establishment of the corresponding social 
institutions set up by the residents. 
 
4)  Minimize the adverse impacts to the original residents in the resettlement 
area, therefore the PAP should integrate with the former in social and economic 
activities. 
  
5)  Land, housing, infrastructure, and other compensation should be provided to 
the adversely affected population and ethnic minorities who may have usufruct

or customary rights to the land or other resources taken for the Project. The 
absence of legal title to land by such groups should not be a bar to compensation. 
 
6)  Project-affected Person (PAP) is the person affected by the project due to the 
land acquisition and resettlement. The PAPs may be individuals, legal persons, 
or families, no matter what legal status, rights, obligations, and benefits they 
have, or whether they have the permit to reside in the affected area. The PAPs 
include, therefore,  
 
a) 
those project-affected persons who have full or partial, long or short 
authority, rights, or benefits over structures (including housings, simple 
structures, farming fields, arable land) or other acquired assets; 
b) 
those project-affected persons who use the above land, structures and 
assets for business, residence, etc.; 
c) 
those whose living standards are affected because of the project. 
 
All the PAPs within the above scope have the right to increase or at least 
maintain their current living standards and receive compensation for their loss 
of assets (the asset compensation shall cover the replacement expense) and 
compensation for resettlement and loss of properties. Those PAPs who have no 
authorities, rights or permits for residence shall enjoy the same compensation 
and resettlement grant as those who have. 
 
5.6  Resettlement entitlement policy 
 
1)  
All affected assets will be compensated at their full replacement cost 
without any deduction for depreciation;

areas and the representatives of the PAPs; 
 
4)  
All affected persons who lose assets occupied by them before the Project 
cut-off date will be assisted in their efforts to restore their standards of living 
without discrimination on the basis of their tenure status. 
 
5)  
Affected people who cultivate land, construct buildings or settle in project 
affected areas after the cut-off date will not be eligible for compensation or 
subsidies. Compensation will also not be paid for any structures erected, or crops 
and trees planted purely for the purposes of gaining additional compensation, 
but those due to variation of design will be compensated as specified in the RAP.

6.3  Implementation of minorities laws and regulations, and policy 
 
6.3.1  Principle of minorities policy 
 
The principle of minorities policy is described as follows: 
 
(1) 
Adherence to equality and unity among ethnic groups 
 
In China, equality among ethnic groups means that, regardless of their 
population size, their level of economic and social development, the difference of 
their folkways, customs and religious beliefs, every ethnic group is a part of the 
Chinese nation, having equal status, enjoying the same rights and performing the 
same duties in every aspect of political and social life according to law, and 
ethnic oppression or discrimination of any form is firmly opposed. Unity among 
ethnic groups means a relationship of harmony, friendship, mutual assistance 
and alliance among ethnic groups in social life and mutual contacts. To achieve 
such unity, the various ethnic groups are required to, on the basis of opposition 
to ethnic oppression and discrimination, safeguard and promote unity among

themselves and within every particular ethnic group and the people of all ethnic 
groups should, jointly and with one heart and one mind, and promote the 
development and prosperity of the nation. 
 
(2) 
Implement regional autonomy for ethnic minorities 
 
Regional autonomy is practiced in areas where people of ethnic minorities live in 
concentrated communities. In these areas organs of self-government are 
established for the exercise of autonomy and for people of ethnic minorities to 
become masters of their own areas and manage the internal affairs of their own 
regions. Autonomous areas for ethnic minorities in China include autonomous 
regions, autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties (banners). For places 
where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities but where autonomous 
areas and organs of self-government are not fit to be established because the 
areas and populations of the ethnic minorities are too small, ethnic townships are 
established so that the minority peoples there can also exercise their rights as 
masters of their homelands. 
 
All ethnic groups in autonomous areas shall elect an appropriate number of 
deputies to take part in the people's congresses at various levels; among the 
chairman or vice-chairmen of the standing committee of the people's congress of 
an autonomous area there shall be one or more citizens of the ethnic group or 
groups exercising regional autonomy in the area concerned; the head of an 
autonomous region, autonomous prefecture or autonomous county shall be a 
citizen of the ethnic group exercising regional autonomy in the area concerned, 
and the other members of the people's governments of these regions, prefectures 
and counties shall include members of the ethnic group exercising regional 
autonomy as well as members of other ethnic minorities as far as possible. 
 
(3) 
Develop education, culture, and medical and health service among 
national minorities

110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
 
The development of education among national minorities is of paramount 
importance to the improvement of the quality of the minority population and the 
promotion of economic and cultural development in ethnic minority areas. The 
have the rights to develop ethnic education on their own. Organs of self-
government of autonomous areas may decide their own local education 
programs, including the establishment of schools, the length of study, the forms 
of school running, course contents, language of instruction and procedures of 
enrollment and develop independently their own type of education based on their 
ethnic minority characteristics. The building of the ranks of minority teachers 
has been strengthened, and special care in terms of funds has been offered, 
 
All ethnic minorities have formed their unique cultures in the long process of 
historical development. China respects and preserves the traditional cultures of 
ethnic minorities, and all of the minority peoples are free to maintain and 
develop their own cultures. The collecting, editing, translating and publishing of 
their cultural heritage have been carried out, and their famous historical 
monuments, scenic spots, rare cultural relics and other important items of the 
historical and cultural heritage have been protected. 
 
The state and relevant departments devote great efforts to fostering literary and 
artistic talent among the minority peoples, and promoting the creation of 
literature and art by setting up literature and art organizations, art institutes 
and schools, cultural centers and mass art centers. Organs of self-government of 
autonomous areas make their own decisions concerning medical and health 
work. Modern medicine and traditional ethnic minority medicine are promoted, 
prevention and cure of endemic diseases and maternal and child care have been 
improved, with the result that the health standards of the ethnic minorities 
across the country have markedly improved.

Genhe City has taken as main work of speeding up minority economy and social 
development to develop minority science and technology, culture, and medical 
and health service, and to improve civilization levels. The detailed 
implementation plan has been worked out. 
 
(4) 
Train minority cadres 
The organs of self-government in the autonomous areas have trained a large 
number of minority cadres, technicians, management personnel and other 
specialized personnel and skilled workers in line with the needs of national 
construction and brought their roles in work into full play. The main methods of 
minority cadre training in Genhe City are as follows: 
 
Hold training seminars; 
Secure certain proportion of minorities in total cadres; 
Give priority to employ minority people; 
Select suitable minority young people to be specially trained in universities and 
colleges. 
 
(5) Respect and develop spoken and written languages of ethnic minorities 
 
All ethnic groups in China have the freedom and right to use and develop their 
own spoken and written languages. Now, all the 55 national minorities, except 
the Hui and Manchu, who use the Chinese language, have their own languages: 
among them 21 use 27 languages. 
 
The spoken and written languages of national minorities are widely used in 
judicial, administrative and educational fields, as well as in political activities 
and social life. The organs of self-government in ethnic autonomous areas all use 
one or more languages of their areas when they perform their duties. In the 
educational field the organs of self-government, in accordance with the 
educational principles of the state and the law, work out their local educational 
Page  71

programs and decide on the languages to be used in teaching in the local schools. 
In schools with minority students as the main body and other educational 
institutions the languages of the ethnic groups concerned or languages commonly 
used in the locality are used in teaching. 
 
(6) Respect the folkways and customs, and freedom of religious belief of ethnic 
minorities 
 
The various ethnic minority groups in China differ widely in their folkways and 
customs. They have different modes of production and life styles, as displayed in 
dress and adornments, diet, residences, marriage, etiquette and funerals. The 
minority peoples have the right to retain or change their folkways and customs, 
which are respected by the state. The government protects such rights in every 
aspect of social life. 
 
Most people belonging to ethnic minorities in China hold religious beliefs. In the 
case of certain ethnic groups religions are followed on a mass scale. The freedom 
of religious belief for ethnic minorities has been respected and safeguarded, and 
all normal religious activities of ethnic minorities citizens have been guaranteed. 
 
(7) Implement a more lenient childbirth policy with minority peoples than with 
the Han people 
 
To improve the quality of the ethnic minority population and accelerate the 
economic and social development of the ethnic minority autonomous areas, the 
people's congresses of these areas have formulated their own family planning 
policies toward the ethnic minorities in light of the spirit of the state's regulations 
concerning the need also for minority peoples to practice family planning. These 
policies are more lenient than those with the Han people. Under these policies, an 
ethnic minority family generally may have two or three children; in frontier 
areas and areas with adverse geographical conditions, families of ethnic 
Page  72

n\1a\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
minorities with very small populations may have more than three children each. 
As a result, ethnic minority populations have been able to increase at a higher 
rate than the rest of the population. 
 
6.3.2  Minority economic policy 
 
Minority economic policy is described as follows: 
 
(1) Implement preferential policy 
 
While adopting various preferential policies, such as extending financial 
subsidies to minority areas and establishing development funds, the state has 
encouraged minority areas to develop economy according to local circumstances. 
Preferential treatment to minority enterprises and trade has been offered in 
terms of credits, investment, taxation and the supply of commodities, and special 
discount-interest loans have been provided for the construction of an ethnic 
trade network, and the technological transformation of designated enterprises 
for producing ethnic articles for daily use. 
 
(2) Adopt transfer payment method 
 
With respect to the transfer payment method for the transition period which 
China adopted in 1995, the state specially added the policy-related transfer-
payment contents for the five autonomous regions, including Tibet, and the 
autonomous prefectures in Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai and other provinces, 
offering preferential policies to the ethnic minority areas. The ordinary transfer-
payment sum by the central authorities to the ethnic minorities areas has made 
up a half of the nation's total transfer-payment sum. 
 
(3) Help impoverished minority areas get rid of poverty 
 
Page  73

110.6  49.8  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
ndotaccent\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
The state has always attached importance to helping the minority peoples and 
minority areas. The Outline Program for Poverty Alleviation and Development 
in the Rural Areas of China, which began being implemented in 2001, once again 
recognized ethnic minority areas as key targets for assistance. The state has 
adopted special measures to assist the 22 ethnic minority groups each with a 
population of less than 100,000, and focusing on infrastructure construction and 
the problem of food and clothing for impoverished people in frontier regions and 
ethnic minority areas with small populations. Genhe City has taken as one of the 
main work contents of speeding up minority economy and social development to 
support minority township
’s economic and social development. 
 
(4) Special forestry policy 
 
Carrying out the Law of the People's Republic of China on Regional National 
Autonomy, there are 2 special stipulations in the Forest Law of the People's 
Republic of China: 
 
Article 9. In terms of the forestry production and construction in ethnic minority 
autonomous areas, in line with the stipulations of the state in regard to the 
autonomous right of ethnic minority autonomous areas, the State and the 
people's government at the provincial or autonomous region level will offer more 
autonomy and economic benefits than ordinary areas in connection with forestry 
development, timber distribution and forestry fund utilization. 
 
Article 48. If the provisions of this law cannot be fully applicable to ethnic 
minority autonomous regions, the autonomy authorities may, in line with the 
principles of this law and based upon the characteristics of ethnic minority 
autonomous regions, formulate contingent or supplementary provisions, which 
shall be implemented after submission to and approval of the provincial or 
autonomous government or the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress in conformity with legal procedures.

Those stipulations have reflect the support and consideration to the forestry 
production and exploitation in ethnic minority areas, and safeguarding of and 
respect to autonomy there.

From the above tables it can be found that the total cost for brick timber house 
and timber tile house are 266.85 yuan per square meter and 145.48 yuan per 
square meter separately. The indirect loss of the relocated households can be 
calculated at 13 yuan per square meter for brick timber house and 4.5 yuan per 
square meter for timber tile house. Therefore, the compensation rates for brick 
timber house and timber tile house can be determined at 280 yuan per square 
meter and 150 yuan per square meter separately.

Chapter 8  Resettlement and Rehabilitation Program 
 
8.1  Guideline and principle of resettlement program  
 
8.1.1  Objectives of resettlement program 
 
The ultimate objective of resettlement and restoration is to ensure a restoration 
of life and production of the impacted individuals, enterprises and institutions in 
a short period of time and to raise the living standards and productivity as 
quickly as possible. 
 
8.1.2  Principle of resettlement program 
 
A. Resettlement planning should be based on the property indexes and 
compensation standards to improve, or at least to restore the original production 
and living conditions of the resettlers. 
 
B. The resettlement of the Project shall be combined with the regional 
construction, resource development, economic development and environment 
protection. Considering the actual local conditions, practical and feasible 
measure shall be worked out for restoring and developing the production and 
living of the resettlers case by case, meanwhile, some necessary conditions shall 
be created for self development of the resettlers. 
 
C. Planning should be based on the principle "Beneficial to the production and 
make the life convenient". 
 
D. Construction scale and standards of the resettlement Project should be guided 
by the original scale and standards. Investment should be based on the quota 
Page  82

1a\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
planning. Investment for enlarging the scale, improving standards and future 
planning should be treated by the local government and relative departments. 
 
E. All factors should be taken into consideration. Benefits between the state, 
collectives and individuals should be dealt with properly. 
 
8.2  Overall resettlement scheme 
 
All the land affected by the Project is state-owned forest land, besides, the 
function of state-owned forest farms has changed from forest exploitation and 
utilization to forest protection and management. Therefore, there is no need to 
pay land compensation for state-owned forest land. Also, since no people live on 
the occupied forest land, there is no need to pay resettlement subsidy for that 
forest land.  
 
The Project will only affect a small part of houses in 3 towns
, and won’t have 
great impact on their original production and living system. A series of 
consultation meetings were held among affected villages and townships. 
According to the resettler's opinion and suggestion, and combining with the 
actual condition of affected area, it was determined: Project affected persons will 
be provided with replacement houses nearby no less than their original areas, 
structure and standard, or cash compensation. If cash compensation is provided, 
the relocated households can build their new houses nearby. Therefore, the 
PAPs’ way of production, living and social relationship can be maintained, which 
will be beneficial for them to restore or improve their production and income 
level after resettlement. 
 
8.2.1  Resettlement infrastructure program 
 
Ground leveling
 
Page  83
Social Assessment and Resettlement Action Plan for Genhe-Mangui Class III Highway (The Revised Draft) 
110.6  49.8  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
otaccent\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
Because only 2 households will be relocated, there is not too much work for 
ground leveling. The ground will be leveled by a way of excavation of 0.5 m for 
brick concrete and brick timber houses. Simple ground leveling will be used for 
timber tile houses. The ground leveling fee has been included in the house 
compensation, and the ground leveling will be conducted by the resettlers 
themselves. 
 
Public facilities
 
1. Water supply: For those who resettle in their original village have the water 
supply as that before. 
 
2. Power supply: The capacity of existing power facilities for each village can 
meet demands after resettlement. The line distance for each host site to connect 
is about 50-200m and resettlers can have power supply by a 220V line to connect 
it.  
 
The cost for water and electricity has been included in the house reconstruction 
expenses, so those fees come from house compensation.  
 
3. Road and access to outside:  
The host sites are chosen nearby, which solve the problems on access and also 
meet requirements of resettlers. 
 
8.2.2  Facilities for social service 
 
The resettlers and villagers affected by the Project can share the service from 
original schools, clinic and commercial nets, since no such facilities will be 
demolished duo to the Project, and no new ones are required. The distances 
between the affected residents’ houses and the facilities won’t change a lot. 
 
8.2.3  Administrative management of resettlers

110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
 
Since no people will be relocated out of the original towns, the administrative 
management keeps as that before. They are still under the leadership of original 
towns. 
 
The building of resettlers' houses shall take account of their habits and suitable 
for agricultural requirements and also have some space for development in the 
future. The houses can be dismantled and built by themselves according their 
own thought. The house compensation is based on the house structure and area 
and at replacement cost. The compensation will be paid in stages according to 
progress of materials preparation and construction. Since the affected resettlers 
are relocated in the original communities, the distances between their new house 
sites and old house sites are within 500 meter. Besides, usually the new houses 
will be built before the old houses are demolished, therefore, no temporary 
houses are required. 
 
8.2.4  Implementation origination of resettlement 
 
The resettlement program shall be implemented by the Project Resettlement 
Office with personnel from the relative authorities under leadership of Project 
Resettlement Leading Group. Their responsibilities are to work out the 
resettlement policies, and give propaganda, mobilization, organization and 
implementation of resettlement. Also, the office is a main channel for resettlers to 
propose their issues. The office shall collect comments from resettlers in time and 
fully, report it to authorities at above level and relative authorities and return 
the respondents to resettlers in time. 
 
8.3  Housing reconstruction 
 
Housing reconstruction refers to the construction of the impacted people’s 
residences and other buildings. 
Page  85

110.6  49.8  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
ccentfl\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
 
Of all the compensation for impacted houses, 50% of it should be paid before the 
impacted people start building their houses, another remaining 50% should be 
paid when the reconstruction has been half finished. 
 
8.3.1  Implementation of the Schedule 
 
1.  The above control time has been determined according to the construction 
plan. Therefore, if there is any change in preparation time, the control time 
should be adjusted based on extensive consultation with the impacted families so 
as to ensure that they will have three months of removal time and three months 
for the reconstruction of their houses before the start of construction of the 
Project. 
 
2.  Before the completion of reconstruction, the impacted people may stay in 
their old houses, and will not be forced to move out of them. 
 
8.3.2  Selection of Construction Sites 
 
The selected sites should be determined through consultation with the impacted 
households. Measures will be taken for the impacted families to be resettled in 
their own villages “sparsely” because resettlement centers will not be provided.  
 
The sites of construction should meet the following requirements: 
 
1.  The sites still belong to the original communities, (if the impacted families are 
willing to resettle there), which will be easy for them to adapt to. 
 
2.  There should be an adequate sanitary environment in the sites, being 
convenient to live in.

ccentfi\03
110.6  38.7  8.5   4.2   0 : \03
3.  The suggestion for the sites will be made for the families to choose from, and 
it will not be against their willingness.  
 
4.  The desires of the people to be resettled will be considered. 
 
The unoccupied land in a village should be used as the reconstruction sites 
wherever it is possible. Documents for reconstruction on such sites should be 
obtained by the towns from the land administration and building planning 
authorities. 
 
8.4  Management of temporary land occupation and civil 
construction 
 
The temporarily occupied land includes stocking grounds, mixing plants, borrow 
pits, production and living areas for builders and construction bypasses, etc.. 
The range of the temporarily used land was determined in the engineering design 
report. Excavation should be reduced, and impacts on the forest land should be 
minimized. The users should make full restoration of the temporarily used land 
after the temporary use expires. 
 
During civil construction, optimize construction design, reduce construction 
period, and plan housing removal and construction in reasonable period such as 
during farm slack season, so as to decrease the Project impact on local 
production. Reduce the dust and improve treatment of waste materials. 
Construction contractors should carefully select routes for transporting soil and 
stone, and adopt measures to prevent the falling of soil on the roads. The 
construction contractors should follow the environmental regulations and 
requests of local environmental and hygienic departments on treatment of the 
domestic waste materials in the site of construction sites so as to protect 
environment.

The contracts between the Project owner and the constructors will include such 
articles as way and period of temporary land occupation, and that temporarily 
used land should be restored to the level before its use. 
 
8.5  Assistance to vulnerable groups 
 
The vulnerable groups include the poor households, the households having the 
disabled members, the households headed by the women, and the households 
where the aged live alone. The following measures will be taken to help 
vulnerable groups.

Chapter 10  Consultation and Participation 
 
10.1  Consultations and participation 
 
The RAP of the Project has been prepared through the active participation of 
the PAPs. The participation began with the dissemination of the resettlement 
information on the Project to the PAPs. As early as the engineering feasibility 
study and the preliminary design for the Project, the route alignment scheme 
was decided through the solicitation of the PAPs’ opinions.  It is designed that 
detailed information dissemination meetings will be held after the Construction 
Land Use Certificate is obtained. 
 
During the course of the preparation of the RAP, the PAPs have participated in 
the following activities: 
 
1.  
The Project impacts on people and assets were decided through the 
census. The local governments and the representatives of the PAPs participated 
in the census. 
 
2.  
The socio-economic survey has been carried out with participation of the 
PAPs and the representatives of the affected areas. 
 
3.  
In the course of designing the entitlement policies and compensation 
rates, and implementation program, the PAPs’ suggestions and options were 
fully considered. 
 
During the course of implementing and monitoring the land acquisition and 
resettlement, the PAPs and their representatives will participate in the following 
activities.

information dissemination, it will be carried out according to the following 3 
measures: 
 
(1) The Project owner will publish announcement on the local newspaper. The 
affected people will be told to go to the City Public Library to review the full 
RAP, including detailed Project information, resettlement policy and 
compensation standards. 
 
(2) The Genhe city resettlement office and township resettlement offices will have 
special persons to receive the PAPs and let them look up the RAP and explain 
the related content 
 
(3) Various forms, including notification meeting, forum, visiting notice will be 
adopted to disseminate Project resettlement information. 
 
10.3  Resettlement Information Booklet 
 
In order to ensure the affected people can know the detailed information of the 
RAP, the Project resettlement office will prepare the Resettlement Information 
Booklet. Its main contents are as follows: 
 
As one section of a vertical from
 “four horizontal, four vertical and twelve exit” 
of Hulun Buir City highway network planning, the proposed Highway is an 
important road from Genhe City to Mohe County. It plays a key role in 
economic development of Hulun Buir City, especially Genhe City. In order to 
secure the smooth resettlement implementation progress, following the related 
leaders’ arrangement from the Autonomous Region and the City, the 
Resettlement Information of the Project is prepared specially. 
 
The civil work of the Project will stat from 2006. For the PAPs, proper 
resettlement will be implemented in accordance with the relevant laws and

regulations so as to improve their production levels, income-earning capacity 
and living standards or at least restore to the levels they would have had without 
the Project. 
 
The resettlement implementation will be carried out under the leadership of 
Genhe City Government. In order to strengthen the management of 
compensation standards, the compensation standards for the main affected 
categories will be not lower than the following:

houses 
yuan/sq.m 280 
2 timber 
tile 
houses 
yuan/sq.m 150 
3 Simple 
structures 
yuan/sq.m 105 
 
Through replacement houses or cash compensation, the relocated households 
will be resettled in their original communities. The salvageable material from the 
old houses can be used by the relocated households themselves without deduction 
from compensation. The compensation will be paid based on the agreements with 
the affected people. 
 
For the affected vulnerable groups include the poor households, the households 
having the disabled members, the households headed by the women, and the 
households where the aged live alone, reasonable assistance will be provided 
according to the real situations, such as providing labour for house construction, 
necessary allowance form poverty reduction departments, and giving priority to 
select new housing sites 
 
To ensure that the PAPs have avenues for redressing their grievances related to 
any aspect of the land acquisition and resettlement, the detailed procedures of 
redress of grievances will be established for the Project.

Aggrieved Aspects
 
PAPs can make an appeal on any aspect of the land acquisition and resettlement, 
including the compensation being offered. 
 
Detailed procedures for redress of grievances and the appeal process are 
publicized among the PAPs by distributing RIBs. 
 
In spite of the above procedures established for redressing grievances, in case 
any conflicts arise regarding the land acquisition and resettlement, the 
conflicting parties will first negotiate and mediate the case in cooperative effort. 
The above appealing procedures will be employed only when the mutual 
negotiation mediation fails.
