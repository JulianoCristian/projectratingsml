The following are some of the anticipated negative\n            environmental impacts and measures to mitigate them:  Any\n            waste material resulting from bridge/culvert construction\n            should not be let into the river channel to avoid any impact\n            on the flood discharge capacity or original functions of the\n            river; avoid destroying river dykes and affecting flood\n            discharge capacity; and narrowing river channels; inform\n            proper authorities when cultural relics are found; schedule\n            work for least interference with residents;  clean up site\n            after completing construction;  for temporary land\n            acquisitions, maximize use of wasteland or poor land, and to\n            minimize rangeland, and pay compensation; and recultivate\n            and restore vegetation; to reduce air pollution, use soil\n            borrowing measures; restore topsoil; plant trees on road\n            sides and replace removed trees; cover transport vehicles,\n            wet fly ash, promptly clean earth surfaces, control vehicle\n            speed and manage traffic flow. Avoid discharging asphalt\n            smoke and locate asphalt and lime-mixing plants downwind;\n            Minimize noise of road building machines by locating\n            machinery away from residential areas, and repair and\n            maintain machinery and equipment. Adopt cofferdam method to\n            effectively prevent turbid water quality, and prevent\n            pollution from construction waste falling into rivers.\n            Collect and treat machine oil and prevent discharge into\n            water bodies. Cover the stack sites for construction with\n            canvas. Domestic sewage produced from the construction\n            camping sites should be centrally treaded, and excrement and\n            urine may be compost-treated and then become a fertilizer\n            for grasslands. Otherwise bury non-hazardous solid waste in\n            pits.   Other measures include traffic safety, preventing\n            vehicle overload, hazardous waste disposal management,\n            controlling speed minimizing horn blowing, following exhaust\n            emission standards, and operating drainage facilities."}, "docdt": "2007-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
