quality\n            improvement in undergraduate science and engineering\n            departments in selected universities; (b) assist in\n            strengthening the teaching and research capacity of marine\n            science institutions to address environmental problems; (c)\n            assist in improving the quality of practical science and\n            engineering programs in the open universities and in\n            selected junior technical colleges; (d) improve\n            opportunities for joint research activities in basic\n            sciences through strengthening common research facilities at\n            the Korea Basic Science Center (KBSC); and (e) enhance the\n            quality of training in selected vocational high schools. The\n            project will also include specialized equipment and civil\n            works for the construction of additional laboratories for KBSC."}, "docdt": "1993-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
