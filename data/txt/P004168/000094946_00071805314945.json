The lessons\n            reinforce once again, that simple project design, and\n            careful assessment of the implementation agencies at the\n            earliest stages, facilitates project success. It is further\n            stated that institutional capacity enhances implementation,\n            as shown by the borrower's procurement agency, whose\n            knowledge of the Bank's procurement procedures greatly\n            benefited implementation. The diffusion of project\n            equipment, made available to outside institutions,\n            universities, private organizations, and industries,\n            resulted in high equipment utilization rates, thus\n            generating impressive numbers of research works, and\n            publications, as well as supplemental income for future\n            operation and maintenance funds of equipment."}, "docdt": "2000-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
