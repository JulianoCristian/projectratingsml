She has to lean on someone or something\n            all day to avoid falling. George Marafet, 15, known\n            affectionately as Giovanni, lives with a different set of\n            handicaps. He was born a Roma, or gypsy, in a family of 7\n            with a father in jail, a mother out of work, and no real\n            hope of ever finishing school. Both used to spend their days\n            doing \"not much\" and struggle with feelings of\n            worthlessness. Both are now beneficiaries of programs run by\n            an exceptional Romanian non-profit association that strives\n            to teach independence and self-respect. Motivation Romania\n            is based in Bragadiru, a town of concrete apartment blocks\n            in the suburbs of the capital city of Bucharest, where the\n            back roads are unpaved and goats chew on trash. Primarily an\n            NGO run by disabled people for disabled people, it recently\n            extended its reach to some of its downtrodden neighbors:\n            young delinquents living as social outcasts. This generosity\n            was awarded a $20,000 grant by the Romanian Social\n            Development Fund, an institution partially financed through\n            a World Bank loan to the Romanian government, that supports\n            community-driven development."}, "docdt": "2006-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
