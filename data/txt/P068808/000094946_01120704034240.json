The first funds\n            grants to sub-projects prepared by recipients in poor rural\n            communities and disadvantaged groups, from the following\n            categories: small rural infrastructure (rehabilitate,\n            upgrade, build or equip rural roads, water supply, small\n            bridges, community centers, small-scale flood defenses,\n            etc.); community-based social services for disadvantaged\n            children, shelters for the homeless, home care for the\n            disadvantaged, etc.); income generating activities;\n            follow-up activities; and builds community capacity. The\n            second component, which focuses on knowledge sharing and\n            partnership building, comprises three sets of activities: 1)\n            information, education, and communication activities; 2)\n            building \"bridging\" social capital by creating\n            networks of \"graduating\" community-based\n            organizations and facilitating continued partnership between\n            local authorities and CBos, especially in the area of\n            sustainability; and 3) building linkages with other national\n            poverty reduction agencies and with project s with similar\n            set-up in the Region.
