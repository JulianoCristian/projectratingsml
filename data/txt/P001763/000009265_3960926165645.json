Specifically it will improve the quality\n            and efficiency of primary education in the city of Maputo\n            through improving primary school facilities, training for\n            school managers and principals and provision of essential\n            school supplies. Also, the project will strengthen the\n            quality and relevance of training for accountants, office\n            managers, customs officials, engineers and economists.\n            Finally, the project will improve education sector planning\n            and management."}, "docdt": "1988-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
