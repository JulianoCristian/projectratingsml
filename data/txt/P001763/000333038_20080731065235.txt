 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
      The IndependentEvaluationGroupassessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bank for two purposes:
first,to ensure the integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bankswork is producingthe
expectedresults,and second,to helpdevelop improveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough the
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGWBannuallyassessesabout 25 percentof
the Banks lendingoperations.In selectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those that are
innovative,large,or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or countryevaluations;those for which
ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments; and those that are likelyto generate
importantlessons.The operations,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger
evaluationstudies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion
Report (a self-evaluationby the responsibleBank department)and fieldwork conducted by IEGWB. To prepare
PPARs, IEGWBstaff examine project files and other documents,interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases
visit the borrowingcountry to discuss the operationwith staff of the Bank and the government, other stakeholders,
and beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to validate and augmentthe informationprovided in the ICR, as well
as examine issuesof special interestto broader IEGWBstudies.
      Each PPAR is subject to peer review and IEGWBmanagement approval.Once cleared internally, the PPAR
is reviewed by the responsibleBank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then sent to
the borrower for review; the borrowers'comments are attachedto the document that is sent to the Banks Board of
Executive Directors.After an assessmentreport has been sent to the Board,it is disclosedto the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      The time-testedevaluation methods used by IEGWBare suited to the broad range of the World Bank'swork.
The methodsoffer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibilityto adapt to lending instrument,project design, or
sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following
is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluationcriterion (additionalinformationis available on the
IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.orgAeg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevantobjectives were achieved, or are expectedto
be achieved,efficiently.The rating has three dimensions:relevanceof objectives,efficacy, and efficiency.
Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project'sobjectives are consistentwith the country's current
development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals
(expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
OperationalPolicies).Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved,or expected to be
achieved,taking into accounttheir relative importance.Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved,or is
expectedto achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost comparedto
alternatives.The efficiency dimensiongenerally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings: Highly
Satisfactory,Satisfactory,Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that developmentoutcomes (or
expected outcomes)will not be maintained(or realized). Possible ratings: High Significant, Moderate, Negligibleto
Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services providedby the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supportedeffective implementationthrough appropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequate
transition arrangementsfor regular operationof supportedactivities after loanlcredit closing,toward the
achievement of developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrowerassumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and agreements,towards the
achievementof developmentobjectives and sustainability.The rating has two dimensions:government
performanceand implementingagency performance.Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,
ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on four education
projects inMozambique.

        The Education and Manpower Development Project (Cr. 1907, known also as
Education I)  was approved for a credit o f US$15.9 million equivalent inMay 1988. The
credit closed on April 30, 1996 after extensions totaling 4 months and disbursed fully.

        The Second Education Project (Credit 2200) was approved for a credit o f
US$53.7 million equivalent inDecember 1990. The credit closed on December 31, 1998
after extensions totaling 26 months; US$l.3 million was canceled.

        The Capacity BuildingHumanResources Development Project (Credit 2436,
often referred to as `third project'), was approved for a credit o f US$48.6 million
equivalent inNovember 1992. The credit closed on September 30, 1999 after extensions
totaling 27 months; US$2.6 million was canceled.

        The Education Sector Strategic Program (ESSP; Credit 3172) was approved for a
credit o f US$71.8 million equivalent inAugust 1998. The credit closed on June 30,2006
after extensions totaling 24 months; US$3.5 million was canceled.

        The projects inMozambique were selected for assessment inorder to study the
challenges o f improving learning outcomes ina low-income country at a time o f post-
conflict reconstruction.

        The PPAR i s based on the following sources: Implementation Completion Reports
(ICRs), Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs), Development Credit Agreements, task manager
interviews, and project files, particularly the supervision missions aide-memoires. Also,
IEGconsultedthe research literature and reports on Mozambique, and data on schooling
trends. An IEGmission visited Mozambique inSeptember 2007 to interview officials,
donors, and beneficiaries, observe instruction inschools, and collect other pertinent
information. Fieldvisits and detailed school observations took place inthe provinces o f
Maputo and Nampula. The author thanks the government officials who received the
mission for their extensive cooperation.

        Following standard IEGprocedures, copies o f the draft PPAR were sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. However, no formal
response was received.

Summary

        Mozambique has implemented a series o f four education projects that aimed to
expand the provision o f this educational level to lower-income populations. These
included: (i) the Education andManpower DevelopmentProject (Cr. 1907, approvedin
FY88); (ii) Second Education Project (Cr. 2200, approved inFY91); (iii) Capacity
             the                                                                 the
BuildingHumanResources Development Project (Cr.2436, approved inFY93); and (iv)
the Education Sector Strategic Program (ESSP; Cr. 3172, approved inFY99).

        To help rehabilitate the country's economy after the civil war, the Bank inthe
1990s supported an economic rehabilitationprogram. This included expansion o f
primary educationto alleviate poverty andexpansion o fhigher educationto enhance
management capacity. Accordingly, the Bank's lending portfolio focused on improving
access, quality, and management o fprimary and university education; secondary
education received little attention. This strategy focused resources closest to the areas o f
immediate needinthe early 1 9 9 0 but~ ~ subsequent neglect may have affected long-term
humanresource development. The numbers o fcitizens qualified to become teachers are
small, and this limitation adversely affects instructional quality at all levels.

        The government usedcredit proceeds effectively to expand the education system,
so gross enrollment rates ingrades 1-5 have increased from about 60 percent in 1992 to
about 103 percent in2005. The progress has encouraged more donors to invest inthe
education sector (12 donors participated inthe most recently completed sector-wide
project and 21 inan ongoing project), so since 1999 the Bank has financed education
through multidonor sector-wide approaches.

        However, the educational system o f Mozambique provides little knowledge,
particularly to poorer and rural students. Official contact hours inschools with multiple
shifts are only 700 per year, as opposed to 875 in single-shift schools. Incities, frequent
teacher absenteeism reduces the already limitedinstructional time. The IEGmission also
observed highstudent absenteeism, with halfthe class often missing inupper primary
grades. Inthe approximately 45 classrooms visited by the IEGmission, little information
was presented or elaborated; instead, primary-school children spent much time copying
from the blackboard but many were illiterate and could not decipher their notes or learn
information from the textbooks that had been provided at great cost. Students at all post-
primary education levels (including the university classes visited by the mission) were
also largely engaged incopying or taking word-for-word dictation, lacked textbooks, and
had limitedunderstanding o f subjects such as mathematics or biology. At all levels,
teachers interacted mainly with the few students able to keep up.

        The limitedinstruction resultedinrepetitionrates that were about 25 percent until
2004. At that time, the government implemented a policy o f semiautomatic promotion
recommended by the Bank, which reduced repetition by about 50 percent. However, the
policy allows students who are hardly literate to graduate fiom primary school and enter
secondary. This has exacerbated a severe lack o f prerequisite knowledge that impacts all
levels o f education. Lack o f knowledge has beena long-standing concern inuniversity
faculties and teacher training colleges, but inthe pushto expand the system, this issue has
receivedlittle attention.

         Central and district officials interviewed by the IEGmission agreed that the
systemprovides limited knowledge to studentsbut expressed aninability to improve it.
Some interviewees criticized donors for their interest inexpanding enrollments without
scrutinizing learning outcomes. Yet, some instructional problems have relatively simple
solutions (such as revising the grade 1textbook to teach reading more efficiently), but
incentivesto deal with this level o f detail have been limited. The Bank and the other
donors have largely focused on high-level policy issues and have not systematically
collected first-hand information about instructional conditions, relying instead on data
provided by the government. Furthermore, coordination andharmonization complexities
have left donor staff little time to look into instructional issues.

         The assessedprojects are rated as follows:

                                                  Risk to           Bank            Borrower

         The objectives o f all four projects were highly relevant to the needs o fthe
country. The outcomes o f the first two projects are ratedsatisfactory inlight o f high
relevance, substantial efficiency and modest efficacy, but the outcomes o f the last two are
ratedmoderately unsatisfactory because many activities were not carried out and quality
objectives were not achieved. Riskto development outcome i s rated low inthe first two
projects and moderate inthe last two; the enrollment expansionhas proved resilient over
time, butpoor quality results inpremature dropout and limited schooling for about half
the students. Bank performancewas satisfactory inthe first two projects butmoderately
unsatisfactory inthe last two due to poor quality at entry and weak supervision o f
important activities. Borrower performance i s rated moderately unsatisfactory inthe
Capacity Buildingproject due to government-level conflicts and poor financial
management and moderately satisfactory inthe Education Sector Strategic Program
project.

         This assessmentprovides a numbero flessons for the education sector:

    0    Very low-income countries receiving donor aid may succeed inproviding broad
         access to education. But without a critical number o f reasonably well educated
         teachers, interested administrators, and strong instructional supervision, the
         educational system may provide little learning to the students (para. 3.22);

                                      X l l l



Monitoring o f learning outcomes i s critical inall educationprojects, particularly
where very poor populations are involved. Without clear and monitorable targets,
educational systems may enrol and graduate students who lack basic skills;

Itis not safe to assumethat local educators alone will be able to produce effective
training materials or disseminate effective methods. Transmission o f durable
knowledge to the poor involves technical issues and research that are relatively
new andare little-known among government and donor staff or consultants. State-
of-the art technical assistance i s needed to address learning issues (para. 3.17,
3.20);

Textbooks (or organized printedmaterials) are needed for all students at all levels
to take home. Without textbooks, valuable instructionaltime tends to be used for
copying or word-for-word dictation. Instructional aids must also be provided so as
to maximize the amount o f information that can be learned by students (para.
3-20);

Governments are likely to respond to donor priorities and informational
requirements. Ifdonors are perceived as focusing mainly on access, governments
are less likely to focus on improving learning outcomes (para. 4.16);

Cross conditionalities among donors may be best managed through sector-wide
agreements and plans with partners. However, complex arrangements involving
large numbers o f donors requiremuch foresight interms o f harmonization and
agreement on sectoral strategy. The financing and planningcomplexities o f donor
harmonization may detract from attention to substance (para. 5.8); and

Strategies aimed at increasing girls' enrolment require strong government
commitment at a high level to be effective. Otherwise, activities may take place
butprove unsustainable or ineffective inthe long run(para. 3.7).

1. Background

1.1       Before the independence o f Mozambique, the school system was designed to
serve the white settlers, and space for the Africans was limited. At the time o f
independence in 1975, only about 30 percent o fthe school-aged children were enrolled in
school, and only about 10 percent o f the adult population was literate.

1.2       The government that took over after independence emphasized primary education,
adult literacy, and basic health care. However, a civil war (1976-1992) destabilizedthe
economy and destroyed or closed about 60 percent o f the primary schools. Between 1975
and 1986 demandfor educationrose. Primary school enrollments grew from about
350,000 to 1.2 million, while secondary school enrollments rose from 26,000 to 136,000.'
However, the schooling process inthe 1980s was very inefficient. Classes o f 60 or more
students, triple shifts and short hours, and the continued use o f Portuguese (this country
of 19.8 million speaks 11 languages) made learning accessible only to the brightest or
well off. O f about 500,000 children entering grade 1,only about 1,000 were left ingrade
10 and only about 300 entered the university each year. Girls accounted for only about
44 percent o f primary-level enrollment rates and were scarce inhigher levels.

1.3       To meet the country's humandevelopment goals, the rehabilitation o fthe
education system was considered critical. The government requested help from the World
Bank and other donors.

1.4       Donor Coordination and Sectoral Financing. A host o f donors has assisted
Mozambique since its independence. These include multilateral banks (African
Development Bank-AfDB, the Islamic Development Bank), and many UnitedNations
agencies (World FoodProgram, UnitedNations Development Program-UNDP,
UNESCO, and the UnitedNations PopulationFund-UNFPA). Bilateral aid includes the
UK,Finland, Sweden, Denmark,UnitedKingdom, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany,
Canada, Finland,Portugal, Spain, Italy, Japan, Canada, and Cuba. The multilateral banks
and Japan have largely financed construction o f buildings, whereas the bilaterals have
financed technical assistance and instructional inputs such as textbooks. Some o f these
aid the central government, while others (such as Denmark and Germany) also work in
specific provinces. Several donors have financed fellowships for higher education over
the years, including the former socialist governments o f Eastern Europe. Donor
contributions constitute roughly 50 percent o f the annual budget for Ministry o f
Education and Culture (MEC; Figure 1). Donor coordination challenges have
necessitated financing through a sector-wide approach (SWAP).Fundsare pooled, and
the government provides monitoring data to donors who rarely carry out their own
supervision missions (See more detail inthe Issues section.).

BankSector Strategy
1.5     The Bank's involvement inthe education sector started in 1988 and initially
focused on the economic rehabilitation o f the war-ravaged country. The primary concern
was the almost complete lack o ftrained persons who could staff public-sector institutions
and carry out needed work, including the rehabilitation ofthe infrastructure. Therefore,
for the first 15 years of Bank's involvement inthe sector, the focus was on access to basic
education to alleviate poverty and on higher or technical educationto develop
management capacity inthe government andprivate sector.
1.6     To fulfill this two-pronged development objective, the Bank financed a series o f
education projects, four o fwhich hadbeen completed by September 2007 (Table 1.1).
The first, second, andfourth projectsprimarilysupported primary education, but all
financed some higher educationactivities (Annex Tables A1-4.). The most recently
completed project (Education Sector Strategic Program project, 1999-2006) was a sector-
wide approach (SWAP) supported by 12donors. Because about 21 donors are interested
inprimary education, the Bankdoes not finance the ongoing Education Sector Strategic
Program 11. However, it continues to support the Governnment's Strategic Plan for
Education and Culture by actively participating incountry dialogue and providing
technical assistance inprimary education. Also, it has financed a higher education project
(Cr. 3609) and a technical-vocational educationproject (Cr. 4156) that also finances the
subsector as a SWAp (Table 1.1).

 1.7      Mozambique continues to suffer from a dramatic deficit of professionals with
secondary and post-secondary education inall fields. Under the initiative for Heavily
IndebtedPoor Countries (HIPC), the Bank has financed three poverty reduction support
credits (PRSCs) aimed at critical sectors, including ed~cation.~                  Fundsare not earmarked
and there are no triggers for education, butthe PRSCs aimed at creating fiscal space for
education expenditures. The funding has enabled the government to increase
expenditures for primary education and devote an average o f 20 percent o f revenue -
about 4.7 percent o f GDP-to            this sector (Table 1.2). Mozambique's percentage o fGDP
for education compares well with sub-SaharanAfrica average^.^

1.8       As a result o f donor investments, Mozambique has reached the Education for All
goal o f spending 20 percent o f total budget revenue on education. Since 2002 primary

 PRSC 111. The average percentageof GDP for education in subsaharanAfrica is 4.0 percent (World Bank 2004,
PRSC I,p. 16). In2000, donor funding accounted for 46 percent of all spending on education, 70 percent inhealth, and
75 percent inroads and water, including recurrent expendituressuch as drugs and road maintenance. (See more
information inTable A-5).

education has received more than 50 percent o f the education budget, and secondary
roughly 14 percent. Furthermore, the government has developed a Strategic Plan for
Educationand Culture (2006-201 l),             whose central objective is the rapid progress towards
universal primary education by 2015.5 To close the financing gap and fulfill this goal,
Mozambique will receive funds from the Fast Track Initiative (US$79 million in2008-
09).


EducationSector PoliciesPromotedThroughBankLending
1.9       Lending activities over the years have supported the following policies and
strategies:

    0     Enrollment expansion o f primaryeducation (particularly for girls) and consequent
          emphasis on expansion and rehabilitation o f infrastructure;

    0     Capacity buildingthrough scholarships and training -but limitedattention to
          content or quality o f training received; no textbook provision for secondary or
         post-secondary education;

    0     Automatic promotion within"cycles o f learning" (grades 1-2, grades 3-5, and
          grades 6-7) to reduce grade repetition that averaged about 25 percent.6 No
          specific policies aimed at reducing repetition through improved learning
          outcomes; and

    0     Abolition o f school fees in2004 and financial support to schools for operation
          expenditures.
1.10      Evidence inproject documents (see section on Bank performance) suggests that
the Bank's strategy was drivenby the implicit assumption that once inputswere
provided, teachers would teach and students would learn. Thus, neither the government
nor the Bank have monitored the extent to which instruction actually took place (e.g.
through attendance data or instruments measuring instructionaltime use), and the
methods o f making students literate were not scrutinized. The monitoring indicators have
been enrolment statistics (collected once early inthe school year) andmore recently,
completion rates.
1.11     Inits efforts to make the populationliteratewhile strengthening institutional
management, the country has taken a rather unusual route of supporting only the two
ends o f education. The first two projects did so inorder to meet urgent humanresource
needs, while the third intended to improve senior secondary education outcomes with
limitedinputs(Table 2.1, Annex Table A3). The documents o fthe fourth project show an
intention to deal with future secondary educationneeds but this subsector finally received
limited attention. Overall, the Bank only financed some buildings rather than learning-
related inputs or a strategy for secondary ed~cation.~             Thus, secondary education is

available mainly incities, so the candidates for university and other-post secondary
institutions tend to come from families that are better off. This tendency may have
exacerbated teacher shortages, giventhe multiple opportunities open to those who are
better off and the small number o f female graduates. (For example, in2005, the teacher
training colleges were producing only about 1,35 1new qualified teachers per year; MEC
2005). The outcomes o f the strategy to compress the middle level of education have not
yet beendealt with incurrent lending or donor aid, though efforts were underway in
2008.


2. ProjectObjectivesand Implementation

2.1        The four projects supported the government o f Mozambique inits efforts to
rehabilitate its economy through improved human capital and to alleviate poverty through
education that would enable the population to locate information, understand it, and make
appropriate decisions. All four projects aimed at improving physical facilities, the quality
o f education, and institutional effectiveness (Table 2.1).

2.2        The first three projects were `staggered', andtheir implementation overlapped
from 1993 to 1996. These were executed by a project implementation unit (PIU) that also
implementedthe projects o f other donors. The last completed project was implemented
directly by the Ministryo f Education.

2.3        The projects had complex designs, involving multiple components and agencies.
Execution faced continuous obstacles. Staff turnover inthe PIU and a lack o f experience
with the Bank's procurement rules andthe country's system o f centralized contracting
caused startup delays. A lack of coordination betweenthe school and the university
components caused duplication and further difficulties. There were political impasses and
internal disputes during the third and fourth projects; there were also disputes among
donors and the government regarding governance problems and textbook costs, as was
the case with Swedishbilateral andthe World FoodProgramme duringthe second
project. Inaddition, floods and cyclones repeatedly delayed implementation or destroyed
infrastructure. Sometimes it was necessary to divert money from quality inputsfor the
rehabilitation o f more buildings (e.g. inthe Education Sector Strategic Program project -
ESSP).

2.4        The first project essentially closed as scheduled, but the other projects had delays
o f 24-27 months. Overall, the projects were largely implemented as designed, and most
planned activities were carried out (Annex Tables A 1-4).

2.5        To assess project effects on the instructionalprocess, the IEGmission visited 12
schools inthe Maputo and Nampula provinces, as well as the Instituto Comercial de

8The schools visited in Maputo were: Estrela do Oriente, 25 de Septembre, escola Annexa to teacher training college, 3
de Fevereiro primary schools; Laulane, secondary school. Schools visited inNampula were: Namigonha, Meconta
district central primary school, Monape district central primary school, Lumbo bilingual primary education program,
Muatal secondary school, and Ilha de Mozambique secondary school. Instruction was observed in about 60 classes. In
the UniversityEduardo Mondlane, the mission visited the engineering, sciences, and economics faculties and observed
instruction in four classes. The sample was purposive; schools were selected on a convenience basis and some were in
rural but not very poor areas.

Maputo, the Eduardo Modlane University, and the Pedagogical University o fNampula.
Most visits were planned inadvance by the government, andmany schools had been
informed o f the mission's arrival. Classroom instruction was observed to determine how
the recent project inputswere used, and segmentswere videotaped for subsequent study
by the mission and counterpart staff. Overall, about 38 government officials and school
staff were interviewed regarding project outcomes and impacts. Individual and group
interviews were also conducted with donor staff. (See list of persons met inAnnex B.)

3. Achievement of the Project Objectives

3.1       This sectionpresents results and evidence regarding efficacy, that is the extent to
which project activities and inputs may have contributed to outputs, outcomes, and
impacts.' All four projects aimed at improvingphysical facilities inschools, the quality of
education, and institutional effectiveness. The objectives were stated somewhat
differently ineachproject, but for brevity, similar objectives are treated under one
heading. Objective-wise ratings are inTable 2.1 and Table A5.

Expansionof access and improvedphysicalinfrastructure

3.2      Theprojects built a large number of schools and staff houses inthe country as
well as laboratories and classroom buildings inthe Eduardo Mondlane University. The
first and second education projects built or rehabilitated about 2150 classrooms, while the
third(Capacity Building) project built one secondaryschool and rehabilitated four. The
fourth, ESSP, was expectedto build 12,000 classrooms but fell far short of its targets due
to intergovernmental disputes (Annex Tables A1-4).

3.3       All projects experienced difficulties with civil works. Fewcontractors were
available and some of them builtpoor-quality buildings (e.g. during the Capacity
Buildingproject) and greatly delayed or abandoned civil works, particularly inrural
areas. Becausecontractors had limitedability to buildrural schools, efforts were made to
involve communities. Communities could erect ina few months buildings made of
thatchedroofs and sun-baked bricks, but lackedthe capacity to build solid buildings or
provide windows, doors, and furniture. For example, only 17of the 55 schools planned
through a food-for-work program by the World FoodProgramme could be completed.
During all projects the Bank emphasizedmaintenancecapacity, but the effort was not
sustained andthe IEGmissionobservedthat buildings were poorly maintained.

3.4      As a result of Bankand other donor financing, the number ofpublic schools in
grades 1-5 rose from about 3,556 to 10,217 between 1992and 2005.'ORural schools
increasedby about 88 percent over the period, while urbanschools increasedby 32
percent (Figure 3.1).l1Infrastructure improvements have not kept up with surging
demand, especially inunderservedareas. The schools that were built quickly filled up,
operating at least two shifts. Many operate inthree shifts and some inMaputo operate in
four.

3.5       As a result o fthe infrastructure provision and teacher appointments, enrolments
increased dramatically, and abolition o f fees in2004 further stimulated enrolment at all
levels. Inabsolute terms, the number o f students inprimary school increased from 1.26
million in 1986to 3.87 million in2005 (Figure 3.2). From 1992to 2005, the gross
enrolment rate (GER) ingrades 1-5 increased from about 60 to about 103 percent, and for
grade 1enrolments were 131percent (Figure 3.3 and Table 3.2). Inupper primary                l2
grades 6-7, the gross enrolment rate increased from 13 to 47 percent inthe same period.
Construction o f upper secondary schools (by the Capacity Buildingproject and ESSP) led
to enrolments o f about 12,000 students by 2000 and about 25,000 by 2005 (Table 3.2).

3.6       Though the student numbers show dramatic improvements, they are still very low.
There is a large difference between gross and net enrolment rates because children start
primaryschool late and often repeat classes (Tables A-6 to A-9). As a result, students are
about four years overage. Due to the extensive dropout and failure (Table 3.2, see



12The series attemptsto capture enrollment before, during, and after the projects ended. The enrollment ratios reported
in various documentsat various dates difersignificantly, andtheir accuracy is unclear given alack of updatedcensus
data. This report presentsfigures from various sources that seem most consistent. Since student ages are often
uncertain, it reports mainly gross rather than net enrollment figures.The ESSP ICR reports gross enrollment rate of 86
percent for 2003, butjust one or two years later. various reportsshow rates of 103 percent or higher (e.g. the PRSC
project documents and the 2004 Povertyand SocialImpact Analysis). The higher figures are inconsistentwith earlier
estimates.

3.7      Increasingfemale participation. Starting with the secondproject (which had an
explicit gender objective), efforts were made to improve girls' enrolments through
community awarenesscampaignsand scholarships. However, only a total o f about 1,670
girls got scholarships (Annex Tables A-3 andA-4). The government reduced scholarship
amounts from US$50 to US$15 per month and gave some scholarships to boys, but
ultimately the banking network was too limitedfor a broad use of this scheme. Overall,
few initiatives for girls were implemented, andthey had a limitedeffect. Female
participation has increasedto some extent, particularlyin grades 1-5, from 41.2 percent in
1999to about 46 percent in2005. Overall girls' participation inupperprimary and lower
secondary remained constant from 1994to 2001.14 Though enrolments tripledinupper
secondary education (from 1271 in 1994 to 4301 in2001), the female participation rate
duringthe same period stagnated(from 25.8 percent in 1994to 26.4 percent in2001), and
few girls graduate. The gender gap is greatest inthe north, while it has nearly disappeared
inthe south. Girls start school later thanboys and drop out earlier, so they get very little
education (Figure 3.4). Sexual harassmentandteachers' demands for fees may adversely
affect female school attendance."

beginning o f the school year. Student-teacher ratios ingrades 1-5 increased from 54 in

3.9      Enrolments have substantially increased at the Eduardo Mondlane University
which i s the largest higher education institution inthe country. They had risen to about
6,800 by 1999, and new admissions doubled from about 1,000 in 1992 to 2,155 in 1999.17
As dormitory space increased, the number o flive-in studentsrose from 696 in 1994 to
1,063 in2001 (Female live-in students increased only from 107to 141because only one
o fthe dormitories plannedfor girls was built.) The numbers o f students enrolled in

However, the IEGmission observed very poor reading performance among second-year
students.


Improved Quality of Education

3.11     The projects financed many inputs and activities aimed at improving quality o f
education at all levels:

3.12     Curriculum development. The projects supported curriculum development for all
levels o f education including technical assistance and fellowships for universitycurricula.
Primary school curricula were repeatedly revised, and newtextbooks were produced with
each revision. Revisions were seen as necessary partlybecause time wastage and poor
learning outcomes led to the conclusion that the curriculum was too demanding.l9

3.13     Textbooks. The projects supported the provision o f free textbooks for every
primary-school student. (No textbooks were plannedfor post-primary education, except
for libraries o f schools or universities.) The projects procured at least ninemillion
textbooks, partly financed with bilateral funds (Annex Tables A1-A4). Textbook
provision was a difficult task, given the limitedprintingcapacity inMozambique. During
the first and second projects they were imported from India, and disputes ensued between
donors and providers over quality o f binding andhighcost. Distribution proved difficult
given the poor transportation network, and contractors sometimes preferredto abandon
the books destined for inaccessible sites. DuringESSP, procurement and distribution of
books to districts was decentralized. Upto about 2003, about halfthe students lacked
textbooks, but the distribution systemhas since improved. The IEGmission found that
most students inthe schools that were visited did have textbooks, although many could
not readthem and (as noted inthe Capacity Buildingproject ICR) teachers hardly used
them. Local printingcapacity has also improved, butcosts remaintwice as highas book
costs incountries like India and Malaysia.

3.14     Mother tongue instruction. In 1986, only 1percent o fthe population were native
Portuguese speakers, and about 25 percent o f the population were conversant in
Portuguese. A mother-tongue pilot intwo languages was introduced inthe early 1990s
through the second project, and another pilot was done during ESSP. Though results
were encouraging, 15 years after the first pilot there were only 63 schools teaching in
native languages. One problem has been the challenge o f writing books in 11 rarely
written languages and training teachers to use them. Books inlocal languages have
particularly highcosts, given the limitedprintingamounts, and the existing programs
have faced scarcity.

3.15     Health and nutrition activities. The second project introduced various health
initiatives, such as deworming, vitamin A, and iron supplementation (administered by a
local non-governmental organization). Snacks were also given in some schools up to
1992. The efforts did not prove sustainable inthe long term, but deworming has become
a country-wide program that is carried out every year.

3.16      Teacher training. All projects built or strengthened training colleges for primary-
and secondary-school teachers. In-service andpre-service training was provided to many
untrained teachers and administrators who were hiredto help expand the system (Annex
Tables A1-4). As a result, the number o f teachers who are considered trained increased,
although their proportion decreased as enrolments increased (Figure 3.6; nationwide, the
absolute number o f qualified teachers for senior secondary schools increased from 140 in
1996 to just 368 in2001.) Completion documents describe training as weak and lacking a
focus or strategy, but project files show little concern with content. DuringESSP, the
two-year pre-service training (after 10 years o f schooling) was reduced to one, with little
discussion about what educators should know or how their classroom behavior should be
most efficiently modified. The skills that teachers acquired duringthe various training
events was never tested.

3.17      The IEGmission examinedthe materials o fthe Instituto de Educacgo Aberta e a
Distancia (IEDA) that are used to train andpromote teachers through distance education.
The modules contained little factual information and had several mistakes. Furthermore,
they made no mention o f issues that are critical ineffective instruction: time to be spent
on various topics, textbook use, students' literacy, classroom management, assessing
students' comprehensionfrom oral responses, or makingand controlling groups inlarge
classes. InMay 2007 there were 10,294 teachers registeredinthe basic course, and 7,23 1
had recently graduated. However, due to quality concerns, it i s difficult to consider
graduates o f these courses as 'trained' teachers.

3.20       Mission visits to schools. Despite the many quality-oriented inputs from the
projects, Mozambican schools provide very few opportunities for learning. Duringvisits
to schools, the IEGmission observed the following:

     Mozambican schools inprinciple operate for 175 days a year; the schools operate
     about 875 hours for two-shift schools, and 700 hours for three-shift                                    Much
     o fthe time available for instruction was wasted. Inurbanschools, manyteachers
     were absent or had come to the school and abandoned the classrooms. The principals
     and the pedagogicaldirectors (who exist inmost schools) were apparently unaware o f
     the numbermissingor ofclassroom activitie~.'~Inone large Maputo school, for
     example, the director mentionedthat o f 12 sections only two teachers were absent,
     but infact only two sections were found operational. Ina large new senior secondary
     school o fNampula, four o fthe 15 teachers were absent (three taught science), and the
     director was unaware o f this fact. Students without teachers strolled the grounds
     noisily disturbingthe few classes that were working. One possible reason for the
     highabsenteeism rate is that secondary educationteachers inurbanareas are very few
     andwork three shifts, while some are still universitystudents. Scarcity combinedwith
     modest salaries has resultedina shortage o f qualified personnel inthe numbers
     req~ired;'~

     The instructional activity observed inthe vast number o f classes was copying; the
     teacher wrote on the board or waited for the students to copy. Primary-level students
     could sketch letters (Figure 3.7) but were unable to read what they had copied. In
     secondary schools and inteacher training colleges, copying was supplemented by
     word-for-word dictation o ftexts, since students get no textbooks. For example, when
     asked to explain plant reproductionthat they hadjust copied (Figure 3.9), lothgraders
     merely read back the dictated passage. Students inthe secondary grades studied
     Portuguese, mathematics, physics, and chemistry without textbooks. Without




22 The international mean is 850 hours inprimary school (see Abadzi 2007). During2007, over a month was taken up
with census registration, during which the schools were closed. Agreementwas reached during the appraisal of the
second project that the number of hours would increase from 600 hours and this was accomplished(Education I1S A R
p. 40.) Schools that have two shifts are supposedto have five instructional hours per day, but schools that have three
shiftshave only four, andthere are no provisions to make up for the lost time.

23 Yet 95 percent of teachers reported in the SACMEQ survey that they receive advice `often' or sometimes from their
directors. (Passos et al. 2005, p. 85).

24 Capacity Buildingproject ICR (World Bank 2002). The mission heard repeated concerns that salaries were too low
for teachers to work, but they are over 3.5 timesthe per capita income. The international researchhas not found
consistentlinkages between teacher salaries and absenteeism (the more highly educated or paid teachers are often
absent), but has found clear linkagesbetween supervision and absenteeism (Muralidhara and Sundararaman, 2006).

     words per minute;25and

     Most students, who were observed, aside from two middle-class schools o f Maputo,
     were unable to readuntilgrade 5, and even at that grade many readhaltingly. Some
     teachers expressed the beliefthat students knewhow to read because they could copy
     the letters or repeat passages inunison. The grade 1textbook contributedto this
     problem, because it was developed usingthe whole-word approach; it does not teach
     individual letters or syllables, and introduces calligraphic letters along with standard
     letter forms. The many studentswho remained illiterate after whole-word literacy
     instruction cannot learn from the primary school textbooks that have been provided
     with mucheffort and expense.26

     Absenteeism or informal dropout among students was high; inone school at the
     outskirts o fNampula, for example, only about a third of the class was present in
     grades 3-4 (Figure 3.11). The teachers were observed covering the curriculum,
     although most o f their students could not read or follow. By grade 4, ineffect
     teachers were conducting classes withjust the 3-4 brightest students, while others sat

      received from schools. Paradoxically, the vast majority of students (e.g. 85-96
      percent) were found to be progressing `positively' and got passing grades (Figure
      3.8). The school and local authorities did not seem to question the evaluation criteria

      inspectors inNampula. The training curriculum consisted o f legal and safety issues,
      school and financial management, and personnel issues. But the curriculum didnot
      include any training for monitoring literacy or improving learning outcomes. The
      trainer incharge o f the event stated that inspectors were already experts inthis area,
      and it was not necessary to train them further.

3.21       Evidence for learning outcomes inMozambique is sparse. The following sections
present the existing data.

3.22       The sample-based tests given in 1998-2000 showed extensive deficiencies in
Portuguese as well as inmath, with students showing a limitedunderstandingo f concepts
likeplace value o fnumbers. Higher grades scored better, particularly inscience, butthe
survivingpopulation represented about a third o fthe students who had started ingrade 1.
(The scores cannot be efficiently summarized and are not presented inthis report.)

3.23       The only performance data available onthe schools o f Mozambique come from
participation in SACMEQ, an international comparative assessment (Southern and
Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality). Inthis test,
Mozambique performed well compared to other area countries, scoring above the mean
of 500 (5 16 inreading and 530; Annex Table A-10). However, this i s a single measure
whose results cannot be attributed to the projects. Furthermore, government staff
involved inthe testing process expressed concerns about sampling bias. The sixth graders
who were tested constituted only 25 percent o fthe cohort that had entered ingrade 1, and

*'Astudyin     Pakistanfound that teachers who were absent often tended to give passinggrades, buttheir studentswere
less likely to continue, since they lackedknowledge(King et al. 1999).

                                                           17

the frequent absences o f poorly performing students made it likely that those who were
present on the day o f the test were the better performers. (By comparison, countries such
as the Seychelles, Mauritius, and South Africa retain and test most students.) Even in
self-selected Mozambican sample, only 62 percent reached the SACMEQ minimumlevel
o f mastery, and only 8 percent reached the desirable level o f mastery. Inaddition, some
comparison countries include very low-income countries usingEnglishas a language o f
instruction, where literacy acquisition i s very difficult because o f Englishspelling
irreg~larities.~'

3.24       The ESSP had stipulated targets for increasing school completionrates (from 54
to 74 percent inprimary and from 58 to 66 percent insecondary). These are determined
through tests developed by M E C but scored inschools (see para. 3.19). The targets were
nominally met,       30butthey hadremainedstable untilthe year o fproject completion.
(Similarly insenior secondary education, average examination pass rates improved from
58 to 66 percent, and graduation rates increased from 40 to 54 percent.) The ESSP ICR
expressed doubts about the data quality and attainment o f targets, since more than half
the students lackedtextbooks. One potential reason for the increased pass rates was the
semi-automatic promotion3'instituted in2004 to reduce the highrepetition rate (see para.
1.9). Through this method, the average repetition rate of about 25 percent was reduced
by 50 percent between 1998 and2005. As a result, completion rates have increased over
the years (Table 3.2). It i s uncertain, however, whether students learn more andperform
better or whether teachers promote them more easily.

3.25       Though data are sparse, the very limited education offered inschools coupled
with a semi-automatic promotion policy suggests that schools allow a number of students
to graduatefrom primary schoolfunctionally illiterate. Those students may aspire to
enter secondary and higher education but are unpreparedto study the subject matter. The
effect reverberates through the school years. Many secondary school graduates have too
little knowledge to perform at the university. This has been noted since the first
andefforts were made to improve the performance o f incoming students with remedial


29 The difference between high and low socioeconomic status Mozambican students was limited, 523 vs. 511 points in
reading and 533 vs. 528 points in math. Teachers were also tested, who scored rather satisfactorily, 716 points in
reading and 782 points in math (Passos et al. 2005).

30 Key indicators of EducationI1ICR, p. 19. In2000 the pass rate rose to 67 percent and remained stable until 2005
when it rose to 75 percent attaining the target (ESSP ICR, p. 10).

31Accordingto the ESSP project appraisal document (Annex 2 p. 3) these "strategies will allow for longer periods for
children to absorb material". The line of reasoningfor this assumptionwas not apparent.

 classes. However, professors reportedto the IEGmission their frustrations and
 difficulties indealing with poorly qualified students, who pass entrance examinations but
 lack sufficient knowledge to deal with freshmen courses. The teacher training center in
 Nampula also reportedthe same difficulty.

 3.26     Paradoxically a survey has shown that the population i s relatively satisfied with
 the current provision o f education.33 About two-thirds o f urban households-but                        only
 half o fthose inrural areas-perceived            an improvement ineducation over 2001-06. Two
 thirds o fthose who didcited expansion o fthe school network as the chief reason for the
 perceived improvement. Actually, inrural areas almost a quarter o f households perceive
 that conditions have worsened, and female-headed households inrural areas express the
 most dissatisfaction. The dissatisfactionwas due to a need for bribes and distance from
 schools. While better-off households inurban areas express more satisfaction, the
 poorest households inrural areas complain the least about recent developments.

 3.27     At the EduardoMondlane University, graduation rates have steadily increased.
 Partly through fellowships and staff development duringthe Capacity Buildingproject,
 the percentage o f Mozambican staff with graduate degrees rose from 17percent in 1992
 to 46 percent in 1999. Students' examinationpass rates improved from 39 percent in
 1994 to 53 percent in2000, the number o f graduates rose from 148 in 1994 to 695 in
 2000, andthe percentage o f graduates who completed degree requirements duringthe
 prescribed time increased from 5 percent in 1997 to 53 percent in2000. However, the
 limitedperformance o f entering students continues to be a problem.

 Strengthening management capacity

 3.28     The projects provided much training andtechnical assistance to develop a
 management information system and to obtain and update educational data. Also, studies
 were financed to help MEC andthe university planfor systemic expansion. Donor aid
 and government commitment have resulted ina functional administrative system o f


 33 Poverty and Vulnerability Surveyo f 2006 (World Bank 2007). However, residents have a very limited frame of
 reference. This phenomenonhasbeen shownto exist among residents of some areas inBrazilwhere schools are
 known to perform poorly (Abadzi 2007).

                                               19

schools. Overall, capacity has increased, and institutional change has brought about
education studies and strategies, curricular development, girls' education, and support for
advanced degrees. Pedagogical directors, supervisors, and inspectors have been appointed
and some are well qualified. However, they rarely monitor instruction inschools at this
time and are not accountable for learning outcomes. And when they do write monitoring
reports, it i s unclear who (ifanyone) reads them and what actions are taken. The
supervision chain is broken, and M E C managers do not receive reliable feedback on
quality.

3.29    With fellowships and technical assistance, the projects have beenmore successful
at building capacity at the levels o f various institutions, but less so at the M E C
organizational level. The attempts to improve the M E C financial management had
modest results. Since about 2006, M E C has started to use an integrated financial
management system (SISTAFE) with aid from the budget support                      but outcomes
are unknown.

3.30    Thereis evidence that the system could deliver better education ifit were
specifically asked to do so. The IEGmission observed data entry for enrolments and
trimester grades indistrict offices o fNampula and Maputo. Staff mentioned to the
missionthat the Ministry andthe university have gained a lot inmanagement capacity
since development started duringthe first educationproject. Nevertheless, efforts to
decentralize management to the district level under ESSP have not been successful;
district staff are prepared to provide material inputs but lack the capacity to make
systemic decisions about quality o f education intheir areas. Given the limited interest
shown inlearning outcomes at the district level, decentralizationmay be limited to issues
for which local staff have skills, such as school construction and maintenance.

3.3 1   .Direct support to schools. After tuition fees were abolishedin2004, schools
received grants to replace the loss o f income. The amount in2004 was approximately
$0.50 per term per primary student and was calculated on the basis o f school enrolments
(as reportedonce early inthe academic year). The funds are to be used for non-salary
expenses, including purchasing essential teaching and learning materials and repairing
school buildings. School committees, the director, and district staff are authorized sign to
cash the checks provided by MEC, andthen the essential supplies can be purchased. For
financial control, halfthe schools are audited every six months.

3.32    The grants have been well received, and the mechanism has achieved some
positive                However, the annual amount i s too little for the smaller schools, and
directors may not manage it well. Since enrolment i s the criterion, enrolments could be
inflated. Community involvement has been weak, and communities may be ineffective at
stopping small-time corruption. However, the mechanismis new and is expected to
evolve as the time passes.

4. Ratings

ProjectOutcomes

4.1       The objectives o fthe four projects were highly relevant at the time o f appraisal
and have remained relevant for the country's development goals. The first and second
education projects were largely post-conflict reconstruction operations and built much-
needed infrastructure. Learning outcomes were to be achievedthrough access that was at
the time very limited.The projects were designedto deliver inputsefficiently, andthough
impact expectations were unclear, the input-oriented design was common inthat period
o f time and appropriate. The third (Capacity Building)project was closely linked to the
Country Strategy Paper andthe Social and Economic Rehabilitation Program o f 1991.
(Its design, involvingmultiple committees and two independent institutions, appeared
relevant at the time but provedhardto implement; see Bank performance.) Similarly, the
objectives and design o f the ESSP were inline with the Bank'sCountry Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Mozambique, which emphasized the expansion o f humancapital and
withthe 1990 Paris Declaration, which mandated donor partnerships and streamlined
coordination o f aid. The Action planfor the reduction o f Absolute poverty (PAFWA
2001-2005) has continued to support the objectives o f expanded and equitable access.
However, the complex SWAP designo fthe ESSP may have modest relevance when
learning outcomes are very low.

4.2       Thefirst andsecondeducationprojects largely aimed to improve quality by
rehabilitatingthe prerequisite infrastructure and providing materials and inputsto expand
enrolments inschools, university faculties, and post-secondary institutions. Despite
difficulties, and a lack o f management capacity in Mozambique, the inputswere
delivered relatively efficiently.36 Efficacy was substantial for the second project but only
modest for the first due to the lack o f evidence o f improved learning outcomes and
modest performance infilling manpower gaps (see Table A-5). Enrolments increased
dramatically and targets were met, although learning outcomes inthat period are
uncertain. Nevertheless, relevance for both projects was highand efficiency substantial,
so their outcomes are rated satisfactory. The Capacity Buildingproject was highin
relevance o f objectives but modest interms o f design relevance, efficacy, and efficiency;
it succeededinincreasingthe quantityandquality o funiversity graduates by providing
civil works, fellowships for professors, and support for university publications. However
it failed to improve the learning achievement o fsenior secondary education, andmany o f
the activities directed towards that objective (including increased enrolments for girls)
were not carried out. Its outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

4.3       Through a sector-wide approach, ESSP brought together multiple donors ina
rather complex financing scheme. This was an important donor harmonization
achievement, but design and outcomes were less impressive. The project aimed to
"improve access to higher-quality education through improved management" (Table 2.1).
This was an overly ambitious andcomplex objective that could not be attained


36 Projectdocumentsandmissioninformation offeredlimited evidencewith respectto efficiency. It was difficult to
assess clearly whether inputswere providedefficiently, given limited alternatives and the economic condition o f the
country.Ratesof returnwere provided in some projectdocuments, but their rationalewas unclear, andsavings as a
resultof repetitionreductiondid not take into accountthe missionfinding of widespread illiteracy.

                                              21

efficiently. Few activities actually aimed at improvingmanagement; to the contrary,
financing was diverted from quality inputs into civil works. And while most "hardware"
activities were completed, activities for girls' scholarships and for special education were
not implemented. Little attention was given to adult literacy and secondary education, as
well as to instructional issues at any level. Reductions inrepetition rates were attained
through semi-automatic promotion rather thanimproved learning outcomes. This
promotion policy risks creating cohorts o f students who graduate without literacy or other
skills associated with schooling and for whom education funds have essentially been
wasted. Not coincidentally perhaps, primary-school pass rates increased across the board
on the year that ESSP ended, but the improvements were difficult to explain. Overall
relevance was substantial, but efficacy and efficiency were modest. For these reasons,
project outcome i s rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

4.4     Overall, the risk that the development outcome will not be maintained i s rated low
for the first and second education projects, since their infrastructural inputs continue to be
used. It is rated moderate inthe Capacity Buildingproject; althoughthe inputs to the
university are likely to be sustained, capacity inhigher secondary education is precarious
given the large deficiencies inmaterials and teaching staff, and instructional time.

4.5     For the ESSP, the risk to development outcome i s also rated moderate; it i s
unclear how much knowledge students obtain through the educational system and how
muchthey will retain later and use for decision-making. Furthermore, it i s unknownhow
sustainable enrolments are when students drop out without obtaining the expected
knowledge from schools. Also, further development o fthe sector depends on the
continued collaboration o f multiple donors, which has beenquite complex.

BankPerformance

4.6     Bankperformance is ratedsatisfactory for the first and second educationprojects
interms o fquality at entry and supervision. The design ofthe second project was
complex, but some o f its components were pioneering and perspicacious, and task
managers were diligent inpursuingtheir implementation. Ingeneral, the Bank's
diagnostic work has been good at identifyingsector development needs and constraints,
but less good at assessing and following up onthe required organizational change.     37


4.7     The Capacity Buildingproject had serious design problems, and an unsatisfactory
quality at entry. The Bank didnot foresee the difficulties that interministerial councils
would have inpromoting project activities; it did not sufficiently prepare components
such as the girls' scholarship scheme, despite the highly publicized experiences o f the
similar lending inBangladesh. Preparationalso failed to pay sufficient attention to the
systemic needs o f senior secondary education. For example, the project omitted inputs in
the Pedagogical University, so the number o fqualified senior secondary teachers did not
increase substantially over the years andthe scarcity contributes to the instructional time
wastage observed by the IEGmission. Large cost overruns resulted from poor appraisal

                                                         22

cost estimates. Supervisionreports show much concern about the political problems
created by interministerial conflicts and civil works implementationbut show little
concern about how students would learn. For example, new senior secondary education
curricula were partly developed, but the project did not include textbooks or teacher
training. Without the necessary preparation and safeguards, girls' scholarships proved
difficult to administer and some were givento boys. For all these reasons, Bank
performance i s rated moderately unsatisfactory.

4.8        Overall, the Bank failed to pay attention to instructional delivery and to learning
outcomes. Inparticular, the Capacity Buildingand the ESSP projects made no attempts to
form a line o f reasoning that would lead from inputs to outcomes. Specific instructional
problems and deficiencies were attributed to general economic conditions, poverty, or
classroom crowding. Despite concerns inproject documents that students were not
learning the required material, the Bank equated enrolments with basic skills acquisition
and built rate-of-returnassumptions on the basis o f enrolment^.^' The alternative o f going
to school but remaining illiterate was not examined, and there has been no debate on
whether this is an acceptable option compared to not going to school at all. Similarly
there has been no economic analysis o fthe instructionaltime wastage or the opportunity
costs o f students who remain illiterate despite years o f school attendance.

4.9        Borrower and donor staff interviewed duringthe PPAR mission repeatedly
mentioned the inattentiveness to learning outcomes. One person interviewed felt that the
donors had a "gentleman's agreement" with the government, that enrollments would
show increases but that learning outcomes would not be studied too closely. Another
stated that school enrollments were a "mentira colectiva" (a collective lie) in
Mozambique because o f limited attendance. It was also felt by some that the Bank was
very diligent untilprojects became effective but less so thereafter.

4.10       The appraisal o fthe ESSPthrough a sector-wide approach and donor coordination
posed new complexities and difficulties. Muchpreparation and supervision time was
takenup by the logistics o fthis financing instrument, so important subsectors were not
sufficiently financed, and chains o f causality were not established. As with the previous
project, the girls' scholarship scheme did not benefit from earlier experiences in
Mozambique or inother countries. (See para. 4.3 on Outcomes.) A supervision review
by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in2002 rated supervision satisfactory but
considered quality at entry unsatisfactory and criticized the task team for failing to pay
attentionto content. Duringsupervision missions, field visits were reduced because the
government hadthe role o f giving progress updates(a policy which risks a conflict o f
interest). Thus, the Bank had little fist-handknowledge about intermediate outcomes and

38 The ESSPICR estimatedthat an extrayear of education would increasewages by about 3% inthe agriculturesector
andbetween5% and 15% innon-farmwork. "Higher labor productivity will resultfrom improvedquality of
education, and increasednumber completingschooling.Comparingthe proposedprogramto the without-program
situation, it canbe shown that an additional260,000 workers (thosegraduatingfrom upper primary) will increasetheir
lifetime earningsby 18.5%, and another 15,000 workers will increasetheir lifetime earningsby 14%(those graduating
from lower secondary). Overall, comparedto the currentenrollment, an estimated 1.4millionprimary students and
about 560,000 girls will be absorbedinto the systembetween 1999and2003 as adirect result of the program." The
PRSC Iprojectdocumentmaintainsthis assumption: "Public activities inthe social sector have adirect redistributive
effect on incomeand wealth. They also foster the development of humancapital, which is afkndamentalasset in all
spheres of society, with an unlimited demandonthe part of individuals and institutions(public andprivate). Education
has an importantplace in this context, directly impactingon the creationand expansionof humancapacities and
abilitiesand contributingdecisivelyto inclusive andbroad-basedeconomic growth."

a limitedsay over activities that were deleted or neglected. Staff worked hard to make
this instrument effective, but overall, Bank performanceinthe ESSP is ratedmoderately
unsatisfactory.


BorrowerPerformance

4.11      Over the longterm, the government has made good use o f donor funds. Ithas
shown a sustained commitment to the cause o f increasing access ineducation and has
devoted substantial expenditures towards serving poor areas and excluded populations. In
its efforts to implement multiple projects at the same time, the government
implementation capacity has beenstretched to the limit.39

4.12      Government performance fluctuated during various periods. It was relatively
strong duringthe first education project, despite the many difficulties and financial
management problems o f the era.4oCommitment flagged during the second project. The
PIUperformed satisfactorily, and most planned activities were carried out. However, the
PIU interacted mainly with the Bank rather than MEC, and there was a perception that
the projects had been conceived by donors. (This i s why the Bank supported integration
with Ministry activities as government capacity increased.) Overall, borrower
performance for these two projects i s ratedsatisfactory.

4.13      The Capacity Buildingproject was faced with political issues that impeded
implementation, partly due to infightinginthe inter-ministerial committee that was
overseeing it. The implementing agencies also had serious financial management
deficiencies, such as large cost overruns for civil works and pendingfellowships at
closing without sufficient funds for disbursement. Project staff gave girls' scholarships to
boys and allowed persons who were not teachers to live in staff quarters, thus reducing
the effectiveness o f these measures inexpanding senior secondary education. Borrower
performance i s rated moderately unsatisfactory.

4.14      The ESSP was implementedby MEC departmentsrather than a PIU, which
should have enhanced ownership. Shortly after effectiveness, however, the government
changed, and implementation stagnated for the next two years. Subsequently,
government personnel and procedures were supportive, and civil works were
implemented relatively smoothly despite precarious performance by contractors inthe
north o fthe country. Borrower performance i s rated moderately satisfactory.

MonitoringandEvaluationDesign,Implementation,andUtilization

4.15      Monitoringand evaluationdesigns for all projects are rated modest.The first
project was appraised before the Bank-wideadoption o f monitoring indicators and did


39In2006 about 35 percent ofthe pooled donor funds were not spent, and it is unclearwhether more donor funds can
be spent effectively.
40Some financial audits were qualified. For example, an audit of the first educationproject by Ernst and Young of
Maputo (dated 6/28/96)showed that funding for furniture exceededsources without authorization, while some
replenishments were made twice to the special account. Other audits found payments that were not reflected inthe
project accounts or bank statements as well as payments of US$20,000-47,000 that were not approvedby IDA. Project
records did not discuss the extent to which the Bank followed up on the issues.

                                                            24

not collect outcome data. The second and third projects collected data on pass rates and
enrolments. (Both the first and the second project documents stipulated annual evaluation
reports, but none could be located inthe files.) Monitoring implementation was modest
inallprojects. As mentioned above, achievement tests were developed andwere
administered on a sample basis repeatedly. However, the results were not compared or
reportedextensively, and there i s no evidence that they were used for decision-making.
A project completion seminar was heldat the end o fthe Capacity BuildingProject, but
there i s no evidence that it influenced the design of the next project or the long-delayed
secondary education strategy.

4.16      The project appraisal document o fthe ESSPoutlined an extensive planfor
monitoring and evaluation that was implemented to a considerable extent. Ministry o f
Education units were to develop monitoring instruments relevant to their respective
components, and financial monitoring reports were to consolidate statistical, financial and
physical data on the rate o f implementation. The donor group was to monitor and
evaluate their respective components and provide their own reports. However, as is so
often the case with monitoring and evaluation, the planproved too complex, and did not
appeal to everyone. Some donor staff stated to the IEGmission that donors should not be
involved inquality control, so donor reports were not generated. The Ministry has
provided timely and comprehensive financial monitoring reports on the physical progress
o fthe implementation but no field observations or reports on outcomes and component
implementation. Learning outcomes are still not being monitored, and without such
information, monitoring-related decisions are limited.

4.17      The projects missed opportunities to track learning outcomes across time. The
school leaving examination results were not usedfor monitoring, although it would have
been possible to obtain scores andmonitor them. An easily obtainable monitoring
indicator for learning would be the percentage o f studentswho read fluently (45-60
words per minute minimum) inall grades. One would expect the PRSC to focus on this
issue, but PRSCs inMozambique have no triggers for education anduse a single
indicator, primary school enr01ment.~~              This indicator is o f questionable reliability because
enrolment statistics pertainto the beginningo f the school year (on or about March 3),
after which the majority o f students insome areas may stop attending. The tendency of
PRSC to use oversimplified indicators o f little value i s an issue that deserves closer
attention.


5.        Issues and Prospects in Sectoral Strategy

Buying LearningTime for Students through the Fast-Track Initiative

5.1       The government i s working hardto overcome the many obstacles it faces and to
maximize donor support. This i s why Mozambique has submitted an Education Strategic
Planfor 2006-2011to achieve universal primary school coverage and Education for All
by the year 2015. Theplanwas endorsed by the donors andby representatives o f


41 The project document (PRSC 111) furthermore confuses enrollment with actual attendance, for which data are not
collected at the Ministry level. ("education and health indicator surveys found strong improvements, particularly inthe
areas of primary school attendance.. over 1996-2003" ).

Mozambican civil society inJune 2006. To deal with the inefficiencies o f the system, the
country will receive US$79 million from the Catalytic Fundo fthe donor-financed Fast-
Track Initiative for 2008/2009. This newpledge i s additional to US$70 million in
foreign funding already granted andbrings the total for the year to US$105 million. H o w
much learning can this money buy for the students o fthe country?

5.2        The findings o f this report raise concerns that, without changes, this investment
may have a limitedimpact on learning outcomes. Quality improvement i s a key priority
inthe Plan, butinstructional improvements andlearningoutcomes are not sufficiently
detailed. Fundingultimately translates into time and opportunities for students to learn.
If,for example, only 10percent ofthe availabletime is usedfor thispurpose, then
roughly 10 percent o f the funding i s efficiently used. Inthe current instructional
conditions the donors could be financing a very inefficient system.

5.3        Withtargeted attention, donor funding could be usedto help students catchup and
improve use o fthe officially available instructional time. Some options include the
following, starting inthe next academic year.

5.4        Conducting a readingfluency campaign,whose monitoring indicator would be
that all students in2008 will read at least 60 words per minute by the end o f grade 2 and
109 words by the end o f grade 5. The campaign could be extendedto include 124 words
per minute by the end o f grade 8, and 150 words per minuteby the end o f grade 12).42
Activities that could be considered:

    Measuring reading fluency and instructional time use throughout primary, secondary,
    andtertiary education to establish a baseline and to monitor progress;

    Holdingteachers, school directors, pedagogical directors, supervisors, inspectors,
    district directors, and provincial directors accountable for delivering learning
    outcomes (that may start with reading fluency and basic calculations). Requesting
    detailed reports regarding the number o f fluent readers, and teacher absenteeism up
    the supervisory chainandtaking action onthe basis o fthe reports. Inspectorswould
    check to verify how muchtime is infact used for learning tasks and how well
    studentsread;

    Making the supervisory chain function. Holdingmeetings at the school, district,
    province levels to determine and evaluate establish goals, expect outputs, provide
    feedback on reports up and down the supervision chain. Askingprincipals and
    pedagogicaldirectors to supervise closely the teachers o f grades 1-2 and ensure that
    they teach students how to decipher text (not merely to copy letters), andto report
    results to their superiors;

    Addingextratutoring for those who have already fallen behind; hiringsecondary and
    post-secondary students to read with lower-grade students after school hours; (the
    materials may be local newspapers and also the textbooks themselves, since many
    studentscannot readthem.) Since schools are crowded, tutoringsessions may be


42These indicators correspondto the 25th percentileofUS oral fluencynorms (Hasbrouckand Tindal2006). For the
research linking speed to comprehension,see Abadzi (2006).

    arrangedinthe open air, churches, mosques, or other buildings. School-level
    competitions could be organized on readingandmathfluency;

    Giving intrinsic as well as extrinsic incentives (praise and                        to administrators
    andteachers including bonuses to teachers ingrades 1-3 who make everyone able to
    read fluently. Conversely, enforcing the regulations and deducting the salaries o f the
    teachers o f all levels who fail to show up; and

    Acquiring the materials necessary to teach basic reading efficiently during class. The
    time left to the beginning o fthe next school year is short, butthe Progress0 materials
    inPortuguese andlocallanguages could bereproduced anddistributed, albeit at a
    higher cost. Teacher training on making students literate would be highly desirable,
    butmerely following the books could enable untrained teachers to carry out the task.

5.5      Duringthe next calendar year, the following actions couldbe considered:

    Modifying the curricula to specify a daily hour o f explicit reading instruction and
    practice in grades 1-3. Revisingthe grade 1 book on reading (inPortuguese and in
    local languages) to add explicit instruction on letter sounds andto omit the
    calligraphic forms untilstudents are fluent readers (eg. Grade 5); increasing the
    availability o f books inlocal languages inall schools. (NGO staff report that the
    local printingindustry has sufficient capacity to print books innational languages).
    Disseminating viable means for teachers to monitor student progress, such as hearing
    every child read for one minute per day (as practiced ina successful NGO o f
    Bangladesh);

    Revising teacher and administrator training inthe institutes and inthe distance
    education mode to reflect the real issues seen inclassrooms and research-based
    solutions to these issues: usinginstructionaltime efficiently, managing crowded
    classes (e.g. through grouping), distributingtopics through the school year, teaching
    phonics and fluency, as well as the rationale for these methods. Videos are a more
    effective means o f demonstratingproblems and solutions thanthe usual lecture- and
    dictation-based methods. A 3-minutesupervisiontechnique could be taught to
    principals and inspector^;^^

    Informing communities regarding expected achievements at school through radio and
    television announcements (e.g. reading fluently by the end o f grade 2); and

    Piloting conditional cash transfers to bringgirls to school instead o f scholarships,
    since there are now no school fees to pay.

5.6      Thus far, the government has met donor expectations for increasing enrolments
and reportingrelevant data. Ifthe donors demand more learning, the government may
rise to the occasion. To make funds use more efficient, the donors might consider
makingdisbursements conditional on learningimprovements.


43 Researchsuggeststhat teacher bonusesare effectiveinraisingstudent achievement(E.g.Muralidharanand
Sundararaman2006, Podgurskyand Springer 2007).

                                              27

5.7      The cohort o f students progressing through secondary and higher education inthe
current conditions may not be sufficiently well prepared to teach secondary school.
Shortages o f qualified teachers may continue for the foreseeable future. To prepare
students at all levels better, it may be necessary to import secondary-education teachers
as well as higher-education professors. There are many young European or Brazilian
graduates with science and math background looking for employment ininternational
education, who may be willing to work inMozambique for limited salaries on a semi-
volunteer basis.

Sector Wide Approaches and Surveillance of Educational Quality

5.8      SWAp arrangements have beenviewed as necessary, given the large number o f
donors involved ineducation. Overall, the SWAPhas been expected to achieve (a)
smaller transaction costs for the government while addressing the information needs o f
the donors as a group, (b) harmonizationo f procedures and efficient utilization o f donor
funds to reduce duplication, and (c) attention to the education sector as a whole through
large-scale consultations and involvement o f multipleagencies and departments. To
what extent have these goals been achieved?

5.9      Government officials stated that the SWAPhas to some extent reduced
transaction costs by obviating the need to deal with donors individually. However, the
World Bank, Japan, and some other donors also work outside the SWAP(e.g. incertain
provinces), so they require extra government attention, particularly the World Bank. But
addressing donor needs formally also has a cost. The government must write a detailed
and formal monitoring report every year andmake preparations that are time-consuming.
Government staff must also attend donor meetings regularly. On an hourly basis, it is
unclear which approach consumes more time.

5.10     Coordination has transaction costs for the donors themselves. Many staff have
moved to the field andparticipated inweekly or biweekly meetings. Duringthese
meetings disagreements arise, and their resolution may cost stafftime. However, the
issues are mainly related to financing and disbursements. Some donor staff mentionedto
the PPAR missionthat the donors concentrate so muchon general policies or on
financing and procurement complexities that they rarely deal with the substantive issue o f
ensuringthe acquisition o fbasic skills. Thus, the SWAp process may take precedence
over substance.

5.11     Inprinciple, the government mustbe allowedto implement its policies. However,
donors have opinions about government policies, which they make known, sometimes
forcefully. Donors have equal voting rights, regardless of the amount they donate. But
donor staff are not equally knowledgeable; some are diplomats with limitedknowledge
about education, particularly inthe state-of-the art neurocognitive research that has
implications for the education o fthe poor. Sometimes they pressure the government to
undertake activities that are not conducive to efficient learning for the poor.

5.12     SWAPcomplexity showcases the dedication and organizational ability o f donor
staff, but it affects project outcomes. Under project-based lending, a single task manager
i s ultimately responsible for project design and for the integration o f the various
components. However, SWAPShave wide participation, and there may not be a single

                                                       28

overseer other than a government functionary. For example, the ESSP project had 7
working groups, while the SWAP process had 10 (based on the thematic areas o f the
strategic plan).Perhaps sub-sectors such as secondary educationhad poor outcomes in
ESSPbecausethey got limitedattention. For matters requiring technical expertise,
participatory decision-making may not be the most efficient way to bring
Therefore, a SWAp inwhich everyone participates but no single person i s accountable
may defeat the purposes for which it was intended.

5.13     Supervision o f a SWAPinvolves the same issues. Since the government i s in
control, the donors no longer supervise project components. It i s not strange, therefore,
that the limitedlearning outcomes were not identifiedindetail, as might have happened
duringsupervisiono findividual projects. This may also apply to province-level projects
that some donors have traditionally financed.

5.14    Mission findings suggest some potential courses o f action that could be explored
further:

0   Focusing on the substance. Appointing a quality coordinator among knowledgeable
    donor staff (or consultants) to review outputs on a regularbasis and to see how they
    are used inschools. One important itemwould be to obtaining external reviews o f
    materials that the government develops and that donors finance for dissemination
    (e.g. the distance educationmodules) andto provide feedback to the relevant
    government agencies;

    Increasing accountability among donors. Making specific knowledgeable donor staff
    (or consultants) specifically responsible for monitoring various activities and
    conducting supervision visits on a regular but decentralized basis (Le. interacting
    directly with the schools and institutions rather than with the overstretched Ministry
    staff); collect and evaluate materials have been developed and attend various training
    events with a view to critically evaluating the quantity and validity o f information
    provided therein.


6. Lessons

6.1     This assessmentprovides a number o f lessons for the education sector:

0   Very low-income countries receiving donor aid may succeed inproviding broad
    access to education. But without a critical number o f reasonably well educated
    teachers, interested administrators, and strong instructional supervision, the
    educational system may provide little learningto the students (para. 3.22);

0   Monitoringo f learning outcomes is critical inall education projects, particularly
    where very poor populations are involved. Without clear and monitorable targets,
    educational systems may enrol and graduate students who lack basic skills;



45 White2007. Psychologicalresearchon "diffusion o f responsibility" (e.g. LatanCandDarley 1976) would predictthat
donorsoperatingin a largegroup would have a limited individual initiative.

                                          29

Itis not safe to assumethat local educators alone will be able to produce effective
training materials or disseminate effective methods. Transmission o f durable
knowledge to the poor involves technical issues and research that are relatively new
andare little-known among government anddonor staff or consultants. State-of-the
art technical assistance i s needed to address learning issues (para. 3.17, 3.20);

Textbooks (or organizedprintedmaterials) are needed for all students at all levels to
take home. Without textbooks, valuable instructional time tends to be used for
copying or word-for-word dictation. Instructional aids must also be provided so as to
maximize the amount o f information that can be learned by students (para. 3.20);

Governments are likely to respond to donor priorities and informational requirements.
Ifdonors areperceivedasfocusingmainlyonaccess, governments are less likelyto
focus on improving learningoutcomes (para. 4.16);

Cross conditionalities among donors may be best managed through sector-wide
agreements and plans with partners. However, complex arrangements involving large
numbers o f donors require much foresight interms o f harmonization and agreement
on sectoral strategy. The financing and planning complexities o f donor harmonization
may detract attention from substance (para. 5.8); and

Strategies aimed at increasing girls' enrolment require strong government
commitment at a highlevel to be effective. Otherwise, activities may take place but
prove unsustainable or ineffective inthe long run(para. 3.7).
