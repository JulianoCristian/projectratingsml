Ratings of the\n            Energy Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC) Project concur on\n            satisfactory outcome and likely sustainability, but the\n            audit upgrades institutional development impacts to\n            substantial, and, on the Second Structural Adjustment TA\n            (SALTAII) Project outcome is downgraded to moderately\n            satisfactory, and modest institutional development impacts,\n            although sustainability is also likely. Lessons indicate\n            that Georgia's weak governance severely limits the\n            country's ability to create conditions conducive to\n            economic development, and the effective use of development\n            assistance, and, that for a country which experienced\n            economic collapse, it is incumbent that the Bank give high\n            priority to prompt measures that can directly mitigate\n            conditions for the poorest. Furthermore, turnover on the\n            country team limited program effectiveness, diminishing the\n            continuity of the program, and probably constraining the\n            Economic and Sector Work (ES W) that was performed,\n            suggesting a more robust, timely ESW program would have been\n            beneficial to the design of the reform program, while the\n            turnover among policy officials hindered reform progress."}, "docdt": "2003-07-23T00:00:00Z"}
