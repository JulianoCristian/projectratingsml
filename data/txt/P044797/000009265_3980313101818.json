The project will do this by\n            supporting the implementation of the Government's\n            reform program. The reform program aims at: a) strengthening\n            public finance while maintaining a prudent monetary policy;\n            b) developing the private sector; and c) alleviating\n            poverty. Among key reforms are: tax revenue collection\n            improvement; public spending restructuring; privatization\n            acceleration; capital markets development; energy sector\n            financial discipline improvement; banking sector\n            restructuring; and reform the provision and financing of\n            social services."}, "docdt": "1997-08-11T00:00:00Z"}
