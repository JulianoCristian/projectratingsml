"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Overall, the outcome of the project\n            objectives was satisfactory. The sustainability of the\n            project is rated as likely in both financial and\n            institutional terms. Overall, the World Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory during project preparation,\n            appraisal, and implementation. There was excellent\n            coordination between the project team and all relevant\n            sector and operation units. Similarly, the overall\n            performance of the Borrower was satisfactory. There were\n            several lessons learned, both institutional as well as\n            technical. They included: Minimizing effectiveness delays by\n            obtaining all clearnaces in advance will be critical for\n            future projects. putting health on the local political\n            agenda through decentralization is critical for sustained\n            delivery of health care to the slum populations. Long term\n            engagement is needed both for building capacities of local\n            municipalities and sensitizing slum communities for\n            effective delivery of health services and their use by the\n            urban poor. Factors that enhance the health access and\n            demand include neighborhood female community volunteers and\n            local leaders acting as catalysts; using private\n            practitioners; and client friendly services provided at\n            convenient locations and times. cost sharing with\n            safeguards, retention of user fees, flexibility based on\n            local needs and capacities, involvement of departments\n            implementing urbna poverty reduction programs, development\n            of permanent infrastructure, and partnerships with NGO and\n            private are noted. Technical lessons comprised judiciously\n            mixing public health and curative care services; ensuring\n            good referral linkages, especially for emergency obstetric\n            care; and attending to the reproductive health needs of\n            males. Operational lessons focused on starting services\n            early on and initiating demand generation actvities;\n            prioritizing behavior change initiatives to a focused set of\n            interventions and strategic delivery of messages based on\n            sound communiciations research; and better coordinating\n            health interventions with ongoing slum development programs."}, "docdt": "2002-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
