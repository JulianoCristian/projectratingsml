But in Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi and\n            Hyderabad, the women of the slums, NGOs, and government\n            health workers have joined together to improve the health\n            and well-being of women and children in some of the city\u0092s\n            poorest neighborhoods. The partnership is supported by the\n            World Bank\u0092s Eight India Population Project (IPP VIII).\n            Volunteers help bring the services to the poor. In\n            Hyderabad, for instance, women's health groups and\n            community-revolving funds have made it possible for the\n            women of the slums, perhaps for the first time, to finance\n            improvements in their neighborhoods. They have used these\n            seedling funds to improve civic amenities, such as\n            sanitation systems, wells, and toilets. Income-generation\n            schemes like tailoring centers have also been set up."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
