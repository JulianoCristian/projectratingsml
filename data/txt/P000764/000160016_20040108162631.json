"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the project are as\n            follows: the project outcome is satisfactory, the\n            project's sustainability is likely, the institutional\n            development impact is substantial, and the Bank and Borrower\n            performance are both satisfactory overall. The main lessons\n            learned of the project are (a) on decentralization, (b) on\n            sequencing and flexible implementation arrangements (c) on\n            capacity building, and (d) on sanitation and hygiene.\n            Increasing decentralization of governmental responsibilities\n            renders governments more closely accountable to communities\n            but also presents a major challenge in capacity-building at\n            local level. Decentralization is a prerequisite for moving\n            towards more demand driven approaches, as only local\n            institutions are in a position to listen to and understand\n            the demands of their consumers,  a staged process requiring\n            shifts in mentality and capacity building;  and offers an\n            opportunity to improve performance of service delivery by\n            introducing a mix of private sector, public entities, and\n            communities to deliver services. An integrated national\n            programmatic approach must serve as a basis for local\n            action. Project design should be \"performance\n            based\", prioritizing those towns and communities\n            willing to get themselves organized, pay for (part of) the\n            cost of service delivery. Implementation arrangement should\n            be effected at the lowest level whenever conditions and\n            capacity permit. Monitoring and evaluation increases the\n            effectiveness of a project by capturing the lessons learnt\n            under each planning phase and by forcing institutions to\n            communicate. Transfer of knowledge between various tiers of\n            government is essential in decentralized systems and\n            requires collaboration on common problems. On the job\n            capacity building (through project implementation) is often\n            more effective than formal training. Sector institutions\n            need to have acquired a minimum level of stability before\n            capacity building activities can have sustainable results.\n            Specific sanitation and hygiene components should be\n            included in project design including earmarked budgets."}, "docdt": "2003-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
