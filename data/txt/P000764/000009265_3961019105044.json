Supply\n            Development and Rehabilitation Project are to ensure the\n            long-term viability of water supply and sanitation\n            operations in line with the Government's\n            regionalization policies and, in the long run, improve the\n            health and productivity of the population. The objectives\n            will be met by providing assistance for: 1) capacity\n            building of the Regional Governments and water supply and\n            agencies for management of urban water supply and sanitation\n            schemes and rural water supply operations; 2) formulation of\n            policies to ensure long-term financial and managerial\n            viability of water supply operations, establishment of\n            regulatory arrangements and sound investment planning by the\n            Regional Governments and water supply agencies; and 3)\n            short- and medium-term physical rehabilitation, augmentation\n            and establishment of urban water supply and sanitation\n            schemes in war-affected and the most deficient regions. The\n            project will consist of the following components: 1)\n            institutional capacity building, which includes water supply\n            sector capacity building and rural water supply pilot\n            scheme. This component will provide studies, technical\n            assistance, training, equipment, service rigs, mobile\n            workshops, vehicles and the construction of pilot schemes;\n            2) feasibility and engineering which will consist of water\n            and sanitation scheme feasibility, engineering designs and\n            building works designs; and 3) physical works comprising\n            water and sanitation scheme rehabiliation as well as\n            building works."}, "docdt": "1996-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
