                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After experiencing major delays during the initial first three and half years, in July 2010, the Government and Bank agreed to implement an Action Plan and the Implementing Entities
                         have successfully completed the main agreed actions. Consequently, the project has shown marked improvement in implementation. As of May 30, 2012, the project has disbursed
                         70% with an additional US$ 0.6 million under processing for payment. According to the latest disbursement projection, disbursement is expected to reach 75% by June 30 ,2012.

                         A summary of the progress during the past six months is summarized below by component:

                         Electricity Component: Overall, physical progress is 90% . Electrification of the market centers along the Rumphi-Nyika-Chitipa corridor have been completed; 150 customer

                         connections including 96 public buildings have been connected to the grid. Works on the remaining four corridors including overhead lines, and installing transformers, and service
                         lines is near completion and expected to be completed by June 30, 2012

                         Road Component: Overall, physical progress is 75%. Road construction in the five corridors is progressing well but at a slower pace than anticipated. The delay was largely due the
                         foreign exchange crisis and fuel shortage that was not unforseen and beyond the control of the contractors. It is anticipated that that four contracts (Nsanje, Mulanje slice, Phalombe
                         and Mangochi) shall be completed before June 30, 2012 while for the remaining three corridors, (Zomba Slice, Ntechu Neno and Rumphi and Chitipa), works are likely to remain
                         unfinished by the current date of IDA Grant closing of June 30 ,2012. The Roads Authority will need to continue to monitor progress and quality of works on site to ensure works are
                         completed on schedule.

                         Water Supply and Sanitation Component: Overall, physical progress is 65%. Works have been completed at Nthalire, Kambilonjo and Ligowe Market Centers and at the three sites
                         under the Southern Region Water Board (SRWB), namely Maldeco, Jali and Mayaka, progress has improved significantly and the three schemes will be nearly complete by June 30,
                         2012. The Water Boards need to continue closely monitoring progress on site to ensure works are completed as scheduled.

                         Information and Communication Technology Component: Overall, progress is 95%. Ten (10) public internet access centers have been established and the system is fully
                         operational. MACRA is currently negotiating with a contractor to install backup systems for the public internet access centres and that the installations will be completed by June 30,
                         2012. Work on establishment of public payphones is almost completed and the service provider has commenced establishing the remaining 50 public payphones and work is
                         expected to be completed by June 30, 2012.
