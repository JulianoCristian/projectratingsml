                         After experiencing major delays during the initial first three and half years under implementation, in July 2010 a joint Bank-Government team prepared and agreed on a detailed
                         Action Plan for implementation by the Implementing Entities and the PMU with a view to to turn the project around. Subsequently, the Action Plan has been successfully completed

                         of roads and water supply and sanitation facilities and engineering consultants to supervise works. All contractors and consultants have been mobilized and works are currently in
                         progress as summarized below.

                         The Board of Executive Directors approved Project Restructuring that involves extension of the grant closing date by seven months (from November 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012),
                         reallocation of US$ 3.9 million currently available under unallocated category to mainly infrastructure components of the project and modifying the Project Development Objectives
                         and monitoring indicators.

                         As of October 30, 2011, the disbursement rate is 48% with about US$4.0 million disbursed in the past four months. An additional US$ 0.6 million is under processing. Overall, the
                         project has committed 96% of total funds.

                         The status of project implementation is summarized below:

                         Electrification. Electrification of the market Centers in the Rumphi-Nyika-Chitipa corridor have been completed. Consumer meters have been procured and are expected to be
                         delivered by November 30, 2011; (ii) a total of 167 metered consumers including 96 public institution buildings are connected to the network (some 138 consumers have applied and
                         paid for their electricity connections and a further 86 other consumers have applied for service connections); and (iii) 100% on conductors and transformers and 15% of poles
                         delivered and delivery of the critical non-itemized materials (bolts and other line accessories) is expected in December 2011 in time to commence stringing of the transmission and
                         distribution lines in January 2012.

                         Roads. Seven civil works contracts valued at MWK2.1 billion (US$14.3 million) have been awarded and launched in all the five corridors. Two supervision consultants valued at
                         MWK108 million (US$711,000) have been hired for the supervision of works. All contractors and consultants have mobilized and works are currently in progress, albeit a slow pace
                         ranging from a low 5 % to a high 50%. Roads Authority need to continue to monitor progress and quality of works on site and strengthen oversight of contractors and consultants to
                         ensure works are carried out in line with specification and completed on schedule.

                         Water Supply and Sanitation. All five contracts with value of about US$8.1 million have been awarded for the construction of water supply and sanitation facilities in ten market
                         centers. Work is in progress at all the markets, with significant progress at some centers. The Water Boards need to continue to monitor progress and quality of works on site and
                         strengthen oversight of contractors and consultants to ensure works are carried out in line with specification and completed as scheduled.

                         Information and Communication Technology. Almost all planned activities have been fully implemented; 64 pay phones installed in Rumphi District and 24/74 public phones in Chitipa
                         district. Internet centre in the district is also operational.

                         Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building. The implementation capacity of the six IEs and the PMU has been strengthened in part from strong technical and procurement
                         support from the Bank team in addressing the procurement processing challenges.

                         Disbursement. As of October 30, 2011, the disbursement rate is 47% with a total of about US$4.0 million disbursement in the past four months. An additional US$0.6 million is under

                         processing. Overall, the project has committed 96% of total funds. 96 % of total funds are committed in new contracts..

                         Civil Works. The project has awarded several contracts and committed US$22.00 million in civil works contracts and engineering consultants All civil works have begun. Progress
                         registered so far ranges from a low 5 percent to a high 50% completion rate. The low rate is due to delay by some contractors in mobilizing for the works. Contractors and
                         consultants attributed slow progress to the shortage of fuel availability in the market. Government acknowledged the problem and will seek to address the issue. .

                         The overall project implementation progress is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

                         Notwithstanding commitment of almost all of the funds under the project and the recent turn-around performance, the main challenge remains completion of the infrastructure works
                         and delivery of the results by the project closing date of June 30, 2012. The key risk for the project is delay in completion which is directly related to fuel shortage. This issue was
                         brought to the attention of the Government which agreed to address it as a matter of high priority. Detailed Action Plan and completion dates agreed with each of the six
