In addition the project would help develop seven\n            semi-autonomous water enterprises and train staff in\n            management, accounting and operation; strengthen the project\n            implementation capacity of government agencies responsible\n            for the sector; prepare future water supply projects;\n            improve training institutions; and foster the concepts of\n            cost recovery and efficiency pricing in the public sector.\n            The benefits of the project and the organization, training\n            and financial safeguards built into the project are\n            considered sufficient to justify the risks which include,\n            inter alia, possible implementation delays, increases in\n            capital costs and poor performance in collecting water bills."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
