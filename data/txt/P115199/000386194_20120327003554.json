Indonesia were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible; Bank performance\n            was satisfactory; and borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: as with the DPL\n            series, strong government ownership and the Bank's\n            extensive engagement on the ground were key contributing\n            aspects of a successfully executed operation. Still, the use\n            of a DDO was a new experience for the Indonesia office and\n            some key lessons came to light. When uncertainty is high,\n            but a country's fundamentals are strong, the Bank can\n            be an effective partner in helping to reassure the markets.\n            As it was the first time since the 1997-98 Asian crisis that\n            market volatility was so severe, there was a great fear that\n            the country would be ensnared in the global financial\n            crisis, despite the sounder macroeconomic fundamentals it\n            held this time around. Access to financing was not\n            sufficient on its own to calm markets. As several investors\n            in the survey pointed out, Indonesia's strong macro\n            fundamentals, such as the government's decision to a\n            limited budget deficit despite potential revenue short\n            falls, were key to reassuring markets that Indonesia was\n            stable. Sending a strong signaling effect can be as\n            effective as providing straight financial support. The\n            sustainability of results in such emergency operations\n            depends on post-crisis priorities. The Government of\n            Indonesia and all parties involved in the preparation of\n            this operation devoted much attention at the time of the\n            crisis. Economic surveillance and monitoring was\n            significantly increased by Government of Indonesia (GoI) and\n            partners during supervision. Refining the DDO package.\n            Unlike other DDO operations, the purpose of this DDO was not\n            to serve as a lower cost financing option, but rather as\n            insurance against prohibitively high financing costs which\n            would jeopardize Indonesia's development efforts.\n            Securing financing at accessible prices for a rainy day was\n            more beneficial to GoI than securing financing at cheaper\n            prices in a relatively benign market environment, as it was\n            in mid 2009 and until the closing of the operation.\n            Dissemination of the merits of a contingency-based operation\n            is important to ensure stakeholders have a good\n            understanding of its costs and benefits. People that were\n            closely involved in discussions during the preparation of\n            the PESF are well aware of the benefits of the operation,\n            particularly relative to the very low costs incurred by GoI."}, "docdt": "2011-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
