Policy Loan (DPL) with a Deferred\n            Drawdown Option (DDO), comes at a critical time for\n            Indonesia, and is designed to support Indonesia's key\n            development efforts at this time of need. Like many other\n            developing economies, Indonesia has had to cope with the\n            immediate ripple effects of the turmoil and crisis of\n            confidence that has disrupted the global financial system in\n            the last few months, while at the same time preparing for an\n            anticipated growth slowdown and continued tight liquidity in\n            2009. The government has responded proactively to the\n            rapidly evolving situation and the Bank and other partners\n            have assisted in and continue to support these efforts. The\n            PESF represents an opportunity to provide enhanced support\n            to an important client with a sustained record of prudent\n            macroeconomic management and fiscal discipline at a time of\n            increased stresses in global financial markets. The\n            government has clearly indicated that it feels that the\n            Bank's engagement on the policy dialogue is critical,\n            both in terms of the substantive support provided as well as\n            in terms of the signal it sends to the market and to\n            Indonesia's bilateral and multilateral partners. At the\n            same time, by helping Indonesia to meet its gross financing\n            needs in the event that liquidity conditions do not ease,\n            the PESF would ensure that Indonesia is able to maintain and\n            even scale up public spending on critical infrastructure and\n            human capital investments and social protection at a time\n            when they are most likely to be needed."}, "docdt": "2009-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
