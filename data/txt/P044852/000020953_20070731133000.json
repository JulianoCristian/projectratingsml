"versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Enterprise Incubator Project (EIF)\n            of Armenia had the following ratings: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was negligible to\n            low, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            included: 1) The enhanced incubator model tested during the\n            project seems to be an appropriate vehicle for addressing\n            the market failures in the Armenia's IT sector; 2)\n            According to sample company data, the service package most\n            in demand in Armenia's IT industry seems to be a\n            combination of business services and training, in both\n            technical aspects of the IT industry and in sales and\n            promotion; 3) With hindsight, the original design of\n            including a control group to test the impact of an incubator\n            enhanced with business services and training may not have\n            been necessary; 4) A Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) is\n            probably not the most appropriate vehicle for launching any\n            future enterprise incubators based on the experience with\n            EIF, particularly since there already has been considerable\n            global experience with them; 5) It is better not to define\n            pre-set packages of services in designing an enterprise\n            incubator project, due to the diversity of company needs,\n            even within the same sector, and instead allow the service\n            packages to emerge from the market place, hiring experts as\n            needed and using surveys to assess the needs of potential\n            clients; 6) The usual design of the PAD does not provide\n            enough up-front attention to the learning hypothesis and its\n            linkage to the development objectives and monitoring\n            indicators; 7) The lack of sufficient quality control for a\n            LIL, in the absence of the reviews required for Board\n            presentation, essentially transfers the appraisal work to\n            the implementation stage, and this can cause delays that may\n            jeopardize the outcome of the project; 8) In defining a\n            monitoring framework, in order to keep the focus on the main\n            objective, it is important to clarify the hierarchy and\n            inter-relationships of final outcome indicators and\n            intermediate indicators; and 9) Any future incubator project\n            including a building donated or rented by the Government\n            should be in place before the start of the project and\n            therefore should be a condition of effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2007-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
