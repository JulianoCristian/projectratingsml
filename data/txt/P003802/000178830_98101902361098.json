Its main\n            objectives are to: increase the output of high-level\n            manpower in the fields of engineering, science, agriculture,\n            and economics (including business administration and\n            accountancy), improve the quality of university education in\n            these four fields, and strengthen the management of the\n            overall university system. The project would accomplish\n            these objectives by: (a) introducing policies to improve\n            efficiency and quality; (b) preparing for civil works by\n            providing initial site development and building design in\n            order to expand enrollment in the four selected fields at\n            the Universities of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and Andalas; (c)\n            improving academic and professional qualifications of\n            teaching staff; (d) increasing the relevance and quantity of\n            instructional materials; (e) rationalizing university\n            administrative organization and staffing; (f) developing\n            monitoring, evaluation and management information systems;\n            (g) introducing a university management training program;\n            and (h) establishing a University Development Office in the\n            Directorate General of Higher Education (DGHE)."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
