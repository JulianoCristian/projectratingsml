conditions for\n            renewed broad-based growth driven by the rural economy and a\n            private sector that is more confident about the future; b)\n            improving public sector delivery with participation of local\n            communities; and c) improving efficiency and accountability\n            in public resource management. THE ERC is a quick-disbursing\n            credit of three tranches. Its proceeeds will help the\n            Government meet the costs of the economic recovery program\n            within a stanle macroeconomic environment; and increase\n            resource allocation to the priority poverty-sensitive\n            sectors of primary education and primary health (including\n            the fight against HIV/AIDS). Successful implementation of\n            the ERP supported by the ERC should: 1) increase incomes and\n            employment opportunities in the rural economy and create the\n            conditions for strengthened private sector activity; 2)\n            expand access to and improve the quality of primary\n            education and health services, while strengthening local\n            community participation in the delivery of such services;\n            and 3) improve budget formulation, execution, and monitoring\n            and reporting, while strengthening accountability."}, "docdt": "2002-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
