The project achieved\n            some of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been significant, sustainability is likely\n            with donor financial support, and the Bank performed\n            satisfactorily while the Borrower did not. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, sustained political\n            support is crucial for a population operation to be\n            successful in a difficult socio-cultural environment that\n            currently exists in Pakistan. Second, projects should be\n            firmly grounded in recent sector work completed before\n            project preparation work. These analyses help identify the\n            issues and problems the sector will face and also enhance\n            the quality of dialogue between the borrower and lender.\n            Third, a PAC or Project Administration Cell should be\n            established to ensure project implementation. Lastly, the\n            IDA (International Development Association) staff should be\n            continuously knowledgeable about projects on supervision\n            missions and provide more intense supervision."}, "docdt": "1990-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
