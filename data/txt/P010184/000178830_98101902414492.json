  are to assist the Government in implementing its new\n            Population Welfare Plan and in establishing a sound basis\n            for a sustained and effective population planning effort\n            over the longer term. The project would focus on: (a) the\n            establishment of national training and motivation programs\n            for population planning; and (b) the implementation of a\n            comprehensive package of population planning activities in\n            13 districts serving about 20 million. To achieve these\n            objectives, the project would include: (a) support for\n            non-clinical program training; (b) establishment of a\n            national IEC organization; (c) strengthening and expanding\n            population education in the formal school system; (d)\n            establishment of family welfare centers and family planning\n            service outlets; (e) monitoring and evaluation; and (f)\n            training and technical assistance to strengthen the\n            organizations responsible for family planning and provision\n            of health services, as well as preparation of future\n            population projects."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
