support the banking\n            and enterprise reform program of the Mongolian government.\n            In addition, the Credit will help meet external financing\n            requirements and support the budget burdened by reform\n            costs. The adjustment program will tackle the main\n            structural problems of the banking and enterprise sectors\n            through an integrated approach that broadly aims to restore\n            the banking system as an efficient and safe intermediator of\n            resources, and to improve the economic and financial\n            performance of select public and recently privatized\n            enterprises. BESAC will support: the bank restructuring\n            strategy including liquidation of the two insolvent banks,\n            loan recovery efforts through the development of a debt\n            workout unit (DWU) in the Trade and Development Bank, and\n            halting the flow of loans to defaulting borrowers. In the\n            enterprise sector, BESAC will assist the imposition of hard\n            budget constraints, and passively restructure or liquidate\n            six selected state-owned enterprises to jump-start more\n            widespread restructuring in the rest of the economy."}, "docdt": "1997-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
