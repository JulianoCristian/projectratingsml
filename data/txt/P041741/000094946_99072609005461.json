While the World\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory, the Borrowers was\n            mixed. Key lessons were learned in the following areas: A\n            strong government commitment was critical to achieving the\n            project's objectives. Monitoring and supervision are\n            important, especially in the early phase of reforms when\n            slippage may occur. Project objectives should give priority\n            to measures relevant to law implementation and enforcement\n            rather than approval / establishment. Reform of the banking\n            sector in transitional economies is a very slow process that\n            requires investment and changes in institutions, legal\n            infrastructure, and human capital. More attention should be\n            paid to the fiscal consequences of banking sector reforms,\n            in order to assess short-term and long-term costs. When\n            institution building is crucial for a project's\n            objectives, as it is in transition economies, structural\n            adjustment operations that provide a road agenda for reform\n            in particular sectors should be accompanied and supported by\n            parallel, well designed and timely technical assistance\n            projects. BESAC and BELTAC constituted a good attempt at\n            implementing this simple principle."}, "docdt": "1999-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
