A number of valuable lessons were learned from\n            implementing this project, and have been incorporated in the\n            follow-on project, UBSIP2, as appropriate. They include the\n            following:  1) Procurement was complex because of (1) IDA\n            prior review of all aspects of procurement from designs, bid\n            documents, and contract awards; (2) a large number of small\n            packages; and (3) the enactment and implementation of a new\n            procurement law in Mongolia from 2001, which introduced high\n            level interdepartmental committees for procurement, and\n            delayed contract awards significantly. These issues have\n            been addressed in UBSIP2 through better packaging and\n            establishment of prior review thresholds. In addition,\n            following the IDA Country Procurement Assessment Report of\n            2003, Mongolia's procurement law is being revised with\n            a view to overcoming the major issues identified.  2)\n            Consultant support for design review, construction\n            supervision, and project management: During implementation\n            the SAR assumption that consultant support for these\n            activities would only be required during the first two years\n            was much too optimistic. In practice, consultant support\n            became essential until the extended project closing date of\n            December 2003. UBSIP2 will include consultant support\n            throughout that project. In addition, in order to improve\n            construction supervision, UBSIP2 will involve the\n            Ulaanbaatar Water and Sewerage Company (USAG) through a\n            Project Implementation Unit, with adequate staff. 3)\n            Designs:  Chief issues are the extent of protection required\n            against freezing and the need to standardize designs of\n            pumping stations, bath houses, and water kiosks. These\n            matters have been addressed in UBSIP2. 4) While\n            institutional development of USAG was very successful\n            overall, a number of second generation issues remain. These\n            include the development of policies for metering and house\n            connections, an appropriate role for the private sector,\n            further improvements to maintenance, development and\n            implementation of a communication strategy, and on-going\n            upgrading of staff skills. Again, these are being addressed\n            under UBSIP2. 5) Financial sustainability of USAG -The\n            project did not succeed in its ambitious objective of making\n            USAG commercially viable from an early stage because of a\n            variety of factors, including the need for a phased\n            progression to commercial operation and the lack of\n            Government (also, local government) commitment to\n            USAG's financial objectives. Under UBSIP2 periodic\n            tariff increases required for financial viability will be a\n            disbursement condition for implement ting the physical\n            investment program. 6) Medium-term water and sanitation\n            strategy - This is needed to determine the feasibility of\n            expanding the water supply network to germ areas, the\n            strategy for sanitation in germ areas, the institutional\n            framework for the water sector, and the prospects for\n            involving the private sector in the overall management of\n            USAG. IDA will assist Government in obtaining grant\n            technical assistance for this work."}, "docdt": "2004-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
