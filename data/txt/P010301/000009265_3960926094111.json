It aims to enable the State Cement Corporation\n            of Pakistan (SCCP) to modernize its facilities, reduce\n            operating costs, improve environmental controls, train\n            operating personnel and formulate a Corporate Strategy in\n            order to respond to the new competitive market environment.\n            To this end, the project intends to assist SCCP in\n            converting one plant from wet process to dry process, and\n            rehabilitating and modernizing five other SCCP plants for\n            improvement of energy efficiency, productivity and\n            environmental controls. In addition, the project hopes to\n            improve SCCP management through the establishment of a\n            Corporate Strategy for SCCP, supported by a modern\n            Management Information System and a human resources\n            development program for training of personnel. Finally, the\n            project seeks to establish a Cement Research Institute for\n            sectorwide use. This loan is designed to encourage further\n            rationalization of the industry by assisting the State\n            Cement Corporation of Pakistan (SCCP), major producer within\n            the industry, to improve operating and marketing efficiency.\n            The project includes five components: (a) conversion of\n            cement plant at Wah from wet to dry process operation; (b)\n            selective rehabilitation of five of SCCP's wet process\n            plants, including install pollution control equipment; (c)\n            development of a corporate strategy a associated management\n            information system for SCCP; (d) formulation of resource\n            development program, including redesign of existing training\n            facilities; and (e) establishment of a cement research institute."}, "docdt": "1987-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
