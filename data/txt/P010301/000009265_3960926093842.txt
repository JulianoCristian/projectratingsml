Borrower:         Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficia:        State Cement Corporation of Pakistan (SCCP)
Amount:           11S$96 million equivalent
Terms:            20 years, Including 5 years' grace at the Bank's standard
variaole interest rate
Relending Terms:  Total loan amount will be relent to SCCP at an interest
rate of 14X p.a. which Includes repayment guarantee,
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk coverage by
(0OP. Repayment to GOP based on fixed amortization
schedule over 11 years, including grace period of 4
vears.
Onlending Terms:  SCCP will onlend US$87.9 million equivalent to its six
subsidiary companies on terms and conditions identical to
those enjoyed by SCCP.
Project
Description:    The project builds on a successful dialogue between GOP
and the Bank on cemer*t subsector strategy and policy,
which started during the preparation of a cement
subsector study in 1982, and supports the GOP policy of
liberalization of key productive subsectors, It will
enable the SCCP to modernize its facilities, reduce
operating costs, improve environmental controls, train
operating personnel and formulate a Corporate Strategy in
order to respond to the new competitive market
environment. To this end, the Project will assist SCCP
in converting one plant from wet process to dry process,
and rehabilitating and modernizing five other SCCP plants
for Improvement of energy efficiency, productivfity and
environmental controls. In addition, the Project will
improve SCCP management through the establishment of a
Corporate Strategy for SCCP, supported by a modern
Management Information System ard a hume- resources
development program for training of personnel. Finally
the project will establish a Cement Research Institute
for sectorwide use.
Benefits and
Risks:          the ProJect will lower SCCP's production costs by
increasing fuel efficiency and utilization rates in the
six plants covered under the project, leading to an
efficient operatlon with significantly improved
environmental control. The technical assistance
component will assist SCCP to focus on long-range
corporate planning and improve the company's project



- II -
implementation capability. The typical project risk
identified is possible delays In pro,ect implementation,
which should be minimized by the assistance of an
experienced consultant financed under the project. Some
risk may occur through continuing disruptions in power
supply which would be lessened by the installation of
diesel generators at the corporation's two major plants,
Wah and Zeal Pak. There is also some risk that SCCP will
be unable to Implement all of the recommendations of the
Corporate Strategy exercise because of GOP's political
difficulties. However, the Corporate Strategy aims to
develop options for solving such problems and identifying
their costs.

PAKISTAN - CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has requested a Bank loan of
USS46 million equivalent to finance a cement industry modernization project
for the State Cement Corporation of Pakistan (SCCP)e The major part of the
loan (US$87.9 million) will be applied towards process conversion of one
SCCP plant and minor rehabilitation of five other SCCP plants. The
remaining UJS$8.1 million will be applied toward technical assistance and
the establishment of a Cement Research Institute. The project will result
in a capacity increase of 500,000 tons per year (tpy).
1.02      Project financing requirements, including price contingencies,
incremental worklng capital and Interest durlng construction, are estimated
at UlS$164.4 million, of which US$105.6 million equivalent would be in
direct foreign exchange. The Bank loan of US$96 million, therefore, would
cover nearly 91% of dlrect foreign exchange and 58% of total financing
requirements. The balance of US$68.4 million will be I-rvided by loans
from local commercial banks and SCCP's internally generated funds.
1.03      The orlgin of the project may be traced to a study of the
country's cement Industry, which the Bank commenced in March 1982. The
major recommendations of this study with resnect to improvements In pricing
policies, energy conservation and modernization of the industry have been
instrumental in promoting subsequent policy change In the industry. This
In turn enabled the Bank to proceed with the identification of the project.
1I.  T'P PAKISTAN CEMFNT INDTSTRY
A. Historical Development
2.01      Cement manufacture is a well-established industry in Pakistan,
accountlng for about 5.5% of total industrial production. In 1985/86, the
gross value of cement output at market prices was estimated at
approximatelv PRs 7.5 billion, representing about 1.4% of GDP. Employment
In the cement sector in 1585/86, including those employed in limestone
quarries, amounted to approximately 13,500, or about 0.4% of total
employment in the Industrial sector.
2.02      Pakistan's first cement plant was established in 1921 at Wah by
Associated Cement Company (ACC), with a capacity of 44,500 tpy, and the
industry grew steadily until independence in 1947, when there were four
plants owned by two private companies with a total capacity of about
48O0OOO tpy. During the 1950s and 1960s, expansion of the industry
accelerated, with installed capacity lncreasing at an average annual rate
of 9.7%, and six more plants were established, four by the private sector



2
and too (Zealpak and Maple Leaf) by the public-sector Pakistan Industrial
Development Corporation (PIDC). By 1972, Installed capacity had increased
to 3045 million tpy, with 58% owned by the public sector and 42% by the
private sector.
2.fn      On January 2, 1q72, the Government nationallzed 31 major
manufacturing enterprises covering 10 subsectors, Including cement, under
the sconomic Reform Order. A Board of Industrial Management (MTM) was
established shortly after to manage all nationallzed enterprises. In
September 1q73, while the company structures were left unchanged, the
Government secured majority shareholdings in the cement enterprises by
purchasing them with saleable bonds at prevailing market prices.
Meanwhile, public sector cement companies owned and run by the Pakistan
Development Corporation (PTDC) and the G,overnment-owned Associated Cement
Company (ACC), which had been purchased by Government from its Indian
owners in 1960, continued to operate unchanged. In December 1973, the
Government created the State Cement Corporation of Pakistan (SCCP) as an
independent holdlng company under the negis of the Ministry of Production
(MOP) to manage and operate the natlonalized plants on behalf of the
state. In addition to the private sector units, the Corporation was also
given control of the plants established by PTDC and those owned by
Government, and thus had eight enterprises under its wing.
2.04      At the time of nationalization, annual cement production amounted
to 2.55 million tons (nominal capacity utilization of 74%) of which
approximately n.45 million tons were exported, mainly to Middle East
markets. Government withheld approval for new capacity, and for the next
five years no funds were made available for the type of modernization and
energy conservation investments carried out In many other ^ountries
following the oil price increases of 1973. As a result of increasing
domestic demand, cement shortages began to appear in 1975/76 and tl.e
Government banned exportse  Wro,r an export peak of 0.7 million tons (23% of
production) in 1973/74, Pakistan became a net importer In 1976/77. Until
July 1481, when the Government allowed import by the prlvate sector, SCCP
was the sole agency permitted to import cement. During this period, in
spite of increases In capacity utilization, there was stbstantial
unsatisfied demand because SCCP had insufficient foreign exchange to import
enough cement to meet demand at official prices.
2.05      In resoonse to continuing shortages, the Government lifted the
ban on private investment in cement in 1978, and announced an Incentive
package for private Investors consisting of a guaranteed rate of return of
15-202 and, depending on plant location, reductions in import duties for
equipment and corporation tax exemptions. At the same time, SCCP was given
approval for consttuction of new plants and expansion of existing plants.
This offered the first opportunity in almost a decade for the Pakistan
cement industry to upgrade its technology. Subsequently, SCCP increased
capacity by 2.1 million tpy, through slx projects comprising two expansions
and four greenfield plants, while some two dozen private investors received



- 3 -
investment sanctioning approval I/ (Annex 2-1). By the beginning of 19879
four private plants, comprising about one quarter of subsector capacity,
had started operation, two more were under construction and a number of
planned projects remained in early stages of development. All the recent
private and public projects have adopted dry process technology, but
because of Investors' preference for proximity to Karachi and the
guaranteed return policy in force at the time of sanctioning, too many
plants have been located in the Soutn, thereby creating a regional
supply-demand imbalance. Furthermore, the projects have used kiln sizes
considerably smaller than those adopted in modern plants in many other
countries, although, in contrast to most of the public sector projects, the
private plants were designed for a later, cost-effective capacitv increase.
2,06      Since 1980, when the first of the new generation of dry process
plants came into operation, subsector capacity has increased at
approximately 13% p.a., and imports, which had risen to a peak of
1.3 million tons in 19R1/82, have virtually disappeared. Subsector
production has Increased over the 1980-86 period at approximately 10% p.a.,
and capacity utilization has fallen from 92% in 1980 to about 80%,
reflecting start-up of new units and dlfficulties in maintaining production
at the older wet process plants. The need for modernization of the
industry has been accentuated by radical changes In the policy framework
introduced by the Government in May 1985 (see paras 2.19-2.21). These
changes have created a competitive market environment which is intensifying
competitive pressures upon SCCP and private companies to optimize the scale
and location of production facilities and to rationalize commerclal
practices.
B. Present Structure of the Industry
2.07      At the beginning of the 1986/87 financial year, the Pakistan
cement industry consisted of 17 operating plants, with a total nominal
installed cement capacity of 7.7 mtpy (Annex 2-2). Thirteen of the plants,
comprising about 6.0 mtpy (78% of total capacity) belong to SCCP;2/
9 plants produce only ordinary Portland cement (OPC), two produce both OPC
and slag cement, one produces OPC and sulphur resistant cement and one
produces OPC and white cement. Four plants are owned by the private
sector, and all produce OPC. Four more plants, two private and two public,
are being constructed, and another private plant has recently received
sanctioning approval. These five projects are expected to increase
capacity by 1.3 million tons.
2.08      The location of plants currently in operation and those to be
completed in the near future is shown in the attached map (IBRD 20235).
I/   One side effect of the policy package was that it encouraged
applications from promoters, many of whom did not have any prior
experience in ooerating modern cement plants. As a result, in many
cases too little attention was given to technical and locational
factors.
2/   SCCP also owns and operates a small factory in Karachi producing
refractory materials, mainly alumina bricks.



Cement investments In the past have been made largely in the southern part
of the country, around 1(arachl.  This occurred because of the pact tolicy
of guaranteed returns which provided no penalty for Improper location, and
becauso of political and provlncial considerations prevailing over market
and transport factors, although the lack of Investments in the Punjab is
also explained to some degree by the lack of suitable limestone deposits in
eastern Punjab.  In a number of cases, plants were located only a few miles
from each other. Too much capacity Is now located In the south, while
northern SJnd and Punjab remain defictt areas.
2.09      Because of the lack of investment during the 1970s, the cement
subsector in Pakletan comprises a high percentage of wet process plants
(Annex 2-2). In 1986/87, about 52% of total kiln capacity was based on wet
and semi-dry technology (with some kilns datlng back to the 1920s, although
most were Installed in the 1950s and 1960s), with the remainder oased upon
the more energy-efficIent dry process. All the private sector plants and
SCCP's new plants and expansion projects undertaken since 1978 are based
upon dry process, but nine of SCCP's plants still rely on wet or semi-dry
processe
2.10      By internatlonal standards, cement plants In Pakistan are small,
and average kiln sizes are particularly small (Annex 2-3), About 34% of
subsector capacity comes from plants of 1,000 tpd (330,000 tpy) capacity or
less, and average plant c&Dacity is only 450,000 tpy, compared to a
worldwide average plant size of approximately 900G000 tpy. Most plants are
multi-kiln, with kiln sizes rang'ng from 150 tpd to 2,000 tpd. The
existing 35 kilns (only 10 of which use dry process) have an average
capacity of 6q5 tpd, and even the largest kilns (2,000 tpd at DG Khan and
Attock Cement Company) are considerably smaller than the 2,500-4,000 tpd
kilns employed in countries with a more advanced cement Industry. Average
plant size, and in partlcular average kiln size, have, however, been
Increasing In both public and private projects since 1978, and this process
will continue with the single-kiln 3,000 tpd plant proposed at AC Wah.
2e11      Over the past decade, the cement Industry in Pakistan has also
experienced conslierable overmanning. Following nationalization,
employment in SCCP grew in response to political pressures to provide jobs,
and under Pakistar.'s labor laws, persons once employed cannot be
dismissed. As a result, the work force In each plant had increased
considerably by the early 1980s,3/ when SCCP secured government approval
to limit severely the growth of employment. In fact, over the past three
years, there has been, In overall terms, a hlrIng freeze in SCCP, and total
employment has fallen somewhat due to normal attrition and retirements. A
comparison of dry process plants belonging to SCCP and the private sector
indicates that employment levels are twlce as large in SCCP as in the
private plants: in the 1,000 tpd plants, private sector plants typically
employ between 300 and 400 persons while SCCP plants employ 600-800. As a
result, labor costs in SCCP plants have tended to be 8-10% of total
3/   For example, Gharibwal's labor force, which was 645 persons In 1972,
had grown to about 950 persons by the beginnlng of the current decade.



production costs compared to 4-5% in private plants. Rowever, the
improvement in SCCP's abillty to control its manning sltuation in recent
years is shown by the fact that the numbers of personnel at Its newest
plant, nO Rhan, are not significantly more than the numbers at a similar
private plant (Attock).4/ A long-term solution to SCCP's manning and
labor costs is hound up closelv with the provisions of the labor laws and
the future location and scale of productive facilities, and the analysis of
labor issues and development of options will be an Important component of
the SCCP Corporate Strategy exercise.
2.12      Over the past decade, SCCP's labor force has gained considerable
experience in operating wet and dry process plants, and In general SCCV has
been able to secure the quantity and quality of skills required.5/
However, the Introduction of larger-scale plants and more complex
electronic operational and control systems has created a need for upgrading
and retraining of existing labor and the Introduction of new skills.
SCCP's existlng training programs are not considered sufficient or adequate
in their present form to meet the demand for new skills, and the company
recognizes the urgency of upgrading all its managerial and technical
personnel and workers. In the private cement plants, the Issue of trainlng
is currentlv seen as less urgent since each company appears to have secured
adequate training In the process of start-up, but the need for upgradlng
and retraining will grow in the future.
2,13      The market for cement in Pakistan has been unsophisticated and
narrow, and to-date little has been done to promote demand for other than
ordinary Portland cement (nPC), In 1985/86, OPC comprIsed approxlmately
95% of subsector output, with slag cement and sulphur resistant cement
comprising about 2% each of the market and white cement the remainder. The
narrow market is typlcal of cement industries in which shortages are
prevalent and competition is limited, but it is also explained by factors
on the demand side. First, per capita consumption is low (58 kg per capita
in 1984), in part because In rural areas cement use has yet to make serious
Inroads into use of mudbrick for houses. Second, demand for specialized
cement has developed slowly, and price has been the predominant determinant
of demand. The market for slag cement (produced from slag available from
Pakistan Steel Mill (PSM)) has developed because of its low price rather
than for its technical qualities. However, there are signs that the
situation is begInning to change: for example, some attempts are being
made through advertising to establish technical distinctions between cement
brands, and private Investors are showing interest in constructing white
cement plants In the belief that a larger market can be created through
judicious advertising, while SCCP is seeking to Increase sales of
4/   Total personnel at DO 'Khan and Attock are 500 and 400, respectively.
Dr. Khan employs more malnly because functions that are done at Attock
by contract labor are done by regular employees at DC Khan, which is
in a more remote location.
5/   The company has also served as a training ground for the private
plants, Insofar as some SCCP employees have joined the private cement
enterprises.

sulphur-resistant cement, which enjoys a high margin. These developments
In the cement market are expected to generate increased interest by
producers and consumers in research into cement products and production
techniques.
2.14      In parallel with the development of the cement industry, Pakistan
has also developed a domestic capacity to manufacture certain types of
cement plant equipment, as a result of an active Government policy to
ensure as much local content as possible in both public and private sector
plants. The Heavy Mechanical Complex (RMC), a public engineering
enterprise, has to-date benefitted most from the emphasis on local content,
but other public enterprises, Pakistan Shipyards and the Heavy Foundry and
Forge (HFF), and a private company, Ittefaq, have also developed some
manufacturing capacity. In one case, HMC was the primary contractor for a
plant of 1,000 tpd capacity, and it Is now developing licensing,
subcontracting and joint venture arrangements with several foreign
suppliers for manufacture and supply of certain parts for 2,000 tpd
capacity plants. However, HMC's performance, particularly in terms of
delivery times and quality, has not been very satisfactory, and Its
participation in the private sector projects, required in the past by the
Government as a condition of sanctioning approval, has resulted in higher
capital costs and significant delays.
C. Costs and Economic Viability
2.15      Over the years, Pakistan has been an economic producer of cement,
as demonstrated by calculations of domestic resource cost well below one
and by the fact that industry has generally received nega;4ve effective
protection (Annex 2-4), Pakistan is endowed with abundant sources of raw
materials. Large deposits of limestone are located in most areas, except
for Punjab, generally accessible to major demand centers, and clay, shale
and gypsum deposlts are also available, frequently in the same vicinity as
limestone. In the past, Pakistan's plants derlved their cost advantages
from cheap natural gas, low wage rates and low financial costs of the old
wet process plants. In recent years, these advantages have been eroded by
Increasing labor and maintenance costs and the substitution of fuel oil for
low-cost natural gas. In addition, although production in Pakistan,
especially in the north of ;he country, remains competitive with imports,
Pakistan's cost position vis-a-vis imports has deteriorated. On the one
hand, import prices have fallen significantly over the past decade in the
face of world overcapacity and, on the other, cost-reducing technological
changes have "ntil recently largely bypassed the Pakistan cement Industry.
2.16      Despite increasing capital costs of new plants (partly because of
relatively high costs of locally produced cement equipment), Pakistan
retains some capital cost advantage in exploiting its raw materials. The
1986 base cost of a single-kiln plant of approximately I million tpy
capacity is estimated at about US$135 per aunual ton of cement in Pakistan
compared to about IJS$i70 internationally. This lower cost is due
predominantly to louar labor and civil work costs.



2.17      Average production costs(fixed and variable) per ton of cement in
1985/86 amounted to IT46.7 for all SCCP plants and 1TSq59.7 for all private
plants (Annex 2-5). Average production costs per ton of Pakistan cement
plants have Increased quite sharply in recent years, and are now hlgher
than costs of large-scale, low-cost producers in Spain and Greece (which
range from 11SS3f to USS4O per ton), but still comparable with costs in
other European countrles such as the UK, PRG and France (which range from
118535 to IJS$55 per ton).  The reason for this Increase is primarily 6/
that the recently constructed dry process plants In both public and private
sectors currently have hlgher total production costs than the wet-process
plants (the average costs of wet and dry process plants in SCCP in 1985/86
were USS44.4 per ton and US$52.7,7/ respectively, with costs ranging from
a low of US$37.5 at Gharlbwal to a high of 118557.9 at Kohat). Estimated
production costs of the rehabilitated Wah plant will be US$42.7 per ton
when the plant attalns full production and will decline thereafter as
financial charges diminish.
2.18      The dry process olants have relatively high financial costs
initially, but once the financial charges diminish within a few vears, they
will be much more competitive because of their significantly lower variable
costs. Variable costs (including labor) of dry process plants in SCCP and
the private sector were US928.4 and US520.9 per ton, respectively, In
1985/86, much below costs of UJS$39.7 per ton In SCCP's wet process plants.
These cost figures indicate that, with the exception of the two National
Cement plants in Karachi and Dandot, variable costs (and in most cases
total production costs) in both dry process and wet process plant are lower
than the cost of imports. Thus these plants should be kept operating
pending the creation through the Corporate Strategy exercise of an optlmal
Investment program (para 2.31). Indeed, even If the Corporate Strategy is
likely to recommend closure of some existing plants after some years,
further selective investments to reduce costs In such plants, as under the
proposed project, may be Justifiable if they have rapid payback and high
rates of return.
D. Subsectoral Issues
1. Pricing and Decontrol
2.19      Over the past decade, pricing and decontrol have been the major
issues confronting the Pakistan cement Industry.  tJntil May 1985, when the
Government announced radical policy changes designed to affect both public
6/ A secondary reason for the increase in average total production costs
has been the increasing difficulties in maintaining production levels
at some of the wet-process plants as their kilns become older and
maintenance costs increase. As a result, SCCP has begun programs of
balancing, modernization and rehabilitation (BMR) at most plants so as
to maintain production levels in a cost-effective way.
7/   SCCP's dry-process plants currently have lower total production costs
than the private plants for several reasons: first, the private
plants opened more recently and thus face start-up costs, and second
their debt-equity ratios are considerably higher than SCCP's plants.



and private sector plants, cement prices at both retail and ex-factory
level had been controlled by rovernment directly or through SCCP. Official
cement prices were set through a cost-plus system, whereby a cost-price was
fixed for each factory to provide a 15-20% return on equity, to which was
added a development surcharge 8/ or subsidy to create a more or less
uniform "retention price" for all plants.  Through this system of
cross-subsidization, each factory and SCCP as a whole were assured a return
on equlty. To this retention price was added an excise tax to arrive at an
ex-factory price. To avoid wide disparities in retail prices for different
consumption areas, SCCP operated a freight equalization system which
reduced, but did not completely eliminate, regional pri-e differentials.
For major consumption areas, SCCP fixed retail margins for dealers, and in
other areas they were set by deputy district commissioners. At the time
the private plants were sanctioned, It had been intended that they should
operate under similar arrangements.
2,20      In May 1985, however, the Government, which had previously
considered that liberalization of the cement pricing system should
proceed gradually, opted for full decontrol, by announcing the removal of
all controls on production and sale of cement. This decision was prompted
by Government's acknowledgement of the undesirable features of the existing
cost-plus pricing svstem, such as the black market created by widespread
shortages and SCCP's practise of allocating cement to dealers, and the lack
of incentives for improved efficiency. Three major factors behind the
policy changes were: (a) the adt'Lnistrative complications of incorporating
the new private sector plants in:o the pricing system; (b) the need to
Increase proflts in public sect.r plants to ralse the level of
self-financing for Investments in modernization and rehabilitation; and
(c) the realization that SCCP profits could be increased by raising the
ex-factory price witbout affecting retail prices, because under the
existlng system large profits were accruing to dealers In deficit areas
because of the black market.
2.21      The policy changes had several important features:
(a) abandonment of cost-plus pricing arrangements for private sector
producers, and elimination of all price controls on retail sales;
(b)  liberalization of licencing requirements for private sector
cement imporrs, subject to pavmert of a tariff, and the
withdrawal of SCCP from the Import trade;
(c) removal of the cement industrv from the list of industries
requiring prior investment sanctioning by the Government and
passing on the authority for investment approval to the financial
institutions; and
81   This surcharge, which is paid into the Cement Development Fund, was
Introduced in 1976 as a means of railsing funds within SCCP for capital
investment. In 1982 GOP allowed its use for subsidizing less
efficient, high-cost plants.



- 9 -
(d)  introduction of increased flexibility in ex-factory prices from
SCCP plants and the elimination of the freight equalization
scheme.
2.22      These measures represented a significant improvvment in the
policy environment for the cement subsector, and have already had
beneficial effects upon the development of the industry, in tandem with the
entry Into production of the private plants. Cement is no longer in short
supply on a national scale, and in the South excess supply has created
rapldly increasing competition, exemplified by decreases in real retail
prices, discounts for quantity purchases and increased advertising and
attempts at product diversification. The black market in the North has
disappeared, and demand Is being met at published market prices as the
South's surplus production is being diverted towards the Punjab. Because
of the competitive pressure, SCCP's market sa'are in the South is now much
less secure, and while SCCP remains the price leader in the North with a
large share of the market, it is now having to develop a natiotnal and
regional marketing strategy to replace the previous allocative system, and
to introduce some flexibility at the plant level in pricing and marketing
decisions.
2.23      The policy changes have also had an immediate impact upon the
assessment of production and investment viability. Two projects for
construction of private sector plants in the South have been shelved, and
several other proposals at the sanctioning level are expected to be
cancelled because both investors and lenders recognize that they are too
small or wrongly located. Investors are examining locations closer to the
deficit areas. In addition, both SCCP and private producers understand the
necessity of making plants larger to secure economies of scale, and two
existing private producers are already preparing plant expansions designed
to lower unit costs significantly.
2.  Imort Policy and Tariffs
2.24      With the 1985 policy changes, Government's import policy for
cement became fully based upon a tariff rather than administrative controls
(Annex 2-4). Between 1975/76, when Pakistan first began to import, and
1981, import tariffs were very low (the nominal tariff rate was 10% and
both nominal and effective rates of protection were negative) and import
prices were considerably above domestic prices. Imports were controlled
largely through the amount of foreign exchange allocations made
available to SCCP, the only authorized importer. In 1981, when the demand
for imports outran SCCP's ability to obtain sufficient foreign exchange,
private importers were authorized to impot. subject to license.
2,25      During the first half of the 1980s, the nominal tariff rate was
gradually increased as domestic costs of production rose and import prices
fell.  In May 1985, the Government raised the import tariff to PRs 550 per
ton 91 plus two across-the-board import surcharges of 5% of cif price.
9/   The specific tariff was Introduced to discourage underinvoicing.



- 10 -
The tariff was set at a level designed to provide producers with a
reasonable return on equity, as a quid pro quo for the elimination of the
guaranteed return policy. At the same time, the Government lifted all
administrative restrictions on imports by the private sector.
2.26      Based upon a reference c&f price of US$43 per ton,L0/ the
specific tariff and surcharges are equivalent to a gross tariff rate of
84%. However, since imported cement does not pay the excise tax of T1Rs 332
per ton levied on domestically produced cement, the real or net tariff rate
amounts to 39%, while the notional nominal rate of protection amounts to
approximately 36%. The nomlnal rate of protection actually available at
the prevailing ex-factory price of PRs 930 per ton is 14% (Annex 2-4).
2.27      In spite of the increased nominal protection during the 1980s,
cement remains one of the least protected industries in Pakistan. Over the
past few years, effective protection has been positive. Currently, the
nominal effective rate of protection for cement in tle Karachi m.rket is
+40.7%, although at the current ex-factory price the actual effective
protection is negative, -3.1% (see Annex 2-4 for details of the
calculations). Effective protection has declined over the past year,
largely because domestic energy prices have fallen less rapidly than world
prices. As a result, cement falls in the lowest range of effective
protection rates in Pakistan. The most recent comprehensive study of
effective protection in Pakistan (PIDE, 1980/81) calculated an average
effective protection rate of 60Z for the industrial sector as a whole, and
indicated that almost one half of all industries had effective protection
rates above 80%, with 14% showing negligible or negative value added at
world prices. Since the PIDE study was completed, the Government has
introduced a number of changes to Pakistan's incentives structure, but not
sufficiently to affect the above conclusion about the relative degree of
protection for cement.
2.28      The generally high levels of protection in Pakistan are a major
constraint on efficient development of the industrial sector, and the
Government is ex?ected to initiate a phased program of reform designed to
lower protection. Within such a program, cement protection should be
monitored, and any necessary changes in the level of protection should be
introduced within the context of the overall program. In the meantime, the
Government has denied requests for increases in protection by the new
private producers to offset their high financial costs, on the grounds that
protection was set in 1985 at a level consistent with a reasonable return
to an efficient producer. The Bank supports the Government's stance.
3e Modernization and Technological Improvement
2.29      The major policy changes introduced in 1985 established a
competitive market environment in Pakistan, and provided the impetus
for modernization of the cement industry. Government policy and lack of

funds in the 1970s prevented Pakistan from taking the energy-efficiency
measures, such as Introduction of dry-process technology, which many other
countries carrled out in the wake of the oil-price increases, and the
guaranteed rate of return policv of the nost-1978 perlod permltted both
private and public investments in new capacity of Inadequate size and
inanproprlate locatlon. The maior nrioritv for the industry Is now to
modernize and rationalize production facllities.
2.30      The modernization program must be undertaken in a number of
areas. Flrst, scale and locatlon of production facilities need to be
rationalized, as a basic step to lowering production costs. This will
involve rehabilitation of some existing Plants, closure of obsolete
capacity and construction of new large-scale, drv-process units in
deflcient areas. In the South, greenfield Plants will not be viable
investments for the foreseeable future compared to capacity increases and
cost-reducing Investments In existing plants, and in the North, the
investment pattern will need to be a mix of new plants and rehabilitation
and modernization of existing plants. Already, some of the new private
plants are planning to Increase the scale of facilities to reduce unit
costs, and the most urgent need for rationalization and modernizatlon is
now in SCCP, whlch retains considerable capacity in old, wet process
plants. Second, trainlng of plant operators will be needed to improve
operations and malntenance of existing plants and start-up and operations
of new plants based on new technology. Third, cement research will be
required to Improve quality of cement and to introduce new cement
products. And fourth, the working environment and performance of SCCP
management will need to he improved.
2.31      The proposed proiect addresses these issues with a particular
emphasis on SCCP (see Chapter V). Parallel with the investment in
efficiency improvements at WJah and five wet-process plants, in training and
in cement research, the project provides for the preparatlon of a Corporate
Strategy and a Management Information System at SCCP to qupport it. With
the emergence of Drivate sector Droducers and a competitive market
environment, SCCP has already begun to respond to the changes In its
position by developing a marketing strategy. liowever, long-term planning
of its business activities and investment Is made difficult by the
short-term perspective of government policies relating to the Corporation's
role and its investment program, and by the political difficulty of dealing
with plant closures and labor rationalization. Currently, It is GOP policy
that SCCP should not imolement any greenfield projects or projects
involving a substantlal increase in overall capacity. In addition, GOP has
Included cement in the list of subsectors in which private shareholdings in
state enterprises are to be encouraged. SCCP needs to develop a medium- to
long-term business strategv which represents a rational and economic
response to private sector competition, and to develop specific plans and
programs for ensuring the commercial and economic viability of the
Corporation through appropriate investment, plant closures, training,
organizational and managerial improvements, marketlng and distribution
arrangements, By assuring that SCCP, as the dominant player in the market,
wlll behave in a ratlonal manner, the formulation of its business strategy
will also help to create a more stable and predictable envlronment for the



- 12 -
sector as a whole, and thereby permit the private sector to plan and
ooerate ratlonally, at the same time as It imposes greater competitive
pressure upon private producers. In addition, the private sector will also
benefit from the tralnlng and research components.
P.  Role of the Rank Group
2.32      The 'Rank's strategv in the Industrial sector in Pakistan has been
two-pronged. Policy-based lending has been supporting: (a) reform of the
trade incentive system; (b) deregulation of government controls, includlng
relaxation of investment controls and cost-nlus pricing; and
(c) organizational and policv reform to improve the efficlency of public
manufacturing industrles. Project-based lending has been financing GOP's
efforts to revitallze the private sector, to Improve financlal servlces and
to rehabilitate and modernize public sector enterprlses.
2.33      The Rank's role in the cement industry has been consistent with
these overall industrial sector objectives. The Rank's involvement in the
Industrv began with the 1983 subsector study, wh5ch took as Its primarv
focus the importance of the tolicv environment In promoting operatIonal
efficiency, technological change and the rational and economically
efficient develonment of the industrv. tee study recommended changes in
the policy environment concerning pricing and control of investment, as a
necessary step for the modernization and rationalization of the sector and
SCCP's plants in particular. Now that these policy changes have been
Introduced, the proposed Project Is a first step In the long-term process
of modernization and rationalization, lnvolving not only the development of
a comprehensive Corporate Strategv and business plans for SCCP, training
programs and establishment of cement research activities, but also the
financing of cost-effective investments in selected SCCP plants.
2.34      In the past, the Rank has also supported cement plants through
lines of credit made available for industrial lending to NDFC, It is
anticipated that private producers will continue to have access to Rank
funds channelled through development banks for both greenfield and
expansion proiects. In early 1987, a tTYRR milllon loan for a nrivate plant
which will produce white cement was anproved under an Tndustrial Investment
Credit Project.
2.35      TvC has also been active In the cement subsector.  It was first
involved -In 1965 when it financed expansion of Ismael (now Gharibwal)

III. THF PAKISTAN CEMENT MARKET
A. General
3,01      The main objective of the proposed project is to support the
process already underway to modernize the cement industry and to Improve
the performance of SCCP. The project will not materially alter the
country's overall cement supply/demand position, nut will contribute to
reducing the deficit in the nortnern Punjab area. Converslon of the Wah
plant will Increase installed capacity by 0.5 mtpy in Northern Punjab,
representing about 5% of the country's total projected capacity by 1992
when the Wah plant would go into commercial production. The additional
production resulting from the project will easily be absorbed by the market
at remunerative prices, accordlng to the Bank's demand projections
(para 3.12).
3.02      Following a period of nominal surplus II/ (1972/73-1975/76),
during which cement was exported, Pakistan turned -into a net importer of
cement in 1976/77. Part of the excess demand in the past decade was met by
imports (which peaked at 1.3 million tons in 1$81182, representing 28% of
consumption) but, as shortages developed, particularly in the Northern
parts of the country, a black market emerged. Following GOP's decision to
encourage private sector investment in the Industry, cement capacitv has
nearly doubled during the last six years, increasing from 4,0 mtpy in
1980/81 to 7.7 mtpy in June 1986 (includlng 16 mtpy of new capaclty In the
private sector), and imports fell to only 18,000 tons In the first half of
1986/87, indicatlng that supply/demand has reached a balance. Rowever,
because most of the new capacity has been located In the South, a regional
surplus of cement has developed in the South while the northern parts of
the country remain In deficit.  Recent studies by National Development
Finance Corporation (NDFC) and SCCP consultants forecast a small surplus of
cement over the next few years on an overall country basis, changing Into
an expanding deficit from 1991/92 onwards. These studies, however,
forecast a continuing surplus in the South and a shortfall in the North
throughout this period. The Bank's own analysis generally supports this
view, but it suggests that, on an overall country basis, a deficit may
develop a little earlier, in 1989/90.

imports, exports and consumption figures for the last ten years. The
consumption figures are derived from the detailed data oresented in
Annex 3-1.
11/ Although cement was exported, shortages were experienced In the
Northern areas, indicating that GOP attached higher priority to
earning foreign exchange than to meeting domestic demand.

3.04      Cement consumption in Pakistan increased from 3.04 mtpy in
1975/76 to 5.92 mtpy in 1985/86, representing an average annual growth rate
of 6.9%. During these ten years, however, there were three distinct
periods of varying growth, Between 1975/76 ^nd 1978/79 when imports were
restricted and domestic production remained stagnant, consumption grew by



- 15 -
606% p.ae During the 1978/79-1981/82 period, as production started to
increase and imports were made, consumption grew at 8.9% p.a., primarily as
a result of higher availability. Finally, between 1981!82 and 1985/86,
although production increased at 11.9% p.a. and there was no restriction on
imports, consumption growth declined to 5.6%, suggesting that demand and
local production have moved closer to balance.
3.05      After being an exporter in the first half of the 1970s, Pakistan
became a net importer of cement in 1976/77. Between 1978/79 and 1984/85,
when the cement shortage was most acute, imports accounted for between 10%
and 28% of annual consumption, peaking in 1981/82 at 1.3 million tons
(Table 3.1). Until 1981, SCCP was the sole agency authorized to import,
but was not able to meet demand because it received insufficient foreign
exchange allocations, and it sustained losses on imports because import
prices of bagged cement were generally above local prices. In 1981, the
private sector was authorized to import under import license, and for a
couple of years, a floating bagging plant in Karachi harbor permitted
low-cost bulk cement imports. With increasing domestic production and the
surplus in the South, which has led to some decline in retail prices in the
Karachi area, imports have been virtually eliminated. The bagging plant
was closed in 1985, and only small amounts of bagged cement have been
imported recently; in the first half of 1986/87, only 18,000 tons were
imported, mainly through prior commitment under barter deals with the USSR
and East European countries.
3.06      Pakistan's per capita consumption of cement was 58 kg in 1984
which is relatively low considering its GNP per capita and degree of
industrialization. Table 3.2 shows GNP and per capita cement consumption
for selected countries.

3,07      Per capita consumption is low partly because about 70% of the
population lives In rural areas, primarily In mud-built dwellings and their
cement consumption Is extremely low. Furthermore, there are relatively few
stockists/retailers of cement In the rural areas and cement availability is
not assured, thus preventing some potential consumers from acquiring
cement.
Cement Production
3.08      Between 1975/76 and 1985/86, installed cement capacity increased
from 3.62 to 7.67 mtpy, and domestic cement production Increased from 3e17
to 5.74 mtpy. All this increase, however, took place during the last six
years. Capacity utilization during 1975/76-1985/86 averaged 86% which,
although low,12/ is understandable given the age of some of the older
plants and the technical problems that were encountered during the initial
operation of some of the new plants.
C. Supply and Demand Projections
3e09      Table 3.3 summarlzes projected year-end capacity and production
of cement during 1985/86 to 1994/95. More detailed projections of capacity
are given in Annex 3-2. In addition to examining forecasts of production
made by SCCP and NDFC, the Bank has made its own forecast, which takes into
account only new plants or capacity expansions %.hich have been sanctioned
and have firm financing arrangements. The details of the assumptions
underplnning the Bank's production forecast are given in Annex 3-3.
12/ 100% capacity utilization in Pakistan is defined as an annual
production corresponding to 300 days of kiln operation at rated
capacity. By internatlonal definition, it would equate to about 82%
capacity utilization.

expected demand-supply balance during 1985/86 to 1994/95. In addition to
showing figures produced by SCCP and N)VC, the table provides the Bank's
own projection of demand, which is based upon an average growth of 6.5% per
annum in constructlon value-added. (For details of the methodology, see
Annex 3-3). All three forecasts show that, over the next four years,
demand and production will be close to balance, with a deficit beginning in
the early 1990s.

3.11       On a regional basis, the supply-demand picture is more complex.
tIDFC have forecast production and demand on the basis of provincial
boundaries and indicate that, while Sind and Baluchistan would enjoy a
surplus of cement up to 1993/94, Punjab and NWFP would continue to
experience deficits throughout the next ten years. SCCP itself has made
projections based upon division of the country into ten market areas, and
these, while generally similar to the NDFC results, show a small surplus in
some parts of NW P and a small deficit in the northwestern part of
Baluchistan.
3.12       The Bank has also prepared its own regional projections, dividing
the country into four zones delineated according to location of existing
and future plants and their natural market areas (see Annexes 3-1 and 3-3
for details). Table 3.5 shows the projected capacity, production and
demand in 1985/86 and 1995/96 for each zone (annual details are presented
in Annex 3-5). The projections indicate that the surpluses in zones 1
(NWFP and the north of Azad Kashmir) and 4 (southern Sind and southern
Baluchistan) would decline by 1995/96 as demand expands, and that the
current deflcits in zones 2 (northern Punjab and the south of Azad Kashmir)
and 3 (southern Punjab, northern Sind and northern Baluchistan) would
Increase considerably. In fact, the deficits are likely to increase less
than the projections suggest, because investors will respond to market
opportunities by the end of the period and construct new capacity not
included in the projections.

and market cement, the Government, through SCCP, controlled all sales and
distrlbution of cement in Pakistan. SCCP determined regional quotas,
arranged for transporting cement and established allocations for public
sector agencies. Only public sector bodies were authorized to pick up
cement directly from the plant; the general public could buy cement only
from those SCCP stockists (commission agents) who were allocated an annual
quota and were authorized to pick up cement directly from the plants at the
control price. Because of the cement shortage, and the profits to be made
from selling cement on the black macket, appointment as a stockist became
an important source of political patronage and between 1980 and 1Q85, the
number of stockists doubled from 3,500 to approximately 7,000. SCCP and
the District Commissioners (local administration) fixed dealers' margins.
Because of the regional production and demand imbalance, large quantities
of cement (up to 0.8 millon tons per annum) had to be transported over
considerable distances, and SCCP operated a system of freight subsidies to
avoid wide disparities in retail prices among different areas. Owing to
shortages of railway wagons, only 15Z of the cement dispatches were made by
rail, and the remainder was carried by trucks.
3.14      Following commissioning of several private eement plants and the
Government decision in 1985 to abandon cost-plus pricing, decontrol market
prices and eliminate the freight subsidy,13/ the market envirorment has
13/ While SCCP has eliminated explicit freight subsidies, a decreasing
market share In the South has forced it to allow discounts to Lahore
stockists for purchases from the Zeal Pak plant at 'Hyderabad.



- 20 -
undergone a qualitative change. It is no longer a "seller's market,"
particularly In the South. Because of the surplus situation, prices have
decreased in real terms in the southern region, vlrtually eliminating
imports; the black market in the Northern areas has disappeared; and demand
Is being fully met at prevailing market prices as producers in the South
are forced to divert their surplus productlon to the North (Annex 3-6).
3.15      As yet there has been little change in SCCP's distrlbution
systems; 70% of its total sales are still made througli stockists, 20% of
the production is earmarked for public sector agencies, and the remainder
is sold directly to larger private sector consumers ex-factory. The
proliferation of stockists in the past few years, who generally have had
quotas of only 50 tons per month, has created administrative difficulties
for both SCCP and plants, and in response SCCP has now abolished quotas for
its stockists in the South. As a result, many small stockists no longer
order cement, and most sales are being made to larger stockists who are
professional cement retailers. A similar situation exists for the private
plants. The quota system remains in the northern part of Pakistan, but
SCCP is lnvestigating alternative arrangements as part of Its overall
marketing and distribution planning.
3.16      While SCCP continues to allocate market shares among its plants
and still determines ex-factory prices for its plants, it has recently
taken several steps in response to the new market environment, for example:
(i) ex-factory prices of the Rohri and the Northern plants have been
increased from PRs 1,262/ton to PRs 1,300/ton;14/ (ii) a larger volume of
cement (50,000 tons per month instead of 30,000) is being shipped by rail
from the South to the North; (iii) quantity discounts for cement shipments
have been secured from the Pakistan Railways; (iv) marketing staff at the
plant level are being reorganized and posted nearer demand centers; (v) an
advertising campaign has been launched on the TV and other media; and
(vi) a decision has been taken to adopt a uniform brand name and bag deslgn
for cement produced by all SCCP plants.
3.17      While the above steps are In the right direction, SCCP's future
marketing strategy will need to evolve, taking into account increasing
competition, both in the South as the Attock Cement plant attains higher
capacity utllization levels and also in the North when the FECTO plant goes
into production. While SCCP's overall market stratesy will be refined
within its Corporate Strategy exercise, SCCP is also already considering:
(i) increasing the proportion of cement dispatches by rail, to reduce
transportation costs, and entering into medium-term contacts with Pakistan
Railways; (11) diversifying Its product-mix and selecting optimal locations
for producing each product; (iii) encouraging the private sector to install
bulk handling and ready-mix facilities at major consumption centers;
(iv) providing micro-computer facilities to the marketing staff to
facilitate data processing and analysis; and (v) delegating further
14/ The individual plants are in theory also permitted to vary ex-factory
prices by +PRs 50/ton. However, in practice, only the Thatta and
Javedan plants have so far utilized this flexibility.



- 21 -
responsibility for marketing and pricing to the plant level. SCCP is now
examining these proposals in the context of a special program to improve
marketing and distribut.on.
E. Cement Pricing
3.18      Prior to price decontrol in May 1985, when only public sector
plants were in operation, GOP followed a complex pricing system based on a
cost-plus formula (see para 2,19), Annex 3-7 shows the buildup of, and
variation in, ex-factory prices during the 1976-86 period. During the
period, retention and ex-factory prices recorded a four-fold increase
against a two-fold increase in the general consumer price index.
3.19      Since decontrol of prices In 1985 (see paras 2.19-2.23), SCCP has
increased its plants' ex-factory prices twice. An increase of PRs 100/ton
was made for all plants in June 1985. Another Increase of PRs 38/ton for
the Northern plants was made in August 1986. These decisions to increase
prices are in line with SCCP's objective of gradually adopting a fully
market-oriented pricing policy for its individual plants. SCCP has also
made some changes in the internal pricing arrangements for its plants. For
example, while it still collects a transportation surcharge from its plants
of PRs 12 per ton of cement, only part of the proceeds is used to improve
the cash flow position of the less profitable units; the remainder is used
for SCCP's corporate expenses. Moreover, SCCP no longer guarantees a
minimum rate of return for its individual plants. The profit-making plants
are permitted to retain a portion of the profits to allow for adequate
dividends (minimum of 202 pre-tax return on equity for lOOX SCCP-owned
plants) 15/ and BMR investments. While the market developments will
continue to press SCCP to rationalize its plant and company pricing
practices, it is also intended that the question of pricing, financing and
company-plant relationships will be examined within the context of the
Corporate Strategy exercise.
IV.  THE COMPANY
A. Historical Development of SCCP
4.01      Following the nationalization of privately owned cement plants in
January 1972 and their organization under a Board of Industrial Management
(RIM), the Government decided in 1973 to form the State Cement Corporation
of Pakistan (SCCP) as an independent holding company under the aegis of the
Ministry of Production (MOP) to take over the management of all cement
plants in Pakistan (para 2.03). The company was formed on August 11, 1973,
with an authorized capital of PRs 100 million. Under its charter, SCCP was
charged with the following specific responsibilities:
(a) assure an adequate supply of cement in the country through
domestic production and, if necessary, imports;
15/ A higher return is normally given to plants with public holdings.



- 22 -
(b)  ensure efflcient capacity utilization, introduce modernization
and balancing within existing cement plants, and plan for
additional capacity to meet Increasing domestic demand;
(c) aevelop a comprehensiva marketing and distribution system; and
(d) carry out training programs to meet the manpower needs of an
expanding and modern industry, and create technical and
engineering abilities in the cement and cement machinery
industries.
4.02      Between 1973 and 1978, SCCP's responsibilities were limited to
operating eight plants, since Government did not authorize construction of
new plants or the rehabilitation and modernization of existing plants.  In
1975, SCCP began to import cement in the face of increasing demand, and in
1978 it was given approval to construct new plants and expand existing
plants. Between 1978 and 1985, SCCP implemented an investment program
amounting to approximately US$200 million, which financed an increase of
2.1 million tons in the Corporation's capacity through six projects
comprising two expansions (1,000 tpd each at Javedan, and Mustehkam), and
four new plants (1,000 tpd each at Thatta, Dandot and Kohat, and 2,000 tpd
at DG Rhan). As of early 1987, SCCP had a total capacity of 5.9 mtpy
distributed among 13 plants.
B. Corporate Structure and Management Performance
4.03      SCCP is owned by GOP.  It is headed by a Board of Directors
conslsting of six persons: the Chairman of SCCP, who is appointed by the
Ministry of Production (MOP); a member of the National Assembly; a member
from the development banks (currently IDBP); a member from the Mutual Funds
Organizations (currently ICP); a member appointed by GOP; and a member
appointed by the provincial government of Punjab. Some degree of autonomy
has been given to the Board of Directors, which has established a committee
of the Chairman and two directors resident in Lahore to take decisions on
urgent matters. However, the Board has frequently chosen not to exercise
its autonomy, and as a matter of course, all but routine decisions have
been referred to the finistry of Production. As SCCP faces increasing
competition from the private sector and needs to develop a coherent
strategy for ensuring its commercial survival, the relationship between the
CGrporation and GOP will be reviewed under the Corporate Strategy exercise.
4.04      All executive powers are vested in the Chairman, who in turn
works under the general orders of the MOP. An organization chart of SCCP's
management structure is shown at Annex 4-1. The eight departments and the
sma'l Cement Research Laboratory are each headed by a General Manager
reporting directly to the Chairmar. The structure of the Corporation's
headquarters, which employs approximately 2'0 persons, will be analysed
thoroughly, as part of the Corperate Strategy exercise (paras 4.12 et
seq.), one of whose objectives wilL be to establish an appropriate
organizational and managerial framework for the Corporatiorn.



- 23 -
4.05      The 13 plants operated by SCCP are organized Into eleven
companies (Annex 4-2), Assoctated Cement Company (AC) has two plants at
Wah and Rohri; although incorporated, ACC is currently treated as an
operating division of SCCP, pending GOP approval for the two plants to be
formally transferred to It in the near future. Four of the companies are
public limited companies with a diversified ownership structure (Zealpak,
Charibwal, Mustekham and Javedan). These companies are quoted on the
Karachi stock exchange. The other seven companies are not quoted on the
stock exchange and are fully owned by SCCP as private limited companies
(with the exceptlon of the white cement company which is an unquoted public
limited company managed by Maple Leaf). A typical organization chart for a
subsidiary company is shown at Annex 4-3.
4.06      Each of the companies has Its own Board of Directors.  In the
case of the quoted companies, directors are appointed by the shareholders.
The presence of non-SCCP directors in the quoted companies and the need to
pay dividends to shareholders are recognized as having had a very
heneficial effect upon performance and management. The non-quoted
companies have boards of directors appointed by SCCP. The Managing
Directors (MT)s) of the plants are appointed by SCCP and report directly to
its Chairman. In contrast with past practice, all MDs are now cement
professionals, whlch has also resulted in improvements in plant
performance.  However, the powers of the MDs are generally limited to
factory operations and do not extend to the commercial and financial
viability of the plant, responsibility for which rests with SCCP through
its control of pricing and marketing. Within the past year, SCCP has taken
steps to increase MDs' responsibility in these areas, by giving them the
power to vary ex-factory prices by plus or minus PRs 50 per ton and by
decentralizing some marketing functions (para 2.19). HRowever, the MDs have
not yet exercised the greater responsibilities. Within the scope of the
Corporate Strategy exercise, there is a need for clarifving and redefining
the powers of plants' Managing Directors and 1Poards of Directors.
4.07      The flnancial performance of SCCP as a whole has been good, given
the policy environment and pricing arrangements which existed in the past
(see paras 7,04 and 7.05 and Annex 7-3 for details of financial performance
for the period 1981/82-1985/86). As a holding company, SCCP has no
operating income of Its own. It derives its income primarily from
dividends of its subsidiaries, of which Associated Cement is one of its
major contributors. Although ACC's accounts are said to be consolidated
with those of SCCP, in practice ACC's net income is treated as a dividend
and shown in SCCP's revenue account together with dividends from other
subsidiaries (para 7.06). The development surcharge collected from the
subsidiaries does not form part of SCCP's revenue, but flows into a Cement
Development Fund, which is maintained as a tax-free reserve available
chiefly' for the construction and rehabilitation of cement plants (see
para 2.19).
4.08      The operational performance of SCCP's plants has in general been
good but has varied widely, primarily because of widely different
technologies, varying degrees of overmanning and specific operational
difficultles at some plants. Over the curent decade, only two plants, the



- 24 -
Mational Cement plants at Karachi and Dandot, have regularly reported
losses, resulting from aging equipment, high fuel costs, small scale of
production and a relatively large labor force. SCCP has already decided to
close these plants, and is currently exploring with Government how this
politically sensitive decilsion can be Implemented. One other plant, Thatta
Cement Company, which produces chiefly slag cement, reported minor losses
during the past fiscal year because of unavailabllity of slag from Pakistan
Steel Mills, but Is expected to move back into a profitable position this
year, assuming adequate efforts to market output. All other plants have
declared profits each year.
4.09      Over the past few years, significant efforts have been made to
improve the operational, financial and managerial performance of SCCP and
Its plants. SCCP's management has begun to respond to the changes In the
policy environment and the entry of the private sector by paying more
attention to the market. Marketing staff has been decentralized and
enlarged and efforts are now being made to rationalize the stocklst system
and to develop marketing expertise at the plant level. By placing cement
professionals in the management of the subsidiaries, and by generating gnore
comprehensive operational and managerial informatlon for the Corporation
and plant managers, a good start has been made in improving SCCP's
organization.
4.10      SCCP has also been involved in two broader exercises deslgned to
improve management. First, along with all other state enterprises, the
Company has been part of the Public Enterprise Signalling System which
began in 1982. This system, implemented with the assistance of consultants
under the Bank's Technical Assistance Credit No. 1256-PAK, was set up to
assist GOP in monitoring and improving the performance and efficiency of
state enterprises. The system contains a performance informatlon system, a
performance evaluation system which defines objectives and targets and an
lncentive system which rewards managers on the basis of performance against
negotiated targets. The system, which has been in force in SCCP since
1984, is seen within the Government as a positive factor in improved
performance of enterprise particularly since the reviews and discussions
between the enterprise, Ministry of Production and the Experts Advisory
Cell (EAC), which is responsible for managing the system, have improved the
Government's understanding of enterprlses and have encouraged timely
follow-up of issues and problems. The Bank would generally concur with
this judgement of the system, although it appears that the use of gross
production as the main index of performance has encouraged some plants to
maintain production to the detriment of proper maintenance. EAC Is aware
of these deficiencies, and is currently working on ways of improving and
amending the system for all state enterprises.
4.11      Second, SCCP has also served as one of five cases 16/ within a
study (also financed through the Bank's Technical Assistance Credit by EAC
16/ The others are the Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC), Ravi Rayon,
National Motors and the National Fertilizer Corporation.



- 25 -
with the assistance of A.D. Little and Co.), which is designed to equip
state enterprises with tools and methodologies for corporate planning.
Draft plans have been prepared for eaclh of the five enterprises on the
basis of currently available Informatlon and their current objectives and
constraints. These draft plans are now being discussed and wlll provide
the base for more comprehensive and detailed plannlng efforts *In future.
The experiences of the flve companies In the process will also dictate the
future generalizatlon of the planning procesa and methodologi-es to all
other state enterprises. This planning study has been useful for SCCP In
establishing a planning capacity, drawing together all relevant material on
the company and identifying the analytical work necessary to extend the
current statement of corporate strategy inato a longer-term strategy. As
detalled below, the proposed Bank project will build upon this initial
exercise,
C. Corporate Strategy and Restructurinkg 'Program
4,12      A key objective of the proposed Bank project Is to support the
modernization and Improved performance of the cement subsector In general
and of plants owned by SCCP In particular. In addition to supporting
Investment In rehabllitation and 1IMR, training and research activities, the
proposed project will produce a medium- to long-term Corporate Strategy for
SCCI', detailed business plans for SCCP and each of its plants, including
implementatlon proposals and programs, and a Management Information System
(MIS) required for effective management and planning. The purpose
therefore Is to produce a flexible blueprint for SCCP's future development,
which will enable It to operate efficiently and profitably in a competitive
market and to Aeal effectively wit'h Its current and future problems.
4.13      The Corporate Strategy Component is outlined In para 5.07, and
draft terms of reference prepared by SCCP' are attached at 'Annex 4-4. This
exercise, to be managed by an Internal SCCP task force supported by
consultants, would produce a medium-to long-term strategy for SCCP and its
plants Including the design and implementation of detailed action plans for
achieving the Corporation's objectives, and would design and implement a
computerized MIS required for effective management and planning at SCCP and
Its plants.
4.14      The core of the exercise would be analysis of the cement market
and SCCP's competitive position vis-a-vis Its competitors over the next
decade. Based upon these analyses, the task force and c..'-nsultants would
formulate options for SCCP, which would lead to the preparation of a
detailed Corporate Strategy. SCCP has agreed that the exercise should
examine all issues relating to Its activities and viability, and 'has also
agreed that the proposed strategy should be reviewed with the Bank before
finalization* The exercise will examine the relationship between the
various agencies of Government and SCCP with a view' to estabolishing a
proper environment for SCCP to meet both Its commercial objectives and
legitimate socio-economic objectives. The full support of GOP, both In Its



- 26 -
role as owner of SCCP and also as the originator of sector policy, is
crucial to successful implementation of the strategy. In particular, it
will be essential for Government to clearly specify its general intentions
for the Corporation's future, especially in the areas of ownership,
privatization, and growth of capacity (para 2.31). Purthermore, the
exercise will examine product and market opportunities, plant closures and
expansions, labor manning and training and marketing and distribution, as
well as the appropriate relationship between the Corooration and its
plants, including the possible decentralization of functions and the
creation of autonomous subsidiaries. On this basis, the exercise will
generate an investment program for the Corporation resulting in improved
operating efficiencv.
4.15      As part of the Corporate Strategy, the exercise will generate
specific business plans for both SCCP and Its plants. The overall
oblective is to produce detailed and implementable solutions to the
questions of how the Corporation and its plants should be organized and
managed, which plants should be closed and where new capacity should be
built, and how the competitive position of SCCP can be maintained and
improved. In addition, the Corporate Strriegy exercise will also decign,
develop and implement a comprehensive Management Information System
required for effective decision-making at both SCCP and plant level.
4.16      SCCP's management acknowledges the urgency of starting this work,
in view of the increasing competition facing SCCP, and has indicated that
it wishes to complete the exercise as soon as possible. SCCP has agreed
that signature of a contract with consultants should be a condition of
effectiveness of the loan. It was agreed during negotiations that SCCP
will not undertake any major new investments for any of its plants under
the Project prior to completing the formulation of investment criteria
under the Corporate Strategy exercise.
Iv, TR. PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
5.01      The overall objective of the project is to support the rational
development of the cement subsector in Pakistan. Recent policy changes and
reentry of the private sector have created a more competitive environment
and the opportunity for the cement subsector to become more efficient and
internationally competitive through modernization and rationalization of
production facilities, improvement of operatlonal, technical and managerial
performance, and development of new product and market opportunities. In
the light of the adequacy of the policy framework and the fact that the
private sector plants are only now attaining full production, these
opportunities can best be secured by focussing upon the largest producer in
the subsector, the State Cement Corporation of Pakistan (SCCP), which faces
an urgent need to develop a comprehensive and coherent corporate strategy
for modernization and rationalization of its production facilities and



- 27 -
Improvement of its managerial and technical performance. In addition, the
project addresses the need for training and research to benefit both
private and public cement producers, and also the construction and building
materials industries in Pakistan.
R, Project Description
5.02      The project comprises the following cive components:
A.  tWah plant - replacement of five wet process kilne with one large
(3,000 tpd) modern dry process production line;
B.   BMR program (Balancing, Modernization and Rehabilitation) - minor
and medium-scale rehabilitation of five other SCCP plants;
C.   Corporate Strategy and Management Information Systems (MIS);
D.  'Human Resources Development; and
E.   Cement Research Institute (CRI).
5.03      Component A:  Wah Plant.  This component finances the conversion
from wet to dry process operation of the Wah plent, which is located north
of Islamabad (see map). The plant currently co-iists of five wet process
kilnas, whose ages range from 14 to 64 years, with a total capacity of
1,450 tpd of clinker. These kilns are to be replaced by a single
preheater, precalciner production line with a clinker capacity of
3,0nO tpd. A deLailed technical feasibility study carried out in 1986 by
Dyckerhoff Engineering (FRG) identified conversion to a large scale dry
process plant as the optimum option for the Wah plant, and SCCP
subsequently determined that the market situation in tbe North justified a
3,000 tpd plant.  The rehabilitation will increase wah's annual output by
approximately 500,000 tpy and will reduce production costs significantly
(para 7.02).
5.04      The conversion comprises the following new equipment:  quarry
equipment, impact crusher for limestone and clay, covered raw material
storage and reclaiming facilities, a vertical raw mill, rawmeal
homogenization and feeding system, a 3,000 tpd preheater, precalciner kiln
system, clinker silos, a closed circuit cement mill, cement silos, cement
packing and loading station, Process areas and infrastructure retained
from the old plant will be upgraded to permit sustained operation at the
higher production levels. In addition to replacement of the existing power
input system with modern higher capacitv units, the plant will also be
provided with e 500 kVA diesel generator which will assure continued
operation of critical process equipment during power cuts. The access road
to the plant will be expanded and paved to accommodate the additional
trafflc. A detailed project description of the subproject is given in
Annex 5.1.
5.05      Co!monent B:  BMR Program (Balancing, Modernization and
Rehabilitation). This component comprises 22 mediumr-size subprojects in
five of SCCP's wet process plants (Gharibwal, Maple Leaf, Mustehkam,



- 28 -
Javedan and Zeal Pak). These plants, whose ages range from 22 to 31 years,
face design and operational bottlenecks which prevent them from producing
at rated capacity, and experience high maintenance costs brought about by
the need to manufacture in-house many spare parts which can no longer be
purchased.  For four of the plants (Charibwal, Maple Leaf, Mustehkam and
Zeal Pak), technical feasibility studies were carried out in 1986 by
Dyckerhoff Engineering to Identify BMR subprojects, and for Javedan,
subprojects were Identified by SCCP itself. Subsequently the subprojects
were evaluated by SCCP for financial and economic viability, with a view to
selecting for financing those subprojects which, with a high rate of return
and a rapid payback, would be viable irrespective of the outcome of the
Corporate Strategy exercise.
5.06      The 22 subprojects will eliminate bottlenecks in the plants,
replace and strengthen substandard parts critical to major process units,
improve efficiency and reduce costs in major process areas and Improve
environmental standards. Seven subprojects will replace critical parts in
major process areas, whose failure would result in major production
losses. These subprojects include the installation of a diesel generator
at Zeal Pak, which would provlde a limited source of power to protect the
most critical production units against power cuts. Eight subprojects will
consist of efficlency improvements with high returns, such as new limestone
crushers, belt conveyors, storage and reclaiming facilities in Maple Leaf
and Zeal Pak and new cement packing machinery at Mustehkam. Nine
subprojects will consist of improvements in environmental standards,
comprising electrostatic precipitators at Mustehkam, bag-house dust
collectors at Maple Leaf, Mustehkam, Zeal Pak and Javedan and cement
distribution equipment at Gharibwal and Mustehkam. The subprojects are
described in greater detail in Annex 5-2, which also lists the subprojects
on which detailed cost-benefit analyses have been carried out.
5.07      Cmonent C:  Corporate Strategy and Management Information
System. This component comprises the preparation of a comprehensive
Corporate Strategy for SCCP (para 4.12), through which it can analyse and
address the issues pertaining to Its future development, 'Under this
component, SCCP will hire Internationally selected consultants to assist an
internal task force to prepare a Corporate Strategy based on its long-term
objectives, to design and implement detailed business plans for the
Corporation and its subsidiaries, and to design and implement a Management
Information System (MIS).
5.A8      Annex 4-4 provides draft terms of reference prepared by SCCP for
the consultants' work. During Phase I of this exercise, to be completed by
March 1988, the consultants will assist the SCCP task force In developing
and refining SCCP's mediumr- to long-term Corporate Strategy. At this time,
the Bank and SCCP will carry out a joint review of the strategy anA the
task force's proposals for Phase II of the exercise, During Phases II and
III, which are to be completed by March 1989, the consultants will assist
the task force to prepare detailed business plans for the Corporation and
its plants, and to design and implement the MIS, including the procurement
of hardware and software systems.



- 29 -
5,09      Component D:  Human Resources Development.,  Rapid growth of
cement industry capacity, emergence of private sector plants and the
changeover to dry process technology with sophisticated electronic control
systems are creating a demand for skilled cement industry personnel which
the country is unable to satisfy. On the basis of a recent analysis of
manpower needs and available sources for training, SCCP has decided to rely
on outside sources for management training, and to establish its own modern
training facilities for technical and operational personnel. UJnder the
project, an internationally selected consultant specialized in designing
cement training facilities and training trainers will review SCCP's two
existing training facilities (located in two plants) and their training
staff, and prepare recommendations for upgrading facilities (including
installation of computer-operated simulators) and training trainers
according to modern methodology. The new facilities would be designed to
accommodate personnel from the private sector as well as SCCP. Selected
SCCP training personnel will receive training abroad, and the consultant
will assist in the implementation of the program. This component,
including terms of reference for consultants, Is described in detail in
Project File (item B5.2).
5.10      Component E:  Cement Research Institute (CRI).  This component
comprises the establishment of a CRI for applied research on cementitious
materials, such as cement, concrete and concrete products. On the basis of
a consultant study, SCCP has prepared a propossl for a national CRI to be
located in Lahore, that would consolidate and develop the work of a group
of SCCP technicians currently performing tests on cementitious materials
for SCCP and private sector clients. SCCP has expressed a desire to limit
the initial scope of CRI activities to applied research on cementitious
materials, for which it considers there is an established demand.
Initially, the CRI will serve both public and private manufacturers and
consumers of cement, the construction industry and the building materials
industry by providing accurate analysis and testing of cementitious
materials. In addition, it will be responsible for drafting national
standards for cement and for cementitious building materials. The project
will finance the construction of offices and testing facilities for CRI.
Initially, operational expenses will be funded by SCCP, but it plans to
invite private sector participation and representation on the CR1 board and
to formulate plans for CRI to move gradually towards being funded by fees,
in order that its work meets the needs of its sponsors and customers and
that it eventually will be a self-supporting and independent corporation.
It was agreed during negotiations that SCCP will take all necessary steps
toward the development of the CRT Into an efficient service-oriented,
self-supporting organization with private sector participation. Detailed
information on the CRI is provided in the Project File (item B5.1).
C. Project Management and Implementation
5.11      The Wah project will be executed by a SCCP project implementation
team acting as its own general contractor. A project implementation team
has already been assembled of SCCP engineers with considerable experience
of civil and process engineering, construction and project execution,

largely derived from the commissioning of four greenfield plants since 1980
and the installation of dry process kilns at two existing plants. Details
of the project team and the members' CVs are provided in the Project File
(Item B 5.3).
5,12      In view of the scale of the Wah project, the project
implementation team will be assisted and advised by an experienced
internationally selected engineering consultant (FC), whose
responsibilities will be to advise on process selection, plant layout and
design, tender preparation, bid evaluation, procurement and general Issues
of project management and implementation. The EC will also be responsible
for designing a critical path program to control and monitor project
progress and for providlng periodic progress and cost reports. SCCP's
draft terms of reference for the EC aze shown in the Project File (Item
8 5-4), and agreement on these terms of reference has been obtained. In
addition, the equipment suppliers will be responsible for equipment
performance, commissioning and supervlsion of erection, and clear
allocation of responsibility will be ensured through having bid packages
based on discrete process arease
5.13      For the BMR component, project implementation teams in each of
the five plants will be responsible for implementation, under the general
supervision of the Wah component project implementation team. The latter
will have specific responsibility for procuring the equipment required for
the subprojects under the BMR component.
5,14      SCCP will contract with third parties for design and
implementation of civil works and mechanical and electrical work.
Sufficient experienced local contractors are available to ensure a
competitive environment.
5.15      In order to assure timely implementation of the Wah project,
invitations to suppliers for prequalification were Issued in May 1987, so
that prequalified bidders can submit bids by June 1988. Similarly,
invitation for proposals for the EC assignment were mailed to the five
shortlisted consultants (already approved by the Bank) in August 1987, so
that the contract can be signed by November 1987.  As indicated in
Table 5.1 and the more detailed implementation chart in Annex 5-3,
evaluation and contracting of equipment packages will take place between
September-November 1988, and the kiln will be commissioned 36 months later
in November 1991. This time span coincides with world-wide experience for
greenfield cement projects, and can be considered realistic given that the
new Wah production line will be installed on an existing plant site.
Implementation of the other components, which will be implemented
concurrently with Wah, are expected to be completed within a span of
24-30 months as indicated . More detailed implementation charts are shown
in Annexes 5-4 to 5-8.

5.16       As indicated In para 5.12, SCCP has committed Itself to address
the long-term needs for training of SCCP and private plant personnel
througpth component D of this project. SCCP has also made specific plans for
the training of personnel for the Wah plant.  To ensure their timely
training,, SCCP will select personnel at an early date and provide training
by the following methods: (a) sending selected staff for overseas training
under agreements with equipment suppliers; (b) sending other personnel for
training in the most advanced of SCCP's existing dry process plants; and
(c) sending staff to SCCP's existing training facilities, which will be
updated and improved under component D. Moreover, Wah will borrow
experienced operators from other SCCP dry process plants for the start-up

period. For component B, since no major change in technology is foreseen,
SCCP's internal training facilities will be able to provide adequate
training for the personnel of the five plants. For components C, 1) and E,
training will be provided by Internationally selected consultantso
D. Pollutic.i Control
5.17      The major pollutlon problem in SCCP's cement plants would arise
from particulate emissions from mills and kilns, and the plants do not
experience problems with liquid or poisonous discharges. GOP has
established preliminary emission standards and requires the preparation of
environmental impact statements for major new developments in order to
ensure compliance. For the Wah project and for the Mustehkam subproject
(under component B), modern and highly efficient electrostatic dust
collectors will be installed for the cement kilns. The proposed equipment
is based on a design efficiency of 150 mg/NM3, which is well below 1oth the
existing Pakistan code of 600 mg/NM3 and the 300 mg/NM3 standard scheduled
to be implemented by 1990. In addition, bag-type dust collection devices
will be installed both in Wah and in selected subprojects under component B
to reduce dust emissions around crushers, cement silos and packing plants.
It has been agreed with SCCP that the project will comply with
environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank.
VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Cost
6.01      Table 6.1 summarizes the total financial requirements of the
project. Total capital cost, excluding IDC and incremental working
capital, for all components of the project is estimated at
PRs 2,495 million (US$144.2 million equivalent), and the total foreign
exchange component is esti-4ated at US$96 million equivalent (i.e., 66.6% of
total cost). Incremental working capital amounts to U1S$1.5 million, of
which US$0.7 million equivalent (47%) is in foreign exchange. Interest
during construction amounts to PRa 324 million (US$18.7 million
equivalent), of which US$8.9 million equivalent (48%) is in foreign
exchange. The total financing requirements for all the components amount
to PRs 2,843 million (US$ 164.4 million equivalent), of which
US$105.6 million equivalent is in direct foreign exchange.

2. Total physical contingenies are about 10% of base cost; loca price       es are about 30%
and foreign price    i ci  about 10% of the respective base costs plus trsica
contingencies.
3. Tans aid duties are about PRM 169.5 miion ( .8 milon euivalen).

and 3.5% anuamly threafter.
6.02       The base capital cost estimates were prepared from estimates by
suppliers and consultants, and reflect recent costs in Pakistan for civil
worke and international prlces for the equipment costs.  Calculated on the
basis of capital cost per unit of capacity, base cost estimates compare
favorably with similar projects in most other countires, mostly due to the
relatively low cost of construction labor. Summaries of capital cost
estimates for Wah and the BMR component are shown In Annexes 6-1 and 6-2,



- 34 -
with further details in Project Files. The cost of internationally
recruited consultants (including consulting fees, travel and subsistence
expenses) has been estimated on the basis of an average rate of about
US$16,0nO per man-month, with an estimated 400 man-months required.
6.03      Despite a high degree of confidence in the base cost estimate,
physical contingencies have been set at 102 of base costs for both civil
works and equipment purchases, which allows for possible changes during
detailed design. The estimates include provision for price escalation
using factors, in accordance with IBTRD guidelines (Table 6.1), applied to
the base cost estimate plus physical contingencies, and take into account
the expected project lmplementation schedules of subprojects under the
various components. 'Price escalation amounts to an average of 16% on the
base cost plus physical contingencies, and reflects the mix of project
implementation schedules.
6.04      Incremental working capital required at start-up Is estimated at
US$1.5 million, and the main elements to be financed would comprise
Inventories of minor spare parts and consumables. Since most customers pay
In advance when placing orders for cement and thus provide plants with
resources for use as working capital, the estimated provision for
incremental working capital is deemed adequate. Such advances amount to
Eround eight weeks of sales, and are a major source of financing for ACC's
current assets (see para 7.11). Interest during construction of
US$18.7 million has been estimated on the basis of subproject
implementation schedules and assumed loan terms as detalled in Annex 7-1.
B. Financing Plan
6.04      The total financing requirements for the project are proposed to
be met as follows:

would cover 58% of the total project cost, and the remaining 12% would be
funded by local commercial banks. The Bank loan will cover all foreign
exchange requirements of the project, excluding IDC and incremental working
capital. The detailed financing plans for the Wah rehabilitation and the
BM4R components are shown in Annexes 6-1 and 6-2. Analysis of the projected
financial performance of SCCP and its subsidiaries under components A and B
of the project shows that, under the proposed financing plan, acceptable
levels of debt service coverage and current ratios are maintained both
during and after project implementation. Agreement has been reached during
negotiations that all subloan covenants with SCCP will include provision
for cost overrun financilg to be provided on terms and conditions deemed
satisfactory by the Bank, The Government has confirmed that, in the event
of any cost overrun which SCCP is unable to finance, it will ensure that
such additional funds as required will be made available under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank.
C. Relending and Onlending Arrangements
6.06      The Bank loan of tJS$96 million would be made to the Government of
Pakistan. The terms would be in line with recent Bank practice, and would
have a ma.urity of 20 years including 5 years of grace and would carry the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
6,07      Relending Arrangements.  GOP will relend the funds to SCCP on the
following terms: repayment over 11 years including a four-year grace
period and an interest rate of 14% p.a. which is considered adequate to
cover IBRD's lending rate, and repayment guarantee, interest rate risk and
foreign exchange coverage fees for GOP.
6.08      Onlending Arrangements.  SCCP would onlend US$87.9 million
re-uired for Components A and B to its subsidiaries at terms and interest
tate identical to those enjoyed by SCC'.
6.09      Effectiveness of the Bank loan to GOP would be, inter alia,
subject to the signature of:
(a) a subsidiary loan agreement between GOP and SCCP on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank; and
(b) subloan agreements between SCCP and Its subsidiaries on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank.

Note: Wigures in parentheses indicate amount financed by the proposed Bank loan.
6.11      Bank guidelines will be followed in the procurement of all
Bank-financed goods and equipment and consulting services. International
competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for procurement of Benk-financed
equipment packages costing approximately US$86 million. The ICB packages
for Wah have been designed according to process area, while those for the
RMR component have been formed by grouping equipment for all of the
subprojects lnto generic machinery groups. Because of their size and
complexity, some ICR packages are expected to be awarded mostly to foreign



- 37 -
bidders, Domestic suppliers will be eligible for a preference of 15% or
the amount of customs duties, whichever is lower. Prequalification of
suppliers will be used for complex packages, and two-stage bidding
procedures will be followed for some packages. The major complex packages
will include erection supervision and commissioning by the supplier.
6.12      Of the US$98.2 million required for equipment, US$89.9 million
will be procured through ICB, US$4.7 million will be procured through LCB
and US$3.6 million will be procured through LIB (Table 6.3). Equipment to
be procured through LIB comprises US$3.0 million for anticipated
proprietary equipment in the BMR component and US$0.6 million for training
simulators under component D, where only two qualified suppliers are
expected. No civil works will be financed by the Bank. All local cost
items including civil works contracts will be procured according to LCB.
Consulting and engineering services (US$6.5 million) will be procured in
accordance with Bank consultants' guidelines. Bidding packages for
equipment estimated to cost more than US$1.5 million and all bidding
packages for consulting and engineering services will be subject to the
Bank's prior review of procurement documentation, resulting in a coverage
of 95% of the total estimated value of contracts. The balance of contracts
will be subject to ex-post review,

6.14      Of the 19 ICB packages for Wah and BMR subprojects, 12 packages,
each valued at more than USS1.5 millions account for 96% of the total
value (Annex 6-3). Disbursement will be against full prior review of all
packages above TISS1.5 million. For contracts between USS300,000 and
US$1.5 million disbursement will be against ex-post review during project
supervision. Por contracts of less than US$300,000 and for payments for
training and overseas visits by local staff of less than US$300,000,
payments will be against statements of expenditure (SOE), prepared and
retained by SCCP and made available for Bank revlew during project
supervision. To facilitate disbursements, a special account will be
established in US dollars at the National Bank of Pakistan, with an
authorized allocation of US$6.5 million for SCCP, corresponding to the
average disbursement for four months. Applications for replenishment would
be submitted on a monthly basis, or when amounts withdrawn are equal to 50%
of the US$6.5 million authorized, whichever occurs first. The Bank is
satlsfied that, based on past performance, SCCP will be able to furnish
audited accounts on a regular and timely basis.
6.15      The expected disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan and
a comparator profile for industry projects ln the South Asia Region is
shown as Annex 6-4. The comparator profile for Industry projects in the
South Asia Region, calculated as an average of 20 projects, gives an
average disbursement period of six years. The disbursement profile for
this project is based on the regional profile and past experience of SCCP
In implementing similar projects. The bulk of loan disbursements are
expected to take place during the first four years following loan
signature. The loan is expected to be substantially disbursed for the Wah
conversion and BMR components by June 30, 1991, and fully disbursed for all
components by June 30, 1992.
F.  Status of Project
6.16      SCCP has already obtained clearance from the Central Development
Working Party (CDWP) for the required GOP Project documentation paper,
PC-1. The PC-1 document has been submitted to the Executive Committee for
the National Economic Council (ECNEC) for approval and EtVNEC approval of
the PC-1 will be required as a condition for loan effectiveness. Draft
documentation has also been prepared for the selection of the Engineering
Consultant (EC) for project implementation (Project File B5.4), consultants
for the Corporate Strategy exercise (Annex 4-4) and the training consultant
(Project File B5.2). In addition, on the basis of the Dyckerhoff
feasibility study, SCCP has prepared layouts and process descriptions for
the Wah component and the subprojects under the RMR component.  SCCP and
its subsidiary companies have already established the project
implementation teams required for project implementation.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Methodology
7.01      Detailed financial analysis for the project has been carried out
in three respectso First, SCCP as a whole has been examined to determine



- 39 -
its ability to provide eauity funds of PRs 842 million to meet its project
financing obligations. This has required analysis of subsidiary companies
not Involved in the project, but whlch contribute to the Cement Development
Fund (para 7.07) and upon whose dividends SCCP's profitability depends.
Second, the Associated Cement Company (ACC) has been analyzed to determine
its abillty to servlce the additlonal debt associated with the
rehabilitation of the WJah plant. Third, the five plants undertaking the
BMR component have heen analyzed to determine their individual abilities to
service the debt associated with the R'Nt subprolects. The analysis
demonstrates that SCCP and its subsidiaries under this project are
profitable entlties, capable of meeting their debt obligations and
maintaining the financial ratios required by the Bank. The following
paragraphs focus chiefly upon the financial analysis carried out on SCCP
and ACC, because of the scale of the rehabilitation of the Wah plant and
its impact on SCCP as a whole and ACC. Descriptions of the five plants
involved In the RMR and projectlons of their financial statements are
presented in Annex 7-5 and are detalled in the Project File (B7.3-B7.5).
,. Assumptions Used and Forecast of Production Costs
7.02      Details of the assumptions used in the financial projections for
SCCP and ACC are provided in Annex 7-1. Projectlons have been made through
1994/95, when the Wah rehabilitation project wlll have reached full
capacity utillzation, Current and projected unit costs of cement produced
at Wal are shown in Annex 7-2, The project will result in a decline in
Wiah's total costs of production of PRs 95.4 per ton, and a decline in
variable costs of PRs 210.5 per ton. As Table 7.1 indicate;, most of the
reduction in variable costs results from fuel savings whlch will amount to
PRs 179 per ton of cement.  The remainder of the variable cost reductions
is obtained In the areas of raw material, maintenance and labor costs.
Labor costs per ton will be lowered because there will be no need to
Increase the size of the current labor force to operate the larger ploit;
raw material costs per ton will be reduced because of more efficient
process technology including high efficlency dust collectors; and
maintenance costs per ton will be lowered because of improved process
design. At plants assisted under component A, reductions in costs per ton
will be achieved through the elimination of bottlenecks and replacement of
critical parts in major process areas, which will maintaln or improve their
rates of capacity utilization, and through improvement in power and fuel
efficiencies.

7.03      The production build-up under component A assumes a kiln capacity
utilization 17/ of 65%2 75%, 90% and 100%, respectively, in the four years
after start-up. Sales revenues for Wah have been projected using the
current ex-factory price of cement in Northern Pakistan, currently PRe 956
per ton net of excise duties. Although the Wah plant is located in a
deficit area and price increases might be expected in the medium term, the
projections do not include Increases in the esisting ex-factory price.
Operating cost estimates for all plants under the proposed project have
been calculated on the basis of detailed evaluations of labor, raw
materials, fuel, power and overhead costs, and all operating costs are
assumed to remain constant in real terms. For the projections of pro-forma
financial statements, inflation factors have been used In acco-dance with
Rank guidelines (see Annex 7-1)e

1.  SCCP
7,05      Since SCCP is a holding companv and has no operating Income of
its own, its financial performance is dependent upon the dividends it
receives from its subsidiaries, interest on investments and other
miscellaneous income. Its pretax profit as a percentage of revenues
increased from 63% in 1982/83 to 832 in 1983/86, largely because of
increases in dividends received from its subsidiaries, whose profitability
increased after the decontrol of cement prices. At the end of the 1985/86
17/ In this context, 100% capacity utilization assumes 300 days'
operation.



- 41 -
fiscal year, SCCP's financial position was sound, with a debt/equity ratio
of 41:59 and a debt coverage ratio of over 6.
7.06      The projections at Annex 7-4, which are sumarized in Table 7.3,
show that SCCP's net profit is forecast to increase by about 200% (13%
p.a.), from PRs 161 milllon in 1985/86 to PRe 483 million In 1994/95, when
the full benefits of the project will be realized. They indicate a strong
and profitahle flnancial position for the Corporation throughout the period
of project implementation.

2. ACC
7,08      Associated Cement Company (ACC), although incorporated, is
currently treated as an operating division of SCCP, pending the government
approval for the two plants (Vah and Rohri) to be transferred to it in the
near future. Currently, its profit/loss is reflected as dividends in the
income statement of SCCP (para 4.07). Audited subsidiary financial reports
are, however, annexed to SCCP's annual financial report. Historically ACC
has been a strong financial performer with a sound capital structure; the
proJect is expected to enhance even further both ACC's competitiveness and
profitability.
7.09      ACC has two plants, one at Wah (460,000 tpy) and the other at
Rohri (250,000 tpy), with combined Installed capacity of 71n,000 tpy.
Capacity utilization has averaged approximately 76% for the last four
years, but increased to 89% in 1985/86 mainly because of a continuing BRR
program at the Rohri plant. As a result of increased capacity utilization
and higher prices derived from sales of sulphur-reststant cement produced
at Rohri, the company's operating profit (profit before depreciation and
financial charges) as a percentage of sales increased from 11% in 1984/85
to 21% in 1985/86. In 1985/86, ACC contributed PRa 110 million in the form
of cement development surcharge to SCCP, compared to PRs 38 million in
1984/85. At the end of the 1985/86 fiscal year, ACC's financial position
remained sound with a good profitability and liquidity position.
7.10      ACC's production is forecast to increase by about 87? from
628,000 tons In 1985/86 to 1178,000 tons in 1994/95, when the
rehabilitated Wah plant is expected to reach full production. ACC will
then be the largest cement manufacturing company in Pakistan, accounting
for 13% of the total production in the country. As a result of benefits
derived from the rehabilitation of Wah (para 7.02) operating profit is
expected to increase from 21% in 1985/86 to 44% by 1994/95.
7.11      ACC's sales are projected to increase about 12,5% annually over
the next nine years (Table 7.4). Beginning in 1991/92, when the new unit
comes onstream, sales revenues will increase rapidly and the company's
profitability will start to improve in the following year. In 1991/92
itself, profitability is expected to be low because of lower projected
capacity during the initial operations of the plant. However, the company
will remain able to service its projected obligations. In 1985/86, the
company's current ratio was 1.6 (excluding advances and deposits from
customers, which represent a claim on future production rather than a cash
liability; such advances amount to around eight weeks' sales, and are a
major source of financing for ACC's current assets.) At the end of
1985/86, the total net assets were PRs 359 million, and the debt:equity
ratio was 37:63. By the time the project reaches full capacity in 1994/95,
total net assets will be PRs 3,382 million, and the debt:equity ratio will
be 24:76. Throughout the period, the debt:equity ratio will be sound.

7,12      Even if the total value of ACC's sales were to drop by 10% as a
result of reduced cement prices, debt service coverage would drop below
1*5 times only during the first year of operations.  Also, it must be noted
that, although the financial projections assume that the production from
the wet process units will cease as soon as the dry process unit comes
onstream, Wah will, in fact, be able to run some of the old kilns
concurrently with the new unit until production from the new unit is
stabilized, In financial terms, this means that production losses during
the start-up period will be minimal, and that in all likelihood sales
revenues will be higher than forecast. Because of the sound financial
position, no additional covenants, e=cept those stated in para 7,16, will
be included in the Project Agreement (see para 7.17). Detailed financial
projectlons for ACC and SCCP are given in Annex 7-4.

3.  _R
7,13      The five plants under the 1MR Component (Gharlbwal, Javedan,
Maple Leaf, Mustehkam and Zeal Pak), have been profitable, operating at
about 9n-95% of capacity utilization, and the MBMR component will extend
their productive life and malntain profitability. A brief summary of the
historical and projected financial statements for the companies under the
BMR component can be found in Annex 7-5 , and more detailed statements are
found in the Project File (B?.3-B7.  These financial projections reflect
the benefits from the BMR components.
Do Financial Rate of Return
7.14      Details of the financial rate of return calculations for the Wah
rehabilitation project are presented In Annex 7-6. The base case pre-tax
IRR for Wah is 2M%. The net present value of the cash flow discounted at
14%, the assumed cost of capital in Pakistan, is PRs 381 million.
Sensitivity tests on key assumptions concerning cement prices, capital
costs and project implementation periods have been performed, and the
results are summarized in Table 7.5 below. The tests indicate that the
conversion subproject remains financially attractive under reasonable
variations from base case conditions. Break-even analysis indicates that
the project will break even at a capacity ucillzation of 59%.

E.  Financiai Covenants, Auditlng and RepLn  Aguirements
7e16      To ensure the maintenance ef a sound financial position, in
addition to the covenants relating to the financlng of the Project
(para 6.05), SCCP and its subsidiaries will: (i) maintain a current ratio
of not less than 1.3, and a debt:equity ratio not greater than 67:33; and
(Wi) not incur additional debt for further investments if to do so would
cause the long-term debt:equity ratio to exceed 67:33 and/or the projected
debt service coverage to fall below 1.5 timese
7,17      Audit of public sector accounts in Pakistan is performed at three
Aistinct levels:  first, continuous audit by the company's internal audit
denartment; second, year-end audits by statutory auditors; and third,
audits by the Auditor General's office. The internal control and
accounting systems employed by all project entities are sound, and provide
a satisfactory basis for management control and decision making. SCCP has
agreed to have: Mi) all project accounts and financial statements audited
by the subsidiaries' statutory auditors and submitted within six months of
the end of the Company's fiscal year; and (ii) quarterly project progress
reports and semiannual financlal statements submitted on a timely basis.
After completion of the Project, SCCP will prepare and furnish a
comprehensive report on the Project, Its implementation and Initial
operation, and the costs and benefits derived and expected to be derived
therefrom.
VIII,  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Assumptions Used
8.01      For the economic analysis, capital and operating costs used in
the financial projections have been adjusted by excluding taxes and
duties.  Power, which tcresents approximately 25% of the variable costs of
production in the rehabilitated Wah plant, has been shadow-priced by a
factor of 1.06 18/ from PRs 96 per ton of cement to PRa 102 per ton to
reflect its economic costs. All other costs have been adjusted in
accordance with factors shown in Annex 8. The output of the Project is
valued at a reference landed price for imported cement of US$49 per ton.
This is based on current FOB prices Mediterranean ports (Spain and Greece)
of around US$28/ton for bagged cement, and approximately US$15/tort freight
charges to Pakistan ports, plus port handling and insurance charges of
US$6/ton (PRa 100/ton), Sensitivity tests have been conducted assuming
that International FOB prices fall to a long-term low of US$15/ton for
bagged cement, which, with the same transport, handling and packing
charges, would give a reference landed price of TJS$36/ton. An additional
US$18.5 (PRs 315) has been added to these prices to take into account the
cost of inland transport by rail to the North,
18/ The shadow price of power has been calculated by consultants for the
Kalabagh Dam project, and is considered a reasonable estimate by the
Bank.

B. Economlc Rate of Return
8,02      The economic rate of return for the trah rehabilitation project is
estimated to be 28%. Sensitivity tests, as detailed in Annex S and
summarized In Table Ro1, have been carried out to assess the Impact of
deviatlons from base-case assumptions, including a 10% Increase in capital
costs and a fall in landed import prices to US$36/ton. In all cases, the
economic rate of return would remain above 24%. The net present value of
the cash flows discounted at 14%, the assumed cost of capital In Pakistan,
is PRs 1,043 million. The rates of return for the BMR component are much
higher (ranging from 33-86%) due to the short payback period.

C. Other Benefits
8,03      Tn addition to the foregoing quantifiable benefits, the chief
impact of the Project will be to Increase domestic supplies of cement,
mainly in north Pakistan, at low incremental cost; the incremental output
of the Project by.1,994/45 is estimated at n.5 million tons or 5% of
projected domestic demand In that year. Most of the increase will result
from the increase In capacity at the Wah plant, but smaller production
increases will be generated from existing capacity In the flve plants under
the BMR component. The Project will thus contribute to the development of
the Pakistan economy by reducing future shortages of a basic commodity, the
periodlc unavailability of which in the past has created severe bottlenecks
and disruptions to economic activity in user industries. The Project will
also create a marginal increase in employment among domestic equipment
manufacturers, which are expected to supply about 5-10% of the equipment
requirements for the Project, and in downstream industries, particularly in
the construction sector.
8,04      The Project will also play a role in Institution building through
the provision of outside technical assistance to strengthen SCCP's
expertise in implementation and operation of large-scale projects. The
Corporate Strategy will assist SCCP to respond efficiently to the new
market environment and emergence of the privat. sector.  The Human
Resources Development component would benefit the whole cement sector, by



- 47 -
providing facilities for training technical and operatlonal personnel from
both public and private sector plants. The creation of the Cement Research
Instltute will assist both manufacturers and c,nsumers of cement and the
constructlon industry by providing testlng on cementitious materials and by
drafting national standards for currently available types of cement and for
new cements when the need arises.
D. Major Risks
8,05      There are a number of risks which could affect the project, and
their likely impact is evaluated below:
8,06      Delays in Project Completion,  Inefficient civil works
contractors, inexperlenced project implementation teams and delays In the
supply of major equipment are factors that can lead to serious delays in
project completion and thus project viability. Constderable steps have
been taken under the current project to minimize the risk of such delays.
SCCP's project team comprises competent staff with recent experience in
design and execution of projects of up to 2,000 tpd capacity. SCCP has
also agreed to recruit a comretent and experienced consultant/engineer to
assist in the critical phases of project implementation.  Nelays in the
supply of imported equipment are unlikely because all foreign suppliers are
currently underbooked and can offer minimum delivery time. In connection
with the installation of new cement plants during the last few years, the
construction contractors in Pakistan have mechanized and have become more
efficient, and no unusual delays are expected in this area.
8.07      Power cuts have been a problem for all Industries in r3cent
years, largely because of periodic droughts. In spite of continuing
investments, power generation is expected to remain a problem in Pakistan
for the foreseeable future, Rowever, SCCP is alleviating the problem by
Installing captive generating capacity. Tlnder the proposed project,
500 kVA diesel generators will be installed at Vah and Zeal Pak, which
would enable crltlcal units to keep running and prevent equipment damage
from unexpected power cuts.
80S      Corporate Strategy.  A major purpose of the project is to
formulate a medium- to long-term Corporate Strategy for SCCP and to prepare
options for its development, so as to allow the Corporation to respond to
the development of the cement market in a comprehensive and economically
efficient fashion. The strategy exercise will generate business plans,
which will identify plant expansions, closures and efficiency improvements,
including rationalization of the labor force. The risk is that the
political difficulties of closing plants and reducing the labor force in
particular localities will prevent SCCP from implementing the necessary
changes. While these risks cannot be handled or reduced wichin the
project, the aim of the Corporate Strategy is to identify clearly the
economic cost of various options and therefore to demonstrate the cost to
the Corporation and to the economy at large of rot carrying out the
restructuring of SCCP* Moreover, It is intended that GOP participate
actively in the periodic review of the outcome of the various stages of the



- 48 -
Corporate Strategy exercise Including application and implementation of the
agreed atrategy. In addition, there exists a risk that SCCP would be
affected by ,-hanges by the Crvernment in the policy framework, whether
desirable or not. To deal t. th this risk, the Bank has obtained a
commitment from GOP that it will review the policy framework periodically
and maintain policles conducive to the efficlent development of the
subsector.

PAKISTAN - CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Nominal Protection, Effective Protection and Domestic Resource Cost
1.        Over the current decade, the Government of Pakistan has
increasingly moved away from quantitative restriction and towards the use
of tariffs as the foundation of its trade policy towards the cement
subsector. With the nationalization of cement plants in 1972, production
and internal and external trade in cement became a state monopoly,
organized and managed by SCCP. Between 1976, when Pakistan became a net
importer, and 1981, SCCP was the only importer, and the scale of imports,
whose cif price was well above the domestic cement price, was regulated
largely through the amount of foreign exchange made available to SCCP.
During this period, the tariff rate on imports was only 10%, and as Table 1
indicates, domestically produced cement, which alone is subject to excise
tax, was taxed at a far higher rate than imported cement; in 1980/81, the
"net tariff", i.e., customs duty less the excise tax, was PRs -416 (-47% of
cif price).

2,         In July 1981, the private sector was authorized to import,
under normal import licensing arrangements, as the shortage of cement
exceeded the Government's and SCC'"s capacity to allocate sufficient
foreign exchange for import. Sir.ce then, the tariff rate has gradually
increased; it was raised from 10% to 20% in January 1982 and to 25% in July
1982 when a 5% surcharge was also introduced. It was again raised to 40%
in January 1983, 55% in June 1983 and 70% in June 1984. The final increase
was made in May 1985, when the tariff rate was changed to a specific tariff
of PRs 550 per ton, to discourage underinvoicing, and the surcharge was
raised to 10% of the cif price. Over the same period, the net tariff also
increased significantly, not only because of the increase in the tariff
rate but also because of the decline in excise taxes (see Table 1). The
increase in the tariff rate was partly in response to rapidly declining

Page3
world cement prices brought about by excess supply of cement and the
practice of large exporters to sell at or close to variable cost wbile
their own domestic markets were protected by tariffs. In addition, the
tariffs were increased as part of the Government's proposals to reduce wide
disparities in the structure of protection between Industries and to
provide necessary financial incentives for private sector producers to
invest in the cement subsector. The level of tariffs set in May 1985 was
established to provide a reasonable rate of return for private sector
producers, in lieu of the cost-plus pricing and guaranteed rate of return
policy under which investment sanctions for privately owned cement plants
had been given.  In light of this, the Government has refused requests by
the new private producers to Increase protection further.
3e        The nominal rate of protection for the cement Industry in
Pakistan is shown for Karachi and Lahore in Table 2. The calculation is
made on the basis of an estimated long-term c&f import price of U8S43 per
ton, As Table I indicates, this price is somewhat higher than import
prices recorded in Government statistics in the 1985/86 fiscal year.
However, a number of factors have led to the conclusion that the observed
prices of about US$32 are too low as an estimate of the long-term reference
price for evaluating the competitiveness of local production. First, the
observed prices have been spot prices for small import volumes, which would
not be obtainable for large, longer-term contract amounts. Second, much of
the low-priced cement has been frov the TJSSR and East Europe, and has been
of lower quality, a feature that has been reflected by imported cement
belng sold in the Karachi market at discounts of PRs 40-60 per ton compared
to domestically produced cement. In addition, much of the cement from the
USSR and Eastern Europe has entered as part of barter trade agreements,
which makes price comparisons difficult, and Importers have indicated that
poor packaging of this cement (recycled paper that is glued rather than
stitched) has led to higher losses, as much as 10% compared to normal
losses of about 2%. Third, some cement has been imported in ships which
have been on their last voyage before being broken for steel scrap on
Gadani Beach near Karachi. As a result, real transport costs are believed
to have been understated.

4,        On the basis of these factors, discussions with importers in
Pakistan and the current and projected state of world cement prices, it has
been concluded that YIS$43 per ton can be considered a reasonable long-term
c&f import price of standard quality cement in Karachi port. This price
comprises an fob export price from the Mediterranean area (Spain and
Greece) of about 1JSS2R per ton of bagged cement, to which should be added
about USS15 per ton sea transeDort to Karachi. Further attempts to verify
this price projection during the project appraisal were rendered difficult
by the recent lack of imports. The decline in -etail prices in the Karachi
market coupled with the continuing devaluation of the rupee has meant that
imports have virtually ceased, with the exception of small amounts from
Eastern Europe. Discussions with a large firm that was previously a major
importer indicated that quotes of up to US$48 per ton cif Karachi had been
obtained over the last six months.
5.        Measured against a c&f price of US$43 per ton and a landed price
of US$49 per ton, the notional nominal rate of protection in the Karachi
market is 36%, and in Lahore 28%. In other words, at the reference import
price, local manufacturers would be able to fix an ex-factory price (net of
excise tax) of up to PRs 1,106 and PRs 1,331 per ton in Karachi and Lahore,
respectively, before losing their market to imports. In fact, because of
increasing competition in a market characterized by excess supply, local
manufacturers are unable to obtain the full benefit of the available
nominal protection. The actual Karachi price is only 14% above the
reference import price, and the Lahore price is 7% below.  With the current
ex-factory price (net of excise tax) of PRs 930 per ton in Karachi and
PRs 968 per ton In Lahore, c&f import prices would have to fall to US$34
per ton for imported cement to be competitive in the Karachi market, and to
US$24 to be competitive in the Lahore market (given cement duties and
excise taxes).
6.        Table 3 ptesents estimates of the effective protection for cement
production in the Karachi area. T'wo calculations are given. Case A, which
indicates positive effective protection of 40.7%, reflects the degree of
effective protection permitted to local producers by the nominal protective
structure and thus estimates the degree of protection that would be
available if domestic producers sold at an ex-factory price of PRs 1,106
per ton.  In fact, with the actual ex-factory price of PRa 930 per ton
(Case B), actual effective protection amounts to -3.1%, which means that
domestic value added has to be less than value added in a free trade
situation. Over the past year, effective protection has fallen because
domestic energy prices have not been reduced as much as international fuel
price, and thus the implicit tariff on fuel imports has increased
significantly (see footnote of Table 3).

falls very much in the lower range of effective protection In Pakistan.,
The most recent comprehensive study ol effective protection in Pakistan
(PIDE, 1980/81) calculated an effective protection rate of 60% for the
Industrial sector as a whole, and almost half had effective protection
rates above 80%. Although Government has introduced a number of general
and specific changes to Pakistan's incentive structure since then, it is



ANNEX 2-4
- 60 -                           Page 7
not considered that they materially affect the conclusion that Pakistan' s
cement industry is relatively under-protected. High protection in industry
in general has been Identified as a major constraint upon the efficient
development of Pakistan's industrial structure, and the Government is
expected to introduce over the next few years a phased program of tariff
reform to lower effective protection and to rationalize the structure of
protection in indtustryo Although the Government should continue to monitor
levels of anid chaniges in effective protection in the cement industry,
especially since it is sensitive to changes in fixed prices and import
prices of cement, the anialysis does indicate that there is no urgent need
for tariff reform in cement.
8.        In addition to demotnstrating the net impact of protection upon an
industry, the level of effective protection is also indicative of the
relative incentiveG for investment in the industry (the higher the level of
effective protection, the higher the incentive), and in addition it is
frequently used as a rough indicator of economic efficiency (the lower the
level of effective protection, the less scope for inefficiency). However,
the calculation of domestic resource cost (DRC) is a more accurate
indicator of the degree of efficiency. Tables 4 and 5 present DRC
calculations for Javedan and rehabilitated AC Wah plants. Javedan was
chosen to represent the average plant in Pakistan, and the calculation for
AC Wah is presented to demonstrate the potential for economically efficient
cement production in Pakistan, when plants of internationally proven scale
and technology are located correctly in relation to raw materials and the
market.
9.        As the tables show, cement production in Pakistan is, at current
costs, economically efficient both in the Karachi area and in the inland
areas, when compared with imports at a c&f value of US$43 per ton and a
landed price of US$49 per ton in Karachi. In order for the DRC for Javedan
to increase to unity, the landed price would need to decline by about 10%,
and thus the c&f price would have to fall to about US$38 per ton.

PAKISTAN - CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Projections of Cement Supply and Demand, 1985/86-1995/96
1.        Since the policy changes in the cement subsector introduced by
GOP in 1985, renewed attention has been given by cement producers and
financial organizations to the issues of the future growth and location of
demand for and supply of cement in Pakistan. The existence of regional
surpluses and deficits and their immediate impact in a free market upon the
sales price of cement producers have resulted in studies to determine the
period during which these surpluses and deficits can be expected to
persist. Furthermore, GOP established during 1986 a special committee to
assess market trends and to help rationalize future decisions by existing
producers and new investors concerning scale and location of new capacity.
2,        The two most significant studies conducted within Pakistan in the
past year or so, which were fed into the GOP committee, were conducted by
SCCP and NDFC. In addition to examining these studies during the
preparation and appraisal of the proposed Bank-financed project, the Bank
also prepared its own projections of supply and demand on a national and
regional basis. The purpose of this annex is to set out the details of the
assumptions and methodology underlying the Bank's projections and to
explain where the results differ significantly from those of the SCCP and
NDFC studiese
Forecast of Supply
3.        The Bank's forecast of production for the period 1985/86-1995/96
is based upon capacity figures which include only new plant or capacity
expansion that have already been sanctioned and have firm financing
arrangements. The forecast allows for possible delays in the completion of
new plants and also assumes the National Cement Company plants in Karachi
and Dandot will be phased out by 1988/89. The projections, which are
practically identical to those contained in the SCCP and NDFC studies,
indicate annual increases in capacity until 1991/92, at which time total
subsector cement capacity is expected to amount to 9.9 million tons.
Annex 3-1 supplies the plant-level details of annual clinker capacity 1/
for the period 1985/86-1995/96.
4.        The forecast of production has been based as much as possible on
past performance of plants. For existing plants, capacity utilization is
assumed to approximate past levels, but has been adjusted where necessary
to reflect rehabilitation investments. For new plants, production has been
assumed to increase from 65% of rated capacity in the first year of
operation to 75% in the second year, 90% in the third year and 100% in
subsequent years. For plants in the South, capacity utilization rates have
1/   Clinker capacity is converted into cement capacity by dividing by
0.95, to take account of the addition of gypsum to clinker in the
cement production process.

been set at lower rates than in the North in view of the cement surplus in
that area. The forecast also assumes that the entire production of the
Attock plant would be sold in the domestic market.2/
5.        The Bank's production forecast projects that production will
increase from 5.71 million tons in 1985/86 to 9.06 million tons in
1995/96. While the Bank projection compares closely with the projections
produced by SCCP and NDFC for the end of the period, the intermediate year
projections involve wider dispersion. This is because both NDFC and SCCP
projections assume faster production build-up than the Bank projections.
Forecast of Demand
6.        SCCP has forecast, based on housing statistics and historical
growth rates, that cement demand would grow at 6-7% per annum on an overall
country basis, varying from 4% in the Southern areas to 10% in Baluchistan
and Azad Kashmir. Similarly, using the relationship of demand with GNP and
time, the NDFC has forecast an overall growth rate of approximately 6.5%
per annum, with 5.5% for Sind, 6% for NWFP, 7% for Azad Kashmir, 16.6% for
Baluchistan and 6% for Punjab. The NDEC figures produce a higher absolute
level of demand than SCCP because the former adopt a larger initial
(1986/87) demand level. A Committee set up by the Government specifically
to assess the cement demand/supplrJ situation in the country has endorsed
the NDFC forecast.
7.        Less than two years have passed since GOP decontrolled cement
prices, and there is not yet sufficient experience of the market's behavior
in the new environment to suggest significant long-term changes in prices
or consumption patterns. Therefore, for its own projections of demand, the
Bank has relied on regression analysis to forecast cement demand. Since
historical data on consumption of cement by sector or in individual markets
are not available, demand projections using multiple regressions are not
likely to be reliable. Moreover, since cement demand is determined
primarily by the level of construction activities, which in turn are
closely related to the overall level of economic activity in the country,
the Bank has used value added in construction and GDP growth rates to
forecast cement demand.
8.        During the 1975/76-1980/81 period when imports were restricted,
there was considerable suppressed demand as evidenced by a jump in
consumption in 1981/82 following liberalization of imports. However,
consumption figures from 1981/82 onwards represent a reasonable
approximation of demand, as evidenced by the decreasing volume of imports.
In estimating the relationship between cement demand and construction value
added for the period 1975/76-1985/86, cement consumption during 1975/76 and
1981/82 onwards was taken as a proxy for cement demand. However, in
2/   The Attock cement plant (0.6 mtpy) was originally sanctioned by the
Government on the understanding that up to 70% of its production would
be exported; however, this is not feasible given the current world
cement market situationo

Page 3
1976/77, suppressed demand equal to 7% of the cement consumption in that
year was assumed, and unsuppressed demand was estimated at 3.38 million
tons, Projecting this figure at -n annual growth rate of 7% (the average
annual rate for 1974/75 to 1984/85) gives a demand figure of 4.74 million
tons for 1981/82, which is close to the actual consumption in that year.
The demand estimates adjusted for suppressed demand give a correlation
coefficient of 0.95 with construction value added. Estimates of elasticity
of construction value added with respect to GDP for the period
1975/76-1985/86 indicate that a 1% increase in GDP results in a 1.13%
increase in construction value added, Based on this relationship, a
5.8% D/ annual growth in GDP would result in a 6.5% growth rate in
construction value added. Annex 3-4 gives three estimates of projected
cement demand based on 5.5% andi 95% and 7.5% growth rates, respectively,
in construction value added*
9.        It is considered that the demand forecast based on 6.5% annual
growth in construction value added represents a reasonable estimate, and
this growth rate forms the basis for the demand forecast given in Table 3.4
of the main report. This table compares the Bank's, SCCP's and NDFC's
forecasts of domestic production and demand for cement for the
1985/86-1995/96 period. All three forecasts show that, over the next few
year, demand and local production would be close to balance, gradually
changing into a deficit situation from about 1992/93. The Bank forecast,
however, shows a deficit beginning in 1990/91.
Regional Supply and Demand Forecast
10,       While NDFC made forecasts of cement production and demand on the
basis of provincial boundaries, SCCP has made projections based on
division of the country into ten market areas. The NDFC projections show
that, while Sind and Baluchistan would have a surplus of cement up to
1993/94, Punjab and NWFP would have a deficit throughout the next ten
years. The SCCP projections, while generally similar to the NDFC forecast,
show a small surplus in some areas of the NWFP and a small deficit in the
northwestern part of Baluchistan.
11.       Since the natural markets of all plants are not necessarily iv
the province in which they are located,4/ demand/supply projections of
supply and demand according to political boundaries are likely to give a
distorted picture. The Bank has, therefore, prepared its own projections,
dividing the country into four zones, delineated according to the location
of the existing and upcoming plants and their expected markets (see
Annexes 3-3 and 3-5 for composition of each zone). Lack of regionally
disaggregated data on key economic variables (e.g., population growth,
contribution to GDP and construction value added) prevents the use of
variables other than time to forecast regional demand. The Bank has
3/   Bank's forecast for the medium term.
4/   For example, although the Attock cement plant is located in
Baluchistan, near its boundary with Sind, its main market is in Sind
rather than Baluchistan.

forecast cement demand for each of the four zones based on historical
regional consumption patterns and recent trends.5/ Historical data on
regional consumption were derived from SCCP's records of district-wise
dispatches of locally produced as well as imported cement. While precise
information on the dispatches of private imports is not available, it has
been assumed that, because of high transportation cost, most of the private
sector imports were consumed in the southern areas.
5/ The following growth rates have been used: Zone 1 - 5.5% p.a., Zone 2
- 6.5% p.a., Zone 3 - 7.0% p.a., Zone 4 - 4.5% p.a.

PAKISTAN - CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Terms of Reference for the Design, Development and Implementation of a
Corporate Strategy and Management Information System
at the State Cement Corporation of Pakistan
A. Introduction and Objectives
1.        The State Cement Corporation of Pakistan (SCCP) was formed in
1973 as a holding company to manage the cement subsector following the
nationalization of all the country's cement plants.  Today the Corporation
has under its control fourteen plants which produced in 1986 about
5.0 million tons of cement (about 85% of total subsector production). The
remaining 0.8 million tons were produced by four private sector plants that
have started production in the past two years following a change in
Government policy that encourages private investment in the subsector. In
the light of anticipated private sector competition and significant changes
in the policy environment in the past two years, the Corporation is now
taking a wide range of actions to improve its competitive position. These
actions include investment in modernization and rehabilitation of its
plants and the formulation of business strategies to meet its corporate
objectives.
2.        As a major component of these efforts to improve its competitive
position within the subsector, the SCCP now wishes to hire consultants to
assist it in the design, development and implementation of a Corporate
Strategy and a Management Information System (MIS) for its headquarters and
its constituent plants.
3.        The Corporation has established an overall work program and
timetable for the exercise which will be conducted under the overall
guidance of a Steering Committee and managed by a Task Force composed of
SCCP and units personnel* The overall exercise will comprise formulation
of a corporate strategy and business plans for the Corporation and its
plants and will include the implementation of detailed action plans and
programs for achieving the Corporation's objectives, as well as the design,
development and implementation of a MIS.
4.        The Corporation intends to recruit consultants to assist the SCCP
Steering Committee Task Force to carry out this overall work program. As
detailed below, the role of the consultants will be to assist SCCP to
produce a revised corporate strategy, and subsequently to assist SCCP in
the formulation and implementation of detailed development and business
plans for the Corporation and its plants, and to design a Management
Information System and to assist SCCP to develop and implement the MIS. In
the process of this exercise an important component of the Consultant's
assistance will be to assist SCCP in improving SCCP's capacity to carry out
Corporate Planning.

B. Scope and Content of the Work
5.        It is intended that the work required to meet the overall
objectives of the exercise will be carried out in three phases, in order
that the client is fully involved in the definition of the work to be done
and in the review of each stage, and that the development and
implementation stages can proceed as smoothly as possible.
1. Phase I: Corporate Strategy Formulation
6.        The scope and content of the wurk to be carried out by the
consultant during Phase I should be:
(a) to review the initial statement of Corporate Strategy prepared by
SCCP and the action plans already prepared by SCCP on various
areas of its operations, with a view to identifying areas and
issues requiring further detaileA examination for the preparation
of a comprehensive Corporate Strategy and development plans for
the Corporation and its plants and for the design of MIS;
(b) to analyse the current and prospective position of SCCP and its
plants within the cement subsector. The analysis should include
the following areas:
(i)  the constraints and opportunities afforded by the sector and
the policy environment;
(ii) the current and prospective markets for cement by area
(including export), producer, product (slag cement, OPC,
white cement, etc.), and type of end-user;
(iii) distribution networks and costs in various markets;
(iv) current and prospective business strategies and competitive
positions (sales, product ranges, market shares and cost
structures) of SCCP competitors;
(v)  evaluation, for SCCP plants and their competitors, of plant
technology, availability, dependability and quality of raw
materials, production processes and products, and analysis
of operating data with comparisons to international
standards;
(vi) the evaluation of current and future cost structures and
competitiveness of individual SCCP plants (and by product
for multi-product plants), including an analysis in relation
to international standards. The evaluation should, inter
alia, analyse cost structures in relation to capacity
utilization and break-even points, plants' efficiency in
terms of energy, labor and material usage, the importance of
financial charges and delivered costs;

the preparation of a revised statement of Corporate Strategy.
2. Phase II: Design of the MIS and Preparation of Corporate and
Plant Development Plans
7.        During the second phase, the scope and content of the work to be
carried out by the consultant should be in two directions: first, the
design of a MIS, and second, the elaboration of the Corporate strategy in
the form of detailed business development plans for the Corporation and its
plants.
8.        For the MIS component, the scope and content of the work to be
carried out by the consultant should be:
(a) to establish the Corporation's and its plants' requirements for
operational, cost, financial and other relevant information.
These requirements should be derived from the SCCP Corporate
Strategy and through interviews with MOP, EAC and SCCP Managers
at departmental, divisional and unit levels;
(b) to examine existing information and management systems to
establish their adequacy as a base for the MIS. The consultants
should examine, inter alia, systems relating to financial and
cost accounting, budgeting, pay roll, administration, sales and
marketing, inventory control, maintenance, planning and control
and manpowero The examination should also assess the current
state of SCCP's manpower resources available for the
implementation and operation of MIS, so as to permit an early
evaluation of the manpower and financing requirements of the MIS.

PAKISTAN - CE?ANT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Project Description: Wah Component
Project Summary
1.        The project comprises the conversion of the Wah plant located at
Wah, Punjab province, from wet to dry process* The five kilns currently in
production have a cllnker capacity of 435,000 tpy corresponding to
460,000 tpy of cement. The project will replace them with a new four-stage
preheater, precalciner kiln with a rated capacity of 3,000 tpd of clinker,
corresponding to 900,000 tpy of clinker and 945,000 tpy of cement. The
project will generate a 12% reduction in the total production cost per ton
of cement (from PRa 809 to PRt 714) and a 36% reduction in variable costs
per ton (from PRs 587 to PRs 377) (see Annex 7-2). The major factor
leading to reduced costs will be a 57% reduction in fuel costs per ton
(from 1,950 kcal/kg to 840 kcal/kg), although some reductions in per-ton
cost of labor, raw materials and maintenance are also expected.
Options Considered
2*        The current kilns range from 14 to 64 years of age and the four
oldest kilns are very small (300 tpd and below) and beyond ,ehabilitation.
Conversion of kiln #5 (600 tpd) to either semi-wet or to dry operation was
considered and rejected, and three options for a major rehabilitation, all
based on dry process precalciner technology and of differing size
(2,000 tpd, 2,600 ptd and 3,000 tpd) were examined. The 3,000 tpd option
was chosen because of Its higher economic rate of return.
Equipment Requirements
3.        Because of their age and obsolete design, it was decided not to
make use of the old equipment. As a result, project layout is highly
efficient as no compromises had to be made for the sake of utilizing old
units. The main process areas such as rawmill, kiln, clinker cooler,
cement mill .nd cement storage, package and dispatch departments will be
located, according to a modern compact and energy-efficient design, in an
area directly adjacent to the existing plant.
4.        New equlpment comprises:  impact crusher for limestone and clay,
rawmlll, kiln, clinker cooler, cement mill, cement storage, packaging and
dispatch.
5.        Exlsting equipment used or modified:  quarries, gypsum crusher,
auxiliary buildings, offices and infrastructure.
6.        Eguipment to be abandoned:  existing rawmills, kilnas and clinker
coolers, cement mills and packing plant.



_ 90 -                          ANNEX 5-1
Page 2
7.        The new plant adopts advanced technology including c'mputerized
control equipment, but will also allow optional manual control.
Coi'truction and erection will take place with minimum disturbances to the
existing plant.
Raw Materials
8.        Limestone.  Deposits are located 0.5 km southwest of the plant.
Preliminary estimates of reserves indicate approximately 70 million tons,
corresponding to 50 years of consumption at the proposed project capacity,
and these reserves are being verified. The deposit consists of a gently
sloping mountain, and mining is carried out in four benches, each 12-!5 m
high. Chemical composition is uniform, except for occasional pockets of
clay (which comprise the second raw mix component), and is ideal for dry
process operation.
9°        Clay.  The clay deposit is adjacent to the plant.  The present
deposit will be exhausted within a few years, but the plant has acquired
450 acres of land adjacent to the present deposit with reserves of
60 million tons, corresponding to 180 years of consumption. The clay (both
present and future deposit) is of a favorable chemical composition.
Other Materials
10.       Gygsumo  Gypsum will be procured through contractors brought by
truck from surrounding areas.  It will be stored in an open storage yard.
One of the existing crushers will be used for crushing gypsum.
iI.       Fuel Oilo  Fuel oil, refined from domestic oil with a low sulphur
content, is trucked in from government-owned oil distribution facilities.
Infrastructure
12.       Electric Power.  Power is supplied by the government-owned
utility company, WAPDA, at 66,000 volts. Modern receiving equipment will
be installed to permit receipt of 132,000 volts, Under the project, power
demand will increase from 8 MW to 20 MW. WAPDA has agreed to the higher
demand, but it is expected that, as in the past, the plant will. continue to
suffer occasional power cuts. A 500 kVA diesel generator will be installed
as part of the project to provide power to the most critical operating
units during power cuts.
13.       Roads,  The plant is located 2 km from the main highway north to
the Khunjerab Pass and China. The plant road is presently of poor quality,
but is to be widened and resurfaced.
14.       Rail.  The plant spur connects with the main railroad line within
a distance of 1 km.
15.       Water,  Water is pumped in from plant wells, and no supply
problemis are encountered. Total water consumption will be reduced because
of the conversion to dry process.

Environmental
17.       The plant and equipment will be designed to reduce particulate
emissions to less than 150 mg/Nm3, which is in line with international
standards. The plant will have io emissions of liquid or poisonous
wastes. The plant will easily comply *ith the Government's future
standards to be implemented by 1990.
Project Management
18.       The project will be executed by a SCCP project team acting as
general contractor with an experienced foreign consultant to assist in the
following areas:
(a)  process selection and layout based on completed conceptual
engineering;
(bW  drafting of tender documents and technical specifications;
(c)  evaluation of tenders;
(d)  monitoring of implementation and preparation of progress reports.
19.       Procurement for Bank-financed equipment packages and hiring of
consultants will be done under Bank guidelines. The equipment has been
grouped in packages according to process areas; each package includes
supervision of erection, performance warranty and commissioning
responsibility. Civil works and erection/installation will be contracted
with experienced local contractors.
Implementation
20.       As shown in Annex 5-3, the project is expected to be completed in
36 months from the date of signing the major equipment order (scheduled for
July 1988). Commissioning will take place in July 1991. Because of the



- 92 -                          ANNEX 5-1
Page 4
easy access to the site, availability of infrastructure and
non-interference with the existing plant, the implementation should be
accomplished within the indicated time.
Training and Commilssioning
21.       SCCP plans to train future operating personnel partly through
courses in SCCP's two training institutes and partly by sending selected
personnel either overseas or to other SCCP dry process plants for
training. Experienced operating personnel from SCCP's other dry process
plants will assist during start-up and the initial operations period.

PAKISTAN - CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
BMR CoEponent
1.        This project comprises small- to medium-sized rehabilitation in
five cement plants belonging to the following SCCP subsidiary companies:
Gharibwal, Maple Leaf, Mustehkam, Zeal Pak and Javedan. These plants,
ranging in age from 22 to 30 years, were built as wet process plants, and
two, Mustehkam and Javedan plants, were expanded in the early 1980s by the
addition of a 1,000 tpd dry process preheater kiln to each. Number of
kilne, their age and capacity for the plants are shown in Annex 2-2.
2.        Because of age the equipment in these plants require a high
degree of maintenance. In many cases spare parts for the old units are not
available and the plants are forced to fabricate the parts themselves.
Prior to the appraisal SCCP's subsidiary companies had identified a large
number of subprojects for the BMR components. During appraisal it was
decided to narrow the scope to the 22 subp:ojects in the five above-listed
plants. Approximately 28% of the estimated cost will be spent on
environmental control improvements and 13% on replacement of parts in
critical condition which, in case of failure, would render large important
process units inoperable. The remaining subprojects will improve energy
efficiency through introduction of modern technology and utilization rates
through the elimination of bottlenecks. Although plant capacities remain
the same higher production will be attained because of these projects.
3.        Raw Material Reserves and Infrastructure.  All the plants have
ample raw material reserves. In the case of Zeal Pak the present clay
reserves will be exhausted in a few years, but the company has identified
new reserves, which will be acquired after proper sampling and
verification. The chemical composition of the limestone reserves belonging
to the northern plants (Mustehkam, Gharibwal and Maple Leaf) is favorable,
while the cheiaical composition of the limestone in the South tends to cause
problems with kiln operation. All five plants have good access to road and
rail infrastructurz.
4.        The below tabulation lists the subprojects by plant.

Project Manxgement
The subprojects will be executed by a local project team in each
plant. These project teams will report to corporate project management in
Lahore. Procurement will be done by the corporate project team. The
equipment requirements have been arra,jed in 12 generic machinery groups
(Annex 6-3) which will be procured under the Bank's ICB guidelines. Civil
works and erection services will be contracted with third parties.
IMlementation
6.        Annexes 5-4 to 5-8 show the implementation schedules for the
individual plants. Because of the relative small size of these projects
implementation time from signing of contract to commissioning will be
36 months.
Cost/Benefit Analysis
7.        The following subprojects were subject to detailed cost/benefit
analysis.

PAKISTAN - CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Main Assumgtions Used in the Financial Analysis
1.        The main assumptions used in financial projections and rate of
return calculations for ACC and SCCP are listed below, The assumptions
used for the plants under component B can be found in project files,
2.        The financial analysis has been carried out in two parts:
(a)  The incremental pre-tax financial rate of return of the Wah
conversion subproject has been determined by developing
differential "with" and "without" cost-benefit streams; and
(b)  the projection of financial performances of ACC and SCCP with the
proposed conversion investments taking place.
3,        The main assumptions in the incremental analysis of Wah are:
(a)  All projections have been carried out in constant 1986/87 terms
through 2005/06;
(b)  Production build-up af.er conversion has been estimated at 65% of
capacity in the first year, 75% in the second year, 90% in the
third year and 100% from the fourth year onward;
Cc)  No funds for minor rehabilitation are invested under the "without
project" case for Wah. Under this scenario, production is
assumed to decline by 5% per annum from 1987/88 onward and stop
when the breakeven point is reached in 1998/99;
(d)  The price of OPC is taken at PRs 956/ton, the current market
price of cement in the North. This price has been held constant
throughout the period;
(e)  Production costs are developed from detailed evaluation of
material, labor, fuel, power, stores and overhead costs provided
by the plant for its existing kilns and proposed new facilities
(see Annex 7-2)o Prices for raw materials, utilities, etc., are
held constant throughout the period; and
(f)  Other basic assumptions used in the incremental analysis
calculations are as follows:
Construction Period: 4 years
Life of the Project: 15 years
Working Capital    : fully recovered at end of project life
Scrap Value         : 10% of initial value of fixed
assete in 1987 terms

Page 2
4.        The main assumptions in the financial projections of ACC and SCCP
are:
(a)  Projections are carried out in the "with" Project case in ,urrent
terms through 1994/95 when the project is expected to have
attained steady state operations;
(b) Inflat:ion assumptions are based on the following parameters:
Percent Annual Increase
FY87   FY88   FY89   FY90   FY91  FY92-95
Foreign Goods &
Services                7.3    2.0    1.0    1.0    2.2    3.5
Local Goods & Services   5.5   10.0    8X0    7.0    5.0    3e5
(c)  Interest on new long-term debt has been taken as follows:
Foreign Currency Portion of IBRD Loan          -  14.0%
Other Loans                                    -  14.0%
Repayment of loans in maximum of 14 semi-annual installments
starting no more than one year after plant commissioning;
I
(d) No asset revaluation has been assumed to take place.
5.        The particular assumptions by plant and company are summarized
below:
Main Aesumptions - Wah Plant
Existinig  Converted
(1986/87)   (1994/95_)
Clinker Capacity (tpd)                 1,418      3,000
Cement Production OPC (tpd)            1,500       3,175

Power Consumption/ton of cement          110         120
6.        Working Capital assumptions are summarized below and detailed in
the Project Fileso
ACC - Plants
Accounts Receivable          -  5% of sales
Raw Materials                -  3% of variable cost
Stores & Spares              -  28% of variable cost
Work in Process              -  3% of variable cost
Finished Product             -  2% of variable cost
Accounts Payable             -  0.1% of variable cost
Deposits                     -  10% of sales
Other Current Liabilities   -  41% of variable cost

Financial Performance of Plants Under Component B (BMR)
1.        This annex provides a brief description of the five plants
(Gharibwal, Javedan, Maple Leaf, Mustehkam and Zeal Pak) under the above
component, and their past and projected financial performance.
A. Gharibwal
2.        This factory is located in Jhelum district and was set up in 1965
by the Ismail A. Shiek family. The initial installed capacity of the
factory was 360,000 tpy, which was further expanded by 180,000 tons in 1969
to bring the total installed capacity to 540,000 tpy. After takeover by
GOP in 1972, the name was changed from "Ismail Cement" to "Gharibwal
Cement". Currently it is a public limited company with an authorized
c6pital of PRs 150 million and paid-up capital of PRs 34.5 millione After
takeover in 1972, urgently needed mechanical repairs/replacements were
undertaken, with the result that capacity utilization improved from 51% in
1972/73 to over 100% in 1983/84.

3.        Company profits decreased in 1982/83 becasue of increased fuel
costs brought about by conversion of the kiln from gas to oil firing.
However, over the last two years profits before tax and deduction of the
cement development fund have increased substantially, largely as a result
of increased cement prices following price decontrol, The company has a
sound capital structure.

4.        As a result of the BMR program (Annex 5-2), Gharibwal will be
able to maintain its level of capacity utilization and increase its
profitability.  The company's projected cash flows are adequate to meet its
debt obligations.
B. Javedan
5.        This plant was established in Karachi in 1964 by the Valika
Group. It was renamed "Javedan Cement" after its takeover by GOP in 1972.
Initial installed capacity was 300,000 tpy, and it was expanded by another
300,000 tpy in 1980. It is a public limited company with an authorized
capital of PRs 150 million and paid up capital of PRs 88 million.

the expansion carried out in 1980, the company's financial performance was
weak between 1981/82 and 1983/84. However, increased prices and improved
capacity utilization over the last two years have significantly improved
the company's financial performance.

9.        The original kilns were coal-fired, but because of unsatisfactory
performance they were converted to gas in the 1970s. Company profits
declined sharply after 19F1/82 because of increased fuel costs brought
about by the change from gas to oil firing. However, higher cement prices
have resulted in improved company profitability during the past two years.
The company financial performance is good with no outstanding long term
debt.
