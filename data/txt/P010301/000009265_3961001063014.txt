MEMORANDM WAND RECOMENDATION 0F THM PRESIDENT
OF THE INVERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND rEVELOPUNT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLENTA  LOAN TO
THE ISLAXIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
supplemental loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for US$56.4 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed supplemental loan would
be for 17 years, including a two-year grace period, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. The Government of Pakistan (GOP) will relend the
proceeds of the loan to the State Cement Corporation of Pakistan (SCCP) at an
annual interest rate of 152 (including administrative charges and foreign
exchange and interest rate risk premiums) with a maturity of 10 years,
including a three-year grace period which has been determined taking into
account the revised implementation schedule for the Project. (The original
re-lending terms provided for a four-year grace period, a maturlty of 11
years and a 141 annual reate of interest.) The foreign exchange and the
interest rate risk for the supplemental loan, as in the case of the original
loan. would be borne by GOP.
Proiect DescriUtion
2.        A US$96 million loan (Loan 2884-PAK) to the Republic of Pakistan
for the Cement Industry Modernization Project was approved in November 1987.
It was designed to encourage further rationalization of the cement industry
by assisting SCCP, the major producer within the industry, to improve
operating and marketing efficiency. The Project includes five components:
(i) conversion of SCCP's cement plant at Wah from wet to dry process
operation; (ii) selective rohabilitation of five of SCCP's wet process
plants, including installation of pollution control equipment; (iii)
development of a Corporate Strategy and associated Management Information
System for SCCP; (iv) formulation of a Human Resource Development Program,
including redesign of existing training facilities; and (v) establishment of
a Cement Research Institute (CRI).
Pro1ec-, 1glem2=tion
3.        The Project is being implemented by SCCP. For Wah, the largest
project component, SCCP has selected, in consultation with the Bank,
experienced international consultants to assist them in the implementation
of that component. However, procurement has taken longer than planned,
primarily because of delays in obtainLng responsive bids and also in
exploring for alternative sources of funding to meet cost overruns. Changes
in SCCP's top management also added to the del4y. The revised estimated
completion date for the Wah component is September 1993, about 20 months
behind the original schedule. Ninety-five percent, in terms of value, of
supply contracts have been awarded; site preparation is completed; and SCCP
is ln the process of awarding contracts for civil worke and equipment
erection.
4.        SCCP is implementing the BMR (balancing, modernization and
replacement) component of the Project on its own, while making use of the



-2-
experience gained from the Wah component. Eighty percent of the procurement
has been completed and the BHR component vill be completed by June 1993.
S.        During the reappraisal of the Project In March 1991, the Bank was
informed by SCCP that the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has decided to include
SCCP among the public sector enterprises to be privatixed under the GOP's
recently announced privatization program. The preliminary plan calls for all
of SCCP's units to be privatized in about two to three years, with the first
two (which are not part of the Bank-financed Project) to be tendered for
offer within two months. The precise timing and phasing of the privatization
of SCCP units is yet to be worked out. Meanwhile, as the execution of the
Wah and BMR components of the Project is far advanced, SCCP has decided, in
consultation with the Bank, to complete their rehabilitation and
modernization by September 1993 and privatize them subsequently. The
investments on these components are economically attractive and will enhance
the value of the units; the cost of cancelling them (e.g., penalties on
contracts already signed) at this stage is high. The proposed supplemental
loan would help carry out these major components of the Project according to
the revised schedule.
6.        Three small components of the Project include the Corporate
Strategy and Management Information System (CS/MIS) Component, the Human
Resource Development (HRD) Component, and the Cement Research Institute (CRI)
Component. For the Corporate Strategy and MIS Component, consultant report
(based on Phase I work) has been received, and preparation of the tender
documents have been prepared for the HID and CRI copetUnts. However, it
has been agreed with the Government that further coomitment of the remaining
Bank funds (US$6 million out of the original allocation of about US$8.1
million) for the small components would be hold in abeyance until a clearer
view of the overall schedule and impact of the proposed privatization on SCCP
emerges. By August 1991, SCCP and the Government would decide, in
consultation with the Bank, whether to proceed with CS/MIS, HRD and CRI
components or redesign or cancel them. A bank mission will visit Pakistan to
review the situation in August 1991 and help 8CCP and the Government in
taking a final decision on the above-mentioned components. Meanwhile, the
loan funds originally provided for the completion of these components will
remain intact until the final decision is made.
Poject Costs and FaeiMS&
7.       The total cost of the Project was estimated at appraisal to be
US$164.4 million equivalent, of which US$105.6 million was the foreign
exchange component. However, the total financing required for the Project
has increased by about 45 percent to US$238.8 million. The cost increase has
been mostly in foreign exchange and partly in local costs. The main causes
for the cost increases have been: (i) depreciation of the US dollar against
the currencies of the major supplier countries, Denmark and Germany; (ii)
deprecLation of the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar; (UiL) real price
lncreases for cement equipment resulting from higher than expected demand in
the international cemnt plant equipment market; and (iv) a 20-month delay
in project implementation due to reasons mentioned in para 3. The original
and revised cost estimates by coponents are set out in TIble I below:

9.       As indicated in the table, SCCP/GOP would bear the full local
costs of the Project, which has increased by about 15 percent in terms of
US dollars. To finance the sharp increase (about 62 percent) in the
foreign exchange costs, the Bank's loan for the Project would rise to
US$152.4 million, covering the foreign exchange costs of the Project
(excluding interest during construction and incremental working capital, as
in the case of the original financing plan). As a percentage of the total
financing required for the Project, the Bank loan would now cover nearly 64
percent (compared to 58 percent estimated at appraisal).
&AocX  n  and Diaburlen
10.      Bank guidelines are being followed in the procurement of all
Bank-financed items (goods and consulting services). Bank financing is
limited to foreign exchange costs. International competitive bidding
procedures are being used for all Bank-financed equipment packages.
11.      Ten of 13 Bank-financed equipment packages for the Wah and BHR
components (corresponding to more than 90 percent of Bank financing) have
advanced to bid evaluation and contract signature. Most of the contract
amounts are denominated in European currencies which have appreciated
sharply against the US dollar since appraisal. On the basis of quoted
prices for packages already evaluated and of estimates for the remaining
packages, total requirements for Bank-financed components are now estimated
at US$152.4 million, representing a cost overrun of US$56.4 million.
12.      The proceeds of both the original and supplemental loans would be
disbursed against 100 percent of foreign expenditures on equipment and
consultant services. The revised Loan Closing Date would be June 30, 1994,
24 months later than the original date of June 30, 1992. The revised
amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and the revised
disbursement schedule are shown in Sch dul.A



13.      The Government ha" reamoved statutory price controls on cemnt.
However, the pub4lc sector company, 8CCP, which is the market leader
accounting for narly 70 percent of the market share, consults wlth the
Governmnt and provides justifLcation for any proposed price increase. The
latest audited financial statements for th loan benoficiary companies
available for FM9O (year ond    June 30, 1990) show that 8CCP was in
compliance with all financial covenants. Its six subsidiary companies were
in compliance with the debt/equity eovenant (67/33). However, their
current ratios were below the agreed level of 1.3:1 in mO. The revised
estimate of financial statements shows that the finacial position of all
companies would improve and they would be able to reach the agreed
financial covenants in MT92, with the proposed price increase of PRs 40
(US$2)/ton of cement and the proposed injection of PRs 165 million (US$ 8
million equivalent) to ACC (Associated Cement Company, one of the
subsidiary companies of SCCP) from the Cement Development Fund of SCCP
which currently has about PRs 1.5 billion (US$68 million) to finance the
cement projects under implementation. The proposed price increase and
Vapital injection with effect from July 1, 1991 would be a condition of
effectiveness for the Supplemental Loan.
14.      As explained in para. 7, cost increases have been caused
significantly by factors beyond the control of SCCP. When it became
obvious that the original Bark loan of US$96 million would provide
inadequate coverage for all items identified for Bank financing, SCCP
attempted unsuccessfully to obtain supplier's credits to supplement Bsank
financing for one of the major equipment packages. However, the national
credit underwrlting agency in the supplier's country declined to underwrite
the credit. Similarly, attem ts to obtain cofinancing on soft terms from
official aid agencies have failed. Subsequently, SCCP reviewed the
potential for obtaining cost savings through reduction in scope of the
project components and concluded that the design and procurement activities
had advanced so far that the integrity of the Project would suffer if some
parts were to be eliminated or substantially reduced. The original loan is
expected to be fully used by mid-1992. Without prompt availability of
additional foreign exchange, project implementation would be adversely
affected.
15.      The Project is entering a critical phase in terms of activity
scheduling, when financial payments to supply contractors must be
maintained in order to avoid penalties as well as delays in equlpment
delivery. It is against this background that GOP has requested additional
financing from the Bank. Further, Pakistan has been adversely affected by
oil price increases following the Persian Gulf crisis in August 1990.
During the past few months, increased pressure has been exerted on
Pakistan's foreign excharge reserves, which recently fell to a level
equivalent to less than two weeks' imports. For 1991, the negative foreign
exchange impact due to the Gulf crisis is tentatively estimated at about



U8S$450 million. Given this deterioration in the externl account combined
with tho fact that currencies of tho countries from which major equipment
packages for the Projoct are bling procured have appreciated against the
dollar, spelal ssistanc  In the form of thi proposed supplemntal loan
would be justifiod. The loan would respond to the current resource
constraints Pakistan to faclg and safeguard the timly completion of the
Project which is critical for expanding supply of cemnt for the
development of the building Industry in Pakistan.
16.      Revised estimtes of the oconmndc rate of return (SUK) of the
Project indicate that the Project rmins viable. UR for Wah, the major
component, Is now estimted at 32 percent (comaed to 28 percent estiated
at appraisal), and for the B1iR sub-projects, Ras are estimated to range
between 18 and 45 percent (compared to 33 to 86 percent at apprasal). In
spite of capital cost licreaes and project delays, the revised IRis for
Wah and some Blll sub-projects are higher than the appraisal estlmate mainly
becase of real increases In the world oil prices which are used to value
nergy savings expected as a result of the Project. The revised finacial
rate of return for the Wah Component is 15 percent and for the Bl
conet subprojects, it ranges from 15 to 29 percent.
17        Two special conditions of effectivenss of the proposed
Suppleental Loan would be: (1) price increase of PRs 40 (US$2)/ton to
cment companie and capital injection of PRs 165 million (US$8 million
equivlent) to Associated Cment Company by July 1, 1991; and (11) the
amendment of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement related to the existing loan
(between the Goverment and SCCP), and amendment of the Sub-Loan Agreements
(betwn  SCCP and the individual beneficiary companies) in a manner
atisfactory to the Bank, to reflect appropriate onleading arraents for
the Supplemental Loa.
18.      I am satisfied that the proposed Supplemental Loan would couply
with the Articles of Agrement of the Bank. I recomend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Supplemental Loan.
