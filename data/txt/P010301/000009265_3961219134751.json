The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            uncertain at this time, and the performance of both the Bank\n            and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, since significant\n            implementation delays are more likely to be incurred for\n            projects in the public sector, more weight should have been\n            given in the SAR to the Bank's disbursement profile for\n            the country. Second, continuity within the implementing\n            agency is extremely important. Third, cumbersome channels\n            for reporting and approval and lack of delegation caused\n            significant delays in implementation. Fourth, procurement\n            was very time consuming. The standardization of bidding\n            documents, which has since been implemented in the Bank, is\n            a major step towards streamlining the procurement process.\n            It would have reduced the implementation time of the project\n            considerably. Finally, the sharp focus and detailed analysis\n            on the cement sub-sector during project preparation most\n            likely induced GOP to decide on an early privatization of\n            the cement sub-sector."}, "docdt": "1996-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
