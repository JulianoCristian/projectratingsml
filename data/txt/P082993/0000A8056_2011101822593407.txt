                         The development objective of this project is that China will implement polices and measures to identify and demonstrate environmentally-sound and cost-
                         effective policies, procedures and techniques for safely managing and disposing of China's unique temporarily stored PCBs and associated PCB-contaminated
                         wastes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In December 2010, the project closing date was extended for 12 months. In addition, the grant categories were reallocated, and the implementation plan and results targets were
                         modified. At the time, the project seemed to have overcome key implementation problems,and after initial delays, the two GEF grant withdrawal conditions were met, the trial burn for
                         the Shenyang incinerator completed showing successful results, and preparations for the Thermal Desorption Unit's (TDU) proof of performance (POP) test being finalized. In

                         addition, clean-up of three sites was completed, and preparation of the clean-up plans for two more sites was underway.

                         Despite these achievements, implementation progress since December 2010 has been slower than expected, mainly due to unsuccessful TDU POP test which prevents immediate
                         treatment of low-contaminated PCB waste. The Recipient and Supplier are closely coordinating problem diagnostics work and preparing for a repeated POP test. Once this is
                         successfully completed, the TDU will be able to treat the soil obtained from six more sites, clean-up plans for which are currently being finalized. Incineration of the first batch of
                         highly-contaminated PCB waste obtained from the three first sites is expected to take place in October 2011.
