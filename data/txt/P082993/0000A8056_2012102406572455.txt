                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After project extension and restructuring in December 2012, good progress has continued and the project is on the way to achieve most of its development and global environment
                         objectives. Many of the project activities are either completed or in the final stages of implementation. Clean-up of most of the confirmed PCB contaminated sites has been
                         completed, ongoing or will start shortly with the expected completion before the end of December 2012. The Thermal Desorption Unit (TDU) operation capacity has increased and
