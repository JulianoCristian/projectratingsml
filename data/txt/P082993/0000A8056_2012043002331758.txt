                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project closing date was extended in December 2011 until December 2012 to account for initial project implementation delays and changes in the actual circumstances identified
                         during project implementation. Good progress has continued since project extension with clean-up completed in six PCB contaminated sites, ongoing in two sites, and preparation
                         work being finalized in a number of additional sites. The Thermal Desorption Unit (TDU) operating capacity is gradually improving and it is expected that the final proof-of-
