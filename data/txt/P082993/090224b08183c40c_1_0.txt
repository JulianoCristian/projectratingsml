                         The development objective of this project is that China will implement polices and measures to identify and demonstrate environmentally-sound and cost-effective
                         policies, procedures and techniques for safely managing and disposing of China's unique temporarily stored PCBs and associated PCB-contaminated wastes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project progress has continued since October when the previous ISR was filed. The project has largely achieved its Development and Global Environment Objectives. Lessons from
                         Zhejiang Province demonstration of the environmentally-safe policies and methods of PCBmanagement and disposal are being documented and disseminated, and being used to
                         refine PCB management regulations and program. Project's lessons have informed Ministry's of Environment Protection (MEP)-approved 12th 5-year POPs (Persistent Organic

                         Pollutants) management plan. Project results and experience have also been shared during the Technical Coordination Group meeting with local and international audience and two
                         national workshops attended by local Environmental Protection Departments (EPDs).All sites in Zhejiang province that have been identified and were technically possible will be
                         cleaned-up as part of the project. In addition, scale-up activities using project experience have been carried out in 12 other provinces. Thus, the project has contributed to the
                         elimination of PCB waste in compliance with the Stockholm Convention and also set a sound basis for scaling-up PCB management in the rest of China.
