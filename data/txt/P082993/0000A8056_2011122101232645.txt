                         The development objective of this project is that China will implement polices and measures to identify and demonstrate environmentally-sound and cost-
                         effective policies, procedures and techniques for safely managing and disposing of China's unique temporarily stored PCBs and associated PCB-contaminated
                         wastes.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As described in the previous ISR, the project has experienced implementation delays since December 2010 due to (a) the Thermal Desorption Unit's (TDU) unsuccessful proof of
                         performance test which has prevented treatment of low-contaminated PCB waste, and (b) slower than expected preparation of the PCB burial sites clean-up plans. Good progress
                         has been achieved in the past two months and the latest TDU performance test shows considerable improvements that are close to the performance standards agreed in the TDU

                         contract. Three PCB sites have been cleaned-up, an additional three are currently being cleaned-up, and two more expected to start in December 2011. Incineration of the first batch
                         of highly-contaminated PCB waste obtained from the three first sites was completed in November 2011.
