               Notes:
                  1) Considering much preparation work for the cleaning up of sites #32, #36, and #46 has been done by Hangzhou Dadi
                     Environment Co., and their clean-up plans have been approved by provincial expert panel, Dadi company is suggested to
                     complete the cleanup of above sites by direct contracting. Dadi is also directly contracted for the service for TDU
                     operation since it is the only company who received an official approval by the Ministry of Environmental Protection
                     (MEP) for operating a TDU in China.
                  2) Shenyang Hazardous Waste Disposal Technical Center would be directly contracted to carry out the services since it
                     possesses the facility for final disposal of PCB wastes, which would be the only facility of this kind available in China in
                     the foreseeable future and licensed by SEPA for final PCB disposal.
