The principal\n            lessons learned apply at three different levels: a) at the\n            central level, the fact that the regulatory and\n            environmental frameworks were correct from the beginning,\n            was crucial for the success of the project. The autonomy of\n            the implementing agency also helped enormously to preserve\n            the project, both from the turmoil affecting the rest of the\n            energy sector, and from political pressure resulting from\n            induced redistribution of the rent extracted from the\n            natural resources; b) at the local level, the fact that\n            villagers, legally, were given an opportunity to become\n            owners of their natural resources, and to earn money as\n            well, showed to have far reaching impact: from\n            \"subjects\" they became \"individuals\" and\n            moreover, \"organized individuals\", mostly, that\n            environmental degradation could be halted; and, c) the\n            capacity to combine the environmental agency - AEDE - formal\n            autonomy, with active participation on the ground of both\n            villagers, and local Forestry Inspection Offices teams,\n            ensured a high level of ownership by stakeholders. Looking\n            at the future, the results to date are very promising. The\n            model developed in this project demonstrably delivers\n            results, but its full impact can only be achieved if it is\n            scaled-up considerably."}, "docdt": "2004-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
