aims to\n            provide an economic and sustainable supply of energy for\n            households in Chad. The project comprises four components\n            that will be implemented over four years: 1) establishing\n            village-based natural resources management--this component\n            builds the capacity to design simple long-term village\n            land-use and wood exploitation plans for villages in the\n            N'Djamena wood fuel catchment area by funding the\n            technical assistance for nongovernmental organizations,\n            forestry agents, and villagers to develop a master plan and\n            thereafter manage and control fuelwood use; 2) building the\n            capacity of the Agency for Household Energy and Environment\n            to monitor and control wood product flow through charging\n            collecting user fees/taxes; 3) improving the efficiency of\n            household fuel use by commercializing efficient cooking\n            stoves (firewood, charcoal); and promoting the use of\n            low-cost kerosene and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) stoves with\n            publicity and NGO-sponsored promotional activities as well\n            as testing, product development, and monitoring of stove\n            performance; and 4) capacity building and training as a part\n            of project management."}, "docdt": "1998-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
