        Governance Grant (ERGG) Project for Togo were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: close\n            coordination with other development partners, both with\n            regard to substance of the program and timing, has been\n            indispensable to mitigate risks and improve the leverage in\n            the policy dialogue. It also provided some scope for\n            dividing responsibilities according to the main strengths of\n            each partner. Coordination between the ERGG, the\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) Poverty Reduction and\n            Growth Facility (PRGF) and the African Development Bank\n            (AfDB) budget support operation created a critical mass and\n            proved particularly important. Given the capacity\n            bottlenecks in the country and the fragile political\n            situation, it was necessary to ensure that the arrears\n            clearance and development policy operation were accompanied\n            by appropriately targeted technical assistance, by the Bank\n            and other donors. In this case, the ERGG was supported by\n            the low income countries under stress (LICUS) grants and the\n            Financial Sector and Governance Reform Technical Assistance\n            (TA) Project. In fragile country situations, it is\n            particularly important to select a focused number of prior\n            actions that are deemed essential to supporting the\n            Government's broader reform program. Selectivity not\n            only reduces transaction costs for the Government that is\n            burdened by multiple management demands while the capacity\n            is weak, but also increases the likelihood that these\n            reforms are successfully implemented and the reform program\n            moves forward."}, "docdt": "2009-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
