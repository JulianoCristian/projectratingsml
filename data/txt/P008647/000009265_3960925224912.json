The project was appraised in October 1984 and\n            approved by the loan on December 3, 1985. Official notice of\n            cancellation was sent to the Government on April 6, 1987.\n            The project fell victim to a series of various external\n            circumstances whose importance was not necessarily\n            foreseeable during project appraisal. Political instability\n            in the country and changes in the institutional framework\n            for housing finance were contributing issues. The main\n            problem, however, was that by the time the loan was\n            approved, Portugal had gained access to sources of funding\n            for low-income housing that were offering resources under\n            more favorable and less stringent conditions than those\n            offered by the Bank. There was full agreement with the\n            designated implementing agency about the project goals.\n            Although the loan never became effective, Bank staff\n            estimated that through its very preparation it had a strong\n            and positive impact on Portugal's housing finance\n            intermediary (sound financial policy) and its lending\n            program (focus on moderate income groups with appropriate\n            designs and lowered construction standards). In hindsight,\n            it seems that the Bank probably underestimated the risks\n            stemming from the availability of other funding sources. The\n            experience of this project confirms that the Bank can, apart\n            from its resource transfer role, contribute to institutional\n            development through advisory inputs at the project inception\n            and preparation stages. The overall project outcome and its\n            sustainability cannot be rated. Institutional development is\n            rated as substantial."}, "docdt": "1993-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
