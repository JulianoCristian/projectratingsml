 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

 1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT
 With a population of 890.470 people, a natural area of 1.283,42 km2 (Statistical Yearbook in
 2009) and located in the central region of Vietnam, Da Nang is considered as an important
 gateway to the sea, to the central highland and countries such as Laos, Cambodia and
 Thailand.
The Socio-economic Development Plan (Phase 2006-20 I 0) had set up targeted annual GDP
growth rate about 14-15%. Despite, the environmental degradation caused by the old and
degraded infrastructure system affects public health and economic development.
Under these circumstances, in 2004, the Government of Vietnam has requested FDI
supporting the development project Priority Infrastructure Investment Project in Da Nang.
Then there is the investment report (IRlPFS) Da Nang People's Committee adopted by
Decision No. 2456/QD-UBND issued April 4, 2007; and credit agreements were signed
between the World Bank and Vietnam bank on 28/08/2008 and put into practice on
26/1112008.

    2.3.2 Upgraded items

    Four upgraded items are: (i) roads, (ii) water supply and drainage systems, (iii) public lighting
    systems, and (iv) social works. The selection of the portfolio is based on the current situation
    and the urgent needs of each LIA with the active participation of the community. Details of
    the investment in the LIAs are described in Appendix 2-1. Here is the overall workload of the
    LIAs.

Roads: Based on the specific situtation of each LIA, 09 LIAs were selected to upgrade the
roads with the total of 20,076m, of which LIAI: Binh Hien, Hai Chau (650m), LIA2: Binh
Thuan, Hai Chau (2170m), LIA3: Nguyen Tri Phuong, Hoa Cuong Bac, Hai Chau (l033m),
LIA 4: Hoa Tho Dong, Cam Le (179Im), LIA5: Thuy Tu, Hoa Hiep Bac, Lien Chieu
(4032m), LIA6: An Hai Bac, Son Tra (1833m), L1A7: An Hai Dong, Son Tra (1 5 18m), LIA8:
Tho Quang, Son Tra (5042m) and LIA9: Tam Thuan, Thanh Khe (2007m). The width of
roads are different among LIAs (2.5-13.5m). The road is covered by cement if its width is
below 3m and by asphalt for the rest.

Lighting: Light cable is provided for all LIAs with the total of 15,873m, of which LIAI
(3,321m), LIA2 (I,387m), LIA3 (2,206m), LIA4 (I,175m), LlA6 (3,509m), LIA7 (533m),
LIA8 (3030m) and LIA9 (712m); except LIA 5 because its lighing system has just upgraded.

Water supply: Water supply pipes are installed for all LIAs with 36km length by HDPE and
pressure pipes ofD = 50 - 110 providing conections to more than 8,000 households.

Drainage and sewerage system: Combined drainage systems are installed for all LIAs with
total length of 4,2km with presure pipes ofD 300 - 800.

Social infrastructure works: There are three kindergartens with constructed space of
1,500m2 providing places for more than 2,000 childen; and 07 community meeting halls of
I,200m2 offering more than 2,000 seats. Number of beneficiaries is about 4,079 households.

2.4    COMPONENT B: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

Component B includes new installation and expansion of the rainwater drainage system, wastewater
collection system and WWTP system. The combined drainage system is applied, which means
that domestic wastewater and storm water are collected and conveyed together. The
wastewater is separated via CSO at the end of the pipeline to pumping station, and then
WWTP. To prevent the back flows from the sea or rivers into the drainage system, the
overflow weir in the diversion chamber is constructed at level +0.60 meters above normal sea
level. When the tide reaches +0.60 meters, the pumping stations are automatically switched
off. In case of heavy rain, the mixture of wastewater and storm water will overflow the pier of
CSOs and discharged into the receiving water body. It is shown in the below Figure 2-3.

2.4.3.3 Description oftreatment process
Coilected domestic wastewater passes in the headwork structure which includes flow meter,
screening bars and grit chamber. At grit chamber, the grit classifier separates the water from


                                                                                             24

the grit by a cyclone conveyer and returns the waste stream back into the flow downstream of
the screening bars then goes into the secondary treatment tanks (extended aeration) and sand
is moved to the sand storage. A single extended aeration activated sludge basin is constructed
and sized to serve an average day flow of 20,000 m 3/d and two secondary clarifiers are
constructed to separate sludge from treated wastewater. The process of treatment is completed
with disinfection by using compressed liquid chlorine (chlorine gas) before discharging into
water receiving body. The layout of treatment is presented in Figure 2-5.

The sludge is treated prior to discharging to the dumping site and smell is managed by
collecting system and treated before dispersing into the atmostphere.

Sludge Processing
Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) and scum is pumped from the secondary clarifiers to a
storage tank in the dewatering building. From the storage tank in the dewatering building the
WAS and scum is pumped to belt filter presses for dewatering. The dewatered WAS is then
conveyed using screw conveyors to a truck.
Odour Control
Two smell control systems are designed for the new WWTP - one system collects smell from
the Screening & Grit Chamber and the other serves the Sludge Handling Building. The
removal odor system is a biofilter tanks.

    2.4.4.1 Objective ofupgrading
    Experiment the aerobic treatment model to compare with the current model to evaluate their
    effectiveness before deciding to upgrade other existing WWTPs.

2.4.4.2 Upgrading scope
Upgrading scope means designing a aerobic treatment technology to improve the treating
capacity. In the pilot phase, a reservoir will be converted into an aerobic technology and
another remains unchanged. Treatment and the effluent quality of wastewater meets TCVN
7222: 2002. The upgrading scope is shown on table 2-8.

CHAPTER 3. ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS
3.1       WITHOUT PROJECT
Without the Project, Da Nang's environmental sanitation will not be improved significantly
because the existing collection and wastewater treatment system does not meet the current and
future needs. The public health, particularly the poor in LIAs, is threatened by the polluted
environment and unsafe water as well as the unperfect transportation infrastructure system. All
of them will hinder the economic - social development (especially in the south of the City) and
affect the City's sustainable development, present and future.
3.2       ALTERNATIVES
3.2.1     Component A
3.2.1.1 Process for selecting upgraded items
The process to select options for 09 investments in upgrading the LIAs is as follows:
      •   First, design consultant, environmental consultant and PMU carried out a survey the
          situation and assessed the needs of each LIA area (local people, local authorities and
          urban development plan of the city).
      •   The portfolio for each LIA was unanimously selected through community meetings. On
          that basis, design consultants presented to the community 2-3 investment options for
          each item with the advantages and disadvantages of each option; after that community
          discussed and chose the preferred option. The opinions of the community were fully
          recorded, analyzed and applied by the design consultants.
      •   The final option went through community and local authorities before the detailed
          design of each portfolio in the LIA is implemented.
3.2.1.2 Analysis and selection factors
Based on the condition of each LIA, the options of upgrading alleys, lighting, drainage system,
wastewater collection, water supply and transit of solid waste (garbage) are discussed with the

Conclusion: the options of community for upgrading roads, sewer system, garbage collection
system are suitable. However, fire protection need to be considered carefully. Consultants
propose the alley out to be less than 305m should be invested fire hydrant and guide people to
practice fire when the fire occurred.

Conclusion: Based on the strategic objective of the municipal wastewater management, the
selected locations for Lien Chieu, Hoa Xuan WWTPs are considered feasible. However, we
should pay attention to the possibility of smells if the buffer zone does not meet TCVN 7222:
2002IBTNMT and calculate impacts on the surface water of wastewater receiving basins when
the plants are breakdown.

Technological selection
Because of the narrow buffer zone based on QCVN 07/2010IBXD (40m), some treatment
technologies such as biological lagoons or disinfection by UV light are not considered.
Sequencing Biological Reactor (SBR) and Extended Aeration (EA) were two options identified
for providing secondary treatment at the Hoa Xuan and Lien Chieu WWTPs. Disinfectants
such as UV, Ch and NaCIO were provided for selection.

Secondary treatment

    1. Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) System

A Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) is a variation of the activated sludge process. As a fill and
drain or batch process, all biological treatment phases occur in a single tank and no required
separate tanks for aeration and sedimentation. There are normally 5 phases in the SBR
treatment cycle: Fill _ React _ Settle -Decant -Idle.
Normally, aeration system is installed in the bottom creating bubbles with a simple repeated
sequence of aeration and non-aeration to provide aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic process
conditions in each batch of treatment. The SBR process is based on a fill-and-draw operational
mode with four distinct cycles as depicted in Figure 3-1 and as follows

2. Looped Activated Sludge System - Extended Aeration (LASS- EA)

LASS - EA is derived from the oxidation ditch (OD with a variation that adds control,
efficiency and flexibility with mUltiple concentric oval or ring shaped channels with the aim
accelerating air transfer efficiency.
A typical EA system is shown at Figure 3-2. Wastewater along with the return activated sludge
(RAS) normally enters the outer channel and the combination known as mixed liquor (ML)
flows concentrically towards the centre of the tanks. Once at the centre, the ML will overflow a
weir and flow to the centre influent well of the clarifier. Horizontal shaft disc or vertical shaft
mechanical aerators provide aeration and move the ML around the rings.

Conclusion: Level 2 processing technology of extended aeration oxidation ditch (Lass-EA) is
evaluated more advantageously than the batching biological reaction technology (SBR) in term
of the wastewater treatment efficiency and environment pollution thank to its less smell and
sludge formation.
3. Alternative for Odour removal methods 

Three smell removal methods were proposed for smell control at WWTPs: 

    •   Activated Carbon Adsorption
    •   Biofilter
    •   and chemical Scrubber
Principle of each method
Activated Carbon Adsorption
Activated Carbon is extremely effective at smell control. The tremendous surface area of
activated charcoal (I teaspoon = a football field) quickly adsorbs unpleasant scents - not just
masks them. So, while other smell control techniques just cover up the smells, activated
charcoal actually eliminates them permanently.
Biofilter
Biofilter are a smell treatment technology that utilizes biological processes as the treatment
mechanism. Odour will go through a wet bio-Iayer and micro-organisms will consume
substants caused smell and emit in the outlet air with other air substants. The biological activity
in a biofilter is similar to the activities performed by microorganisms in activated-sludge
secondary in wastewater treatment processes.
Chemical scrubber
Foul air is directed upstream to the wet chemical tower, where it is transferred from vapor to
liquid by surface contact. Its pressure dropping reduces its flow speed. At this point, the ordor
element, H2S is oxidized by sodium hypochlorite (NaCIO) and retained in the system.
Chemicals are pricked into the system continuously.
The advantage and disadvantage of the 03 desmellant methods are compared in Table 3-3.

Conclusion: Actually, the biofilter is now popular not only because it is modem but also it is
simple, efficient and stable. Biofilters are considered to be a "green" approach to smell control,
because microorganisms in media could produce external enzyme to transfer smellous
substances into carbon dioxide, water, biomass, and other benign by-product such as chloride
and sulfate. Therefore, this method is proposed to be applied for two WWTPs of the project.
Disinfection
Three alternatives for disinfections are Ch, NaCIO and UV. Each chemical has different
advantages and disadvantages as shown table below:

    Conclusion: Based on the advantages and disadvantages of the above 03 disinfectants, UV is
    hard to apply because of its high cost and low ability of bacteria killing in wastewater. NaCIO
    has less toxicity in the water. CI has high corrosive possibility in the system. Cl2 can be seen
    more advantageous than UV and NaCIO because of its wide sterilization, popularity and
    minimization of environmental impacts by avoiding the amount of residual chlorine in
    wastewater after treatment.

 EIA ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project - Phase 2B

 Conclusion: Based on the aforesaid analysis, Option 1 for the first phase of the          Proj~ct    is
 feasible because ofthe following reasons:
 In the first stage of the Project, the sludge is not enough for the investment of a new fertilizer
 plant;
It needs time to calculate a feasible plan of an organic fertilizer plant, making use of available
 materials of waste and sludge.
 Sludge to be made in wheels are safe for the transport and environment without malpractice as
 spillage of sludge on roads or smells and flies in dumps that make offensive to people of a
 modern large-scaled wastewater treatment plant.
Sludge is buried in Khanh Son landfill which is feasible for small volume and excavatable for
raw materials for a future fertilizer plant.
Sludge can be considered to be dried 35% for transport but not 16% as designed.
Investment of a sludge handling building at the plant will reduce future investment costs for a
fertilizer processing plant which will be decided to build.
3.2.3   Component C
The component C has two sub-components, Southern Link Road and Hoa Phuoc, Co Co
Bridges.
3.2.3.1 Southern Link Road
The People's Committee of Da Nang city has selected the Southern Link Road in Decision No.
5957/QD-UBND dated 09/08/2010 in term of the standard framework for the Southern Link
Road and the master development planning of the transport infrastructure of Danang city (the
data is updated from the Urban Planning of Danang city). The alignment of the Southern Link
Road follows the approval of Da Nang People's Committee in Decision No.7922/QD-UBND
dated 01114/2006, enclosed with Land Acquisition Decision No.4316/QD-UBND dated
23/5/2011 of the municipal People's Committee (Appendix 3-4).
Comments: in term of the economic aspect: the construction of the Southern Link Road will
contribute significantly to the development of the transport network and economic
opportunities for Da Nang city and people in the project area. On the environment aspect, the
route does not affect much the environment and can be minimized because it mostly goes
through paddy land and some small neighbourhoods of Phuoc Hoa, Hoa Yang and Hoa Quy,
Ngu Hanh Son and does not affect the culture and the conservation. Negative impacts such as
land acquisition, dust and noise in residential areas can occur but people will be benefited from
rising land values and opportunities brought by the urban development.
Conclusion: In term of environmental aspect, the alignment option is evaluated reasonable for
the construction of the road.
3.2.3.2 Phlloc Hoa Bridge and Co Co Bridge
There are no options because they are in compliance with the road alignment. The design
option must ensure the aesthetic and technical conditions and take into account the regulated
navigation for River Level 4 (Vinh Dien River).

 4.1.2   River network and Hydrology
 4.1.2.1 River network
 River system is short and declined, originated from the west, northwest and Quang Nam
 province. River network ofDa Nang city mostly belongs to downstream ofVu Gia Thu Bon
 River. Meteorological system is the main source which provides the fresh water to meet
 demands ofDa Nang city.
The Rivers of the City are: Tuy Loan River, Cu De River (in the north), Yen River, Qua Giang
River, La Tho River, Vinh Dien River and Han River. Tuy Loan and Cu De have independent
water basins and locate in Da Nang city. Other Rivers are all downstream of Thu Bon and Vu
Gia Rivers.
         Vinh Dien River: is the branch of Thu Bon River at Cau Lau Bridge, approximately
         5km toward the upstream. Vinh Dien River brings part of Thu Bon water and receives
         the flows of La Tho and Qua Giang Rivers before discharging into Han River.
         Cu De River: Cu De basin is on the northern city and has plume shape, which tilts
         north east - south west. The total area of the River basin is 472km2. Total length of Cu
         De River is 38km. Cu De downstream is frequently contaminated with salt and in dry
         reason almost half of the River length is salted.
         Tuy Loan River: Tuy Loan basin is on the left of Vu Gia River and connects with Cu
         De basin. Tuy Loan River originates from Ba Na Mountain at the height of about
          1487m. The River length is 30km. The basin area from its outlet to the junction of Tuy
         Loan and Yen Rivers is 280km2. The average height is 271m. The average slope is
          15%. The basin length is 25km. The average basin width is 10.3 km. Tuy Loan River
         joins with Yen River to form Cau Do River Cam Le, both discharging into Han River.
         Han River: Is the final join of Vinh Dien River, Cau Do       Cam Le River, which
         discharges into Da Nang Sea. The flow regime of Han River is strongly affected by the
         tide ofDa Nang Sea.
         Phu Loc River: is a small River in Thanh Khe and Lien Chieu districts, which almost
         has no source and the River water flow is mainly from the coming tidal flow.
         Co Co River: is a previous coastal river linking Cai River and Thu Bon River at Cua
         Dai section. Currently, the river was filled and became dead-end. The river flow during
         dry season in Da Nang city is mainly backward from Cai River and Han River.
4.1.2.2 Hydrology
The tidal mode of Da Nang Sea is irregular sun-tide and half sun-tide. Namely, in a half day,
there is a spring tide and a neap tide but the magnitude and time between the spring tide and a
neap tide is different. On average, each month has 3 sun-tide days, the maximum is 8 days and
the minimum is one (1) day.
4.2      SOCIAL - ECONOMIC STATUS
4.2.1    Economy
By size, the City'S Gross Domestic Product (GDP) compared with the constant price was
2,589.8 billion VND in 1997 and was increased to 9,199,755 billion VND in 2009 (a 3.5-time
increase). On average, the GDP reaches 11.1 %/year (in the national scale, this rate is
7.2%/year). In which, the service sector makes up 54.54% ofGDP following comparison price,



                                                                                             51
 EIA ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project - Phase 2B

 industry construction makes up 42.19% and agriculture           forestry   aquiculture makes up
 3.27% (Source: Statistical Yearbook in 2009).
In the chart of Provincial Competition Index (PCI), since 2005 Da Nang has always been in the
good group of the top competitiveness, especially it has ranked first in two years 2008-2009.
4.2.2   Population and Density
It is forecasted that the population will increase from 890,490 people in 2009 to 1,243,264 in
2020. The population density in the urbanized areas of the city varies from 1,674 persons/km2
in Lien Chieu district to 18,380 persons/km2 in Thanh Khe district. Table 4-1 provides details
of population increase and popUlation density.

4.2.3 Land Use Plan
Currently suitable unexploited land for development and for city expansion is available in the
west, northwest, southwest and southeast; however the Master Plan has given priority to
development in the northwest, the area between Highway lA and Lien Chieu-Thuan Phuoc
road because the trunk road network is readily available. The development of the south and the
southwest is very much dependent on the construction of the trunk road to the south.
Land use categories and their area for year 2009 and orientation in 2020 are given below and
shown in table 4-2

 In spite of that, existing traffic network of the city has not met current and future demands.
 While the road density of Thanh Khe and Hai Chau districts is 2.6-3.2km1krn2, the other
 districts only reach about 0.37 - 0.83 kmlkm2. The City'S average road density is 1.31kmlkm2,
 much lower than Hanoi (2.81 kmlkrn2) and HCM (1.66kmlkrn2) at the same time.
 4.2.8. Electricity supply and lighting status
Da Nang is supplied with the electric power from Hoa Binh hydropower plant via the North ­
South Ultra High Pressure Line 500 kV, which meets the needs of production and consumption
of people.
           Primary Center of power supply - Da Nang substation 500/220KV - 450MVA Da
           Nang city is currently powered by the substation that includes two transformers ­
           220/110KV 220/110KV-125 MYA
           Substations have been being built: 110KV Stations (Lien Tri, Xuan Ha, Ngu Hanh
           Son, Hoa Khanh, Da Nang Industrial Zone, Cau Do, Hai Van tunnel, Lien Chieu, Hai
           Van Cement, Hoa Khuong Industrial Zone), 220kV Stations (Da Nang, Hoa Khanh)
4.2.9. Water supply
4.2.9.1 Water source
Surface water
The major River systems that can meet the water supply demand ofDa Nang City:
       Han River and the main River branches running through Da Nang: Cau Do, Tuy Loan,
       Yen, Vu Gia Rivers.
       Cu De River and tributaries flowing into the Gulf ofDa Nang: Nam River, Hac River
Da Nang has been primarily provided water from the only River in the south of the city - Cau
Do River. The water influx point in Cau Do River - Cau Do NMN is about 15krn far from the
River estuary which is usually contaminated with salt in the dry season. The salinization has
been more than IOOOmgll. Da Nang Water Supply Project - Phase I built one more anti­
salinization coarse water influx point in Yen River (at the upstream ofCau Do River) to supply
the city when Cau Do River is contaminated with salt.
In addition, Son Tra 1 Water Treatment Plant and Son Tra 2 Water Treatment Plant take water
from streams originating from the mountains of Son Tra Peninsula, which have small capacity
and change by the reasons.
Therefore, Cu De River is clearly determined as a raw water source for Da Nang Water Supply
Project - Phase 1.
Ground water
According to the documents of the University of Mining and Geology, based on the previous
boreholes in 1992, the water reserve in Hoa Khanh - Lien Chieu areas likely reaches




                                                                                               55
 EIA ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project - Phase 2B

 3,000m3/day. With such limited reserve, the groundwater does not meet the water demand for
 the city.
 4.2.9.2 The status ofclean water production and provision
 Da Nang Water Supply Company is operating 3 water supply facilities with total designed
 capacity of 155,000m3/day; the current capacity is 130,000-140,000m3/day. Cau Do Water
 Supply Plant is one of the largest factories with the capacity of 120.000m3/day; the Airport
 Water Treatment Plant with the capacity of 30.000m3/day is the medium-scale plant; and Son
 Tra Water Supply Plant has the capacity of 5.000m3/day.
 Regarding the water-pipe network, the Company's pipeline class I is 287km long (0) 200);
 pipeline class II is 253km long (0100-200); and pipeline class III is above 3,000km long. The
 total connectors include 120,000 electric meters. The rate of population to be supplied with
 clean water in six urban districts is over 65%, including 130,000 households with
 approximately 500,000 inhabitants. On average, the water consumption of the city is 128
 liters/personlday.

10 years ago, the city made a plan to establish a modern and large scale water supply system in
Da Nang. As a result, Water Supply Company finished it and put the City Water supply Project
Phase I (l20,000m3/day) into exploitation. It is expected to finish the project phase II in 2015
and increase the water supply capacity to 325,000m3/day.

         •   The major drawback of the existing WWTPs:
                The BOD content in wastewater is low at 70mg/L as the ratio of households
                connection to the system accupies about 15 to 20% and wastewater is dilluted (Carl
                Bro,2009).
                Activated sludge is deposited so that the ability of exposing with wastewater can be
                very low. The treatment can remove 30% BOD and TSS. The smell and bubbles
                generate significally at the sluice-gates due to the anaerobic fermentation of
                accumulated emissions and smells.
 4.3         ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE STATUS
 4.3.1       Baseline conditions in the city
 4.1.1.1 Ambient air quality
 According to the monitoring data recorded by the National Environmental Monitoring Program
 from 1995 till present, in general, the quality of ambient air in the Da Nang city is quite good
 except dust concentration and noise level are high in high traffic density and construction
 activities occur.
 4.1.1.2 Surface water quality
 The surface water sources in Da Nang city are from rivers, lakes and sea.
 Quality ofriver water
The major rivers in Da Nang area include the Han, Vu Gia, Cu De, and Phu Loc Rivers. The
Phu Loc River is the receiving body for a large amount of untreated domestic wastewater and is
heavily polluted. The Han River is a downstream river which is used mainly for water transport
purposes. The study by Carl Bro (2009) showed that most of the river water samples are
polluted by organics mainly due to the discharge of domestic wastes and seafood processing
enterprises and intensive water transport. Whereas Vu Gia River and Cu De River, located in
the north of the city, are used for drinking purposes; most of the rivers are utilized mainly for
agriculture and aquaculture purposes. The river water quality is rather good in the upstream and
polluted in the downstream. The main reasons for this, also as reported by Da Nang DONRE
(2007), are the intensive water transport activities and the discharge of industrial wastewater
from Hoa Khanh and Lien Chieu Industrial Park.
The Vu Gia and Cu De Rivers also serve as important sources for the city's water supply. The
quality of water in Vu Gia River is quite good, except for the downstream river from Cau Do
Bridge to the mouth of the Han River. Saline water intrusion occurs in this river in dry seasons.
In addition to saline intrusion, Coliform contamination has the potential for adversely affecting
the city's water intake3 ,
 Quality oflake water
There are 42 lakes scattered throughout Da Nang City. Except for Bau Tram Lake, with a
surface area accounting for 46% of the total surface area of all lakes, most of the existing lakes
are quite small. Nevertheless, most of the lakes play an important role in creating landscape,
recreation, and microclimate regulation for the city. According to Da Nang DoNRE (2007),
most of the lakes in the urban areas are polluted, with the organic content exceeding standard
limits by I 3 times. Nutrients are also high the lake water. Ammonia concentrations were

                                                                                               58
 EIA ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project Phase 2B

 reported to exceed standard limits by 1- 29 times in the 29/3 Lake (2001 - 2005), and by 12
 18 times in Dam Rong 2 Lake. In addition, most of the existing lakes have also been found to
 be polluted with high concentrations of oil and grease and Coliform. Water quality of existing
 lakes in Da Nang, therefore, do not meet the Vietnamese fresh-water quality guidelines for
 protection of aquatic life.
 The main reason for this polluted situation is the discharge of untreated wastewater from
 residential, commercial and industrial units. Uncontrolled disposal of solid wastes is another
 reason for lake water pollution, because of low public awareness.
 Quality ofsea water
 Unlike organic pollution in the rivers, coastal water quality in Da Nang Bay is much better.
 Although the suspended solids (SS) concentrations were determined to exceed the standard
 limit by 1 - 3 times during the period 2003        2004 at Non Nuoc and Bac My An, the
 concentrations were observed to decrease to acceptable levels after from 2005.
It was also reported that the coastal water at Non Nuoc Beach area was contaminated with
ammonia and micro-organisms during the period 1997-2001. However, the pollution situation
has been improved since then, with Coliform counts recently reducing to almost the standard
limits. The ongoing discharge of raw sewage from the combined drainage system into the sea,
during the rainy season, can be one of the main reasons casing pollution of the coastal East Sea
water.
4.3.1.3 Ground water quality
According to studies conducted by Da Nang DoNRE, city groundwater city was
microbiologically contaminated. During the period 1998 - 2000, Coliform in groundwater
exceeded the standard limits by 2 to 31,000 times. High Coliform contamination was recorded
at Thanh Khe and Hoa Chau, and was above standard limits by 636 times.
Also, a number of groundwater wells have report high levels of oil and organic contamination.
These wells are located residential areas of My Khe and the Nuoc Man Petroleum Warehouses,
and also in the proximity or Khanh Son Landfill and Hoa Khanh Industrial Park. The main
reason for the groundwater contamination was inappropriate arrangement and management of
wells, especially with respect to the required hygienic distances from toilets and other pollution
sources such as oil warehouses, landfills, industrial parks ... The most serious groundwater
pollution is also reported in some areas at Lien Chieu, Cam Le and Ngu Hanh Son.
4.3.2   The environmental baseline in the project area
As the project is located in a large area and scattered in 5 districts of the city, selecting
sampling positions and parameters for analysis must be representative, concerning sensitive
works highly possible to be affected by the project during the construction and operation
phases.
4.3.2.1 Quality ofair environment
Rational
With the purpose as baseline data for assessing the positive and negative impacts during
construction and operation phases ofthe project, the sampling positions are selected as follows:
           Component A: one sample in each LIA was taken for analysis
           Component B:

           Southern Road and Mai Dang Chon, (2) Southern Road with Tran Dai Nghia Road
           and (3) at Km 0.000 of the Road.
Time of sampling: rush hours from 10.30 to 1 L30AM in Da Nang city.
Result analysis:
According to the baseline data (shown in Appendix 4), in overall, the quality of air in the project
area is within the standard, except some locations in sub-component B52, B53 and Southern
Road are polluted by dust and noise (Chart 1). The specific level and positions that TSP swpasses
the standard is shown at Chart 2 and Chart 3.

    Component B: The area of sub-components of B52, B53 is polluted by dust and noise.
 Especially, at the positions ofK4, K6, KIO, KII, and K12, dust concentrations fluctuate from
  350 to 480 (j.1glm 3), 1.2 - 1.6 times higher than the allowable limit ofQCVN 05:2008. The
 main reason for that is due to high density of traffic. Noise level ranges from 58.6 -75.6 dBA
       and 719 locations where the noise level is 1 - 1.08 times higher than the standard.
Component C: most of analysis samples are within the permission except dust concentration at
K3 is 360 (pg/m3), 1.3 times higher than the standard QCVN 05:2008 and noise level of 77,4
dBA, 1.11 times higher than the standard. This is caused by heavy traffic density.
4.3,2.2. Quality ofsurface water

Similar to the air environment, the baseline surface water quality in the project area is
established with representative samples at each component and sub-component of the project
Component A.' 05 outlets that are receiving wastewater and rainwater from LIAs are taken for
analysis with the aim at providing baseline for assess negative impact during construction
phase and positive impact once project completed the wastewater is collected and treated.

Component B:
            Sub- components B52 and B53: there are no water sources nearby to receive runoff
            water and wastewater during construction and operation phases;
            Sub-component B54, B55a
            o 	 Hoa Xuan WWTP: discharge its treated wastewater into Tu Cau River. Three
                samples at Tu Cau River were taken for analysis
            o 	 Lien Chieu WWTP: discharge its treated wastewater into Cu De River. Three
                samples at around the discharge point were analysed.
Component C: Bridge construction process can pollute surface water at the bridge crossing the
Co Co river. Thus at the bridge location, samples are taken and analysis.

4.3.2.3 Quality ofground water
The sampling location and analysis results are presneted in Appendix 4-3. Analysis results
show that:
Component A:
Groundwater of most LIAs is polluted by Coliform, Pb and NH4+. All LIAs have concentration
of Coliform higher from 3 to 24 times than the standard of drinking water. Except Hoa Hai Bac
and An Hai Bac wards, concentration of N~+ and Pb in ground water has 2 7 times higher
than the standard. The reasons for that are possible because most wells that are about 5- 7
meters in depth and located about 1- 2 meters from toilets, so the penetration of wastewater
into wells is capable.
Recommendation: According to the analysis results, the quality of ground water is not suitable
for drinking and cooking. However, except Thuy Tu LIA, currently most of the people in 09
LIAs use well water for cooking and drinking purpose. It is recommended that Da Nang
responsible agencies should examine carefully the quality of groundwater in the LIAs to give
the people appropriate advice to protect the community health.
Component B:
The quality of ground water is within the permission, except the concentration of coliform is
higher than the standard of drinking water in accordance with QCVN 01 :2009/BYT.

 4.3.2.5 Ecology
 Da Nang is a city rich terrain, plains interspersed by mountains, hills and the sea. Therefore, in
 general, the ecology of Da Nang has rich biological diversity.
 The mountainous terrain with many watersheds is very meaningful in the ecological
 environment protection of the city. The coastal plain along East of Da Nang city has valuable
 aquatic ecosystem not only for Da Nang city but also for Vietnam.
 Green space
The project area is mainly located at residential areas within the city. Flora in Da Nang city is
quite diverse with more than 75 various types of tree planted in the city. There are mainly
shade trees like Hopea smellata, Draccontomelum duperreanum, Mimusops elengi,
Peltophorum ferrugineum ...
 Terrestrialfauna
DN - PlIP, phase 2B has 03 components which are implemented in Da Nang city, including
urban area, suburban area and agricultural area alternated by residential areas; therefore,
terrestrial fauna mainly include animals, poultries and domestic fowls. There are no wild
animals or rare species.
Aquatic biological sources
Regarding natural habitats, according to study results on the subject "Investigation and study of
coral and associated creatures from Hon Chao to south Hai Van pass and Son Tra peninsula",
it is detected that there are underground coral beaches at Da Nang inshore and there is a narrow
distribution from tide area to the depth of < 12m. Coral reefs are in good conditions, mainly
focus in Hon Sup, Bai But, Bai Nom, Huc Lo, Vung Da areas in the south of Son Tra
peninsula.
Regarding regional fauna, according to study results, there are 221 plankton floras. The areas
where plankton fauna is mainly distributed include the middle area of the bay and in the
northwest of Son Tra peninsula. Regarding plankton fauna, there are 162 species, in which,
plankton fauna is distributed in the south of Son Tra higher than in other areas. Larva in Da
Nang coastal area is quite diverse, especially crustacean larva. Generally, in the west of bay
gate and in the south of Son Tra peninsula, larva components and density is higher than that in
remaining areas. The project will have not any effects on biological resources in preservation
area due to small construction scale.
According to the analysis by Infra - Thanglong in 3/2010, the aquatic flora and fauna in the
project area consists of the phytoplankton species belonging to Cyanophyta, Chrysophyta,
Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta and Dinophyta, and some ephemeral animals as Copepods,
Amphipoda and Larva and benthic animals as Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, Gastropoda, Bivalvia
and Insecta. These aquatic animals and plants are widely distributed in freshwater, brackish
and seawater, which have no economic and conservation values.

 CHAPTER 5. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

 5.1    OVERVIEW OF PROJECT IMPACTS

The Priority Infrastructure Investment Project of Da Nang (Danang - PIIP) - Phase 2B consists
of three building components - A, B, C, which spread over six districts of the city. When the
Project is deployed, the city has opportunity for the urban improvement, sanitation
improvement and traffic infrastructure development, on the one hand, and contribution for the
development and poverty reduction of the city, on the other hand. However, the Project builds
on a large scale and is ranked Group A which is environmental sensitive and should be
carried out impact assessment to minimize negative impacts and promote positive impacts
brought by the Project. In this chapter, positive and negative effects of 03 components - A, B
and C corresponding with 03 stages of pre-construction, construction and operation of the
project will be reviewed.

Component A: upgrading 09 LIAs, which are scattered in wide range with similar upgrade
items like alleys, lighting, water supply and social infrastructure such as kindergartens, nursery
homes and community houses. The upgrade scale is small, which mobilizes local labor with
manual means. The environmental conditions in the LIAs are the same. Therefore the
environmental impact assessment is commonly carried out and can be applied separately to
each LIA.

Component B is classified for the environmental impact assessment as follows:

- Sub-component B52. B53: B52 expands the rainwater drainage route and B53 expands the
wastewater collection route. The construction works are in the same area and are assessed
collectively. The construction of Trung Nghia Lake embankments, which has several different
characteristics, will be considered separately including the waste management in the operation
and potential risks of the deep lake.

- Subcomponent B54, B55a: two new WWTPs, Lien Chieu and Xuan Hoa, will be built with
the same treatment technology and initial capacity, so they are evaluated in general and specific
aspects of each plant such as discharge, receiving sources and buffers, in particular.

Subcomponent B55b: pilot upgrading of Son Tra WWTP station with a very small scale,
which does not affect the current collection and treatment. Son Tra station has two anaerobic
tanks operating in paralleL The renovation option is to upgrade one tank into an aeration tank
and the other works normally. The objective of the comparative effectiveness will be made
before there is a decision to upgrade the existing station in the future. So its impact on the
environment is considered similar to what occur in Sub-Component B54, B55a, typical in
sludge dredging prior to upgrading.
Component C: includes the construction of the Southern Link Road and 02 bridges crossing
Hoa Phuoc River and Co Co River, which is divided into 02 SUb-components, road and bridges
for the assessment.
Here is the detailed impact assessment.


                                                                                              65

 5.2.        IMPACT ASSESSMENT

 5.2.1       Component A

 5.2.1.1 Pre-construction
 Component A invests on upgrading roads/alleys, lighting, installing drainage and sewage system
 and constructing public buildings. The selection of project area and technical design are
 implemented with the community participation (Chapter 3), so the negative impacts on these
 aspects are insignificant. The impacts in this phase are focused on land acquisition and
 resettlement.

 a. Clearance and resettlement

In Component A, 18 households lost the whole house and only one lost a part of their house.
According to RAP, I0.512,5m 2 residential land and 636 households are affected. Therefore, the
compensation, clearance directly impact the lives of people in the region, especially the white
houses cleared, they have changed residence and get used to new life in the resettlement.
This impact is considered negative at high levels but may reduce and affect only a short time.
The details are presented in Table 5-1.

Impact accessment: Although the affected residential land and households are small when
compared with the total residential land of 234,540m 2 and number of households of 6,691
households in 09 LIAs, the environmental changes in this area may put adapting pressure on
affected households to get acquaintance with the new living environment and finding new jobs.
However, the affected households will be compensated and supported to recover their life at
least equal or better than that before. After the project completes, it will bring significant
benefit for them. This impact is significantly negative but in short-term and could be easily
eliminated.


                                                                                                 66

b. Impacts on the air quality due to land clearance
Dust generated from the site clearance of the demolition and repair of houses (households who
are partly affected). So if there are no shielding measures when structures are demolished in
this stage, dust will cause local pollution in the area. However, because the project deploys in
five districts of Da Nang city with small clearance volumn compared to the total area of Da
Nang city, impacts are only moderate and can be reduced.
5.2.1.2 Construction phase
Sources
       •    Dust and air pollution, noise and vibration of construction equipment
       •    Domestic wastewater of workers' activities
       •   Solid waste of dredging to install pipe-laying (sewer system and drainage system)
       •   Solid waste of workers' activities
Affected subjects:
    •      Local people living around construction site
    •      People in traffic around construction site
    •      Worker of construction site
Scale of impact
For each 10 - 20m length of road step, time of construction activities is short (around 5 10
days). In a construction site, there are around 5 - 10 workers and some construction equipment
such as concrete cutters, compactor, some of 5 tons trucks, scraper bucker... , depending on the
road width, equipment capacity. The construction machine is selected to be suitable with small
alley, therefore, the impacts are insignificant.
a. Air pollution
Source:
The main sources of dust are from excavation and transportation activities. The calculation of
excavated and transported materials for 9 LIAs presented in Appendix 5-1.
Impact assessments:
   •       Dust from excavation:
   Dust from excavation could be named as heavy particles which are easy to settle. The
   affected area for each construction site around 10m to 20m. However, the construction
   occurs in many narrow alleys where dust could accumulate and affect local people and
   workers. The impact is assessed to be medium, short term and mitigable.
   •       Dust from transport:
           See Appendix 5-1, the volume of material being transported is approximately 18,000
           m3 for the entire 09 LIAs. Dust is mainly from construction materials (soil, sand and
           small stones):
              Soil will stick to truck-wheels and crash out adjacent alleys and will be dispersed by
              wind to cause dust pollution;
              The process of unloading materials from trucks to collection points causes dust;

                                                                                                 67
 EIA ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project - Phase 2B

            Dust in exhaust fumes of vehicles;
            The dust is swept away by the traffic.
        General assessment: The dust impact is countable in narrow construction project areas,
        which will directly affect people health. However, dust can be easily mitigated by
        simple measures as watering. Its impact is assessed small and short term and mitigable.
b. Noise and vibration
Upgrading LIAs activities are small scales and simple technique so that small machines and
equipment will be used for constructing roads as well as installing pipe-laying (sewage and
drainage systems) in around 10 days. Consequently, the impact is assessed to be small, short
term and mitigable.
c. Wastewater
        Waste water pumped from construction areas
        Waste water from the workers' daily activities
Rainwater and wastewater will be pumped from excavated holes for the construction of a water
drainage system and is also considered as a wastewater source. Usually, after a heavy rain,
storm water is trapped in pits, which will be pumped out to continue the construction. The
amount of water pumped out does not contain toxic pollutants (mainly are settled and
suspended solids (dirt, dust, sand ...) in the water). Therefore, its impacts are not considered
high when flowing into receiving sources (rivers, ditches or drains) but cause unsanitary in the
region, so we should take measures to control this wastewater.
Domestic wastewater is generated from living activities of construction workers on site. The
estimated number of workers present at site is 5-10 people, therefore, the domestic wastewater
is estimated 0.25 -0.5m3/day.
Because the site is completely within population area with small construction space and the
workload is not much, portable toilets are impossible to install. The contractors may hire toilets
of households in the region (as agreed by the employer and people).
This impact is considered negligible and overcomable.
d. Solid waste
Solid waste generated during the construction from the following sources:
       Solid waste from the leveling and digging for the construction of a drainage system is
       one of the noteworthy solid wastes if there are no appropriate construction plans or
       storage areas and prompt transportation. Such type of secondary contamination can
       occur on the surrounding such as arising more dust in dry season or causing sludgedy
       for the region in rainy season on the rest of the road in construction site.
       Solid waste from the construction is a type of waste generared by construction activities
       such as scraps of iron and steel, cement packs, formworks for the construction of
       manholes ... They are considered solid waste and we should have good management
       plan for this source of waste ...
       Domestic solid waste: with such a project scale, workers at a construction point are not
       many (only about 10 people), so the amount of waste generated is not large. However,
       if it is littered without collection in the construction area, the landscape and the
       neighborhood will suffer greatly.


                                                                                              68
 EIA ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project - Phase 2B

 The impact of solid waste is assessed small and mitigable.
 e. Traffic disturbance
 Any construction activities will cause traffic disturbance so that when the upgraded LIAs
 project is implemented, most roads and alleys in LIAs (1.5 - 3m width) will be impacted. The
 construction activities such as excavation, temporary store of debris and materials without in
 good arrangement shall disturb the local traffic. The impact is assessed small and mitigable.
f. Oil spillage and hazardous waste
Definitely, the project construction will use equipment (breakers, excavators, sawers) or
supporting equipment like generators which use diezen fuel and will be maintained or repaired.
During the operation or repair, oil, fuel, grease cloth will be spillled ... If they are spilled into
surrounding streets and construction area or on water resource, they will impact on the water
quality, increase the risk of car crashes and may cause fire. The impact of solid waste is
assessed small and mitigable.
g. Damage to underground utilities in construction areas
The construction of the drainage systems will dig road surface to make trenches. Most training
activities will take place in residential areas where there are a number of underground utilities
(electric cables, water pipes, telephones ...). Without survey, the construction will inadvertently
damage utilities, unsafety for workers and local people.
This impact is considered negative/moderate and can be overcome.
h. Problems in the construction stage
The operation of the Project may cause some significant problems such as:
        Bum up provisional fuel of construction equipment
       Traffic accidents caused by transportation means on the construction site or
       unreasonablly isolated items of construction cause accidents for motorcyclers in rainy
       season.
       Unsafe construction items cause accidents for active children in the construction site.
       Accidents caused by the use of unstandard electrical equipment and cables that
       endanger lives of workers and residents in the area.
This impact is considered negative/moderate and can be minimized.
5.2.1.3. Operation phase
The impacts in operation phase are more positive than negative and all the negative impacts are
minor and mitigable.
a. Positive impacts
Reduced health risk
The drainage system is being completed and connected to the city system, so all wastewater
will be collected and treated before discharging into the receiveing water body. The status of
infrastructures system (such as upgraded road! alleys, lighting, water supply ... ) is impoved.
That will impact directly or indirectly on the people awareness about hygienic sanitation in the
LIAs. The improvement can reduce water born and air born diseases. In addition, the people
will have tap supply-water for drinking and cooking in stead of using the groundwater that is



                                                                                                 69
     EIA ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project   Phase 2B

     being polluted by microorganisms. Thanks to the project investment, the community health will
     be improved.
     Improved water quality
     Both surface and groundwater quality will be improved due to the completion of drainage
     system.
     Improving the quality of life
     Besides the opportunity for infrastructure, houses refurbishment and accessibility to clean
     water, people will have chance to find work to improve their income and participate in the
     society.

    h. Negative impacts
    Road/alley surface can be damaged
           The community is often lack of O&M regulations, so trucks having larger load than the
           designed damage roads.
           The drilling and cutting for instalation of water supply systems and returning road bed
           incorrectly can damage roads.
    Impacts are rated moderate and can be minimized by the community rules.
    Arising smell
    Wastewater is collected in common drains. Without regular dredging or enlarging flow, which
    is blocked by waste, stagnant wastewater will flow over roads and cause unsanitary and foul­
    smelling.




                                                                                               70
  EIA ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project - Phase 2B

  The impacts are small and can be minimized by community self-governing and periodically
  dredge.
  The risk of traffic accidents in alleys
  Usually, people disregard when taking part in the traffic in alleys. They do not wear helmets, so
  the risk of accidents can happen. However, this is small impact which can be minimized.
  Waste in public place
 Supposed that the community house promotes effective and people gather for meetings
 regularly. If there are no toilets and trashes, in addition to low sense of community that litter in
 public places, generated waste will be the risk of environment pollution and threathen people's
 lives in the region.
 However, according to the survey, the waste collection in the LIAs is relatively good. That
 experience will be applied at the centers of community activity. The impact is assessed to be
 small and easily minimize.

 Total affected land is 368717 m2 , of which 104 174m2 of residential land and 264.543m2 of
 agricultural land. 683 households are impacted, of which 301 households have to be relocated.
 The impact is considered significant and was evaluated in the resettlement safety report (RAP).
 b. Technical design 

 ForB52. B53 

Design technique for sub-components B52 and B53 is similar to sub-components of drainage
and wastewater collection which were assessed in phase 2A. The issues which design
consultant must take into account include:
        Choice of location for drainage system: Choice of the drainage pipelines in the design
        stage is in accordance with the regulations of the Vietnamese standards as well as the
        Standards of Construction Sector such as choice of the direction of the pipelines to be
        minimized in relocated households and affect the public traffic during construction.
        Calculate hydraulics of the drainage and sewerage system in order to reduce the climate
        change affect on the system.
        Design CSOs with good smell prevention structure.
According to MONRE, the design must take the effects of climate change into account

   SYSTEM
A.I. CONSTRUCTIONPHASE
The wastewater collection pipelines are designed to run parallel to the storm water drainage
system in the same area. During the construction phase, to avoid digging roads again, the two
sub-components are usually built at the same time. However, the construction of sub­
component B52 - rainwater drainage system is the cause of more considerably environmental
impact due to the installation of deeper big box culverts.
Sources of impact
           Construction activities: include excavation, pipe-laying sewerage and drainage
           system; sludge dredging at current open canal.
           Transport activities: include tranport activities of construction materials and
           disposal activities of construction waste;

Total dust pollution loading is estimated as 96.7kglday. Massive volume of dust generated will
cause negative impacts on daily lives of local residents and passengers. It is noted that the air at
Ton Duc Thang Bac Son cross-road, Ton Duc Thang - Ngo Thi Nham cross-road and Hoa
Minh canal is polluted with dust as concentrations of 0,35mglm3, 0,47mglm3 and 0,46mglm3
respectively because of density population and traffic activities in these roads. The remaining
pipelines are installed in area with low density of population If using appropriate measures
such as water spraying, successive construction, dust is only generated locally, within a short
time and therefore, has no significant impacts.
    •    Dust (rom material transporting
Concentrations of air pollutants such as S02, NO", CO, VOC and dust will increase
proportionally to the quantity of excavated materials and transporting distance, as well as
covering measures of trucks.
Concentrations of dust and other pollutants in the air environment increase locally along then
transporting roads, especially in the dry season. Main composition of the dust is sand with the
size larger than 10 microns. These heavy particles are easily settled and affect directly to
workers and local residents. However, it could not be dispersed very far.
The excavated materials need to be transported: Transport = 57,262.86m3
It is assumed that the truck of 15 tons is used for transporting with the round distance of 10km,
sand density of 1.4 ton/m 3 , and construction duration is 1 year. The sand is taken from Hoa Son
and Hoa Yang.
Number of trucks per day:
(57,262.86 m3 * 1.4 ton/m 3 )/ [15 tons/truck * I years * 365 days/year] ::::; 15 (rounds/day)
The daily oil consumption:

The existing concentrations of NOx, CO and S02 in the project area are within the permission.
In addition, the gases emitted during transportation, they can disperse and be diluted by the air.
However, the gases are highly toxic to people with a mall concentration. These can adversely
impact to those live along the road with heavy traffic. The impact is from small to medium and
must be mitigated.
b. Noise and vibration
Except the box culverts going through Tan Tra residential area to Co Co River, Ngu Hanh Son
district, which has low population density, the other pipelines run through high populated
residential areas. In addition, large box culverts are installed under road centerlines and
sidewalk at the depths of 2 - 6 meters. The digging for culvert installation and retained by steel
planks to prevent landslide will be done by mechanical technique that will cause noise and
vibration, affecting people's lives and works nearby.
 c. Risk ofland slide
Land in Da Nang city belongs to a coastal type formed from sand and mixture of sand and soil
that is easy to be slided. Ifculvert boxes installed as depth of more than 3.5m, buildings located
within 10m from the construction site will be affected by the excavation. This was warned by
the technical designer in phase 1 of PUP - ON. Furthermore, in case of steel sheets used for
preventing it from landslide are not harmonised each other, which creates gaps between the
sheets. Storm water will runs through and make sand slide. Consequently, the road broken that
leads to adverse affect on nearby buildings, specially the drainage route on Le Tan Trung          M

d. Domestic Wastewater
Impacts on water environment are mainly caused by domestic wastewater of workers. Major
pollutants in wastewater are suspended solids (SS), organic compounds (BOD/COD), nutrients
(Nitrogen, Phosphorus) and pathogens (Coliform, E. Coli).
The flowrate is calculated on the basis of norms and number of workers. Under the city standards,
the water supply rate for a person by 2015 is I25Uday4. Thus, the wastewater rate is about 80010 of
supplied water (IOOUperson/day). It is estimated of 20 workers in one camp in average. Thus, the
flowrate ofworker domestic wastewater is about 2 m3/day.
The impact is generally not sidnificant for small construction site, but they can affect the urban
landscape and be required reasonable mitigation measures.
e. Overflows
The overflows include:
           Storm water overflowing through construction site will sweep away soil, sand into
           water-flow and cause obstruction and sedimentation for riverllake and pollute receiving
           surface water source.
           Low-level groundwater and rainwater can be stagnant in the uncompleted foundations.
           Normally contractors will now pump it out to continue processing the work. Pumping
           out water will be unsanitary and increased suspended-solid pollution for receiving
           sources.
This effect is accessed moderate and mitigable.
f. Solid waste
       •   Construction waste
In the construction period, construction solid waste generated includes cement, bricks, sand,
stone, wood, scrap, and spilling materials. This kind of wastes is relatively small and inert, so it
could be re-used for the purpose of ground leveling.

       •    Dredged sludge
    In sub-component B52, the majority of box culverts are located under new roadways and
    sidewalks. Thus, digging soil is considered clean and usable to fill up after the construction.
    In addition, approximately 110m3 sludge is dredged because part of the culvert going
    through a current drainage ditch (L 367m x 1m wide) from Le Tan Trung to the East Sea.
    This culvert is steep, so the sludge accumulation is not much and has no smell. The amount
    of dredged sludge is around O.3m. Due to small amount of this sludge, we can dump with
    the sludge dredged in Hoa Minh cannal in Phase 2A. The area is near residential areas,
    dredging sludge can cause smell and spread sludge in the environment that need to
    minimize during the construction process.

   •       Hazardous waste
During construction, grease and oil residuals may be generated from maintaining and repairing
vehicle and machinery. According to technical documents, the average oil residual from
construction machinery is around 7 liters per change of oil and the period of changing is every
3 - 6 months. If the number of vehicles and construction machinery is estimated 30, the oil
surplus would be 35 to 70 liters/month. Such residual grease and oil are listed as hazardous
wastes (code: A3020, Basel: Y8). The waste can be droped on land and polluted clothes for
cleaning machines, which will cause adversely significant affect on enriroment if they are
wasted in the environment. The impact is accessed moderate and need to minimize.
Concrete used in the installation are also listed as hazardous waste. However, with small
quantities of it can be collected and buried at the location specified, as required by law.



                                                                                                                                          76
EIA ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project Phase 2B

   •   Municipal solid waste
Estimated solid waste is approximately 10 kg/day based on 0.5 kg/person/day and assuming
that the workers are allowed to have meals at the site. This waste quantity is insignificant and
will be collected and treated by the collection contractors. The impact is assessed moderate and
mitigable.
g. Risks ofLocalflooding
In the construction phase of the drainage system, local flooding may occur due to lack of
measures to redirect the flow and to prevent the material washed into the drainage system,
especially in the heavy rains.
h. TraffIC safety
Most of the sewer systems construct through the planned areas, major roads, residential area,
and traffic density is low, except the sewer pipe passes through Le Tan Trung street and the
other goes through Ngo Thi Nham street to Hoa Minh channel is populated dense and high
traffic density. The fencing used for dust prevention shoul d be considered the distance of traffic
safety. In addition, some activities can affect traffic congestion and accidents on the road. Here
are some typical image, such as:

       Storing debris and materials on the main road and untidy sites. 

       Lack of facilities, signage, traffic guidance lights; 

       Operation of construction machines and equipments on the sites without following the 

       rules can cause traffic jam and risk of accidence for travelers. 


Several similar projects in the country, risk of accidents for travelers is cited (Figure 5-4, 5-5)
as a typical example for contractors to find appropriate mitigation measures during
construction.

   •   Other infrastructure services
The sub-component B52 and B53 construction may cause damage to other infrastructure
services such as electric cables, telecom cables and supply water systems if the design does not
review underground facilities which pass through the area project and the contractor does not
have any mitigation measures. The impacts rarely occur, but if that happens, the impact will be
very serious. The impact is rated moderate and required mitigation measures.




                                                                                                77

     •    Local business
 Road excavation will negatively affect business activities of the households in the project area.
 Level of negative impact to business operations depend on the following factors:
          Access to the household business: the establishment of temporary paths for local people
          is necessary. However, some projects have ignored this request and make shops
          isolated.
         Duration of the construction phase: the slower construction period, the greater
         influence.
         Temporary storage of materials and excavated soil on the sidewalk;
         Poor recovery of road surface;
         Dispersed dust in the construction phase affects product quality, especially for the food
         business;
 i. Social disturbance
Small number of workers at each site, the local authorities of Da Nang city are people who
participate in managing the project, therefore the impact is negligible.
j. Working safety
         Lack of safety gears and equipment for workers; 

         Workers' incompliance with regulations on working safety; 

         Electrical incidents, lightning, fire and explosion. 

This impact could happen to any works. If the contractor fails to comply with legal regulations
on working safety, it is likely to cause unfortunate consequences in tenns of workers'
psychology and health. The impact is significant and must be mitigated.
k. Landscapce
In the construction of drainage system, urban landscape could be affected by :
         Excavation activities cause dust which affect on visibility of passenger;
         Inappropriate leveling   ~   fragmented road surface;
         Visual obstructions caused by construction barriers and equipments;
         Tree clearance;
         Lacking of management of excavated materials, spoiling and creating open dump sites;
         Careless recovery of road surfaces causes stagnancy on the street;
A.2. OPERA TION PHASE
In general, the impacts during the operation phase of sub-components B52, B53 are mainly
positive such as the improvement in the urban landscape; reduction of bad smells due to the
construction drainage system and innovation of CSO; reduction of flooding hazard; improved
water quality and remarkable improvement in community health due to decrease in water-borne
diseases. Besides, there are several negative impact with small scale and easily mitigated.


a. Low household connection

                                                                                              78
ElA ofDa Nang Priority Injra.<;trocture Investment Project   Phase 2B

According to the study of Carl Bro, 2009, the percentage of household connection to the
sewage and drainage system is about 20%. This situation leads to the lack of BOD in influent at
the WWTP, meanwhile most of the wastewater from households discharge directly into the
environment. As a result, the environment continues to be deteriorated, while the system is
invested to be ready to collect and convey the wastewater from the families to the WWTP.
Thus, increasing the percentage of households' connection to the system will play an important
role in accelerating the effectiveness of the investment.
h. Noise and smell generlltedfrom pumping stations, CSOS and outlets
Noise and smell generated from the pumping station, CSOs and outlets is insignificant due to
their improvement to overcome the existing PS and CSOS. The pumpers are immerged in water
and in covered boxes, so the noise generation from them is limited. eso is innovated with one
way valve to prevent sand and sea and river water flowing back the system. This has overcome
the previous situation that sand blocks the system, preventing wastewater to run to the pumping
stations and storm water to discharge into the receiving water body, which produces smell at
outlets. A typical location of diversion chamber is illustrated at Figure 5-6.




                       Figure 5-6 A typicallocalion ofdiversion chamber
c. Health affect
Toxic gases such as J.hS, CO2 and sludge are generated inside the system, which can be
harmful to maintenance workers. However, one ventilation fan is installed in each pumping
station for ventilation before maintaining and dredging sludge. The impact is insignificant and
could be mitigated if workers are trained and provided with adequate protection.
B. SUB-COMPONENT B: TRUNG NGHIA LAKE
R.I. CONSTRUCTIONPHASE
Trung Nghia North Lake is located in the middle of Trung Nghia residential area (Hoa Minh
ward, Lien Chieu district). As described in Chapter 2, the lake functions as water reservoir
which receives run-off from Trung Nghia area and discharging to Phu Loc River through the
culvert box (B14 package). There are not many trees around the lake, one side is adjacent to the
railway; the other sides are adjacent small roads. There is sparsely populated with temporary

houses only. The lake is covered with weeds and dirts without any ecological as well as
economic value.




              Figure 5-7 and 5-8 Current situation ofNorthern Tnmg Nghia Lake
Under the package B52, embankment and landscape recreation are executed for the lake.
According to CDM, the lake bank is constructed on the ground, so there is no demand for
sludge dredging. Excavated soil is considered as clean soil that can be reused for leveling. The
negative impacts could mainly be dust, gas pollutant emission and noise generated from
exavation and transportation activities, which will increase concentration in the area. However,
the lake traverses in a large area with scattered poppulation, the impact is insignificant and
could be mitigated by mitigation measures applied in other simple constructions such as
watering the materials in site and the vehicles must follow the Transportion Laws when
operation for the project.
B.l. OPERATIONPHASE
Positive imapact:
Based on the current characteristics and construction activities, renovation of Trung nghia lake
will bring many benefits to the community as environmental and lanscape improvement. After
the completed lake bank of 922.63m length, the lake will contain 162,366m3 run storm water,
which not only creates a landscape area of 36,902m2 located in the middle of city, but could
reduce flooding in the area,
Nel!ative impacts:
The surface water and the landscape could be polluted with domestic solid and wastewater
because of bad habit of dwellers and poor management of municiple authority,
The deep water in the lake could be dangerous fro children playing in the place without
carefullly mamaged by their parents.
The impact is significant and must be mitigated.

    Scale of impacts:

    Assumption: Duration of construction is about 2 years, of which about 01 months for
    excavation surface layer, 12 months for leveling the WWTPs, and 11 months for constructing
    infrastructure and installing equipment. Therefore, the number of workers at site depends on
    specific conditions, fluctuating about 10 - 30 persons in one worker camp.

Before leveling the ground, the 10cm- top layer should be taken out. The soil from rice field is
suitable for leveling the ground after removing waste, grass, tree residues and so on.



                                                                                                      81

 Dust will increase significantly when leveling is implemented with high volume (314.400 m3)
 in Hoa Xuan WWTP. It is assumed that 15ton truck is used for transport in 12 months; the
 number of trip is about 65 turns per day for levelling Hoa Xuan WWTP and 8 turns for Lien
 Chieu WWTP. The soil/ sand are usually dry. The process of downing soil/material from truck
 onto ground will create dust. Because of large construction area, installing fences for
 preventing dust is not economic. Therefore, the dust can be spread by wind and affect the
 surrounding residential area. The impact is significant, short term and must be mitigated.
 Similarly for Lien Chieu WWTP, there are about 8 trips per day. However dust dispersion from
 downing soil and transport will be considerable in the dry season, low humidity.
        •   Dust and air pollutants emissions from material transportation
 Average a day has 65 trips of 15ton truck runs from borrow pit from Hoa Son Hoa Yang to
 Hoa Xuan WWTP the plant. Therefore, concentration of dust and air pollutant emission such as
 NO x, CO, S02 and CxHy will increase along the route, which will impact travelers and those
 live near to the route. The impact is short-term but significant and must be mitigated.
 b. Noise and vibration
 The noise and vibration generated by construction and traffic activities is inevitable. However,
 due to simple construction, and far from residential areas, the impact is short term and
 negligible.
 c. Wastewater
        •   Domestic wastewater
 As assumption above, the workers for each time at one WWTP is around 10-30 people. The
 amount of domestic wastewater generated is approximately about 2-3 m3 per day. However,
 because of contamination of the waste (described in section d of A of 5.3.2.2), wastewater need
 to be collected.
        •   Overflow
Rainwater overflow will be entrained solid waste on the surface of construction area and will
discharge to the receiving resources, cause pollution and sedimentation of rivers and lakes nearby.
For the Hoa Xuan WWTP construction site, water overflow will affect water quality ofVinh Dien
River; for the Lien Chieu WWTP construction site will affect the Cu De River Basin. The impact
was assessed a insignificant, short-term and can be minimized.
d. Solid waste: assessed same as section f ofA.I of5.2.2.2.
e. Risks ofLocal flooding
The WWTPs locate in low-land areas. When the project is implemented, the ground surface
will level from 4.5m - 6m in Hoa Xuan WWTP and 5m Lien Chieu WWTP. If no drainage
ditches is installed around the plants, the ability of river flooding is high. The impact is
significant and short-term and could be minimized.
f.    Traffic safety
Traffic safety problems in the construction of two WWTPs only related to the sand transport
and construction materials transport to the project area. According to the calculations on the
highest number of truck-trip is the leveling period (about 65 trips per day for 12 months),
traffic density from material borrow pits to construction areas will increase, especially when

 many project take place at the same time. The impact is short-term but significant and must be
 mitigated.
 g. Other infrastructure services
 This effect is negligible and can be ignored because the plant is built on agricultural land where
 the infrastructure development is poor.
 h. Local business
 The impact is more positive than negative because the construction does not block or disturb
 business activities. The workers probably increase their demands on food which is
 advantageous for dwellers along the transportation road and closely to the sites of exploiting
 materials and leveling ground.
 i. Social Disturbance: similar to assessment in A.I of5.2.2.2.
 j. Working safety: similar to assment in A.I of5. 2. 2. 2.
 k. Erosion ofriver bank
 Constructing discharging pipelines to the outlets, the activities will cause erosion in Vinh Dien
 riverside and Hoa Khanh canal, if no action is taken to empower the river bank. The impact is
 insignificant.
 C2. OPERA TION PHASE
 a. Air environment
 The air environment is mainly polluted by smell from the collection, treatment and discharge of
 waste.
  Table 5-8 shows sources of smells.

              Smell of wastewater and exhaust fumes
Smell arises from most stages of the wastewater treatment process as shown in Table 5-8.
Moreover the buffer zones in two WWTPs of Lien Chieu and Hoa Xuan do not meet TCVN
7222: 2002/BTNMT, which provides regulation for buffer zones (without drying sludge);
WWTPs having capacity from 5000 - 30,000m 3/day.night is 210m and from 30,000 ­
          3
50,000m 1 day.night is 210 - 350m. QCVN 07:20101BXD (buffer of 40m wide) is reviewed for
the application, therefore, the spread of smell in the environment is possible and requires a
strict and modern technology for collecting and treating smell. In accordance with QCVN 07:
20 101BXD, all locations possible to make smell should be sealed and have thoroughly smell
collection and treatment system before being discharged into the environment.
This impact is high and requires mitigation measures.



                                                                                              83

  b. Surface and grollnd water
  Since most of construction items of the plant were constructed by reinforced concrete with
  waterproofing layer, the ability of wastewater leakage without treatment into the soil affecting
  groundwater is negligible. Therefore the project focuses on assessment of impacts of treated
  wastewater to the quality of receiving surface water.
  c. Calculation ofreceiving capacity ofsurface water 

  Boa Xuan WWTP 

  Wastewater after treatment is discharged into Vinh Dien river (Tu Cau river) at Coordinate N: 

  15°59'17.4"; E: 1080 l3'19.3''. 

  Selected parameters for calculation of receiving capacity of surface water at discharge point are 

  BODs, N-N03 and SS due to the nature of domestic wastewater. 

     • 	 It is assumed that these pollutants do not react in the receiving water body.
     • 	 The flow and upstream loading are constant.
     • 	 The river section is negligibly influenced by tidal regime because slope ofTu Cau River
         is high,
     • 	 It is completely mixed at the discharge point.
     • 	 The river serves for waterway transportation only (Cad Bro, 2009; CDM 2011).


 In order to assess the receiving capacity of Tu Cau River where treated wastewater from Hoa
 Xuan WWTP is discharged to, the calculation is based on Circular No. 0212009IBTNMT dated
 on 19/3/2009 by MONRE.

      Receiving capacity of                  Maximum loading of               Baseline loading of
          water body                =            pollutants             +        water body

 Review of results: Based on the load calculation by the method of conservation of mass, if
 Ltn>O, the water source is capable of receiving wastewater at the worst case that 100%
 wastewater is untreated and directly discharged into the environment. The results of
 calculations show that the Ltn of BOD5, N-N03 and SS is positive with high safety. Moreover,
 the frequency that 8 modules are broken at the same time plant is very low because the Plant is
 modem and taken into account the design of a flood elevation to prevent submerge and the
 equippment of generators, which are ready to operate when the power grid is cut.

 Conclusion: Currently, the treatment capacity of 20,000 m3/day-night of Xuan Hoa WWTP is
 very safe for receiving sources. The Plant can be expanded to two modules by 2030 and 8
 modules in full by 2040. However, the natural parameters such as drought and tides can
 fluctuate over time, which can affect the forecast accuracy of the model in the future. So before
 deciding to expand the Plant to 320,000 m3/day-night, it is necessary for us to measure very
 carefully receiving source parameters and wastewater parameters to protect the receiving
 surface water sources. In cases of natural fluctuations, the possibility of receiving sources is
 less than the current forecast, the following solutions can be considered:

    1. 	 Maintain pumping stations in Hoa Cuong WWTP to pump water to Xuan Hoa WWTP
         in normal condition. When there are problems, part of sewage can be temporarily
         discharged into Cam Le River where Hoa Cuong WWTP is discharging to reduce
         overload for Tu Cau River.
    2. 	 The pumping chambers for Hoa Xuan WWTP are manually operated systems. When
         problems occur, the pump chambers can be temporarily closed in order that wastewater
         can flow through Damp CSOs at the reception environment.

Lien Chieu WWTP

Selection of calculation scenario:

Based on the wastewater municipal strategic management and the feasibility report mentioned
in Table 5-13, the following scenarios are selected for calculations.
Scenario 1: 20,000 m 3/day-night
Scenario 2: 40,000 m 3/day-night
                      3
Scenario 3: 80,000m /day-night
Scenario 4: 120,000 m 3/day-night

Assuming in the worst case, all modules are broken and 100% untreated sewage is discharged
directly into Cu De Rier.

Information on receiving sources:

The discharge point of Lien Chieu WWTP is on a branch of Cu De River at coordinate N:
16°5'19".9; E: 108°7'4.7", which is 80m wide and 25m deep. The upstream of the discharge
point of wastewater is affected by Hoa Khanh industrial zone. The usage aim of the river water
downstream is navigation. Suppose that the wastewater of Hoa Khanh.Industrial Zone does not
change (Document No..... of Danang Department of Natural Resource and Environment), the
quality of the reception source will not change.

Estimate of water flow:

Cu De River, which is subject to north and south rivers from Truong Son mountain range has
quite large water velocity. The water velocity at the discharge point ranges from 0.1 to l.2m/s,
according to the report of CDM in 2011 (Figure 5-9).

        Result: Similarly, the Ltn of scenario 1, 2, 3> 0 and scenario 4, Lnt <0, demonstrate that the
        water only accept the safety capability of 80.000 m 3/day-night in case of 100% untreated
        wastewater is directly discharged into the environment. In case of operating at full capacity of
        120,000m3/day-night, the receiving source will be likely unable to accept if there is a problem
        that 100% wastewater is discharged directly into river.

        Conclusion: In the first phase, when the capacity reaches 20,000m 3/day-night, the water
        source is capable of receiving 100% untreated wastewater. The Plant can be expanded to a
        safe capacity of 2 modules by 2040. But the source is not capable enough to receive the direct
        untreated discharge of 120,000 m 3/day-night of the Plant into the environment. The main
        reason is because the selected location for the current wastewater discharge is affected by the
        upstream of Hoa Khanh industrial zone. It is proposed that in the future, Lien Chieu WWTP
        can expand to a capacity of 120,000m3/day-night if the location moves toward the main
        branch ofCu De River downstream to reduce the water resonance ofHoa Khanh waste.
        Surely, 30 years later, there are changes in the receiving water due to the climate change
        impact. Therefore, to safe the receiving water, the City necessarily measures and assesses the
        receiving capability of the water source to take appropriate solutions.

    Quality of sludge: The sludge or bio-solids generates from both the primary and secondary
    processes. The sludge from the primary clarifier contains 3 to 8% solids and secondary sludge
    contains 0.5 - 2% solids (Charles.P. Gerba, et ai, 1996).
   The amount of crude sludge, sand and large-sized waste are transported to Khanh Son landfill.
   Particularly, biological sludge having good quality can be used to produce organic fertilizer.
   Based on the analysis in Chapter 3, the sludge should be treated, molded and buried at Khanh
   Son landfill in the absence of an organic fertilizer plant to receive.
        • 	 Domestic solid waste
   Domestic waste generated from construction workers can be calculated based on the
   minimum numbers of worker working in plant (14-21 people are estimated). The estimated
   quantity of generated waste is about 7 - 10.5kg/day based on 0.5 kg/person/day and it is
   assumed that workers are allowed to have means at site. This quantity of waste is insignificant
   and will be collected and treated by the contractor under the contract agreement.
        • 	 Hazardous waste
   Hazardous wastes in the plant include chlorine disinfection in the location where receiving
   chemical into and chemical store. Lubricants and lubricating for pump and repaired
   equipment area. We need to be collected for re-use or disposed as Vietnamese regulation.
   d. Runoffwater
   Rainwater overflow can carry wastewater leakage, sewage sludge leakage, or chemical
   leakage to watershed and affect the quality of the receiving source. However, according to the
   plant design, all wastewater and sludge will be collected to be treated. Because chemicals will
   be designed to recover and treated separately, leaking chemical risk maybe happen in accident
   cases (very rarely), the impact is small if the pollution source is managed carefully.
   e. Health effects
       • 	 Hydrogen Sulfide (H2§l
   H2S is classed as a chemical asphyxiant, similar to carbon monoxide and cyanide gases. It
   inhibits cellular respiration and uptake of oxygen, causing biochemical suffocation. Typical

  However, as designed, the content of H2S reduces 99% after deodorizing smells in a closed
  collection system. Workers work in the spacious airy environment with trees around the
  factory, so the impact is negligible.



                                                                                                                              93

     •   Chlorine gas
 Chlorine gas is harmful to eyes, skins and respiratory system, if workers contact it without
 careful protection.
 Chlorine is toxic but it is designed to disinfect wastewater thank to the automatic exposure
 system, the direct contact of workers is very low. Stocks are closed and well ventilated, so the
 impact is considered minor and reducible.
    •    Pathogens
 According to document "Biological hazards at wastewater treatment facilities " (WEF, 1991),
 workers who work in the wastewater treatment plant will suffer from several risks in term of
 health when contact with pathogenic micro-organism in wastewater and sludge .

Contact with compost       Effects on the contacted skin


Aerosol and mist from wastewater treatment works can be the source to disperse virus and
bacteria. The worker can catch bacterium contamination through respiration or skin contact.
However, all the working equipments are covered to meet QCVN 07: 2010/ BXD. Therefore
the impact can be significantly reduced.
Conclusion: The effect is minimized if workers are trained and the plant operates
professionally and seriously. Moderate and long-term impacts must be minimized.
D. UPGRADING SON TRA PUMPING STATION SUBCOMPONENT
Dl PRE-CONSTRUCTIONPHASE
The Project extends in 2 hectares; the plant buffer does not meet TCVN 7222: 20021BTNMT.
The option for this buffer in accordance with QCVN 07:20101BXD will be considered.
Therefore, the design will take into account the posibility of smell collection, smell treatment
before being discharged into the environment.
D2 CONSTRUCTION PHASE
   a. Dust
The scope of improvement is very little except irrigation canals and reservoirs. Dust generated
during the construction is negligible.
   b. Sludge dredging
Before the construction, one lake is dried for sludge dredging. Sludge is dredged in usual way
that the Plant is being periodically used and discharged at Khanh Son landfill. The impact of
sludge dredging is rated moderate and should be minimized.
   c. Quality ofsurface water ofsluice-gate
The flow, 9688m3/day-night is retained in the processing lake 03 days. Currently, because of
upgrading one lake, the retention time will be shortened by 1.5 days. Theoretically, the water


                                                                                            94
 EIA - Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project, Stage 2B

 quality will be less because of shortening processing time. However, the lake is static
 anaerobic, so the exposure of wastewater to MLSS is very low. As the result, waste removal is
 very little. According to the analysis of Carl-Bro, 2009, the effectiveness of BOD5
 elimination is 30% of the existing WWTP. Thus the level of influence on surface water
 sources is negligible compared to the past when the renovation time is estimated 30 days.
 »3 OPERATION PHASE
           a. Smell: lower than the old treatment system because half of the treatment system is
              aerobic.
           b. Solid waste: sludge formation is less than the old treatment system
           c. The quality of the receiving surface water sources are less affected than the previous
              because the output wastewater quality is better

Thus constructing the road leads to 253,311 m2 land recovered, of which 32,463m2 of
residential land and 220,808m2 of agricultural land and 367 households affected, of which 80
households have to be relocated.
This impact is significantly negative because it affects greatly on 367 households. In addition,
with large land area is taken, this component will cause significant loss in local agricultural
production. However, these areas are low-lying and often being flooded, the changing of land­
use purpose is suitable. In the future, the land-use change could benefit local residents.
b. Technical design
       •     Flooding
The terrain along the road passing Vinh Dien River and Co Co River is flat. The elevation
between the river and the surrounding terrain is not high. Therefore, water often overflows the
river into the field causing a widespread flooding. Bau Cung, Bien Kyand Bau Duong is the
vestige of the old river which flows from Vinh Dien River and Han River to the Sea and had
been filled. Currently, Khai Tay 2, Hoa Quy commune is the heavily flooded area. Villagers

 say when the water rises about 1 m, the water overflows the trail of the old river into the fields
 where the southern link road acrosses. So when designing the culvert placement, we should
 analyze the flood flow to avoid erosion of road embankment and minimize the risks of flood
 (Opinion of Mr. Nguyen Ba Linh, Khai Tay 2 village).

       •    Waterway

 Co Co river is not continent for waterway because it is dammed one side, however Cai river
 belongs to level IV for waterway with dimensions as B x H = 25 x 3,5m.

 5.2.3.2 Construction phase
 Component C includes two sub-components: the construction of Southern Link Road (A) and
 the construction 02 bridges, Hoa Phuoc bridge acrosses Cai Rier and Co Co bridge acrosses
 Co Co river(B).

 A. SOUTHERN LINK ROAD
 Constructing the road is related to the transportation of a significant volume of materials from
 borrow pits to the construction sites. Aanalyzing to find a convenient way for transporting
 materials to avoid damage road and traffic jam is very important.

 a. Selection ofmaterial transportation routes

       •   Positions ofpotential pits for the constntction

The borrow pits used for constructing phase 2B are the same as those used for phase 2A. They
are located in Hoa Son commune and Hoa Nhon commune, Hoa Yang district, Da Nang city.
The soil is mainly composed of gravel and sandy clay. The site is estimated to have a reserve
of>I,000,000m3. The pit is I8km away from Nguyen Tri Phuong bridge and 28.5km from the
road end point in Hoa Quy. The transporting road is accessible. Presently the borrow pit is in
use for the construction work in the area.

     • 	 Transport route

 The material pits are at Hoa Yang district where access routes to the site are very convenient.
 They use the National Road lA, National Road 14B and access to the construction site from
 the south of the city. This helps to avoid cutting through the city.

 National Highway lA to the project station has two main approaches:

     1. 	 The main transport direction passing Highway lA, Highway 14 through Tuyen Son
          Bridge to Tran Dai Nghia, Mai Dang Chon and ending at a new construction road
          (near Co Co River).
     2. 	 Onother direction from CMT8 road, Highway lA and goes ahead to the starting point
          of the road at Ian 0 + 000.
  Furthermore, the contractors can use the waterways to transport the materials.

Before leveling the road, about 10cm of organic surface soil is dredged and removed out of
the site. Southern road crosses the paddy field, so the organic sludge dredged will be rich in
nutrients and "clean". It is good for tree planting. Therefore, it will be used for returning the
baseline conditions for exploited material pits in Hoa Yang district. However, the excavation
can generate dust.                              .

Dust generation/day = Vexcavation* E(O.l23kg/m3)* 1.2 103,596 * 0.123* 1,2/365days =
41,9kg/day. The quantity of dust genetation is quite big. In additon, currently, Mai Dang
Chon, Tran Dai Nghia roads are plluted by dust generation from other project. The dust
concentrations is from 250 - 360 /lg/m3 compared to 300 /lg/m3 in accordance with QCVN
05:2010. However, the material transport routes can be used CMT8 road and Nguyen Tri
Phuong road in case the road is completed or through the National High-way IA at KrnO+OOO
to the beggining point of construction site (The Southern Link Road). The impact is
significant but could be mitigated.

      •   Dust and air pollutant emissions

Vtransport = 595,477m3 ; the truck of 15 tons is used for transporting with the 2-round distance
of 20km. The sand is taken from Hoa Son and Hoa Yang.

 The existing concentrations of NO x , S02 and CO in project area are within the permission. It
 is considered that the road intersects with Mai Dang Chon at kIn Km2 + 621.38, Tran Dai
 Nghia at km Km4+958.23 Da Nang Tourism College being built and Truong Sa road at the
 end, so the density of transportation there will probably be high. The impact is medium and
 must be mitigated.

 c. Concrete and asphalt mixing

The project requires a large amount of concrete and asphalt In the epidemiological survey of
workers involved in production of tar they discovered that the incidence of lung cancer is
higher than the increase of cancer or other toxic effects in studies of workers involved in the
production and use of asphalt. These regular symptoms when contacting in a long time are
dyspnea and aesthetic. Therefore, the location of the plant must be at least 500m far away
from the residential areas and workers must be provided with protecting equipments to reduce
the impact.

d. Noise and vibration

Noise and vibration increases in the project area due to constructing and transporting machine
operations. However the impact is insignificant because most of the project area is located far
from residential area. It is noted when constructing closely to 15, 17 and 18 residential
groups, Khai Tay village, Hoa Qui ward, Ngu Hanh Son.

e. Wastewater

Assumed that water consumption is 125U person, the quantity of wastewater is 125*80% =
100Uday/person * 50-100 pers = 5 - IOm J/day. The pollution caused be domestic wastewater
is considerable, if it is not collected and properly treated.

According to statistical calculations for the developing countries of the WHO, the coefficients
of pollution are presented in Table 5-16.

However, the impact could be mitigated by apply septic tanks at site. Concentration of
pollutants in domestic wastewater could be reduced significantly after treatment in septic
tanks is presented in table 5-17

f. Run offwater
Polluted rainwater overflows the construction site due to excavation and installation of
pipelines. Overflow rainwater contains high concentration of SS. Onsite material storage also
causes pollution that affects on the water environment.

Overflow water from spray vehicles and water in the pits contains suspended solids, oil. The
volume of water is subject to the number of vehicles access to the site. The water volume is
discharged from spray vehicles are about 50-100 litters/truck of 10 tons.

g. Solid waste

      •   Domestic solid waste
It is estimated about 25-50 kg/day with references to the emission factor of 0.5kg/personlday
and 50 - 100 workers/site. If the waste is located in unsafe places, it shall cause unhygienic
condition at sites and adverse impact on the community health, ambient air and water
environment. The impact is assessed to be small and mitigable.
    •     Construction solid waste
In the construction period, construction solid waste generated includes cement, bricks, sand,
stone, wood, scrap, and spilling materials. This kind of wastes is relatively small and inert, so
it could be re-used for the purpose of ground leveling. The impact is assessed to be small and
controlable
    •     Hazardous solid waste
Generally, there are many transportation and construction equipment at construction sites.
Therefore, lubricating the pulley crane could fall into the water and land. Otherwise, repairs as
well as maintenance of machinery at construction sites, oil, grease cloth can become toxic
agents to the natural environment and human health. Impacts are rated significantly if the
contractor is not fully awareness about its effects or not well organized for the collection and
proper treatment.

h. Traffic disturbance and safety

As calculated above, l30 turns of IS ton- truck are mobilized in 12 months for leveling the
road, the negative impacts on traffic issues and roads are unavoidable. As analysed at item
"transport route", transportation through CMT8 road must be better than through Mai Dang

                                                                                             103

Chon. However 130 rounds travelling per day on only one road is impossible because it can
damage the road and cause traffic jam. It is suggested that other ways should be used such as
from NW No 1 direct to the Road at km 0.000 or use completed Nguyen Tri Phuong to access
the end side of Road. The impact is significant but could be mitigated.

i. SocioJ disturbance
The number of workers mobilized for construction bridges and road is considerably over 100
people and camped in the locality. If the contractor does not cooperate to the local authorities
to manage workers who working overtime, possible disagreements between local people and
workers can occur. However, because the construction site is located far from residential areas
so the impact can be minimized so the impact is insignificant.

j. Working safety
Lack of safety gears and equipment for workers~ Workers' incompliance with regulations on
working safety; Electrical incidents, lightning, fire and explosion. This impact could happen to
any works. If the contractor fails to comply with legal regulations on working safety, it is
likely to cause unfortunate consequences in terms of psychology and health of workers.

k. Local business
The impact is more positive than negative because the construction does not block or disturb
business activities but drivers and workers concentrate on the site and along the road of
transportation. This probably increase their demands on food water, essentials, which leads to
be more dynamic in business activities of dwellers trading along the transportation road and
closely to the sites of exploring materials and leveling ground.

    B. CONSTRUCTION OF BRIDGE
The impacts such as air pollutant emission, noise caused by the constructing machines and
equipment and domestic wastes from worker at the site are similarly assessed as constructing
the Southern Link Road, the environmental impacts on constructing bridges are focussed on
waste discharged from pile drill, waterways and embankment erosion and landslide.
a. Benthonite in drilling piles

                                                Bentonite is an absorbent phyllosilicate, in general,
                                                impure clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite.
                                                There are different types of bentonites, and their names
                                                depend on the dominant elements such as potassium
                                                (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and aluminum (AI). 8

 the quality of benthonite is required to meet TCVN 326: 2004/BXD. Thus, the impact of
 using benthonite in drilling piles on the environment is negligible due to its nature and with a
 small percentage.

 However, during drilling piles, the most concerned issue is that the mixture of rock, sludge
 and debris may spill out. This is a potential source of impact to water quality and aquatic
 creatures. On average, one pile with D ::= I ,2m drilled in the depth of 50m will spill out 56m 3
 (0.6m*0.6m*3.l416*50m ::= 56m\ The quantity of sludge mixture is 174 (Hoa phuoc bridge
 144 piles + Co Co 30 piles) * 56m 3 = 9,744m3• If the mixture is discharged directly into the
 river, it increases turbidity and reduces ligh penetration. This not only impacts the quality of
 river water but water ecosystem, especially benthic community. The impact is significant and
 could be mititgated.

 b. Aquatic ecosystem
 Constructing bridges is related to drilling piles and drop solid waste into the water that may
 temporarily impact on the water quality and disturb aquatic especially benthic creature in
 Vinh Dien and Co Co River around the bridges.

        Pollute the water due to increased turbidity, suspended solid, organic matter from 

        disturbed sediments, reducing the concentration of dissolved oxygen and 

        photosynthesis of algae and aquatic life. 

        Cause water pollution by waste, oil of construction equipment, damaging aquatic life. 

        Temporarily change the structure of River bottom, kill or change bottom creatures. 

        Combination of these factors can cause River ecosystem impainnent, reducing 

        biological diversity. However, the ecosystem of Tu Cau and Vinh Dien Rivers does 

        not have special or valuable species. The negative impact is partial and temporary, 

        small scale and mitigable. A few months after the end of construction, the River bed 

        structure and ecosystem will be stable and recovered waste. 


c. Disturbance to bottom sludge
According to the study of Nguyen Van Khanh and Pham Van Hiep (Da Nang University) on
the accumulation of Pb and Cd in clam (2009), the concentrations of Pb and Cd in bottom
sludge in Da Nang rivers are 28.88 ± 11.30 ppm and 2.66 ± 1.55 ppm, respectively. In
comparison with the standards for bottom sludge of Canada ISQG, Pb concentration is still
within the acceptable level (30.2ppm) but Cd is higher than permitted value from 2.01-3.80
times (0.7ppm). However, these concentrations do not exceed the hazardous threshold in
QCVN 07:2009 (lOppm for Cd and 300ppm for Pb).
The pollutants from the bottom sludge can be dissolved during the construction. It can affect
to the aquatic living. However, the impacts are not significant because there is no aquacultural
activity in Cu De and Vinh Dien river.

d. Soil erosion at riversides
The construction of bridge will reduce the cross-section area, so the velocity and water height
will be increased and the risk of soil erosion could happen. Nevertheless, the pile driving
construction method will not affect greatly on the river bank because the hole diameter is
small, about l.2m.
e. Working safety
The risk of working accidents can occur in all works with different level of danger, in which
bridge construction is more dangerous, particularly workers working at 3m high and expose to


                                                                                            105
 EIA report ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project - Phase 2B

 electrical equipment in the water environment like welding, drilling bored piles. This will
 become serious if the working safety is not proper concerned.
 The impacts are rated high and need mitigation measures.
 5.2.1.1 Operation phase
 Road and bridges have the similar impacts during the operation phase.
 5.2.1.1.1 Positive impacts
 In overall, the Southern Link Road and two Hoa Phuoc and Co Co bridges, after completion,
 will extend the traffic network from the West stretching down the East Coast of the city. The
 alignment will create favour conditions to support the rural people especially in Hoa Qui, Hoa
 Hai, Ngu Hanh Son, and Hoa Yang to access and benefit the public services such as heath
 care, educations, and cultural activities located in the central area. It also creates more
 opportunities for the people to improve their income and reduce poverty through trading
 activities, access markets and land use changes.
 Besides, the negative impacts are not entirely avoidable, which needs to apply feasible
 measures to eliminate them to acceptable levels.
 5.2.3.3.2 Negative Impacts
Negative impact during operation the road is focused on air pollution, noise and vibration
traffic safety caused by transportation, affect of run off water on the receiving water body, and
o & M worker health
a. Air pollution

    •   Air emission from transportation means

Completed road will create opportunities for transportation. The number of means probably
passing by the road is estimated as Table 5-18.

This means that air pollutants such as CxHy, N02, CO, C02, VOC and TSP emitted from the
exhaustion of vehicles increase, which impacts adversely on the quality of air environment
and human health, especially those living closely to the road. The level of impacts depends
on types of vehicles transporting and their loading and the environmental conditions
surrounding the road. The air pollutant loadings of different vehicles are presented at Table
5-19.

    The demand of transport on the road certainly increases year by year, which leads to the
    increase of the air pollutant loadings. However, except road crossed with Highway No.1, Mai
    Dang Chon, Tran Dai Nghia and Son Tra - Dien Ngoc, most of the road crosses the rice field
    with scattered population. The impact is insignificant, long term and must be mitigated.

    b. Noise and vibration

    Noise and vibration generated from vehicle machines, contacting between the wheels and
    road surface and using horns. Based on the forecast of transportation flow in 2015 and 2020,
    the noise level on the roadside could be estimated as following:
    Table 5-20 Noise level on the roadside
I                         Year                                    2015                     2020

          21h - 6h
    Noise level is expected to increase from 2015 to 2020 and within 15m from the roadside, it
    does not meet standards. The impact is small and long term, therefore, the planting strips as a
    noise barrier are recommended.
c. Traffic safety
When the Road is completed, the increase in the number of vehicles is expected to increase
traffic accidents. The accident is always a concern of society, especially on new routes
connecting the rural areas and urban development. The main reason is the incompleted signal
system and lighting as well as knowledge of the driver. However, these routes are in the
transportation system's main city of Da Nang, so signage and support of traffic police will
work to minimize accidents. Impacts are rated moderate, but long and should take measures to
mmlmlze..

 d. Surface water
The main pollutants from the operation of the bridges are oil and grease, dust, metals (Pb, Zn,
Ni, Mn, Ca) resulting from vehicles on the bridges and roads or from the degradation of
asphalt. The impact level is dependent on rainwater flowrate, receiving water body and
density of transportation. This impact is considered insignificant because the runoff water will
be collected by the drainage system designed at both sides of the road and final discharge to
the sea via the drainage pipes along Son Tra Dien Ngoc Street. Thus the harmful substance
concentrations will be diluted by the flow and the receiving water body at the end.
e. Local flooding
Southern Link road with average elevation 3m higher than the existing road elevation will be
the dyke to prevent water flow from Cai River when the water raises and overwhelm the bank
to flow across the rice field to the estuary because the elevation of this area is low. The impact
is significant especially to those living upstream but it can be mitigated by designing
solutions.
f. Working health and safety
The O&M workers are affected greatly from traffic accidents, occupational risks and air
pollution, not only from the traffic but also from the O&M. The normal symptoms are
respiratory failure, dyspnea and fatigue when contacting for a long time.
5.3           TANGIBLE CULTURAL RESOURCES
5.3.1         Tombs
Building the southern link road and Lien Chieu WWTP is related to more than 177 graves,
which are approximately 20-30-year-soil-graves, scattered in the region. The impacts and
mitigation measures related to the relocation of graves are finalized in the RAP report.

    Most social and cultural works are located in the project area but far from the works around
    50 - 400m. Therefore, there are no affection of site clearance, dust and noise during the
    construction. However two small pagodas, Giac Minh Pagoda on Hoang Dieu road of Binh
    Thuan LIA is about 20-30m far from the construction site, may be affected by construction
    site.
    Mitigation measures: The Contractors limit noise and dust when carrying out the construction
    through the pagodas. Especially on festival days, The Contractors cease construction in that
    area. During the construction, ancient historical/cultural materials to be discovered should be
    reported to local authorities, district and provincial Department of Culture and Sports and
    Tourism.

CHAPTER 6. MITIGATION MEASURES FOR NEGATIVE IMPACTS,
           PREVENTION AND RESOLUTIONS FOR
           ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
Mitigation measures are proposed to cope with the negative impacts that are presented in the
chapter 5 with separated components in three project phases of pre- construction, construction
and operation. They must be designed to minimize environmental impacts with the following
principles:
   • They must minimize disruptions to daily life and movement demand of local people;
   • The proposed measures must be feasible in terms of economic, environment and social;
   • They must comply with standards and technical regulations;
   • They should 	 use the environmental-friendly technical equipments and construction
     methods;
   • There is regular monitoring regime.
6.1.      COMPONENT A
Due to their small-scale construction, the mitigation measures for construction and operation
of Component A will be presented in terms of ECOP. Detail of ECOP could be seen in

 Tidal Level
The sewerage system in Da Nang city discharges directly into the Han River, the Da Nang
Bay, and the East Sea. So designing for installing the drainage system must take tidal system
in Da Nang Sea into account.
The feasible study shows that high tide and low tide lasts for about 5.5 hours. However,
sometime, the tidal pattern is 01 day-night. Therefore, the high tide and low tide last longer
with an average of 11.5 to 13 hours. The typical level of high tide is from O.Om to +0.6m; the
highest tide is measured at + 1.70m. These levels are correlated with the standard elevation in
Da Nang city.

Conclusion: the tide was designed to calculate the depth and slope ofthe entire wastewater
collection and rainwater drainage system.
CSOdes;gn
 CSOs is required to prevent sand deposition, restriction of sand and grit inflows into
diversion structure minimizing cleaning capacity.
Sand deposition and river/sea water inflow in CSOs can be minimized by installation flap
gates in the downstream areas. When there are high tides or waves, water will not inflow into
the CSOs, while during rains, the upstream water pressure will make flap open automatically
to drain water out. This can be carried out by a combination of:
   • 	 Adjustment of CSO to horizontal instead of vertical direction.
   • 	 Gradual improvement of the existing manholes directly connect with the drainage
       system to minimize sand and grit inflow; and,
   • 	 Periodical cleansing sand, grit and debris.
  • 	 For outlet with less l.Om width, arrange one flap that is as dimensioned as equal to the
      established outlet's width.
  • 	 For 1.2 2.0m culverts, arrange two flaps that is dimensioned a half of the established
      outlet's width
  • 	 For> 3.0m culverts, installation of flaps to be established. Number of flaps is calculated
      based on principle that total widths of flaps are equal or greater than width of the
      culvert.
Conclusion: The design took into accont the flow separating chamber to prevent the tide when
it rises.

b.Trung nghia lake embankment
Material for embankment construction includes:
  • 	 Canal rool From bottom to berm of the Lake (elevation +2.00), use quarry-stone with
      cement mortar G 100, T30cm, with bedding crushed stone TlOcm, slope of m 1.75.
      From the berm to top of the Lake, to build precast R.C frame stone lx2 G200, in
      coordination with planting of Vetiver grass with slope of m= 1.50.
  • 	 Body ofthe embankment is filled with hill soil r = 1.8T/m3 (equivalent to K=O.95).
  • 	 Foot ofthe embankment: Build concrete retaining walls stone 2x4, G200. Foundation of
      the retaining walls is made of concrete stone 4x6 0100, bedded with coarse sand with
      bamboo pilings with density of 25piles/l m 2 ; length of the pile is 205m.
 • 	 Since foundation bottom of foot of retaining walls (-1.45) is on Layer 2 that is relatively
     weak (grey fine sand containing some clay grains that makes sand plastic, saturated in
     granular state, SPT=02); to ensure no local settlement to foot of embankment causing
     embankment cracking, it is handled by driving of bamboo piles with density of
                2
     25piles/1 m and length of pile of 205m.
 • 	 Edge of top of embankment: Structure is made of reinforced concrete stone lx2, 0200,
     T20cm with TIOcm 0100 stone4x6 concrete foundation.
  Conclusion: The design considered the embankment foundation and slope to ensure the
  sustainability of the project.

    h. Mitigation measures for maintainance of pumping station and CSOs
          • 	 Before dredging, it is necessary to prepare a detailed plan on construction time,
              construction method, methods on security, traffic safety and environmental sanitation.
          • 	 Sign a contract with URENCO to collect and transport the sludge and large debris to
              landfill
          • 	 Put manholes opened and put on ventilation for a while before dredging.
          • 	 Workers must be protected with masks, gloves and boots when dredging sludge and
              waste inside the system.
          • 	 Not temporarily store sludge and sediment at residential areas. Not put sludge over
              night on roads.

             and quality after discharging.
             Deal closely with DONRE on resposibility of Hoa Khanh industrial zone on its
             wastewater

b. Odor mitigation

).1> 	   Measures to mitigate smell generated in facilities

In order to meet the QCVN 07: 20 10/BXD on the buffer zone, ensuring no smellous affect to
the nearest residents, the best practice smell management is considered to include the
following practices in the design and operation of the plant.

         • 	 Extract sufficient air to maintain a significant negative pressure under the covers, and
             avoid an explosive atmosphere forming
         • 	 Provide effective and efficient scrubbers with backup equipment and units;
         • 	 Maintain positive dissolved oxygen in aeration tanks;

                                                                                                 116
EIA report ofDa Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project    Phase 2B

   • 	 Provide aeration devices which have low rate of smell release, or covers over the
       aeration units;
   • 	 Provide tall stacks for release of treated gases, and as a further backup ifthe scrubbers
       malfunction;
   • 	 Provide a direct coupling for connection to septage delivery tanks;
   • 	 Wash septage trucks under fully sealed conditions;
   • 	 CoHect and treat air from supernatant pipes throughout sludge handling area and
       provide sloping floor to drains;
   • 	 Cover biosolids storage hopper and extract and treat odours;
   • 	 Provide backup equipment for all key items, including onsite emergency power
       supply;
   • 	 Train all operations staff to appreciate the importance of odour control;
   • 	 Provide reclaimed water sprays, or other methods, to control scum on aeration tanks
       and clarifiers;
   • 	 Monitor hydrogen sulphide levels at the inlet and exit from the scrubbers; and carry
       out an odour audit at three year intervals;

» 	 easures to mitigate smell generating from sludge
  M

   • 	 Provide sealed bins to cart biosolids from the site;
   • 	 Use septic trucks for transporting sludge. Sand and raw sludge should be move to
        landfill for dumping.
  • 	 The fine sludge must be processed to reduce quantity, smell and pathogens before
        transporting to its final disposal site. Acccording to Bitton, 1994, sludge can be
        digested both anaerobically and aerobically. Anaerobic digestion typically takes place
        over a period of2-3 weeks on large covered tanks at the sewage treatment facility. The
        process has the advantage of producing methane gas, which can be recovered as an
        energy source, low cost, easy operation and production smellless. However the
       process can produce greater amount of sludge that has to be disposed of. On the other
       hand, the aerobic digestion takes place in a 10 20feet open tank for 12 -30 days
       depending on the prevailing temperature. Oxygen concentration is maintaincd over
        ImglL to avoid production of foul smell (Bitton, 1994). After digested, the sludge
       usually is treated further by adding chemicals such as lime, alum, ferric chloride to
       aggregate suspended particles then followed by dewatering to reduce volume of water
       by several methods such as air drying in spreading basins, centrifugation or vacuum
       filtration.
  • 	 As the buffer zone used for Hoa Xuan and Lien Chieu WWTP is just 40m, if aerobic
       condition method is applied to digesting the sludge, the equipment must be designed
       to gather smell to treat before discharging it to the ambient air. Dewatering sludge
       must be in covered equipment to avoid smell dispersion. The Centrifugation or
       vacuum filtration method can be considered.

  » 	Odor treatment
  • 	 The smell is flowed to the desmellation room for a further treatment before
      discharging into the air. Bio filter method is suggested to use for treating smelL In case
      of the concentration of H2S is still higher than the standard, it should be absorbed by
      active carbon.




                                                                                            117

    • 	 1.2m fences surrounding the plant must be built and trees must be grown surrounding
        inside the plant and along sidewalks. Trees provide us with shadow, lanscape and can
        reduce and prevent smell from dessimination.
    • 	 Concentration of H2S within the facility and border with the residential area has to be
        regularly checked.

c. Solid waste management
~ 	Solid   generated {rom wastewater treatment process

   • 	 The accumulated sand and debris, rubbish should be transported to Khanh Son
        Landfill for a further treatment.
   • 	 Fine sludge generates from domestic wastewater treatment plants mainly contains
        nutrient and low toxic substances such as heavy metals. In addition, pathogenic
        microorganisms reduce significantly after sludge treatment. In anaerobic digestion, in
        general, a plant uses mesophilic digestion (30 -3S°C) with a retention time of 14
        ISdays can expect a 1 2 log 10 removal of total coliform, feacal coliform and feacal
        streptococcus ~Straub et al. 1993). Temperature for aerobic digestion are usually
        mesophilic (37 C) with a retention time of 10 ~20days, the organic matters that are
       diverted to CO 2 and H20 lead to decreased carbon sources for bacteria, hence, the
       number of bacteria are most likely reduced due to nutrient deprivation. Also, as
       mentioned above, after digestion, the sludge may be air dried and treated with lime.
       Both processes reduce the numbers of pathogen. At pH 12 for at least 2 hours, the
       NHt+ in the sludge diprotoned, resulting in the production ofNH3. The combination of
       high pH and NH3 can reduce enteroviruses and coliform remarkably (Satter et ai,
       1976)..
   • 	 It is suggested that the sludge after treatment should be used for landfarming or
       organic fertilizer production to avoid overload for Khanh Son land fill and waste of a
       raw material source for organic fertilizers (US EPA, 1994). One of the typical
       references guiding for using the sludge as organic fertilizers is cited at Appendix 6-2.

~ 	Solid waste generated     from workers

   • 	 Two dustbins with capacity of 20L for each are equipped: One will be put in the
       office, one will be in the control building;
   • 	 Workers are trained to keep the hygienic conditions within the plant and waste is
       collected and put in the dustbins.
   • 	 The solid waste is transported together with sand and debris and rubbish from the

 d. Measures to reduce impact ofrunoff water
       • 	 Do not allow untreated wastewater, sludge leachate, chemicals to spill out on the
           ground
       • 	 After completion of construction phase, the site must be ordered and no abundant
           materials remain on the site
       • 	 Drainage system design keeps unchanged

 e. Measures to mitigate impact ofhealth effect 

 Level ofhealth effect depends on four types ofexposure as follows: 

       •	   Route: inhalation, ingestion, dermal
       •	   Magnitute: concentration, dose
       •	   Duration (minutes, hour, days, lifetime
       •	   Perquency: daily, weekly, montIy and seasonally

       Chlorine gas
       • 	 Staff must be trained and provided with protecting equipment before allowing them to
           operate the plant
       • 	 Mask and gloves are ready in the chemical room
       • 	 Chemical room must be well ventilated and instructed.
       • 	 Well prepared plan to work at chemical room ensuring as less time as possible
       Pathogens
       • 	 The wastewater from cleaning offices, plant and leachate from sludge devices must be
           gathered, covered and transferred to the influent intake headwork immediately
       • 	 Debris, sand, polymer must be taken separately out from the process daily, covered
           then moved immediately to landfill or a fertilizer plant

 6.3.1.2 Design for reducing flooding affect
For the road, the peak flow is calculated based on frequency of 5% or 20 years storm running
period, the road elevation must be over H5%. Culverts must have sufficient capacity for the
top flow with frequency of 5%.
For Hoa Phuoc Bridge must be capable with peak flow from storm water frequency of 1% or
100 years of repetition cycle. Calculation on culvert dimensions, high clearance and road
elevation is based on this peak flow.
Field survey data on highest water levels along the route is presented in Table 6-7.

 d. Overflowing storm water
 Longitudinal drainage system is designed simultaneously in construction stage of the road. A
 drainage system with centrifugal concrete pipes of D800 - D 1000 or longitudinal RC culvert
 drainage with dimension of l500x1500 to 2000x2000 will be arranged on road sides.
 Drainage calculation is made based on sections with consideration of the possibility of
 supplementing volume from surrounding project.Manholes and catch basins will be arranged
 on road sides by interval of 20m - 30m. At the same time, the horizontal drainage system is
 arranged with longitudinal drainage system to collect overflow water into drainage ditches.
 On planned route, 08 points of horizon culverts connect with longitudinal culverts in the
 positions estimated to join with the general drainage system in the region to Cai River (Table
 6-9).

 Through surveys and public consultations, the environmental consultants recommend that
the design consultants study an additional flooding culvert system in Bau Cung creek, Bien
Ky creek and Bau Duong creek at km 2 + 640 and km 2 + 692 with appropriate magnitude
for the drainage.
Reduction ofroad embankment erosion
The slope reduction depends on the geological conditions of the road and embankment
material. For normal material, embankment height is s; 6 m, gradient is 1 / m 1 / 1. 75;
embankment foundation on the sand is 1 / m            1 / 1.5. At the sloping ramps which are
regularly flooded, it is neccessary to sod to prevent erosion and create beautiful scenery along
the route and reinforce with concrete (40x40x5) em. The road embankments are sodded to
limit road erosion when there is heavy rain andflood.
Conclusion: The road embankment erosion limit should remain as designed.
g. Health safety
Workers have to follow work safety regulation strictly when working on road and contacting
with asphalt, oil and paints.

7.2.2    Operation phase

When the construction is completed, they will be transferred to the operational units such as Da
Nang Transportation Department, Urban Drainage Company, URENCO and/or local
government. These organisations will be responsible for management, operation and
maintenance of the constructions in accordance with the current regulations

7.3      ENVIROMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAM 

The environmental monitoring program is proposed in the construction phase at four levels: 

         Monitoring of the project performance indicators: twice a year, PMU is responsible for
         reporting to WB: health indicators; water quality at the receiving water bodies;
         flooding;
         Monitoring of implementation of mitigation measures done by the contractors: it is
         done by ISMC and the efficiency of implementing EMS of stakeholders and militating
         measures of constructors is reported to PMU and approved by PMU and WB with
         frequency of 3 months/time




                                                                                             138
 EIA report ofDa Nang Priori~y Infrastructure Investment Project - Phase 2B

        Monitoring by pUblic: public will monitor the project along its process to ensure that the
        contractors will not break the environmental and social regulations, and to reduce the health
        risks. Community will monitor the project throughout the implementation process, to
        ensure contractors do not violate the principles of environmental safety by providing
        information and help to fill in assessment of the Contractors Mitigation Measures,
        contributing to the work of a good environmental management. Implement monitoring
        community forms the spirit of voluntary reporting and address urgent matters. When an
        environmental deterioration happens, people and local administration will report to
        stakeholders.
        General monitoring of the project: regularly done by the related organizations and these
        reports will be collected and submitted to DONRE.

infrastructure   phase 2B. All 15 wards had been consulted and had 12 wards sent their
feedback. Detail feedbacks can be summarized as follows:
- Agree the project to be implemented quickly.
- Highly agree with measures to minimize negative impacts on the environment of PMU who
will apply as stated in the report.
- The compensation and clearance must be carried out quickly, apply policies fairly,
satisfactory. In addition, investors should have a specific plan to arrange resettlement for white
households are cleared.
- Implement construction schedule on time, to minimize the impact of local people, traffic
safety and security in the construction area. During construction time, should have a reasonable
plan to avoid damaging the public works.
- Contractor should avoid transportation of construction materials in the peak hours, especially
going through populated areas to limit the accident may occur.

- After completion of the project, the Project Manager should remind the contractor to reinstate,
to avoid causing aesthetic and environmental pollution.
- WWTP should be mitigation measures to handle odor emissions.
- WWTP should be monitored the quality of wastewater outlet periodically to control and limit
surface water environmental pollution.
- WWTP Lien Chieu needs to build a seperated pipe line to discharge to water body, not
combined with the pipe line of the Hoa Khanh industrial zone, to limit the deterioration of
responsibility for each other when the WWTP Lien Chieu or WWTP of Hoa Khanh industrial
zone operate ineffectively. In addition, WWTP Lien Chieu regularly measured wastewater
quality at the outlet to ensure efficient operation.
- Recommend investor needs to closely coordinate with relevant agencies to implement the
project as the schedule and good quality and compliance measures to minimize the negative
impacts during construction and operation phases of the project.

All comments above were included in Chapter 6 of the report and the project owner will be
strictly implemented.

 CHAPTER 9: CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
 9.1     CONCLUSIONS
 DN-PIIP- Phase 28 that has three component of A, 8 and C invested will significantly 

 contribute to promoting the economic - social development and sustainable poverty reduction 

 throughout the physical and social infrastructure investment and upgrading in low-income 

 areas as well as the environmental management and infrastructural development in the south of 

 the city. 

After being complete, Component A will update 20,076m long of roads, 15,873m long of street 

lighting, 36km of water-supply pipelines, 03 kindergartens and 07 community houses, serving 

6,691 households in 09 LIAs. The investment is essential as it not only results in the urban and 

sanitation improvement but contributes to improving the lives of poor people, giving them a 

chance to catch up with the pace of the City's development. 

Completed Subcomponents: B52, 853 will upgrade and extend more than 13km long of box
culverts and 10km long of pressure culverts, draining wastewater across three districts of Son
Tra, Ngu Hanh Son and Lien Chieu where there is not the investment and improvement in the
wastewater and storm-water drainage. The investment will heLp promote the environment
improvement significantly in new residential areas and help connect with the existing systems
seamlessly, bringing all wastewater to the existing WWTPs. Besides, the investment of
922.63m embankment of northern Trung Nghia Lake and the surrounding landscape of the lake
will contribute to the storage of 162,366 m3 rainwater, thoroughly addressing the flooding
problem in the region. At the same time, it helps condition the air and landscape 36,900m2 of
the central park of the City which is potentially untapped. Although the investment is not
much, it brings lots of practical results.
The investment in Subcomponents: B54, B55a is the major strategy of the City's long-term
wastewater management. There are two newly constructed Hoa Xuan WWTP and Lien Chieu
WWTP. The design capacity of each plant is 320,000 m 3/day with eight processing modules
and each module has a capacity of 40,000 m 3/day. In the first phase, the project is implemented
only a half of the design module with 20.000 m 3/day. However, the construction area must be
fully prepared to expand the WWTP to meet its full capacity.
Hoa Xuan WWTP situated in an area of 22.0414ha of Hoa Xuan ward - Cam Le district
following Decision No.7919/QD-UNBD dated 15/10/2010 of Da Nang City People's
Committee is planned treating the regional wastewater and receiving wastewater from Hoa
Cuong and Ngu Hanh Son plants.
Lien Chieu WWTP located in an area of 10 hectares of Lien Chieu district is planned treating
wastewater in the Northern region of the City following Decision No.8500/QD-UNBD dated
\1105/2010 of Da Nang City People's Committee. It will serve the wastewater treatment in the
project area and receive wastewater from Phu Loc Treatment Plant in the coming time. The
strengths and weaknesses of the locations and process technologies of the wastewater treatment
plants are presented in Chapter 2. The following is the basic summary:

In brief: the selected locations for two Hoa Xuan WWTP and Lien Chieu WWTP are
reasonable for the City's Waste Management Strategy to 2040, whose small and negative
impacts can be minimized.
Treatment technologies:
The selected technologies are analyzed as consistent with the locations, size, climatic
conditions and human resources of Da Nang city.
       Secondary Processing Technology: Extending Aeration Oxidation Ditch. Its advantage
       is the ability of oxygen transfer of 2.0SkglkWh, much more efficient than other




                                                                                          149

        technologies. This leads to a high effective treatment of waste, less sludge, good
        siltation and low smell.
        Odor Deodozization Technology by Biological Filtration is optimal because it can
        reduce 99% H2S, has low costs and has no by-products affecting the environment.
 The Chlorine Gas Disinfection Technology is appropriate because of its spectrum disinfectant,
 popularity and low costs. Besides, it also contains a number of disadvantages such as its
 residual chlorine in water may cause negative impacts on the environment, the corrosion of
 equipment and human health but these factors can be minimized.
 In addition, fine sludge will be proposed for treatment and disinfection and can be used as a
 source of organic fertilizer to help reduce the overload of Khanh Son landfill in the future.
 Component C will build for the City an asphaltic road of 34m wide and 7,279km long, which
starts from National Highway lA in Hoa Phuoc - Hoa Yang region through Hoa Quy Ngu
Hanh Son rice field and ends at Son Tra - Dien Ngoc intersection of Son Tra district. The
alignment will limit negative impacts and does not break the City'S Urban Transport Planning
provided in Decision No.7922/QD-UBND dated 14/0112006 by the City People's Committee.
On the way, there are two bridges crossing Vinh Dien River with the length of 420.8m and 10
spans, which are large enough for the navigation clearance of the grade-4 River, and Co Co
Bridge crossing Co Co River with the length of 80m and 2 spans, which has no boat
navigation. The completed southern road will create economic-social development
opportunities for the south of the City which is potentially untapped. Also, people living in Hoa
Quy - Ngu Hanh Son district and Hoa Phuoc - Hoa Yang district have chance to access the
urban education and healthcare infrastructures and take opportunities to improve their incomes
by means of trading with the external. The central population density, whereby, reduces thank
to the emigrants who are looking for development opportunities in new urban areas.
Besides the aforesaid positive effects, the process of building and operating the Project does
not avoid certain environmental negative impacts at various degrees (as reviewed in Chapter 5).
However, most the impacts are small and medium and can be minimized at acceptable levels
by highly feasible mitigation measures (mentioned in Chapter 6). These are also summarized in
Table 7-1.
Thank to the advantages of the invested components, limitable negative impacts, proposed
reasonable mitigation measures, and the support, supervision and management of Dang Nang
City, PIIP-PMU and city authorities (mentioned in Chapter 7), the Project certainly succeeds,
brings benefits, is practical for the people and contributes to the sustainable poverty reduction
and socioeconomic development of the City.

9.2     RECOMMENDATION
Functional agencies are requested to provide support so that the project can be soon started.
Local environmental management agency is requested to supervise the project implementation
for ensuring technical parameters and monitor environmental parameters during project
execution.
Relevant agencies should closely coordinate together during pre-construction and construction
stages to ensure the project schedule and progress because the project area may be affected by
storms in rainy season.
