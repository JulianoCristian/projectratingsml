                         Phase 1: implementation was fully completed in 2011, under component A four Low Income Areas (LIAs) were upgraded providing better tertiary infrastructure to about 4,800
                         households, and three Resettlement Sites completed construction to benefit of the project affected households. The Phu Loc river improvement under component B, which includes
