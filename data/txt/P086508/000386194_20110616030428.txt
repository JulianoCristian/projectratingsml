       effectiveness ofthe investment project and minimize the land acquisition of landowners.
       During the process of socio-economic survey and consultation of the project affected community,
       the Consultant took measures to mitigate project impacts (by means of setting up proper resettlement
       and compensation options and residents' consensus towards the Project), which include the
       propaganda and community meetings to introduce the Project and the roles of residents during the

-      project preparation and implementation stage as well.
       Simultaneously, measures to minimize temporary impacts in the construction stage was studied and
       proposed to avoid or minimize the same impacts in the next stages.

       Policy Framework and Entitlement
       The basic principle applied for the RP preparation is: DPs shall be assisted together with their best
       efforts to better or at least improve their living standards, their earning capacity and productivity
•      same as their prior living standards when the project was not started. The lack of legal basis of land
       usage does not bar affected persons' entitlements to the compensation and/or assistance for their
       economic restoration. Their affected properties shall be compensated based on "Replacement Costs".
•      The cut-off date of the project is expected as the date of the project DMScompletion, thus the cases
       arising after this date will be not be the project affected objects.

       Rehabilitation Program
,...
,      The life recovery program is one of the important activities in the implementation process of
       compensation and resettlement. In the project, a vocational training program, job introduction by the
       Da Nang Women's Employment Service Centre have been studied and proposed to apply to the
       project affected persons, at the same time, a loan program under Component A-3 was proposed for



-
       these subjects, partly contributing to helping people repair- upgrade houses after acquisition and
       stabilize their life soon.

•      Institutional Arrangement

-      The Project's compensation, assistance and resettlement will be under the management of the Project
       Management Unit and the City Compensation and Resettlement Committee (CRC) will be directly
       in charge of this work. In the implementation process, the close cooperation among site staffs,

J       DCRC, Project Management Unit, commune officers and residential groups as well as coordination
        with resettlement specialists of the project in process of resettlement and compensation will be
J       carried out.

        Implementation Plan
        The RP will be implemented and completed before the construction of the project works started. It is
        estimated that affected households will be compensated and carry out site clearance in the second
        quarter of 20 11.

        Consultation and Participation
        The Project's resettlement policy in this resettlement plan has been prepared with the close
        cooperation of local authorities, community organizations, and DPs to maximize their participation
        in the preparation and implementation of the resettlement plan. The local authorities, community
        organizations and about over 300 affected households were consulted through different fonns and
        channels of infonnation including meetings, community consultations, in-depth interviews for
        typical cases and questionnaire survey for all project affected households. The infonnation obtained
        in the consultations is not only useful for building resettlement plan policy but also assists for setting
        up of compensation options in the implementation process. The consultation shan be continuous to
        be carried out during the project implementation.

,,..    Monitoring and Evaluation
.
I. 	    The implementation of the detailed resettlement plan will be monitored and examined internally by
        PMU's staffs. The implementation of resettlement plan will be also monitored frequently via the

.	      prepared reports and the proposalS. Arising and outstanding problems will be brought out to solve
        absolutely .
        At the same time, an independent monitoring organization will be employed to monitor the RP
        implementation and evaluate the DP's living standards after resettlement.

        Grievance and Grievance Redress
.. 	    In the implementation process of the resettlement plan, grievances will be settled in accordance with
        the procedure, which is approved in the resettlement policy. The local authorities at all levels and
flit    project staffs will resolve DPs' grievances fairly and quickly. DPs will not pay any administrative
III     fees for their grievance redress.


.

1:      Project Components
        The project includes four components and two phases below.

C       Component A - Upgrading the Tertiary Infrastructures in Low Income Areas
        The participatory method similar to the one applied in the Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project ~ilI be

r.      applied in this component. The upgrade ensures low-income population in urban areas to access
        basic services. The tertiary infrastructure will include expanding and asphalting the road, newly
        building or upgrading the wastewater and storm-water sewerage system, the water supply
        connections in new households, local solid waste transferring stations (waste collection), public
•       lighting as well as upgrading such social infrastructures as clinics, kindergartens, market places and

-	
•
        other similar works. Some first and secondary infrastructures outside the area like entrances (paths),
        main drainage systems may be built to complete the tertiary infrastructures in low-income areas.
        The project also has component constructing' residential areas and apartment blocks for project
        affected people. Da Nang City has policy to temporarily lease houses for project affected people
        while awaiting the completiop of resettlement areas.
        Phase 2, Component A will continue upgrading services in 9 low-income areas in the list of 14 areas
        which were selected at the pre-feasibility study stage. The full community survey and community
•       upgrading plans in these areas are also deployed.

         1.1.3 Main Assignments
         In Phase 2B, the work scope includes (i) update the socioeconomic information (ii) preparation of
l        resettlement plan report, specifically:
         Update the socioeconomic information: A socio-economic survey in the project area was conducted

1        in 2006-2007, which reviewed impacts of the selected investment components on the communities
         and population groups benefited from the project. The main works that require land acquisition in
         Phase 2, were surveyed through the review of the reports completed in Phase 1 and determination of

I        update information level, which is primarily focused on Component C of the project.
         Preparation of the Resettlement Plan: The investment components, especially the tertiary
         infrastructural improvements and construction of road class 1, are estimated to cause certain social
         impacts. Among them, special attention to low-income areas, ethnic minority groups (if any) and
         vulnerable groups must be paid. Although the impacts are very diverse, a resettlement plan report
         covered detailed descriptions of the impacts, benefit policies, rehabilitation assistances to ensure the
         improvement or at least maintenance of the living standard of households as compared to their pre­
         condition of the project implementation. The resettlement plan report is prepared to ensure the

       2.1    OBJECTIVES
       The first principle of WB' s resettlement guideline is to avoid or mitigate impacts on resettlement and
       land acquisition. In case it is not feasible to avoid such resettlement, mitigation methods andlor
       reasonable compensation should be applied for DPs.
       As unified in the implementation principles of Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project,


c      the resettlement and land acquisition should be minimized. The Designed Consultant CDM, PMU
       and related authorities have made efforts to minimize impacts on land acquisition since the stage of
       project design and completion of the investment report; therefore, the impact scale on resettlement is


c	
       limited.
       Unavoidable land acquisition impacts are caused by the need of land acquisition for upgrading,
       expanding, construction of territory infrastructure in 07 LIAs ( there is nil lanf acquisition in
r      remaining 02 LIAs because they will be upgraded based on existing area, they are Tam Thuan area (

•      Thanh Khe district land Binh Hien ward ( Hai Chau district), upgrading and constructing drainage
       system in Son Tra, Cam Le, Lien Chieu district, build Lien Chieu treating plants at Hoa Khanh Bac
       ward (Lien CHieu district) and Hoa Lien commune (Hoa Vangdistrict) and Hoa Xuan treating plant
...    at Hoa Xuan ward and build ring road at Southern of Da nang city ( goes through Hoa Phuoc
       commune ofHoa vang district, Hoa Quy, Hoa Hai wards ofNgu Hanh Son district).              Wide-range
       consultations between the resettlement consultant (Infra-Thanglong) and local authorities,
       community-based organizations and especially households, who may be affected by the project,
       were organized to minimize resettlement impacts. The agreed instruction principles are attempts to
       finalize optimal options and solutions to avoid moving residents from their existing shelters.


,. 	   2.2    MITIGATION MEASURES
       In the project design process, the close coordination between Resettlement Consultant and the
       technical team of CDM Consultant in an effort to mitigate the project impact have been made.
       Thereby the plan of building culverts under the existing roads will not affect households and has no



-
       permanent land acquisition. Households will be temporarily affected during the construction period.
       However, the percentage of temporarily affected households accounts for small numbers in this
       resettlement plan report. For the construction works of extended Nguyen Tri Phuong road and newly

     many mitigation measures (such as building culverts on the existing canals and building box culverts
       beneath the roads ... ) some cases of partly affected houses are inevitably. Therefore, in order to
I
     minimize impacts on these families, including those whose houses are partly or indirectly affected
       during the construction, the following mitigation measures are proposed:
             1. 	 Firstly, the first action of project impact mitigation is to help households get information
                  locations and benefits of the project as. well as estimated impacts in order to establish
                  together a suitable policy framework for minimizing impacts. On the other hand, if
                  households are provided with full information in this stage, they will have spiritual and
                  physical preparation for expected project impacts. The community consultancies in the whole
                  project area were carried out to publicize (i) project information and (ii) expected impacts as
                  well as land acquisition and resettlement compensation methods. In the consultancy
                  meetings, many opinions were exchanged. In general, people supported the Project and
                  hoped that it will be soon accomplished to solve the flooding situation in the area.
             2. 	 Secondly, Technical consultant study the upgrading territory infrastructure to minimize land
                  acquisition in planning process. The consultant carried out socio-economic survey at LIAs,
                  organize meeting, training for project wards to introduce content, principles, criteria,
                  method, implementation time; provide knowledge, skill, method for project implementation.
                  Options will be selected based on technical design, contribution ratio, institution,
                  implementation organization and cooperation of local authority and local people.
             3. 	 Thirdly, for the box culverts - most box culverts have been studied and put in the middle of
                  the road to minimize direct impacts to households living on both roadsides such as the
                  construction of box-culverts in residential area of Lien Chieu, Hai Chau, Son Tra, Cam Le
                  district. Accordingly, remaining impacts after the application of mitigation methods are only

.. 
              temporary impacts in the construction process, especially on the access to business facilities
                  of households living on two roadsides. In addition, as a result of the expected dimensions of
                  box culverts in the project area, the land acquisition for these culverts ranges from 2.5-4.0m
                  while road width ranges from 6- 6.5m. However, in order to minimize impacts on households
                  living along the roadsides, consultation meetings were held with households living in these
                  wards to get their supports on the construction process. Some temporary impacts (on traffic,


-

                  business, etc.) will be minimized by the Contractor, in a close cooperation with the
                  community, based on (i) notifying the Contractor's construction plan so that residents can
                  make necessafY and suitable arrangements; (ii) the construction activities should finished one
                  by one with fencing/excavation section by section to minimize affects on traffic and business
                  activities ofhouseho1ds.
         c   4. 	 Fourthly, for the design ring road at Southern city immediately during the route identification
                  and preliminary design, an appropriate technical plan has been proposed to avoid residential
                  areas. Avoiding impacts are the most feasible measures to minimize the project negative
                  impacts effectively and solve the root of adverse effects. In case of inevitable negative effects

-
                on property, adequate compensation policy and compensation value guarantying restoration
                  of the damages at least will be given in consistent with the project RPF.



-

.. 

             S. 	 Fifthly, in some drainage alignments, which have been mentioned in the feasibility study
                  report and approved in January 2008, there are many changes now because local people and
                  organizations in the area have built many works ... therefore to minimize impacts on land
                  acquisition and resettlement, the design consultant CDM should review the current status of

J               these works to suggest more appropriate locations (if any). The box culverts from Nguyen
                Phan Vinh road to Sluice Gate CXl6 in Tho Quang ward may affect about 30 households, of
1               which about II households are relocated. Through field survey, the construction position of
                the culvert alignment will be adjusted to minimize resettlement of about eight households
                adjacent to Sluice Gate CX16. This is one of the mitigation measures ofland acquisition and
                resettlement of the project.
            6. 	 Sixthly, during construction, there will be negative impacts to the people's lives in the area
                 like repairing partly affected houses. The technical team has been discussed and worked with
                 to find out mitigation measures such as to complete the construction section by section. For
                 the materials generated in the dismantlement of the architectural works, the Contractors are
                 requested to quickly clean-up and move them out of the area.
             7. Finally, many meetings were held with the technical group to determine locations of drainage
                alignments and establish criteria of impact mitigation during the construction such as setting

t               up working safety plans (when constructing near residential areas), making proper
                arrangement of materials and instruments (project sign boards, making partitions with
                residential areas, etc.), and preparing construction schedule to minimize temporary impacts.

         In addition to the mentioned direct affects, the project also cause temporary impacts to over 1,500
         households living along the existing canals/ditches ... in the construction process. These impacts
         primarily prevent/limit few households from indirectly temporarily accessing their business facilities
         during the Project construction period, where the road is closed and the traffic is cramped.

               without legal land rights may meet conditions of legalization and receive
               compensation for losses up to a rate equal to 100% of land price minus the taxes and
               fee for land use right registration from 15 October 1993 (Article 42, 49 and 50 of2003
               Land Law)
        •	     Permanent residents are provided with options that include relocation to an improved
               site, or cash, or a combination of the two
        •	     Resettlement sites offer not only better improved infrastructure and services but

      •	
               represent a higher standard of living
               Allowances are provided to help the DPs in the transition period and there is an
               institutional structure through which people are informed, can negotiate
               compensation, and can appeal.
        •	     Compensation at replacement cost is ensured in Article 6 of Decree 197/2004IND-CP
               dated December 3rd, 2004 that " ... people who have land being acquired shall be
               compensated with land of similar land use purpose. If there is no land for
               compensation, cash compensation equal to land use rights value at the time of land
               acquisition shall be applied. If there is many differences in value, in case of
               compensation by new land or house, such difference shall be settled in cash" and
               Article 19 in the same Decree states that " ... house and structure of domestic use of
               household or individual shall be compensated with the value of construction of new
               house, structures of similar technical standard".

    However, with the promulgation of the 2003 Land Law and the adoption of Decrees No.

        CP, and Decree 69/2009IND-CP the policies and practices of the Government have become
        more consistent with WB's social safeguards policies. Nonetheless, provisions and principles
        adopted to the project will supersede the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in
        Viet Nam wherever a gap exists, consistent with Decree No. 131120061ND-CP on ODA
        management. The main gaps between national policy and OP 4.12 on involuntary

        5.2 	   PRINCIPLES OF EGILIBILITY AND COMPENSATION
t
      5.2.1 	 Objective
        The objectives of the Vietnamese law on resettlement and rehabilitation for relocated people
t
      and compulsory resettlement objectives of the World Bank are applied to finalize the
        resettlement policy framework. The policies and principles applicable to the Project are based
        on the policies of the World Bank (OP/BP 4.12) and the current regulations of Vietnam.
1: 
    The main objective of the resettlement policy framework is "to ensure all project affected
,~"
        persons receive the compensation respective with the replacement prices and the support
j

        policies that help them restore, improve their living standard or at least maintain their living
        conditions and earning capacity same as the time prior to the Project".

        5.2.2 	 Project Displaced Persons
        Project affected persons (APs) are those who suffer from:
             (i) Involuntary land acquisition resulting in:
                (a) 	   relocation or loss of shelter;
... 

    I           (b) 	   loss of assets or access to assets;
                (c) 	   loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether they must move to a
                        new residence or not; or
             ii) Involuntary restriction of access to prohibited or protected forests, resulting in adverse
                  impacts to their means of support of the displaced persons.

        5.2.3 	 Cut-off date
        A valid time for receiving compensation and assistance for each resettlement plan is the date
        that the project or specific project components are formally approved and published by the
        functional agencies of local authorities.
        People who move to the project area after this time will not be entitled to the compensation
        and forced to move and dismantle their properties from the acquisition area before the
        starting date of the Project. To support them, the Project will provide necessary means for
        their relocating.
        According to project study results, the cut-off date will be the date of project's public
        announcement. Accordingly, all households living in the project area, who have land and
        properties after this date will not qualify legal for the compensation any assistance of the
        Project.

                                    RESETTMENT ARRANGEMENT
     6.1    RESETTLEMENT NEEDS
     According to the survey results, there is the total of 468 households in need of resettlement
     (moving houses) to facilitate the project implementation successfully, including:
     Upgrading te"itory infrastructure in LIAs: The upgrading will be implemented in 09 LIAs,
     in which there were 04 LIAs (with 18 DPs) have to be displaced and resettlement..
     The Storm-water Drainage System in Son Tra: Lien Chieu, Cam Ie, Thanh Khe District:
     The drainage system here is inclusive of box culverts, collecting wastewater from the roads to
     the waste water treating plants. For these culverts, expect affects 33 households, who are
     totally affected and must resettle.


-
   Hoa Xuan and Lien Chieu waste water Treatment plants: the construction of 02 plants will
     affect 337 households, who are totally affected and must be resettled.
     Ring Road: This route runs through 03 wards of Hoa Yang and Ngu Hanh Son districts,
     where the effects related to land acquisition have been done by other projects, there is only an
     estimate of 80 affected households whose houses are affected and must move, including 5
     cases in Hoa Phuoc commune ward, 44 cases in Hoa Quy ward and 31 cases in Hoa Hai
     ward.



-
   6.2    COMMUNITY CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION
     The resettlement for households who are totally cleared is based the following order:
              Households who belong to the relocation and resettlement are consulted about 

              resettlement areas; 

              Disclosure the detail design of resettlement areas; 

              Distribute land plots and/or apartments in resettlement areas on the principle of 

              consultation of affected households; 

              Move households to resettlement areas and launch rehabilitation measures for their 

              lives
     Certain consultation contents about resettlement options are as bellow:
     As the result of the survey by questionnaires and community consultations, some comments
     and viewpoints of local people are as follows.
     Compensation and Resettlement: People said the land acquisition and site clearance is quite


-

II
     common, even in their hometown other projects are carrying out the land acquisition and site
     clearance. Therefore, local officials and citizens understand quite clearly the procedures as
     well as the meanings and roles of this work.
J

       RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 28
I

       In fact, when a project is implemented, people firstly concern about the level of compensation
l
     and assistance. They hope the state has such compensation policies that they are not much
       disadvantageous. This shows clearly during the Consultant's survey in the project
       wardslcominunes, where 70.8% households want the Project's satisfactory compensation
[
     policy. Because of no trust and having common cognition and viewpoint to the "projectless"
       status (or suspended project), people want the Project to be commenced soon to avoid their
       risks of investing in land; 94.3% households want the advantageous resettlement points to
[
     limit their living disorders. In addition to the stipulated compensation rates, people also want
       more assistance for their lives stabilization after the project implementation.
       Expectations for the resettlement plan: This is a focus; most households (more or less
       affected) are very interested in the compensation rates. Regarding the resettlement locations,
       people want that the Project builds on-site resettlement areas (at the local precinct), which
       will not cause effects, disruption to people's lives, particularly for their social relations and
       lifestyles.
       According to the survey results, people generally tend to the land plots in resettlement areas
       of the city where the basic infrastructures are established. Receiving such land plots, people
       will be more active in their coordination, settlement as well as seeking other business
I...
       opportunities to maintain their lives. However, in reality of discussion, they also wish in-site
       resettlement if their remaining area can be settled down. Additionally, the nwnber of people
       wants receiving compensation money and manages their accommodations by themselves but
       these cases are not significant (1.4%). Thus households, who are the project relocation
       subject, will be arranged in three resettlement areas of the project. The households, who do
       not agree to relocate to the above resettlement areas, the City People's Committee will issue
       commitments to arrange them in other resettlement areas on the district/ward.
       Besides, there are certain consultation contents about resettlement options as bellow:
              Firstly, people generally understand the value and benefits brought by the Project, so



-

              they agreed with the projects and activities related to site clearance and resettlement.
              Secondly, locals desire new resettlement areas near their old residence or within the
I
              ward precincts. Thus, the habits, the customs and the participation in the activities of
              the resident groups in the community will not be disturbed; the cultural aspects,
              community relations will not change much ...Accordingly, the construction of Thanh
              Khe, Hoa Minh and Hoa Quy resettlement site is being supported from local people;
              estimated 94% DPs agreed to relocate and resettle in the assigned project resettlement
              sites. The remaining DPs are expected to on-site resettle or to locate in communal or
[
            district resettlement sites that are closed to their existing area. Following these, the
              District Resettlement Committees have list the anticipated DPs and to be relocate
              them to the indicated district resettlement sites.
              Thirdly, people want the resettlement areas to be completed and handed over to them
              before acquiring their land. The technical and social infrastructures in the resettlement
              areas must be complete before handing resettlement land to relocated households.
              Fourthly, because most households living in the project area are middle and wealthy
              families, they want the Project having additional supports in the house construction
              and reconstruction in the resettlement areas. They hope that the compensation and
              assistance costs will be enough to cover their restoration of life in the new place.

        RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 28

        In addition, the households also raised many questions about the compensation unit prices
I
      and support regime for poor urban people and the project's criteria for the resettlement of
        households whose agricultural land is severely affected ...


        6.3         DEVELOPMENT OF RESETTLEMENT SITE

        6.3.1 Availability ofthe Resettlement Sites
        Currently, the resettlement home fund is being built in three areas including (i) Thanh Khe
        Tay Resettlement Area, (ii) Hoa Minh Resettlement Area and (ii) Hoa Quy Resettlement
        Area. The detail scale of the resettlement areas are shown below (description of the
        resettlement sites, refer to the project F/S, phase I):
              .:.    Thanh Khe Tay Resettlement Area: This area is 5.18 hectares wide with total 111
                     land plots and 66 apartments .
              •:.    Hoa Minh Resettlement Area: This area is 7.18 hectares wide with total 232 land
                     plots and 132 apartments..
I....         •:.    Hoa Quy Resettlement Area: This area is 5.9 hectares wide with total 270 land
                     plots .

... 
         •:.    If resettlement plots are not enough for households or based on DP demand, DCRC
                     will make list of household who have resettlement demand and arrange them plots
                     located in same district. For example: for resettlement households of Hoa Xuan
,..

,   '
                     treating plant, they will be arranged resettlement in F, E plots of residential are at
                     south Cam Le bridge in Hoa Xuan ward. Affected Dps of ho Quang- Bien Dong
                     culvert will be arrange resettlement plots un Tho Quang Bien Dong residential area
                     under Tho Quang, Son Tra district
        According to the above data on the resettlement home fund and based on the resettlement
        demand in Project Phase 2B, we can be seen that the resettlement home fund is able to meet
        the resettlement need of the resettled households. Resettlement arrangements for individual
        household in total 468 households will be implemented by the Project Management Unit
        based on the agreed resettlement registration process.

        6.3.2 Resettlement Arrangement
til""
        As noted above, 83 estimated households are resettled for phase 2 A, for phase 2B, 468
"       households are about to be resettled, the project implementation and according to the project
        progress; the project construction will be started in the first quarter 2012. Thus, 'the land

.r      acquisition and resettlement for these households must be completed in June to September
        2011 (03 months before the project implementation). To ensure the progress, right from this
        moment the Project Management Unit (and concerned agencies) should take necessary
        activities for land acquisition and resettlement soon.
        As a result of the consultations, most households are keen for resettlement land plots. So for
        such cases, prior to making procedures of land acquisition and resettlement, the PMU (or
        functional body) should organize further consultations/discussions with them relating to the
        detailed design/planning of resettlement areas. The PMU should collect their comments on
        the form of the expected resettlement areas (land lots or apartments ...) by means of the
        registration form for resettlement land allocation filled by the expected resettlement
        households and collect comments of the Ward People's Committees. The estimated time for
        resettlement application is in the second quarter of2011.
           RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2B


           Principle of Land Resettlement Arrangement: Subjects to the resettlement include
           households living in the site clearance area who are acquired all land or their acquired land
           equals to 114 of the recognizable land limit or 112 of the residential land allocation level or
           more and they desire to live in the resettlement areas (the Committee of Compensation, Site
           Clearance and Resettlement bases on the above principle to plan specific resettlement options
           for the Project).

           Publicity of Resettlement Plan: The Project Management Unit of Da Nang Priority
           Infrastructure Investment Project shall coordinate with stakeholder to notify the resettlement
           and housing arrangement plan for each household whose residential land is acquired and
           must relocate. The publicity of the arrangement plan can be posted at the offices of the Ward
           People's Committees where the land is recovered and in the resettlement areas. The notice
           shall include (i) Location and scale of the land fund, resettlement home fund, area of each
           plot of land and apartment, land prices, resettlement house prices and (ii) List of the projected
           households in the resettlement areas.

           Exemption Policy OfLand Use Fees

         The Project reduces 10% of land use fees for all cases which fully pay the land-use fee within
           60 (sixty) days since the receiving date of actual resettlement land as notified by the land
           allocation body (exclusive of specific cases, which are separately regulated).

                                      REHABILITATION PROGRAM

      7.1    OVERVIEW
      Restoring life is an important part of the resettlement when DPs lost production and business
      facilities, employment, or other sources of income, whether they lost their homes or not.
      However, damaged cases of housing and income sources are subjects to have highest risks
      caused by the project. When the project effects to people are negative, people may be worse
      off and bankruptcy of the resources to create life. This can lead to loss of land, loss of job,
      loss of homes, to be separated from the social marginalization, illness, lack of food, loss of
      the use-right of public properties and they are at the risk of becoming social order disturbing
      elements, including crimes and thieves. Therefore, measures to restore life are the core of the
      resettlement and require maximum attention. Measures to restore life' will be designed with
      extensive consultation from the project affected persons. The general purpose of this program
      is to restore the livelihoods of affected persons same as or higher the rate before there is the
      implementation of the Project, and will ensure that affected people adapt to new conditions in
      shortest time.

      Recovery of income are taken into account as an important ·part in the consideration of
      livelihood accessibility or improvement of the DPs's economic circumstances, which aims to
      improve skills or to create more opportunities for poor households, households with difficult
      economic circumstances and households belonging to the vulnerable groups.
      To perform the next step of the Resettlement Plan (RP), the Project Management Unit of Da
      Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project will combine with local government agencies
[     at all levels such as the social organizations: Da Nang Women's Employment Service Center,
      Da Nang Employment Center ... to conduct the operations to restore DPs' incomes. The
      activities here are mainly vocational training and job introduction. The specific contents,
      forms and schedules of implementation are shown below.


      7.2    ANALYSIS OF DEMAND
      According to the survey results, there are 409 households whose landlhouses and other works
~     and structures are affected, including 399 relocated households. In addition, there are 596
II    households, whose agricultural land is affected, including 235 severely affected households
      (losing 20% or more of agricultural land). The affected households here mainly earn for
,..   living by agricultural works along the proposed road or the canal routes. According to the
..    survey, an estimate of 51% household's main occupations are currently agriCUlture, and
      among them, about 85% of their income recently have not depended on agriculture but from
...   other revenue sources such as business, services and freelance and a few government staffs ...
III   In general, DPs mostly live in the suburban, which are in the urbanization conversion
..    process .
        RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase lB


        The DPs have been consulted and investigated through the questionnaires and community
        consultations, their views and opinions to the life restoration after resettlement is shown as
        follows:
        Expectations for life stabilization: This is a big issue because most households' sources of
        livelihood are directly related to their present living locations (in the wards as Hoa Hai, Hoa
        Quy, Tho Quang, Hoa Khanh Bac and Hoa Cuong bac). So the livelihood poses difficulties.
        When asked about the project impacts, approximately 83.1 % households said the project had
        significant impacts on their lives. Namely, about 22.6% households will have no land for
        production; 36.6% said the project will disturb their family life; 14.1% said their family
        economics will be affected and influenced more or less.
        People living in the project area expect the project's sources of job training or vocational
        orientation. Specifically, 43.2% wants vocational training; 32.4% needs job introduction;
        22.2% wants credit loans. The details of people's expectations are shown in the following

[	                       CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION 


1:     10.1   OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
       The major objectives of the consultation and participation are:

t         a) Ensure that affected people and involved parties have their voice in the making decisions
             of all compulsory resettlement issues related to them;
          b) Minimize adverse effects caused by compulsory resettlement;
          c) Avoid conflicts occurring in the process of project implementation.

-      It is regulated in WB's policy that DPs shall be informed and consulted fully on the resettlement
       and compensation plans. Consultation for DPs is the starting point for all resettlement activities.
       DPs may worry about losses of subsistence means and community or worry that they are not
       ready for complicated negotiations on their entitlements. Participating in the resettlement plan
       preparation and management brings opportunities for DPs to participate in the decisions of what


-      will affect their lives. The resettlement implementation without the community consultancy may
       lead to an improper and ine'ffective strategy. Without conSUltancy, DPs may protect again the
       project and create social difficulties to remarkably prevent the project from objective completion
       and even make the project cost increased.· Therefore, if there is· the consultation, the initial

.. 	   objection about project may be changed to the constructive consultation.
       In Vietnam, one next step in the democracy increase at basic level is Instruction No.30-CT/TW

-      of the Central Committee of Vietnamese Communist Party in "Construction and implementation
       of basic democratic regime" and Decree No.79/2003/ND-CP on this matter. The key of the legal
       documents is the well-known sentence: "people know, people discuss people do, people check".


.-
       Ordinance No.3412007IPL-UBTVQHll points out that the local authorities and communities
       have opinions prior to the authorized agencies' making decision; including the establishment of
       compensation and resettlement plans relating to the projects and works in ward/commune areas .

       10.2.1 Consultation In Project Preparation
       Local governments and related organizations, community who are affected by the project will
       participate in all different stages from the planning to the implementation of the resettlement

W 	    The methods of project information and public consultation may include rural participatory rapid
       appraisals and stake holder's consultation ones, using techniques of site and household visits,
       public meetings, group and focus group discussions and socio-economic surveys.
       At the early stage of the project preparation, Da Nang local authorities and leaders of different
       administrative levels in each of the project areas were informed about the project proposal, its
       objectives and proposed activities. They were intensively consulted and actively participated in
       the discussions on their development needs and priorities. On 12/2005, the community
,"""   consultation meetings inclusive of the resettlement policy framework were held in the project
       wards, residential areas. Representatives of households who are definitely affected by the project


-      were invited to attend and give comments in the meetings. The local governments and residents
       were consulted on their agreement and commitment to the resettlement policy described in the
       project policy framework, which is considered as the policy reflecting the objectives and policies
       of the Work Bank and the Government of Vietnam. After the Project is approved, the
       information on the objectives, components and activities of the project have been widely
       introduced in the public places.
       In early April 2010, a socioeconomic survey and inventory of assets on a large scale was
       conducted in 04 district and 07 wards of the project. The survey group investigated by size about
       40% affected partly households and 100% seriously affected & displaced households. According

-	
.
       number of socio-economic survey households is 156 households.
       In addition, the Project Management Unit of Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project
       with the assistance of the resettlement advisory group (Infra-Thanglong Company) conducted


..
"
...
       public consultations (group discussions with communities affected by the project) to gather such
       qualitative information as demographic status, income sources, compensation expectations and
       compensation rates, demand for vocational training and loan revolving fund
       Soon after the Project is officially approved, its purpose, components and project preparation
       activities being implemented will be published to the people by means of local newspapers and
       televisions.

       10.2.2 Consultation In Project Implementation
       In the course of the Project Management Unit of Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment
       Project with the assistance of the project consultants will undertake the following tasks:
•
-      Provide information on the project policies and procedures to the city CRCs and agencies and
       units involved in the compensation and resettlement at all levels.



-
       Organize information dissemination and consultation to all affected persons during the project
       implementation.

       Update the unit prices stipulated by the City, and reconfirm the scale of land acquisition and
       impacts on 	properties based on the results of detail measurement surveys (DMS) with the
       consultation of affected persons.
       Then the City CRC will fix the prices, calculate compensation entitlements, and complete
       property compensation plan for each affected household. Da Nang PUPs will coordinate with
       the City CRC to publicize infonnation on direct entitlement to affected people in the meetings
       and household visits.
"'­
L	     Next, DPs will receive worksheets on compensation - resettlement plans to check infonnation
       through the surveys, rates of compensation, assistance and confinntheir choice on the
       compensation plans. The property compensation plans finalizes affected assets and compensation
       entitlements of households, which must be signed by affected persons to demonstrate the
       evaluated results and their consensus. Any questions of affected persons on the contents of the
       compensation plans must be noted and clarified.
       Consultation of affected people about their desire for their life recovery support must be made.

       This will be applied for severely affected and vulnerable groups of people. The CRCs will notify
       affected persons the plan and entitlement to receive technical assistance before requesting them
       to make clear their desire on the recovery support.
       Community Meetings
       When there are decisions of land acquisition and before the start of the detailed design,
       community meetings in each ward will be deployed to supply additional infonnation for people
       affected by the project and to create opportunity for them to draft public comments on the
       resettlement policies and procedures for each project affected area. All relocated households
       were invited to attend and give comments in the meetings.
