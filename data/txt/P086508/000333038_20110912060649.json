for Vietnam focuses on the City of\n            Danang, capital of the central region, with the following\n            development objectives : improve the living conditions and\n            productivity of low income residents; b) promote economic\n            growth, through strategic investments that enhance mobility\n            and increase private sector participation; and c) improve\n            city and district level management, through institutional\n            development, human resource development and capacity\n            building. The objective of the EA report is to assess\n            potential environmental impacts of project activities\n            proposed in Phase 1, and recommend mitigation measures to\n            address such impacts. Appropriate mitigation measure are\n            identified as follows : construction wastes will be quickly\n            transported out of the site; streets and roads should be\n            regularly sprinkled with water to reduce dust pollution;\n            only low noise vehicle and equipment will used and complied\n            with their established maintenance schedules; construction\n            materials should be covered with canvas while being\n            transported by trucks; a temporary alternative water supply\n            plan during construction should be prepared; local\n            authorities and local population will be kept informed of\n            construction schedule; during excavation and dredging\n            activities comply with environmental best practices;\n            temporary sediment storage will be covered by canvas; proper\n            attention should be given to ensure labor safety; and\n            finally, throughout project design and implementation adhere\n            to the legal and regulatory environmental and social\n            provisions included in Vietnam's legislation, and\n            compliance with the Bank's environmental safeguard (OP\n            4.01, natural habitats (OP4.04), cultural resources (OP\n            4.11) and resettlement of project affected peoples (OP 4.12)\n            operational directives."}, "docdt": "2011-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
