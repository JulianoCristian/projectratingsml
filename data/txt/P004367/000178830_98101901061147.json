and efficiency in secondary education.\n            The policy for enrollment expansion and related increases in\n            student progression in provincial high schools would\n            increase the overall number of secondary school graduates\n            from 7,500 in 1982 to about 11,000 by 1988. The\n            implementation of a policy to replace high cost expatriates\n            with national teachers at provincial high schools would\n            reduce annual recurrent costs per student by about 11% by\n            1988. To improve educational quality, some 450,000\n            curricula-related textbooks would be provided for provincial\n            high school students and national teachers would receive\n            increased training in their subjects of specialization. To\n            reduce inequities in the distribution of secondary school\n            places, some 4,500 new provincial high school places would\n            be located mainly in provinces with below average enrollment\n            ratios. A further 400 additional school places would be\n            provided at existing national high schools."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
