SECONDARY EDUCATION PROJECT
I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Sector Setting
1.01      Overview.  Papua New Guinea's development strategy and programs for
the 1980s give emphasis to achieving financial self-sufficiency through devel-
opment of the natural resource base, and, with derived earnings, to improving
the quality of rural life. A complementary objective is to raise the skill
level of manpower, in particular to replace expatriate with national manpower
in formal employment. However, a shortage of qualified nationals is a cons-
traint to achievement of this objective. Continued reliance on expatriates,
accounting for over half of manpower at the higher levels of formal employ-
ment, is largely attributable to shortcomings in the education system. Weak-
nesses include poor average quality of primary and lower secondary education,
inadequate coverage of secondary education and poor cost-effectiveness at
postprimary levels. The government has begun to address the problems of the
formal educatioy,system through a comprehensive development program for pri-
mary education.-   As the next step, emphasis needs to be given to strengthen-
ing secondary education, which supplies national manpower for higher education
and formal employment.
1.02      Structure.  Papua New Guinea has developed a complete education
system since the 1950s. The system comprises four main cycles: primary,
lower secondary, upper secondary and higher education (as shown in Table 1.1
below and the flow chart in Annex 2). In 1982, primary education was provided
in some 2,200 schools and lower secondary education in 105 provincial high
schools (PHSs). About half of students enrolled at the primary level and two-
thirds of students at the lower secondary level attend government schools.
The remainder attend church agency schools (approved by the central govern-
ment). Upper secondary education is provided in four national high schools
(NHSs) established and operated by the central government. Higher education
is provided at two government universities, the University of Papua New Guinea
(UPNG) and the University of Technology (UOT); and in 18 teacher training and
technical colleges. In addition, pre-employment training is provided in 20
vocational centers; and pre- and in-service training (post-grade 10) is pro-
vided in some 60 institutes operated by government and other agencies. The
government also operates a College of External Studies which offers vocational
courses and grades 7-10 outside of the formal system.
1/   The Primary Education Project, assisted by Loan 1934/Credit 1087-PNG of
1981, is designed to support this effort.

1.03      Coverage.  The formal education system is characterized by low part-
icipation rates at the secondary level and above, as shown in Table 1.1 and
Annex 1.  While some 319,200 children attended primary schools in 1982, only
41X300 students were enrolled in secondary schools. Included were 39,700
students in PHSs and 1,600 students at the four NHSs. Students' performance
on standard achievement tests, taken at the end of grades 6, 8 and 10, largely
determines participation at higher levels of education. At present, about 35%
of grade 6 yaduates enter grade 7; and only 73% of the grade 8 cohort proceed
to grade 9.-    The total number of grade 10 graduates was 6,700 in 1982.  Of
these, about 80%, or 5,360, entered the work force (about 20%) or postsecon-
dary (non-university) institutions (about 60%). Of the remainder, some 12%
(800 students) were selected to enter the country's four NHSs and 8% (540
students) entered a preliminary year at the UPNG or UOT. The preliminary year
is offered as an alternative to grades 11 and 12 in the limited NHS system.
About two-thirds of the 800 grade 12 graduates enter university each year.
1.04      Quality.  A decline in the quality of primary education throughout
the 1970s is explained largely by rapid replacement of expatriate with
national teachers; over half the national teachers employed during the period
had less than a grade 10 education. The Primary Education Project
(para. 1.01) is designed to improve educational quality through provision of
systematic 3)pgrading for teachers, together with appropriate student
materials.-   However, the low educational standards at the primary level have
contributed to quality weaknesses at the lower secondary level. While the
majority of PHS teachers are formally qualified nationals, technical support,
2/   In contrast, the progression rates between grades 7 and 8, and 9 and 10,
average 96%.
3/   The project is also designed to support improvements in educational
planning and management and an increase in the primary enrollment ratio,
with emphasis on reducing inequities in the distribution of school places
among provinces and between males and females.



- 3 -
including in-service upgrading, is limited; and teachers are generally unable
to provide the remedial and further instruction required to strengthen student
achievement. Similar quality problems exist at the post-grade 10 level, with
the exceptions of the NHSs and universities. Quality problems are less severe
at these institutions as a result of selection practices (para. 1.03) and use
of expatriate teachers.
1.05      Administration.  The Department of Education (DOE), headed by the
Minister of Education, has overall responsibility for education in Papua New
Guinea.  In 1978, however, numerous responsibilities for primary and secondary
education were transferred from the DOE to the Provincial Divisions of
Education (PDOEs). The DOE retains direct control over the NHS system and
school inspectorates at both levels. It further establishes the curricula for
core subjects in all schools. However, school planning and management for
primary schools and the PHSs are carried out largely by the PDOEs (Annex 3
provides organizational charts for the DOE and PDOEs). The PDOEs are also
responsible for appointing PHS teachers, establishing new schools and disburs-
ing funds. Salary schedules and employment regulations for primary and
secondary school teachers are established at the central level by the
Teachers' Service Commission (TSC).
1.06      Financing.  The central government finances investment and recurrent
expenditures for primary and lower secondary education through provision of
grants (both tied and untied) to provincial governments. Local contributions
comprise a relatively minor share in the total, 7nd student fees are charged
only at the primary and lower secondary levels.- The central government
further provides matching grants to encourage investment by church agencies in
approved schools. Financing for education at the upper secondary level and
above is provided directly by the central government. In view of the sharp
decline in educational participation after the primary level, expenditure on
education, at about 5.4% of GNP and 19% of total public expenditure budgeted
for 1983, is relatively large (see Annex 1 for comparison). This level of
expenditure reflects high recurrent costs for postprimary education, and is
explained largely by high average wages in the formal sector: salaries for
national teachers are high, and the ayerage salary of an expatriate teacher is
over three times that of a national.5. The relatively small number of schools
and an incomplete transportation system necessitate boarding at the secondary
level and above (for about 75% of PHS students and all NHS and university
students), which further contributes to the high recurrent costs at present.
4/   Student fees at PHSs are charged on the basis of families' ability to
pay, and average US$150/student annually.
5/   The average recurrent expenditure per student in Papua New Guinea
(primary through university level) was 2.4 times the average for an eight
country sample (including the Philippines, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia
and Singapore) in 1975, or US$283 compared with the average of US$120 (in
1975 prices).



4-
Main Issues in Secondary Education
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.0,      Despite the importance of secondary education for development of
midclle and higher level manpower in Papua New Guinea, effectiveness is limited
by: (a) weaknesses in policies for enrollment expansion and cost-control, and
in subsector planning and evaluation; (b) insufficient support for the provi-
sioni of appropriate instructional materials, and for upgrading of the national
teaching force; and (c) inequities in the provincial distribution of school
places, and inadequacies in existing facilities.
Policies, Planning and Evaluation
1.08      Enrollment Expansion.  During the early post-independence period,
(1976- 980), enrollments in PHSs and NHSs expanded at a rate of about 6% per
year.-   Since 1981, the official rate of expansion has been reduced by the
central government to 2% and 3% per year, respectively, for the PHS and NHS
systems.  The revised expansion ra?ys are based on results of the National
Manpower Assessment (NMA) of 1979 -   The NMA estimates that formal employment
will absorb only 20% of entrants to the labor force during 1980-90. The slow
pace of growth is anticipated to result largely from stagnation in agricul-
ture, high wage rates, and related substitution of capital for labor. The
government's policy for reduced expansion of enrollments in secondary schools
is t:hus designed to minimize unemployment among educated manpower. However,
the revised policy, together with generally limited expansion in the past, has
in practice contributed to a shortfall among nationals in formal sector
employment. At present, over 70% of manpower employed in positions requiring
at least a grade 10 education is expatriate; and the supply of qualified
secondary school graduates has been insufficient to fill available places in
postsecondary institutions (e.g., the UPNG is underenrolled by about 30%).
These results suggest limitations in NMA assumptions underlying demand esti-
mates for secondary school graduates. In particular, the NNA assumes that all
grade 10 leavers enter formal employment upon graduation. At present,
however, the majority enter institutions of further education (para. 1.03),
which have little margin of choice in selecting applicants. The NMA metho-
dology also includes assumptions that skill intensities, educational require-
ments and real wage rates in formal employment will remain constant through
1990 and beyond. These assumptions contradict general experience in both
developed and developing countries, where skill and educational requirements
have increased over time, and expanded numbers of educated middle and higher
level manpower have tended to depress wage rates. The present practice of
eliminating 27% of the grade 8 cohort from the PHS system further contributes
6/   This compares with an average annual rate of expansion on the order of
25% for developing countries in general during 1950-79.
7/   The NMA represents the government's first comprehensive review of man-
power supply and demand. The NMA report, published in 1981, is included
in the file for the proposed project, as listed in Annex 21.



to the shortfall in qualiWed nationals for formal. employment and reduces
educational productivity.-
1.09      To ensure an increasing supply of national manpower for employment
and higher education over the medium term, both quality improvements and a
revised expansion policy for secondary education would be required. Enroll-
ment growth should, as a minimum, be adequate to keep pace with population
growth in the relevant age group, and include a systematic increase in the
progression rate from grade 8 to 9. To this end, the government has recently
decided to support an increase in this progression rate, from 73% in 1982 to
about 96% by the mid-1990s. The provinces would provide additional classroom
space required while the central government would finance incremental
teachers' salaries. To determine expansion requirements over the longer-term,
social demand for school places and changing demand and requirements for
employment would need to be reviewed.
1.10      Cost-Control.  Expenditure on secondary education comprises a com-
paratively small share of total expenditure on education (see Basic Data and
Annex 1). However, use of expatriate teachers detracts from cost-effective-
ness at this level. The average salary of an expatriate teacher at the PHSs,
at about US$18,200 per year, is 3.2 times that of a national teacher. In
1982, 75% of approximately 1,500 PHS teachers were nationals. Government
policy is to replace expatriates with national teachers at the PHSs. The
supply of new PHS teachers, at about 175 annually, has been sufficient to keep
pace with enrollment expansion and to increase the share of national teachers
by 1% annually over the past ten years. However, high attrition of national
teachers, averaging 8% per year since 1978, and amounting to about 100
teachers in 1982, has prevented further gains. Alternative employment oppor-
tunities and poor yomotion prospects for PHS teachers largely explain the
high rate of loss.- Replacement of remaining expatriates in the PHS system
would reduce the annual recurrent cost per student by 22%, or from US$550 to
US$430 in 1982 prices. A systematic policy for replacing expatriate with
national teachers at the NHSs has not been introduced. Only eight of 96 NHS
teachers are nationals, as reflected in high per student costs, at US$2,000 in
1982. An all-national teaching staff at the NHSs would reduce this cost to
about US$1,200 per student in 1982 prices. This reduced recurrent cost would
nonetheless represent 2.8 times the comparable cost for a PHS student, owing
to high costs of board and transportation at the NHSs and a relatively low
student-teacher ratio of 17:1 (compared with about 27:1 at the PHSs in
1983). However, the preliminary year, which uses university resources to
provide upper secondary education, represents the highest cost form of second-
ary education: the annual recurrent cost for universities was US$7,500 per
student in 1982. In view of present budgetary constraints, and the relatively

efficiency in the system: 5.5 student years are required to produce a
grade 10 graduate compared with the four-year curriculum.

high share of financing already allocated for education in Papua New Guinea,
the government needs to reduce recurrent costs for secondary education to
support expansion. Implementation of the policy to increase the share of
nationals among PHS teachers should be strengthened. Improvements in training
and in technical support for national teachers would also be required to raise
the quality of teaching. In addition, cost-effective alternatives for pro-
viding upper secondary education should be developed by the DOE (e.g., provi-
ding grades 11 and 12 education at the PHSs, charging fees at that level, and
eliminating the university preliminary year). To reduce attrition of national
teachers at the PHSs, the TSC plans to introduce revised personnel require-
ments towards the end of 1984, to improve promotion possibilities. An
increased number of promotions would be allowed and a system for crediting
participation in upgrading courses towards promotion would be introduced. In
addition, it is expected that economic constraints would reduce alternative
career opportunities for teachers during the next several years.
1.11      Planning and Evaluation.  An absence of medium and longer-term
planning has contributed to the weaknesses in coverage and efficiency in
secondary education. A four-year rolling investment plan, the National Public
Experiditure Plan (NPEP), is the mechanism used by government agencies to
allozate development resources. While criteria for use of NPEP funds are
generally appropriate, they do not encourage multi-year or sectoral
planning. Emphasis is given instead to annual programming and budgeting. The
DOE's Planning Unit, with provincial inputs, has nonetheless bwyn to under-
take medium-term planning for primary and secondary education.-    To date,
however, this planning effort has focussed mainly on school building and
staffing considerations, with inadequate emphasis on strengthening sector
effectiveness. An absence of systematic monitoring and evaluation of sector
performance (e.g., of educational inputs available, efficiency, quality and
costS) has contributed to this approach. While staff of the DOE's Planning
Unit, responsible for overall coordination of educational planning, are appro-
priately qualified to manage broadened planning responsibilities, the
Measurement Services Unit of the DOE's Standards Division has an insufficient
number of staff to carry out additional evaluation responsibilities, and the
PDOEs lack qualified staff for both planning and monitoring. Under the
Primary Education Project (para. 1.04), consultant services and broad training
in educational management and planning were provided for superintendents
heading the PDOEs. This training was organized and delivered by the UPNG. To
support introduction of effective subsector planning and evaluation,
provincial planning staff require further assistance and training, and the DOE
requires additional evaluation and testing staff.
1.12      To continue efforts to strengthen planning, the DOE has decided to
expand the component included under the Primary Education Project. The DOE's
Planning Unit would be charged with coordinating comprehensive medium-term
planning for education. The PDOEs and individual institutions at the post-
grade 10 level would be requested to carry out the regular preparation of
10/ Government is c Lrrently considering the introduction of requirements for
such planning in a 1 departments.



medium-term plans as well as annual programs and budget requests. To support
this effort, the functions of the central Planning Unit's officers for primary
and postprimary education would be revised to center on provision of advisory
services. In addition, a third planner would be designated as provincial
liaison officer. This officer, to be placed in the DOE's Measurement Services
Unit, would assist the PDOEs and other institutions to analyze educational
problems and needs, with emphasis on project development and implementation.
Further, consultant services provided under the Primary Education Project
would be continued through 1987, and further training would be provided for
provincial staff, including the chief planning officers and others in the
PDOEs. Included would be a continuation of the course developed by the UPNG
and regional workshops on subsector-specific planning and related data
preparation and analysis.
Materials and Teachers
1.13      Low average scores of students on standardized achievement tests
administered to PHS students at the end of Grade 10 indicate weaknesses in the
quality of lower secondary education. These scores declined continuously from
1970-1977, as shown in Table 1.2 below. In 1978, a new examination system was
introduced. While not strictly comparable to the earlier examinations, over-
all scores on the new examinations have also declined, by 2.2% annually since
1978. The problems of educational quality at PHSs are explained largely by an
absence of relevant instructional materials and weaknesses in the subject
matter knowledge of national teachers. Quality problems are less pronounced
at the upper secondary level (para. 1.04).

1.14      Materials.  Generally appropriate curricula have been developed and
introduced for both lower and upper secondary education in Papua New Guinea.
Core subjects include mathematics, English, science and social science (see



--8-
Annex 4 for an allocation of student time by subject for the PHS and NHS cur-
ricula).  However, textbooks designed to support the curricula have not been
systematically provided. The Curriculum Unit (CU) of the Standards Division,
DOE, is responsible 'or providing learning materials for PHS students and
related teachers' guides. Materials development has been carried out largely
by subject specialists in the CU, working with Subject Advisory Committees
com' rising mainly DOE staff and teachers. Overall guidance is provided by a
PHS Board of Studies comprising DOE and outside educators. Materials produc-
tion is managed by the Materials Unit of the Standards Division and the DOE's
printshop prints prototype materials. A program of textbook development for
the PHSs has been initiated. Manuscripts for mathematics and English text-
books, and supplementary materials for science are in various stages of prepa-
ratJon. However, materials are not being developed in sequence by grade
level, and progress has been slow owing to an insufficient number of subject
specialists in the CU. Since work began in 1981, only one mathematics spe-
cia'ist has worked full-time on PHS textbook development. As a result, only
grades 7 and 8 mathematics textbooks have been finalized and delivered to
schools, and the majority of teachers are unable to adapt other available
materials (mainly sets of older textbooks purchased or donated from abroad) to
the curriculum. (Similar problems are encountered by College of External
StucLies instructors in the grades 7-10 equivalency courses, for which no
regular materials have been developed.) At the NHSs, the provision of text-
books and other materials is largely a school-based responsibility. However,
sub'ect department heads and senior teachers use textbooks and mimeographed
materials on an ad hoc basis, and the quality of materials for core subjects
varies among the four schools. In view of quality weaknesses at the PHSs,
priority needs to be given to completing the development of textbooks and
teachers' guides related to the curriculum for grades 7-10. For this purpose,
additional staff and facilities would be required for the Standards Division
and printshop in the DOE. To undertake the systematic preparation of
materials for NHS students, materials coordinators would also be required for
the NHSs. Library books and supplementary instructional materials, in short
supply, should also be provided for all secondary schools.
1.15      Teachers.  Preservice training for PHS teachers is provided at two
campuses of the UPNG. The main campus, in Port Moresby, provides a program of
three-years' duration leading to a bachelor's degree. While this program
focusses on educational administration and teaching, only some 15 of 40 grad-
uates annually enter the PHS teaching force. The principal source of
secondary school teachers is the Goroka Teachers' College (GTC) of the UPNG,
which offers a certificate program of two-years' duration. The GTC has an
enrollment of about 350 students. Some 160 students graduate annually. Two-
thirds of those enrolled enter the GTC as grade 10 graduates and must complete
a preliminary year before entering the certificate program (para. 1.03). The
remainder, grade 12 graduates, enter the program immediately. The present
certificate program provides a broad-based education for trainees, with about
one-Third of student hours allocated for teaching methods and practice, and
two-:hirds for subject matter preparation in two subject areas. Time alloca-
Led for teaching methods is appropriate. In view of weaknesses in the quality
of p-imary and lower secondary education, however, time allocated for subject
matter training is insufficient to adequately prepare the majority of
trainees. Moreover, the majority of the present PHS teaching force attended



-- 9 -
GTC when a three-subject major was required in the two-year program, and
regular in-service upgrading in subject matter has not been provided. An in-
service advanced diploma (one year) and a degree program (two years) are
provided at the UPNG in Port Moresby. However, these programs enroll only 15-
20 students annually. In additioni, arn insufficient number of inspectors are
available to effectively supervise and monitor teaching quality at the PHSs:
14 inspectors serve the 20 provinces. No specific training program is
provided for preparing national teachers for the NHSs.
1.16      The relatively heavy workload of secondary school teachers has
further hindered teaching quality at the PHSs. Classroom teaching time
amounts to about 30 student periods a week, and teachers are charged with a
number of non-academic duties related to boarding and administration (e.g.
procurement, library and accounting tasks), which detract from preparation
time. NHS teachers have similar responsibilities. Limited promotion possi-
bilities, particularly within an individual school, have also contributed to a
high rate of interschool transfer, on the order of 30% of national PHS
teachers annually in recent years (about 350 teachers in 1982), which also
reduces school quality and efficiency.  This problem would be addressed by the
TSC (para. 1.10).
1.17      To support continuing increases in the share of qualified nationals
among secondary teachers, the GTC needs to introduce a revised program of pre-
service training and regular in-service training, focussing on subject matter,
for PHS teachers. Consideration also needs to be given to development of a
program for preparing national teachers for the upper secondary level. In
addition, support staff and additional inspectors should be provided to reduce
teachers' workloads and improve supervision.
Distribution of Secondary School Places
1.18      Significant inequities exist in the distribution of PHS places among
the country's 20 provinces. Enrollment ratios range from 8% in the Eastern
Highlands and Enga to 30% and 29% in New Ireland and the National Capital pro-
vinces, respectively.  In addition, those provinces with the highest shares of
the population, i.e., those with over 15,000 children in the relevant age
group, all have lower than average participation rates as shown in Table 1.3
below (for details on enrollments by province and grade, see Annex 5).  In
view of the limited number of places at the NHSs, which draw students from
throughout the country, inequities are reflected primarily in terms of oppor-
tunities to attend PHSs. Inequities also exist in the composition of enroll-
ment as between male and female students. Girls represent 36% of PHS students
overall, and 25% or less in several provinces (Annex 6). The government's
development program for primary education is designed to increase the partici-
pation of girls. On this basis, the share of girls in secondary enrollments
is expected to increase over the medium-term.

1.19       To redress provincial inequities in the provision of school places,
new PHSs should be established mainly in provinces with below average enroll-
ment ratios. While existing classroom facilities in PHSs and NHSs are ade-
quatie, communal, workshop and laboratory space is in generally poor condition,
particularly in older schools. Expenditure allocated for routine maintenance,
carried out by the Department of Works and Supply (DWS), is inadequate for
undertaking the needed renovation and upgrading works. Based on school age
and need, such upgrading, together with the provision of science equipment,
which is in short supply, should also be undertaken to support improvements in
qual:ity.
Sector Strategy and Bank Participation
1.20       Sector Strategy.  A shortage of qualified national manpower in Papua
New Guinea is a major constraint to achieving self-sufficiency in formal sec-
tor employment as well as productivity increases in the informal sector.



- 11 -
Government thus gives priority to strengthening its education and training
system. The NPEP for 1984-87 emphasizes the need to redress three main
problems in the formal education sector: disparities (by location and sex) in
access; inefficiencies arising from low progression rates; and significant
variations in unit costs among levels. Priority is given to the continuing
development of primary education and to development of secondary education.
Specific objectives of the government's strategy at these ievels are to expand
enrollments on an equitable basis and to improve quality and cost-
effectiveness. Owing to budgetary constraints and concern for overall demand,
expansion of secondary school places would, however, continue at a modest pace
over the next several years. No expansion is planned for university and other
postsecondary enrollments. Emphasis would be given instead to making
efficient use of existing resources and to improving the relevance of courses
offered to requirements for technician and higher level manpower. During
1984-87 the government also plans to strengthen nonformal education and
training programs. These programs would focus on literacy and numeracy
training as well as rural skills training for adults and out-of-school youths.
1.21       Bank Participation.  The Bank endorses the government's strategy for
further development of the education and training system. To date, Bank sup-
port has been directed towards two priority areas, development of national
manpower for middle and higher level employment and strengthening of primary
education. Related assistance has been provided through two Bank-assisted
operations in th  /education sector, for which lending amounted to
US$22.0 million.       The first of these projects, assisted by Credit 661-PNG
of 1976, focussed on strengthening selected postsecondary institutions to meet
manpower needs in agriculture, health and primary- and secondary-level teacher
training. The teacher training component contributed to increases in the
share of nationals in the teaching force, particularly at the secondary level
(para. 1.10). A project completion report has been prepared for this pro-
ject. The project was satisfactorily implemented. However, enrollment and
employment targets were not reached owing primarily to changing manpower
requirements and the insufficient supply of qualified secondary school
graduates to fill places in project institutions (paras. 1.08 - 1.09). The
second project, assisted by Loan 1934/Credit 1087-PNG of 1981, supports the
ongoing program for development of the primary education subsector (para.
1.04). This project is being satisfactorily implemented. It is expected that
future operations would continue to support the development of basic educa-
tion, formal and nonformal, as well as government efforts to improve the
effectiveness of training for technical and managerial manpower. Recent Bank
work on public administration and accountancy practices in Papua New Guinea
has served to identify particular requirements for improved training in those
areas, and a review is underway to identify training needs in selected tech-
nical departments and sectors.
11/ In addition, recent operations in the agricultural sector, e.g., the Enga
Rural Development Project (Loan 2125/Credit 1227-PNG of 1982) and the
Agricultural Support Services Project (Loan 2276-PNG of 1983) have
supported development of local education and training institutions and
agricultural extension training.

II. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Scope
2.01      The main objective of the proposed project is to assist Papua New
Guinea to develop qualified national manpower at the middle and higher levels,
by increasing the output and improving the effectiveness of secondary educa-
tion. These objectives would be achieved primarily through: implementation
of strengthened subsector policies and evaluation practices; provision of
appropriate instructional materials and upgrading of the national teaching
force; and expansion of school places and upgrading of existing facilities.
2.02      The project would include civil works, equipment, materials, furni-
ture, staff, staff-upgrading and technical assistance to:
(a) Policies and Evaluation.
(i)  study and implement enrollment expansion and cost-control poli-
cies designed to improve the match between supply of secondary
school graduates and demand for manpower and increase the cost-
effectiveness of secondary education; and
(ii) strengthen the DOE's Measurement Services Unit to support
improvements in educational planning.
(b) Development of Materials and Upgrading of Teachers.
(i)  strengthen the DOE Curriculum Unit and provide materials
coordinators for the NHSs to prepare and provide curriculum-
related textbooks and other learning materials for PHS and NHS
students, respectively; and
(ii)  introduce a revised program of preservice and expanded in-
service training for national teachers to improve their subject
matter knowledge, and provide additional inspectors and school
administration staff to strengthen support for teachers.
(c) Expansion and Upgrading of Secondary Schools.
(i)  provide approximately 4,500 new student places in PHSs to be
located primarily in provinces with below average enrollment
ratios to reduce inequities in the distribution of school
places and to support planned expansion;
(ii)  expand existing NHSs to support a planned increase in enroll-
ments of about 400 students; and
(iii)  upgrade physical facilities at existing PHSs and NHSs on the
basis of need, and provide additional science equipment at PHSs
to complement planned improvements in the quality of materials
and teaching.

Policies and Evaluation (proposed outlay US$1.3 million, excluding contin-
gencies).
Policies
2.03      Enrollment Expansion.  To increase the supply of secondary school
graduates for places in formal employment and higher education, a revised
policy for expansion of student places would be introduced. Enrollment expan-
sion at PHSs would increase from about 2% in 1981 to an average of about 4%
annually for the period 1982-88 (paras. 1.08 and 1.09). This rate of expan-
sion would be adequate to maintain the present enrollment ratio of 13%, while
supporting the planned increase (on the order of 2% annually) in the progres-
sion rate of students from grade 8 to grade 9, from about 73% in 1982 to 85%
by 1988. Overall, PHS enrollments would expand from about 39,700 in 1982 to
49,400 in 1988, as shown in Table 2.1 below, and the number of grade 10 grad-
uates would increase by nearly 50%, from 6,700 in 1982 to about 10,000 annu-
ally by 1988. Enrollments at existing NHSs would also expand by about 4%
annually on average during 1982-88, owing to the low enrollment base (1,600
students) at present. As a result, the number of NHS graduates would increase
by about 25%, from 800 in 1982 to about 1,000 in 1988. This level of expan-
sion for PHS and NHS enrollments during 1984-88, together with planned quality
improvements for the primary and PHS systems, would be sufficient to raise
utilization of existing postsecondary institutions and to allow for increased
selectivity in choosing applicants for higher education. The increased number
of qualified secondary school graduates would also contribute to increases in
the share of nationals in formal employment.

2.04      Longer-term expansion requirements for upper secondary education
would be determined on the basis of a study to be carried out under the proj-
ect. The study would review the relationship between upper secondary edu-
cation and middle and higher level employment to recommend appropriate expan-
sion rates and curriculum options for the future. The relationships between
primary and secondary education, and secondary and higher education would also
be reviewed, together with the suitability of the present duration of each
cycle of education (i.e., the 6-4-2 structure for primary and secondary educa-
tion). Recommendations of the study would be used by the Minister of
Education and other authorities as policy and planning inputs for upper secon-
dary education. The project would provide technical assistance (9 man-months
of foreign consultant services) to carry out the study, under guidance of the
Permanent Secretary, DOE. (For details on technical assistance to be provided
under the project see Annex 7). The DOE has prepared suitable terms of refer-
ence for the study (shown in Annex 8). During negotiations, an agreement was
reached that the study would be carried out beginning in March 1985.
2.05      Cost-Control.  To reduce the recurrent cost per student in secondary
education, implementation of the policy to replace expatriate with national
teachers at the PHSs would be strengthened and alternatives for the cost-
effective provision of upper secondary education would be reviewed. For PHS
teachers, the DOE has established a target to reduce the share of expatriate
teachers from about 25% in 1982 to 13% by 1988, as shown in Table 2.2,
below. This improvement would be effected together with improvements in the
qualifications of national PHS teachers and expanded promotion possibilities
(para. 1.10). The existing capacity of the GTC (which is under-enrolled by
about 25% at present) would be adequate for training the new teachers
required. As a result of the increase in the share of national PHS teachers,
the annual recurrent cost per student would decline by about 11%, from US$550
in 1982 to US$490 in 1988, in constant prices.

/a   Annual attrition (from the end of the previous year) is estimated at:  8%
for 1982 and 1983; 7% for 1984 and 1985; and 6% for 1986 and 1987.
/b   Net stock is the number of national teachers in the PHSs.  Attrition from
the previous year and new GTC and UPNG output have been accounted for in
the total.
/c   Deficit is the number of teacher places to be filled by expatriate staff.
Notes: Teacher demand was calculated on the basis of the present teacher-class
ratio of 1.5:1 (with an average class-size of 40 students, i.e., a
student-teacher ratio of 27:1), which is appropriate.
The low output of new teachers for 1983 would result from the planned
introduction of a year of further training for 40 GTC graduates (pre-
service) annually (see para. 2.14).
2.06      For NHS teachers, the share of nationals is expected to increase
from about 8% in 1982 to 30% by 1988. However, this improvement would not
significantly reduce recurrent costs at the NHSs. The study on upper second-
ary education (para. 2.04) would thus include a review of alternatives for
providing cost-effective education at the upper secondary level and for elimi-
nating the preliminary year at universities by the early 1990s (para. 1.10).
Evaluation
2.07      To strengthen medium to longer-term policy and programming decisions
for secondary education and support the ongoing effort to improve educational
planning generally (paras. 1.11 and 1.12), systematic monitoring and evalua-
tion practices would be introduced for secondary education under the project.



- 16 -
To provide improved information for planning, the provincial education
pLanners in the PDOEs and NHS staff would be asked to be responsible for the
regular monitoring of subsector performance. Achievement of targets for
enrollments, enrollment composition, unit costs and student achievement at
PHSs and NHSs, in addition to school building and staffing, would be moni-
tored. The Measurement Services Unit of the DOE would coordinate progress
monitoring efforts and consolidate results. The Unit would also be respons-
ible for continuous development and administration of examinations to measure
student achievement. Two evaluation officers and two testing officers would
be provided for the Unit to enable it to undertake these expanded responsibi-
lities. Annex 9 provides a list of indicators which would be monitored
regularly by the Unit, together with selected evaluation work to be conducted
by the Unit during 1984-88. Included are evaluations of the impact of
materials and teacher training to be provided under the project on student
achievement.
2.08      The project would include financing for the establishment of the new
positions in the Measurement Services Unit of the DOE (see Annex 10 for a list
of new DOE staff to be appointed under the project). Technical assistance (36
man-months of overseas fellowships for key testing and evaluation staff in the
DOE) would also be provided. In addition, financing would be provided to
carry out studies related to the preparation of future projects. These
studies, to be administered through the DOE, would likely include work on
requirements for postsecondary (non-university) technical training and for
non-formal education. During negotiations, an agreement was reached that the
evaluation officers would be appointed by January 1, 1986, and the testing
officers by January 1, 1987.
Development of Materials and Upgrading of Teachers (proposed outlay
US$10.3 million, excluding contingencies)
Materials
2.09      Provincial High Schools.  To improve the quality of secondary edu-
cation and student achievement, the project would assist the DOE to complete
the ongoing program for preparation and distribution of curriculum-related
instructional materials for PHS students (para. 1.14). The existing Curri-
culum Unit in the DOE would be strengthened through provision of four new
positions for materials development to consolidate its textbook development
activities. To complement the existing mathematics specialist, new staff
would be subject matter specialists and writers in science (one), English
(two) and social science (one). The complete series of textbooks (about
30 titles) and teacher's editions would be developed in sequence, produced,
and printed for each core subject, except English. An existing series of
English textbooks would be adapted. While basic science textbooks would be
purchased abroad, supplementary science textbooks would be developed
locally. On the basis of PHS enrollment projections for the period 1984-88,
the DOE plans to deliver some 450,000 textbooks, including replacements, to
provide each student in grades 7-10 with one set of textbooks for each core
subject. The overall schedule for the introduction of the new textbooks is
provided in Annex 11 and summarized in Table 2.3 below. In addition, the
project would provide some 250,000 copies of supplementary (e.g., science



- 17 -
pamphlets, workbooks) and reference materials in all subject areas as well as
library books. The supplementary materials would be provided on the basis of
one set for each two students, and would be selected to support the prescribed
curriculum.

/a   Textbooks for grades 7 and 8 mathematics have already been introduced.
Note:  Textbooks for subjects other than science include two or more volumes
per grade.
2.10      The materials development staff in the CU would manage the develop-
ment and procurement of materials. The existing Subject Advisory Committees
and the PHS Board of Studies would monitor work to ensure that materials
reflect curriculum needs. The textbook development cycle would comprise two
years: one year for manuscript planning, writing, editing, and field testing;
and one year for revising, printing and distributing the textbooks.
2.11      Field testing of newly written or edited units for each title would
be conducted in a sample of 5-10 schools, selected on the basis of accessibi-
lity and representativeness of students' cultural and linguistic back-
grounds.-2   Curriculum officers and authors testing materials would visit
schools to observe students and interview teachers. Teachers would record
their observations on trial manuscripts (e.g., on adequacy of content, level
of presentation, relevance to cultural conditions), which would be considered
in subsequent revisions. Training on use of the new materials would be pro-
vided to practicing teachers primarily through in-service upgrading to be
provided under the project (para. 2.15). In addition, workshops regularly
organized by the CU would be used to orient school principals, department
heads and inspectors on use of the materials. Printing of materials within
the DOE would be limited to production of prototype materials. Related
equipment is being procured under the primary education project. The
12/ While the medium of instruction in secondary education is English, some
700 languages are spoken in Papua New Guinea.



- 18 -
Materials Unit of the Standards Division would produce manuscripts for
printing by commercial printers abroad, at an estimated cost of US$1.50 per
copy, which is reasonable. On average, 20% of textbooks and otlher materials
would be replaced annually after 1986. Additional staff would be provided for
the DOE's printshop, including two type-setters for printing of prototype
textbooks for PHSs. To support expanded materials development and other
activities for secondary education, a building for the Standards Division of
the DOE would also be provided. Storage and distribution of books would be
the responsibility of the Materials Unit. Suitable storage facilities,
provided under the Primary Education Project, are available in Port Moresby,
and the present practice of distributing packages of books to individual
schools through the PDOEs is appropriate.
2.12      The project would provide for the establishment of four new posi-
ti3ns for curriculum officers at the CU and two type-setter positions for the
DOE printshop. Financing would also be provided for construction of the
Standards Division building, overseas printing of textbooks, and purchase of
science textbooks, supplementary materials and library books. Materials
development would be supported through the provision of fellowships (120 man-
months foreign) for key CU and College of External Studies' staff in the
development of grades 7-10 materials. The DOE has designated staff for two
new positions to be established in 1984 in the CU and an agreement was reached
during negotiations that the two remaining CU staff would be appointed by
January 1, 1986 and the type-setters by January 1, 1985.
2.13      National High Schools.  The project would also support improved co-
ordination in materials preparation for NHSs, through appointment of a
materials coordinator for each of the four core subject areas (para. 1.14).
one coordinator would be based in each of the existing NHSs. Each coordinator
w-ould be responsible for preparing a set of teaching and resource materials in
one core subject for use in all NHSs. The coordinator would be supported in
this activity by teachers and other staff in the schools. Because of the
limited number of NHS students, most supplementary materials would continue to
be mimeographed rather than printed commercially. These materials would com-
plement assignments in existing overseas textbooks already available in the
schools. In addition, library books and other supporting materials would be
provided. The project would finance four positions for materials coordinators
at the NHSs (including housing for three) and the procurement of library books
and supplementary materials. One coordinator has already commenced his
duties, and during negotiations, an agreement was reached that the remaining
coordinators would be appointed by February 1, 1987.
Upgrading of Teachers
2.14      Preservice Training.  To further raise the quality of lower secon-
dary education and support the targeted increase in the share of national PHS
teachers, the GTC is developing a revised curriculum for preservice training
of teachers. The revised preservice program would center on a major subject-
minor subject curriculum. It would allow students to specialize in one
subject area, which they would select for teaching (para. 1.15). Under the
revised curriculum, students' time allocated for subject matter specialization



- 19 -
would increase by 50% for the major subject. This major subject emphasis
would be appropriate: about 75% of schools have 10 or more class groups, and
can fully utilize one or two teachers per core subject. During 1984-88, 200
GTC graduates (preservice) would receive subject matter upgrading through
participation in the first year of the in-service bachelors' degree program at
the UPNG. This course would be revised as necessary by UPNG staff to ensure
coordination with the new GTC program. In addition, 100 UPNG graduates, from
fields other than teaching, would participate in a one-year diploma program in
education at the UPNG during 1984-88. It is expected that about 20 of these
participants would enter the NHS teaching force and that the majority of the
remaining 80 would become PHS teachers. Fellowships for the 300 participants
in the advanced diploma and the diploma programs (3,600 man-months local)
would be financed under the project. Participants in the advanced diploma
program would be given credit towards the UPNG degree program.
2.15      In-service Training.  To introduce systematic subject matter upgra-
ding for practicing teachers, six additional staff would be appointed to the
GTC to develop and introduce a program of in-service training. The new staff
would comprise specialists in the core subject areas, though one or more would
require experience in vocational and other subject areas as well. These staff
would be responsible primarily for developing materials and initiating in-
service training courses in all core subjects during 1984-88. The in-service
courses would combine classroom and self-instructional techniques; and
materials would be prepared for home and classroom assignments on the basis of
grade 7-10 curricula and the new materials to be introduced under the project.
Each course would be carried out over a two-year period. Trainees would par-
ticipate in classroom (i.e., residential) training during vacation periods for
three months over the two years of a course, utilizing existing campuses of
the UPNG and other available facilities. Indiv ual assignments would be
undertaken by the trainees throughout the two-year course cycle. During 1984-
88, an estimated 325 teachers would participate in the GTC in-service program.
This number of teachers would represent about 30% of national teachers
assigned in core subject areas during 1984-88. (An annual schedule for parti-
cipation in this in-service training program is provided in Table 2.4 below.)
To provide practicing teachers with an incentive to participate in upgrading,
credit would be applied towards the advanced diploma of education offered at
the UPNG. This diploma qualifies teachers for a promotion in grade. School
principals and inspectors would be prepared, during regular meetings and
workshops organized by the DOE, to provide support to teachers participating
in the in-service training and to follow-up and monitor the effectiveness of
both the self-instructional and classroom programs.

2.16      During 1984-88, an additional 25 senior PHS teachers would partici-
pate in the two-year degree program at the UPNG. This in-service program
would be designed to prepare trainees as heads of departments at the PHSs. In
addition, 18 national NHS and PHS teachers would be upgraded through partici-
pation in master's degree programs abroad (8 teachers) or subject courses at
the UPNG (10 teachers) for positions in the NHSs. None of the pre- or in-
service training programs to be provided at the UPNG is expected to lead to
requirements for additional staff or facilities, owing to underutilization at
present (para. 1.08).
2.17      The project would include financing for the establishment of six new
positions at the GTC (including housing) and for the development of related
course materials. In addition, fellowships (96 man-months foreign and 1,635
man-months local) would be provided. The foreign fellowships would support
the upgrading of existing NHS teachers. The local fellowships would support
teachers participating in courses at the UPNG and in the in-service training
at the GTC. During negotiations, an agreement was reached that all new GTC
staff would be appointed by January 1, 1987.
2.18      Teacher Support.  To further support improvements in the quality of
teaching at PHSs, additional inspectors would be appointed together with
administrative staff at schools.  Six new inspectors would be appointed to
allow one inspector in each province (para. 1.15). In addition to providing
follow-up support through school visits, to teachers participating in in-
service training at the GTC (para. 2.15), inspectors would be responsible for
monitoring the overall quality of PHS teaching. One to two administrative
staff would also be recruited at each PHS and NHS. Appointment of these staff
is expected to allow teachers more time for classroom preparation and time for
preparing in-service training assignments. The project would finance incre-
mental salaries and housing for the new inspectors, and the salaries of
support staff to be appointed. In addition, fellowships would be provided (96
man-months local) to enable four inspectors to complete the bachelors' of
education program at the UPNG. One inspector has already commenced his duties
and during negotiations, an agreement was reached that the remaining
inspectors would be appointed by February 1, 1988.

Expansion and Upgrading of Secondary Schools (proposed outlay US$48.3 million,
excluding contingencies)
2.19      Expansion of Provincial High Schools.  To support achievement of
targets for enrollments and graduates at PHSs during 1984-88, the project
would include the construction of accommodations for about 112 new classes in
23 new government schools for a total of 4,480 places. The new government
PHSs would be located mainly in the provinces with below average enrollment
ratios, as shown in Table 2.5 below. It is planned that ten schools currently
under construction would be completed and four new schools fully constructed
under the project. An additional nine schools would be established and would
be at various stages of construction at project completion. They would be
constructed in stages over four years, with two classes of 40 places each
added each year. This structure would allow for two classes at each grade
level and cater for progression of about 96% of grade 8 students to grade 9.
Each new school would have an enrollment capacity of 320 students at
completion. On average about three new schools would be completed annually.
In addition to classrooms, two workshops (for home economics and practical
arts) and a science laboratory would be constructed at each school. Boarding
would be provided for all students. Salaries for all additional teachers
required would be financed by the central government. Half of the cost of
financing the construction would come from tied grants given to the provincial
governments by the central government for this purpose, and the other half
would be budgeted by the provinces from their untied grants, also provided by
the central government. Progress with implementation of this construction
program would be reviewed annually and the program revised as necessary. In
addition, funds would be provided under the project for construction at
existing church agency schools. The church agencies would be required to
match these funds which would be used for new classrooms or major renova-
tions. The project would include financing for the construction of the PHSs,
the grants to the church agency schools, the incremental costs of establishing
about 170 new positions for teachers and headmasters (including salaries and
housing) needed during 1984-88 as a result of the expansion program, and the
salaries of expatriate teachers already contracted under the NPEP.

lb  Border and other specially designated areas for which PHSs are managed by the DOE.
2.20       Expansion of National High Schools.  The project would also provide
for the expansion of enrollments at the four existing NHSs. An additional
100 student places would be provided at each school, to increase enrollments
by 25%. Although additional students would be absorbed into existing class-
rooms, and some into existing boarding places, new boarding facilities for 80
students would be required at each school. Only one additional teacher would
be appointed at each school. As a result, the student-teacher ratio would
increase from 17:1 to 20:1 (para. 1.10). The project would include the con-
struction of additional boarding facilities, and staff houses and incremental
salaries for the additional four teachers.
2.21       Upgrading Existing High Schools.  To support planned quality
improvements for secondary education, the project would provide for upgrading
of government and church agency PHSs built before 1979 (including 57 govern-
ment and 30 church agency schools) and of the four NHSs. The work would
center on upgrading of workshops, laboratories and communal facilities. A
formula has been developed by the DOE to allocate the largest proportion of
funds to the oldest schools (i.e., those established prior to 1970) with a
lesser amount to those established between 1970 and 1978 (see Annex 12). The
formula also takes the size of the schools into account.  Each PHS would pre-
pare requests for school upgrading for review and approval by the provincial



- 23 -
DWS. After approval, schools would arrange to have work carried out. Funds
for upgrading would be available yearly through the DOE. However, a school
could allow its allocation to accumulate over several years in order to
finance a larger project. Government PHSs would be encouraged, and church
agency schools required, to match the central government funds to be provided
for upgrading. Upgrading at the four NHSs would also be based on school age
and need, and the national DWS has prepared an upgrading program for these
schools. Science and laboratory equipment would be provided to all PHSs to
cater for replacement as well as incremental needs (para. 1.19). The equip-
ment would be procured in bulk and sorted into kits for distribution to the
schools. Financing for upgrading of existing PHSs and the NHSs, and for pro-
vision of science equipment for the PHSs, would be included under the project.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND IMPLEMENTATION
Costs
3.01      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$78.5 million equi-
valent, including the capitalized front-end fee. The estimated cost by pro-
ject item is summarized in Table 3.1. (Detailed costs are given in Annex 13
and project expenditure by year and purpose in Annex 14). Investment costs of
the project would represent about 25% of estimated development expenditures
for education during the project implementation period, 1984-88. Government
has judged this level of expenditure to be affordable and appropriate in view
of the priority given to strengthening secondary education; and the investment
costs of the project would not detract from planned investments in primary and
other educational subsectors.
3.02      Base costs refer to February 1984 131 prices.  Construction costs
are based on recent contract awards for similar facilities in Papua New
Guinea, and were adjusted for regional cost differences. Furniture costs are
estimated at 5% of construction costs for boarding facilities and 8-10% for
other types of construction. The costs of equipment and materials have been
estimated on the basis of standard DOE equipment lists and recent tenders and
were adjusted to include local transportation and installation. Areas and
capital costs per studernt place and per housing unit are compared with
regional and Bank-wide averages in Annex 15. While unit areas are somewhat

below regional and Bank-wide averages, unit costs are generally higher as a
result of high transportation costs for materials and labor. During 1984, the
government will review possibilities for reducing construction costs by sim-
plifying standard designs and using more local materials. Equipment and
materials imported under the project would be exempt from duties and taxes.
Import duties or taxes on building materials have not been identified sepa-
rately in project costs as such taxes are negligible. The project includes
93 man-months of foreign consultant services and 5,583 man-months of fellow-
ships (252 man-months foreign and 5,331 man-months local). In line with
recent experience in Papua New Guinea, unit costs for consultant services were
estimated to average about US$6,000 per expatriate man-month (inclusive of
salaries, allowances and international travel). Unit costs for fellowships
were estimated at about US$1,300 per man-month for overseas fellowships inclu-
sive of international travel, and US$400 per man-month for local fellow-
ships. In addition, about US$600,000 has been included under the project for
preparation of future projects.
3.03      The contingency allowance of US$18.1 million includes contingencies
for unforeseen physical conditions of 10% for civil works, furniture, equip-
ment, and materials and 5% for all other categories. Price contingencies were
calculated on base costs plus physical contingencies in accordance with the
implementation schedule, the Bank's experience with educational equipment and
technical assistance price increases, and the following expected average
annual increases in prices: local - 8% for 1984 and 7% for 1985-88 and
foreign - 7.3% for 1984, 6.7% for 1985 and 6.2% for 1986-88.L1 Accordingly,
aggregated price increases are estimated at about 20% of baseline costs plus
physical contingencies. Total contingencies are estimated at about 30% of
base costs.
3.04      Based on an analysis of expenditures for similar projects in PNG,
the foreign exchange content of each category of expenditure is as follows:
(a) civil works, 35%; (b) furniture, 35%; (c) equipment and materials, 90%;
(d) expatriate consultants and overseas fellowships, 90%; (e) salaries for
expatriate teachers and technical staff, 40%; and (f) local fellowships,
incremental salaries for national teachers and local technical and support
staff, and incremental operating costs, 20%.

Financing Plan
3.05      The proposed Bank loan of US$49.3 million would finance 65% of total
project costs exclusive of church agency financing, including 100% of the
estimated foreign exchange cost plus the front-end fee, and 43% of estimated
local costs. In view of current financing constraints in Papua New Guinea and
the priority given by government to development of qualified national manpower
for middle and higher level employment, and to the project, local cost finan-
cing is justified. The government and the church agencies would finance the
remaining costs of US$29.2 million. Retroactive financing amounting to
US$4.0 million is provided for under the loan for expenditures in all cate-
gories beginning January 1, 1984. The proposed financial plan is provided in
Annex 16.
Recurrent Operating Costs
3.06      As a result of the project, and the increased progression rate for
grade 8 students at PHSs, the share for secondary education in total recurrent
expenditure for education would increase from an estimated 17% in 1983 to 20%
in 1988. Recurrent costs for lower secondary education (direct education
costs) would increase overall by 11%, from about US$21.8 million in 1982 to
US$24.2 million in 1988. This increase compares with a planned increase of
24% in enrollments over the same period. The difference is explained by the
increased share of nationals in PHS teaching staff targeted under the project,
which would decrease recurrent costs per student by about 11%, from US$550 in
1982 to US$490 by 1988. An increase of about 50% in central government expen-
ditures for reproduction and replacement of PHS textbooks would be offset by
resulting provincial savings for procurement and reproduction of materials.
At the NHSs, enrollments would expand by about 25%. However, total recurrent
costs, at about US$3.2 million in 1982, would remain relatively constant,
primarily as a result of the planned increase in the student-teacher ratio,
from 17:1 to 20:1 and a savings in the average teacher's salary on the order
of 15% expected to result from the planned increase in the share of national
NHS teachers. The government plans to absorb the incremental recurrent costs
attributed to the pf??ect in its routine budgets and should be able to do so
without difficulty.-
Project Management and Implementation
3.07      The project would be implemented by existing line agencies at
national and provincial levels and coordinated by staff -n the Ministry of
Education. Overall responsibility for coordinating project implementation
15/ Continuing priority is given by Government to educational development.
Total expenditure on education is expected to grow by 3% annually in real
terms during 1984-88. As a result of general budgetary constraints,
however, expenditure on education as a share of total public expenditure
would increase from about 19% in 1983 to 21% in 1988. Due to an expected
upturn in export-related growth and investment, the share of expenditure
on education in GNP should, however, remain constant at about 5%.

would rest with a Project Management Committee. The Committee would be
chaired by the Secretary for Education and would include the Secretaries of
Finance and Works and Supply and the Director of the National Planning Office
(or their nominees). Similar committees are established for all externally
assisted education projects. The Committee would be a policy-implementing and
decision-making body, responsible to the Budget Priorities Committee. The
project would be managed by the DOE's Overseas Aid Unit (OAU) responsible to
the DOE's Assistant Secretary for Planning. (The organizational structure for
project management is shown in Annex 17). The Curriculum and Materials Units
in the DOE would be responsible for the development, production and printing
of curriculum-related learning materials for the PHSs. Library books for the
PHSs would be selected by and procured in bulk through the National Library;
library books for the NHSs would be selected and procured by the NHS prin-
cipals.   Science equipment for the PHSs would be procured centrally through
the DOE's Materials Unit. Preservice and in-service teacher training would be
the responsibility of the GTC and the UPNG in consultation with the DOE.
Allocations for support staff in the PHSs and NHSs would be made by the OAU
directly to the schools. Civil works would be managed by the DWS with the
following exception: upgrading at existing government and church agency PHSs
would be managed by the individual schools, following provincial DWS approval
of annual project requests. The DWS currently has the capacity to manage
civil works included under the project. To support timely execution of the
building program for PHSs, the OAU and the DWS would monitor site acquisition
by the provinces and the Department of Lands with a view to completing
purchase four months prior to the scheduled start of construction. The DOE's
Measurement Services Unit would be responsible for monitoring project progress
and evaluation studies included under the project. The Office of the
Secretary (DOE) would be responsible for coordinating studies related to the
preparation of future projects.
3.08      At present, the OAU is effectively coordinating implementation of
the Bank/IDA-assisted Primary Education Project as well as several other
externally assisted projects. An experienced project manager and an account-
ant would be added to the OAU, with specific responsibility for the proposed
project. The project manager would be financed as a consultant under the
project.  Sixty man-months of consultant services (foreign) would be provided
for this purpose. The accountant would also be financed under the proposed
project. The DOE has appointed a project manager whose qualifications and ex-
perience are satisfactory to the Bank. The accountant would be appointed by
January 1985.
3.09      The central government, through the DOE and the DWS, would finance
project components directly. Exceptions are teacher salaries and half the
cost of construction of the new government PHSs, which would be financed from
tied grants given to the provincial governments by the central government.
The remaining half of the cost of construction at the new PHSs would be finan-
ced by the provincial governments from untied grants also provided by the
central government. Church agencies would match central government funds for
upgrading and construction at church agency PHSs.
3.10      The project would be implemented during the five-year period 1984-
1988 (Annex 18). All project items are expected to be fully implemented by
December 31, 1988, the scheduled completion date.



- 28 -
Status of Project Preparation
3.11      Project preparation is well-advanced.  The new PHSs, the staff
housing and the boarding facilities at the NHSs would all be constructed using
standard DWS designs which have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be
satisfactory although these will be reviewed by the government (para. 3.02).
The design for the Standards Division building, also prepared by the DWS, has
been satisfactorily completed. Sites have been acquired for the two new PHSs
for which construction is scheduled to begin in 1984. The provincial
governments have budgeted for their shares of construction costs for these
schools in 1984. Bid documentation for construction of the schools and the
staff housing required in 1984, and the Standards Division building are under
preparation. Staff of the existing PHSs (government and church agency) are
preparing proposals for facilities upgrading which would be completed by March
1984 for work to be carried out in 1984, and the DWS has finalized a program
for upgrading at the NHSs.
3.12      Furniture and equipment lists and specifications woulld be based on
standard DOE lists and would be completed by March 1984 for items to be pur-
chased in 1984. Terms of reference for the study on upper secondary education
and descriptions of programs of study for overseas fellowships have been
prepared.
Procurement
3.13      Civil Works.  Civil works under the project comprise a number of
relatively small items which would be widely dispersed geographically. Based
on past experience in Papua New Guinea, these civil works (totalling about
US$40.0 million, including contingencies) would not attract foreign bidders
unless they operate locally. Contracts for construction of the Standards
Division building, about half the new government PHSs, housing and expansion
at the NHSs would thus be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding to
prequalified contractors under regular government procedures, which are satis-
factory to the Bank and do not exclude foreign bidders. Due to the remoteness
of the sites and to the lack of local contractors at these locations, the
remaining half of the government PHSs (estimated value US$8.0 million) would
be constructed on the basis of competing quotations obtained locally or by DWS
force account by hiring local day labor for the period necessary to complete
the construction. Upgrading of PHSs and construction at church agency schools
would be arranged by the individual schools with DWS approval. (Annex 19
provides a breakdown of project expenditures by procurement category.)
Contracts, analyses of bids and recommendations for awards for all civil works
contracts awarded under local competitive bidding would be subject to post-
review by the Bank.
3.14      Equipment, Materials and Furniture.  Equipment, and materials and
printing services would be grouped to the extent practicable to form attrac-
tive bid packages. Packages estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or more
(estimated value US$3.3 million) would be awarded in accordance with the
Banlk's guidelines for international competitive bidding. In bid comparison,
local manufacturers and printers would be given a preferential margin of 15%



- 29 -
over the c.i.f. cost of competing imports, or the customs duty, whichever is
lower. Other items, which cannot be grouped to form packages of US$100,000
equivalent or more (estimated value US$0.4 million) would be procured under
local competitive bidding procedures. Miscellaneous items, in packages not
exceeding US$25,000 in value, and subject to an aggregate limit of US$0.2 mil-
lion, would be purchased on the basis of at least three competitive price
quotations. Library books and other printed materials (estimated value
US$1.0 million) would be procured through direct purchase after negotiations
for discounts. Prior Bank review of procurement documentation and recommended
contract awards would be required on equipment, materials and printing
contracts of US$100,000 or more. Furniture (estimated value US$2.0 million)
would be procured under regular government procedures.
3.15      Technical Assistance.  Consultancy services financed under the pro-
ject would be obtained in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the use of
consultants.
Disbursements
3.16      The proposed loan of US$49.3 million equivalent would be disbursed
over a period of six years. Disbursements would be made as follows:
(a) 56% of expenditures on civil works;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and
materials and for printing, 100% of the ex-factory costs of locally
manufactured and printed items, and 85% of the costs of other items
procured locally; and
(c) 100% of the costs of consultant services, fellowships and of expa-
triate teaching and technical staff.
Disbursements for the expatriate teaching and technical staff, construction of
PHSs under competing quotations or force account day labor as certified by the
DWS, upgrading of PHS facilities and construction at church agency PHSs would
be based on statements of expenditure (SOEs), as would disbursements for
library books and for local fellowships and training. Submission of numerous,
small withdrawal applications against contracts, certificates or invoices for
these expenditures (for which total value is estimated at about US$35 million)
would be unduly costly for the government and the Bank.  SOEs would be sub-
mitted quarterly and normally aggregated, as possible, to amounts of not less
than US$50,000 per withdrawal.  The OAU's experience with use of SOE proce-
dures under the Primary Education Project is considered to be satisfactory.
Supporting documents would be retained by the OAU and made available for
review, as requested, by visiting Bank missions. Disbursements against
remaining project expenditures would be made against full documentation.
3.17      It is estimated that disbursements would be made within six months
of expenditures, on average. The estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 20)
has been calculated on this basis. To allow sufficient time for submission of
final withdrawal applications, the Closing Date would be December 31, 1989.
In a comparison of disbursements for the proposed project with regional and



- 30 -
country disbursement profiles, the six year disbursement period is average for
projects in Papua New Guinea but almost three-and-a-half years shorter than
the average for past education projects in the region, due to a shorter
implementation period and the advanced state of project preparation.
Auditing and Reporting
3.18      The OAU would establish and maintain separate accounts for all pro-
ject expenditures. At negotiations, the government provided assurances that
accounts would be maintained in accordance with sound practices and audited
annually in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank, including
separate audits of accounts related to disbursement against statements of
expenditure; and that annual audit reports would be sent to the Bank within
six months of the end of the government's fiscal year. Six months after the
Closing Date the OAIU would submit a project completion report to the Bank.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01      The priority given to strengthening secondary education in Papua New
Guinea derives mainly from Government's strategy to upgrade national manpower
to replace expatriates in formal employment. The proposed project would
support progress towards achievement of this objective by expanding enroll-
ments and improving the quality of secondary education. The revised policies
for enrollment expansion and student progression would increase the number of
secondary school graduates (both PHS and NHS) from 7,500 in 1982 to about
11,000 by 1988. This supply would be sufficient to improve utilization of
available places in postsecondary institutions and to contribute to increases
in the share of nationals in formal employment. The project would improve the
quality of secondary education through the provision of appropriate learning
materials for secondary school students, including the distribution of 450,000
PHS textbooks in core subjects, and the introduction of revised programs of
preservice teacher training and in-service training to upgrade the subject
matter knowledge of teachers.  In addition, the project would reduce
inequities in access to secondary education among provinces, by building new
PHSs mainly in provinces with below average enrollment ratios.
4.02      The project would further improve the cost-effectiveness of second-
ary ieducation, particularly at PHSs where a targeted increase in the share of
national teachers is expected to reduce the cost per student from US$550 to
US$490 per year (in constant prices) between 1982 and 1988. A study on upper
secondary education is expected to lead to development of cost-effective
modeLs for providing grades 11 and 12 education and to a substantial reduction
in related recurrent costs during the 1990s. To guide project implementation,
and development of secondary education more generally, monitoring and evalua-
tion capabilities for secondary education would also be strengthened under the
project.

Risks
4.03      The successful implementation of the building program for new PHSs
would require strong provincial commitment and support from the DOE. A risk
exists that provincial commitment would be inadequate. To reduce this risk,
the classroom construction program has been designed to encourage provincial
participation through central government provision of tied grants to cover 50%
of construction costs, and financing for all incremental teachers' salaries.
The ongoing strengthening of planning and planned improvements in evaluation
capabilities at the central and provincial levels, including participation of
provincial education staff in the monitoring of progress towards enrollment
targets, would be an integral part of this effort. A related risk is that
project implementation would lag as a result of delays incurred by the
provinces or the Department of Lands in acquiring sites for new PHSs. This
risk would be reduced through efforts of the OAU and the DWS to monitor site
acquisition with a view to completing purchase at least four months prior to
the scheduled start of construction at a site. A further risk is that
individual assignments in in-service training for PHS teachers would be
ineffective. This risk would be minimized through follow-up by principals,
visits by inspectorate staff, the planned classroom sessions, and continuous
monitoring of training effectiveness.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      Prior to negotiations, the government designated qualified staff for
key positions to be established during 1984 for the Curriculum Unit of the
DOE, as well as an NHS materials coordinator and an additional inspector for
secondary education (paras. 2.12, 2.13, and 2.18).
5.02.     At negotiations, the government provided assurances that:
(a)  the study on upper secondary education would be implemented in
accordance with a schedule agreed with the Bank (para. 2.04);
(b)  staff for new positions to be established under the project would be
formally appointed in accordance with a schedule agreed with the
Bank (paras. 2.08, 2.12, 2.13, 2.17 and 2.18); and
(c)  project accounts would be maintained in accordance with sound prac-
tices during project implementation, and annual audits would be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the
government's fiscal year (para. 3.18).
5.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would consti-
tute a suitable basis for a loan of US$49.3 million equivalent (including the
capitalized front-end fee) to the Government of Papua New Guinea, for a term
of 20 years including five years of grace at the standard variable rate.

C.sparatOne Education Data are useful in the evaluation of oarious education systems and analysis of relative stages nf educational development between yarious
countries.  nHoever, no the basis of the present data,  po-a-natIonal  comparinon should be approached with great nautios.  Data presented in the above table have
beoe collectad largely by Bank misnions from governnent sources; the renainder ore staff estimates or data from Unesco. Efforts have been made to standardize
definition. and, within lilits, to check the accuracy of the data.  Nevertheless, such data are still ieperfect in several respects and the Bank is working to
improve them progreasively on the occasion of its operational work. In the use of these data, the following qualifications shoald be kept in mind:
(1) "Education" as defined in the table includes all education and training, both formal and son-formal.
(2)  "Primary" education refer. to education at the first level and 'secondary" ed-ation refers to all education at the secondary lmvel regardlees of type
(e.g., general, technical, agricnltur-l).
(3)  "Literacy rates" (col. 6) are often obtained from country censuses.  In many countries they are only spprsximatians and it is doubtful that any uniforz
definition of "literate" has been followed consirtently.
(4) "Public eapenditure in education" (cols. 4 and 5) refers to all capital and recurrent expenditures devoted to education by public and quasi-public
agencies .
(5) "Enrollnest ratios" (cols. 7, 12 and 14) refer to rchool year and are the percentage sf eligible children enrolled full-time in the appropriate smobol,
public and private by level. They are often subject to a wide margin of error in the developing countries oving to variatOoss in the accuracy of basic
data (i.e., age-specific population and esrollnenta). Enrollment figures frequently are higher then the number of students actually is school. Over-aged
aradente whose inclusion i. indicated by footntes alno can inflate the ratios.

Terms of Reference
Study on Upper Secondary Education
1.       For some years the National Department of Education has been
advocating the expansion of secondary education, particularly at the upper
level, to meet the assessed needs of the country in a cost-effective
manner. Government now requests an independent study to be done on this
subject. The team of consultants would need to work in close consultation
with the Office of Higher Education and the
Education in carrying out the study. The study would require an analysis
of the current situation and specific recommendations to overnment con-
cerning areas of need highlighted in the study.
2.       Analysis
(a)  Structural.  Investigate the adequacy of the present
6-4-2 system of education (i.e., primary school - 6
years, lower secondary - 4 years; upper secondary - 2
years) in terms of providing basic and general
education as well as in preparing for higher levels.
(b) Qualitative
(i)    Identify the aims and objectives of the two
levels of secondary education (provincial and
national high schools).
(ii)   Identify the causes of any shortcomings in the
developed abilities of grades 10 and 12 leavers
in terms of limitations imposed on their poten-
tial:
a. to use their developed skills to make a
realistic and practical contribution to village
development;
b. for formal employment, and
c. for tertiary education.
(iii) Investigate the quality of grades 11 and 12
education compared to the university
preliminary year.



- 43-                     ANNEX8
Page 2
(iv)   Examine the adequacy of current standards of
entry into institutions of higher education.
(v)    Investigate the adequacy of teacher education
and the rate of localization, particularly at
the national high school level.
(c)  Quantitative.  On the basis of recent manpower and
employment information, analyze the need for grade 12
graduates in Papua New Guinea over the period 1985-95
in comparison with the number of graduates
anticipated.
(d)  Costs.  Propose cost-effective alternatives for the
provision of grades 11 and 12 education and for
eliminating the preliminary year at universities over
the medium-term.
3.       Recommendations
Make specific recommendations on the following:
(a)  The purpose or purposes of upper secondary education.
(b)  The need to expand or otherwise the output of upper
secondary graduates during the next ten years.
(c)  The way in which expansion should occur, if expansion
is recommended.
(d)  Curriculum content and standards given the identified
purpose or purposes of upper secondary education.
(e)  The need for a major development programme for upper
secondary education.
(f)  The structure of the education system.
4.       Considerations
In making the above recommendations, give due attention to:
(a)  The capacity and will of the national government to
finance such developments.
(b)  The institution of desirable economies to increase the
scope of what might be achieved.
(c)  Alternative strategies which best agree with
government aims while meeting the need for upper
secondary graduates.

Evaluation Studies
1.        During project appraisal in April 1983 the government and the Bank
agreed on a number of studies to be conducted or supervised by the Measurement
Services Unit of the DOE during project implementation. These studies are listed
below:
(a) A study of teacher attrition and inter-school transfer of teachers
to analyze rates and causes. The study would include an analysis of
current policies governing tenure, promotion and transfer. It would
also propose possible solutions (both administrative and legisla-
tive) to reduce the attrition and transfer rates. The study would
be conducted early in project implementation in view of Teachers'
Service Commission's plans to review practices in mid-1984, and
collection of baseline data for the study has been initiated;
(b) A study designed to monitor and analyze student performance on the
Grade 10 examination in relation to such variables as Grade 6
examination results, socio-economic characteristics, school agency,
school location, staff transfer rate, staff experience, and school
physical facilities;
(c) A study to show the impact of textbooks on student performance and
attitudes, and teachers' use of, and attitude toward, textbooks in
secondary classrooms;
(d) A study on the use and impact of new teachers who enter the system
with increased subject knowledge and the availability and use of
facilities such as laboratory equipment and libraries in relation to
student achievement;
(e) A related study to show the impact of new in-service training
programs for practicing secondary teachers on teacher subject
mastery and on student performance; and
(f) A study of student progression rates between Grade 8 and Grade 9,
looking particularly at the relationship between Grade 6 examination
scores and the probability of Grade 8 force-out.
