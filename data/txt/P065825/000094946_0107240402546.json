{"cdata!": "The overall outcome of the Public\n            Expenditure Support Credit Project is rated as satisfactory.\n            The lessons learned from this project include: 1) A\n            budgetary support credit with disbursements against a\n            negative list of imports was used instead of an emergency\n            import credit with disbursements against a positive lists of\n            imports, which was more typically used in similar situations\n            in other countries. This quick disbursing budgetary support\n            credit was a very effective instrument during a crisis\n            situation as it allowed the rapid transfer resources. 2)\n            This project was an effective element in coordination\n            between development and humanitarian assistance. Although\n            the budgetary support did not directly finance humanitarian\n            assistance, it provided support for public services directed\n            to the Albanian population itself. 3) The quick timing and\n            high visibility of the credit was essential in strengthening\n            partnership in Albania and building credibility for IDA. 4)\n            To expand and further strengthen the limited policy program\n            supported by the Credit, additional support from subsequent\n            operations was essential. The sustainability of the program\n            would not have been assured through a single, one-time\n            emergency intervention."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
