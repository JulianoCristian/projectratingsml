outcomes of the four projects are satisfactory; the\n            sustainability o f all credits is rated as likely; the\n            institutional development impact for all four credits is\n            rated as substantial; The performance of the International\n            Development Association (IDA) for PESC is rated highly\n            satisfactory because o f its timely, appropriate and\n            effective response to the Kosovo crisis; IDA'S\n            performance for ARC, RPTA and SAC is rated satisfactory; the\n            Borrower's performance for PESC is rated as highly\n            satisfactory because of the government's strong\n            commitment and prompt, transparent implementation; and the\n            Borrower's performance for ARC, RPTA, and SAC is rated\n            satisfactory.  The main lessons from these credits are: 1)\n            Small, focused, one-tranche policy projects with realistic\n            objectives, supported by technical assistance, may work well\n            in transition countries that are politically unstable and\n            have low market economy skills. A limited reform agenda is\n            easier to implement, especially if parliamentary approval is\n            needed for new laws when the political landscape is not\n            stable. Reform continuity can be maintained by similar\n            policy or investment follow-on projects. 2) The very quick\n            preparation and disbursement o f PESC was effective in\n            providing development assistance and coordinating\n            substantial humanitarian assistance. 3) Disbursement against\n            a negative list of imports expedited resource transfer,\n            which was appropriate in Albania's circumstances. 4)\n            Aid coordination--including the appropriate alignment o f\n            government agencies--is critical to ensure appropriate,\n            harmonized and effective assistance where many donors are\n            involved. 5) Some organizations established for special\n            purposes under IDA projects could be transformed into\n            private sector commercial entities when their mandate is\n            complete. This transition could be an integral part o f that\n            organization's strategy."}, "docdt": "2004-07-08T00:00:00Z"}
