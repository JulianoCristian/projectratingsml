        Project seeks to a) help safeguard Albania's\n            functioning public institutions during the impact of the\n            conflict in Kosovo; b) maintain macroeconomic stabilization,\n            while reducing possibilities for revenue collection; c) help\n            monitor and enforce an orderly public expenditure pattern\n            during a period of emergency; and d) establish a vehicle for\n            cofinancing and parallel financing for other donors. The\n            benefits of this project will 1) restore and maintain\n            macroeconomic stability and help to ensure availability of\n            non-inflationary financing for the extraordinary\n            expenditures necessitated by the crisis; 2) provide\n            budgetary support to allow the government to release those\n            expenditures which were frozen; and 3) protect budgetary\n            expenditures essential to achieve Albania's long term\n            development objectives. The main risk is that hostilities\n            will continue with inflow of refugees into Albania. This can\n            only be addressed through future follow-up interventions\n            supported by the international donor community. Additional\n            risks are the possibility of a deterioration in economic\n            governance and the potential loss of macroeconomic\n            stability. This risk will be mitigated by strengthening\n            public expenditure management and providing critical budget support."}, "docdt": "1999-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
