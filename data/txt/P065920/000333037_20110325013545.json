capacity of the coastal municipalities' water\n            utility, and (iii) to strengthen the regulatory and\n            institutional capacity of the Palestinian Water Authority.\n            The additional grant will finance the cost overrun\n            associated with delays in the implementation of the original\n            project activities. The delays have resulted from the\n            hostilities in Gaza and the restrictions on construction\n            materials over the last two years. The AF-3 is needed to\n            enable the completion of the original project activities and\n            achieving its objectives by sustaining the operations of the\n            Gaza water and sanitation service provision under the\n            current difficult conditions and further the consolidation\n            of the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU)."}, "docdt": "2011-03-15T11:09:00Z"}
