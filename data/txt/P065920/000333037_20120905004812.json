the Second Gaza Emergency\n            Water Project for West Bank and Gaza were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            for follow-up operations, the infrastructure investments,\n            the capacity building measures, and operational assistance\n            to Coastal Municipality Water Utility, or CMWU should be\n            designed to: (i) maintain and sustain the core functions and\n            operations of the utility, (ii) provide enabling measures to\n            improve the efficiency of the utility, and (iii) provide\n            incentives to increase collection and cost recovery, and\n            build the financial sustainability of the utility. The\n            current difficult political and security circumstances\n            prevailing in Gaza justify continuing the operational\n            assistance to the utility to maintain its services. However,\n            the utility should be encouraged to take further steps to\n            improve its financial standing, invest to improve\n            operational cost recovery, prepare a viable tariff structure\n            and liaise for its approval and implementation. CMWU is\n            currently preparing a strategic plan towards those\n            objectives. Furthermore, assistance to utility should be\n            provided based on performance and results."}, "docdt": "2012-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
