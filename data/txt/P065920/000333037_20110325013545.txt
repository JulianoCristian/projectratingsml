I.     Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional
grant in an amount of US$ 3.0 million to GZ-Gaza Emergency Water Project (P065920) from the
Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank (TFGWB).

2.      The proposed additional grant would finance the cost overrun associated with delays in
the implementation of the original project activities. The delays have resulted from the hostilities
in Gaza and the restrictions on construction materials over the last two years. The proposed AF-3
is needed to enable the completion of the original project activities and achieving its objectives
by sustaining the operations of the Gaza water and sanitation service provision under the current
difficult conditions and further the consolidation of the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility
(CMWU).


II.    Background and Rationale for Additional Financing in the amount of US$ 3.0
million

3.       The World Bank has granted the Palestinian Authority an amount of $US 20.0 million to
finance the Gaza Emergency Water Project (GEWP). The Trust Fund Grant agreement was
signed on July 10, 2005 and the project became effective on July 25, 2005. The project
objectives are: (i) to improve the efficiency, management, operation, and delivery of water and
wastewater services in Gaza, (ii) to build capacity of the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility,
(iii) and to strengthen the regulatory and institutional capacity of the Palestinian Water Utility.

4.      The Gaza water utility in tandem with the Palestinian Water Authority leads the PA’s
emergency response in the water and sanitation sector. Over the past 5 years, the CMWU forged
a partnership with the Bank and other donors who have been financing the emergency and
development of water and sanitation in Gaza. The Bank continued support proved instrumental
to continue leveraging considerable funds from other donors to sustain the urgent and long -term
needs of the Gaza population for water and sanitation.

5.       A first additional financing was granted to the project in the amount of $US 5.0 million to
cover the cost overruns that happened to the project in 2007 and 2008 due to closure of Gaza and
the substantial increase in the costs of different inputs to the project. A second additional
financing was granted to the project in the amount of $US 3.0 million after the escalation of
conflict in Gaza of December 2008-January 2009. The second additional financing was approved
by the board in May 2009 to cover part of the costs for the repair, rehabilitation, and the
reconstruction of the water and sanitation facilities that were severely damaged during the
hostilities.

6.      Despite the difficult circumstances, implementation of the GEWP and its two additional
financings has been progressing. Since effectiveness, both implementation progress and
achievement of development objective ratings have been rated satisfactory to moderately
satisfactory. In terms of results, the first additional financing enabled CMWU to maintain the


                                                 6
operation of the main water wells, wastewater pumping stations, and treatment facilities during
the December 2008-January 2009 hostilities, providing key supplies, fuel, spare parts, and
emergency maintenance, and maintaining its leading role of managing the risks of the dangerous
Beit Lahia wastewater lagoons. After hostilities ceased, the second additional financing of the
amount of US$ 3 million enabled the CMWU to play a leading role in the reconstruction of the
damaged networks, rehabilitate the water wells and waste water facilities that have been severely
damaged during the course of hostilities. Due to restrictions on materials and access to project
sites and movement of personnel, the implementation of the project activities have been slowed
down and both the first and second additional financings closing dates were extended to June 30,
2011.

7.       In terms of reform and restructuring, the CMWU managed to become the service
provider in a significant number of Gaza municipalities, provide support to municipalities who
have not joined the utility yet, leverage and manage a significant amount of funds from different
donors supporting the sector, and implement an ambitious agenda of its institution building. The
utility has managed to issue the utility unified water bill in Rafah Governorate in December 2009
and in Khanyounis in November 2010, and increased the collection efficiency in Rafah
significantly. CMWU finalized and approved its organizational structure, furnished regional
offices, modernized its management and information systems.

8.      The political unrest in Gaza and the damages that occurred to the water and sanitation
sector during the hostilities of December 2008-January 2009 and the continuing closure have
delayed the achievement of some institutional objectives, and shifted the focus of CMWU
agenda to more of short-term rehabilitation. The deteriorating economic situation and poor
governance and law enforcement in Gaza delayed the achievement of CMWU targets on
collection and led to commercial losses in the distribution system.

9.      The Israeli government has announced in July 2010 some easing measures on materials
entry, especially for humanitarian projects. The implementation of water projects–including the
Bank’s- has witnessed some improvements. In August 2010, the PA has requested a third
additional financing to GEWP project to finance the operating costs of the water utility (CMWU)
and to support the consolidation of the utility functions, and to maintain and improve the service
provision of water and sanitation for the year 2011.


III.   Proposed Changes

10.     The project ’s development objective will remain unchanged. The AF-3 will allocate
funds to maintain the service provision of water and wastewater in Gaza and improve the
efficiency, management, operation, and delivery of services. It will also provide assistance to
consolidate the Coastal Municipalities Water utility and build its capacity. No funds are allocated
in AF-3 for capacity building of the Palestinian Water Authority. The Bank has prepared a new
full-fledged operation for the capacity building of PWA through a Technical and Policy
Advisory Team (TPAT).




                                                7
11.     The CMWU prepared a draft budget outlining the most effective use of the US$ 3 million
for the GEWP third additional financing. The proposed allocations are based on the key
emergency needs with an emphasis on ensuring that key water and wastewater services provision
are not interrupted. A US$1.35 million are allocated to operating cost to finance the electricity,
telecommunications, and other utility bills, utility vehicles and equipment maintenance,
insurance costs, fuel cost supplied to run water wells, pumping stations, and wastewater
treatment facilities, rental expenses of regional offices, in addition to the operation and PMU
staff costs. Worthy to note that after the management contract of the international operator came
to an end in 2008 due to restrictions on international staff to operate in Gaza, the management
and operation of all water and wastewater facilities were transferred to local staff contracted by
the CMWU. This explains the major allocation from the proceeds of the proposed AF-3 grant for
operational cost of CMWU.


12.     For works and goods, it is estimated that US$ 1.55 million will finance contracts for
rehabilitation and maintenance of the water and sanitation networks, pumping station, treatment
plants, water wells rehabilitation, repairing and replacing water meters, and other running
expenses. It will also finance the procurement of chlorine for water disinfection, and
electromechanical spare parts for the maintenance of the water and sanitation facilities, in
addition to hardware and software for integrating the utility IT systems.

13.     Consultancy cost, estimated at US$ 100,000 is to finance the training needs of CMWU
staff, design costs of water and sanitation projects, development, maintenance, and integration of
CMWU Geographical Information System (GIS), Management Information System (MIS), New
Integrated Financial Management System (NIFMS), and Customer Service Information S ystem
(CSIS).

14.     Table (1) below sets forth the disbursement categories and allocations to be financed out
of the proceeds of this grant. The details and cost breakdown of different categories are shown in
Table (1.1) in Annex (1) for the parent project and its additional financing.

15.    Disbursement of the third additional financing is expected to take place according to the
table below. While CMWU will start expenditures of the operating costs in the third quarter of
FY11, retroactive payments from the grant proceeds will start after effectiveness which is
expected in the last quarter of FY11. To expedite the procurement process, the CMWU will start
the procurement process in the first quarter of FY11, and start contracting for works, goods, and
consultant services immediately after the project effectiveness.

IV.      Consistency with CAS


16.      While no formal country assistance strategy exists for WB&G, the Executive Directors in
April 2008 approved an interim strategy for the West Bank and Gaza for 2008-2010, and a new
strategy for 2011-2013 is being prepared. One of the main pillars in the strategy is supporting
infrastructure development. This pillar of the Interim Strategy is aligned with a major theme of
the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) on infrastructure development with a
focus on water and wastewater management. The infrastructure pillar of the West Bank and Gaza
Interim Strategy 2008-2010, envisaged a program with an objective to help Palestinian
institutions overseeing water and sanitation sector enhance capacity and awareness at all levels
for sustainable water service provision to meet domestic, industrial, and agricultural demands.
The program also envisioned support for mitigating the sharp deterioration of the quality of the
Gaza Aquifer.

V. Economic Analysis of Cost Overrun

17.      The grant allocation of the proposed project will enable the CMWU to:

      a) Manage and operate the emergency sanitation situation in North Gaza until the Bank -
         financed project for the treatment plant is commissioned and the central Gaza treatment
         plant is expanded and rehabilitated through a KFW finance.

      b) Finance the management arrangements of the CMWU after the end of the management
         contract and during the year of 2011.

      c) Support the CMWU to pay the rental cost and furnishing the regional offices for an extra
         year, after expanding the municipalities under the umbrella of CMWU.

                                                 9
      d) Further the establishment of the utility management systems and unified billing.

      e) Finance the expanding needs for rehabilitation and expanding networks in new areas,
         water meters to new customers, rehabilitating new wells due to the increased demand,
         and to meet the expanding demand for chemicals for disinfection, and fuel to meet the
         challenges resulting from the electricity crisis in Gaza.

      f) Equipment and facilities increased demand for maintenance due to power outages.

18.     The economic benefits are significant, notably by supporting the CMWU to sustain basic
water and sanitation services to a very large urban population currently living under challenging
security and political conditions. Most of beneficiaries cannot afford additional medical expenses
if supply of clean water and basic sanitation services are interrupted. This additional financing
therefore will maintain the welfare of Gaza residents; aside from enabling the newly established
water utility achieve a sound financial and institutional footing.

19.      The additional financing will generate financial benefits to the water and wastewater
sector in Gaza both directly and indirectly. Increased capacity of CMWU will help improve the
utility’s financial performance by improved revenue collection ratio while the availability of this
additional financing will enable CMWU to ensure appropriate levels of maintenance of the water
supply and sewerage networks.

Table (2.1) in annex (2) illustrates the allocation of funds among project components and
activities with the associated cost overrun and reasons for cost increments.

VI.      Expected Outcomes

20.     The expected outcomes of the project remain unchanged as in the original project. The
outcome indicators and their target values remain as in the original project with the
subsequently-introduced modifications in the first additional financing. Some of the target values
have been already achieved while the other targets are expected to be achieved by the closing
date of the project. Table (3.1) in Annex (3) shows the outcome indicators, the target values in
the original project, the values achieved by end of 2010, and by the closing date January 31,
2012.

VII.     Benefits and Risks


21.     Benefits: As mentioned earlier, the financial and economic benefits are significant. The
functions of CMWU will be strengthened, the financial management of CMWU will be
improved, and supply of adequate water and wastewater services to around 1.5 million residents
will be maintained. The project will improve (a) the efficiency of the distribution system through
rehabilitation and improved management (b) operational efficiency through higher revenue
generation and cost recovery (c) drinking water quality and reliability of water supply and
sanitation services (d) planning, design, procurement, and implementation of projects through
CMWU. In addition, the project will have social benefits by improving the utility performance


                                                 10
for service delivery to beneficiary households, thus contributing to enhanced customer
satisfaction and quality of life.

22.     Risks: First and foremost, the country risk remains high. However, the GEWP project
was designed to operate in highly volatile environments and over the past 5 years has been
remarkably important in the midst of crisis situations. On the project side, the main risks remain
the restrictions on access of materials imposed on Gaza. Restrictions on water and sanitation
(and other humanitarian projects) have been eased lately. The Bank has also forged a good
working relation with the Office of Quartet Representative (OQR) and the Israeli coordinator for
Government activities in the Territories (COGAT) to facilitate and monitor the entry of
materials. The second important risk pertains to the fragmentation of the water sector and the
poor governance in light of the political split between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority (PA),
which is adversely affecting the sector reform agenda and the consolidation of municipal water
and sanitation departments within CMWU. Detailed project risks and ratings are shown in table
(4.1) in Annex (4)


VIII. Fiduciary Arrangements for the Third Additional Financing

23.    The same fiduciary arrangements of the original project and its two additional financing
(AF1 and AF2) will remain during the implementation of the third additional financing (AF3).
    a)    The project does not trigger any safeguards policies except OP/BP 4.01 on
          environmental assessment. The same environmental category “B” of the project
          remains valid and the CMWU will continue implementing the project according to
          the environmental management plan of the project which has been updated and
          disclosed both on CMWU website and at the Bank Infoshop in January 2011. The
          project has an overall positive impact by facilitating better management of the water
          and sanitation services and water and wastewater facilities. Any short-term negative
          environmental impacts during the implementation of the project and operation of the
          water and wastewater facilities will be mitigated by implementing the EMP. CMWU
          is retaining an environmental specialist as part of their core staff to supervise and
          monitor the implementation of the environmental management plan.

   b)      The procurement implementation arrangements of the original project and which are
           currently in place for its two additional financing, AF1 and AF2 will apply to AF3.
           The responsibility for overall oversight and monitoring on the implementation of
           project procurement will rest with the CMWU, which would ensure that project
           procurement is carried out in accordance with the grant agreement and the
           procurement plan. CMWU prepared a procurement plan for Goods, Works and
           consultants services to be financed out of the AF3 proceeds showing the different
           procurement and consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior review
           requirements, and time frame, The procurement plan has been be reviewed and
           approved by the Bank and included in Annex (5).

   c)      The Financial Management arrangement for this AF3 will build on the existing
           Financial Management System currently existing for both AF1 and AF2. The
           financial management rating of the first and second additional financing has been
                                               11
rated satisfactory and the PMU staff has good experience with the Bank FM
guidelines. The audit report for the project for the year ending December 31, 2009
was received within the due date. The auditors issued an unqualified opinion on the
report and the report was considered acceptable to the Bank. The CMWU will be
responsible for the financial management, financial reporting, and external audit of
the Project financial statements.
