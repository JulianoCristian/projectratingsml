                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite the difficult political and security conditions in Gaza, the project has been making progress on both fronts of maintaining service provision and institutional development of the
                         utility. The utility has successfully improved and maintained some of the target indicators on service provision, e.g., average hours of access to water supply, disinfection of water
                         supply. Improvements on collection rates have not shown much progress due to prevailing poverty, unemployment, political division and lack of enforcement. The same political

                         financing (US$ 5 million) and the second additional financing (US$ 3 million) have closed on June 30, 2011. The third additional financing (US$ 3 million) was approved by the board
                         on April 12, 2011, declared effective on June 13, 2011. Delays have been encountered in the implementation of the third additional financing and an extension to the closing date until
                         June 2012 is expected.
