Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The overall objective of the first phase of the Mali Education Sector Expenditure Program
(ESEP) was to provide increased and equitable access to better quality education. Specific goals
were to: (a) increase gross primary enrollment; (b) improve the quality of teaching and learning;
and (c) improve decentralized management of the education sector.

               Adequate instruments for measuring this indicator were not developed. 80% target is
Comments       too ambitious, and was intended for the end of APL in 2010 (see Annex 1) and not
               for the end of Phase 1. A proxy measure is given above for information.

                 1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Two important factors influenced the objectives and design of the Education Sector Expenditure
Program (ESEP). The first is the significant economic growth resulting from Mali's increased
competitiveness following the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA Franc in 1994. Real GDP
grew at an average rate of 4.8 percent from 1994 to 1997, compared to 2.3 percent between 1990
and 1993. The second factor was that, despite the series of projects in the 1990s, the majority of
the labor force remained illiterate and under-qualified to support sustainable economic growth.
A comprehensive sector analysis conducted by Government described an education system with
limited capacity and low performance, characterized by: (i) a gross enrollment rate in 1999-2000
of 56 percent for primary education and 8.6 percent for secondary; (ii) a low quality education
system unsuitable for the country's socio-economic and cultural needs; and (iii) weak capacity
for institutional system management. This analysis led to the conclusion that Mali's future
ability to respond to competitive market conditions would, to a large extent, be determined by its
ability to supply a well-trained and healthy labor force.

As a result, Government decided to undertake an ambitious reform of the education system.
After a broad consultative process, Government put together a Ten-Year Education Sector
Program (PRODEC: 2000-2010) with an expenditure program (ESEP) divided into 3 phases.
The first phase (ESEP I) is financed by the Government, municipalities and about fifteen donors,
including IDA, which provided support in the form of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL).

The planned reforms under the ESEP included some of the most politically sensitive and
challenging ones, including:          (a) the introduction of contractual teachers, to support the
expansion of access without the commensurate increase in the wage bill; (b) the elimination of
secondary scholarships, to allow reallocation of those funds for qualitative inputs; (c) the
decentralization to local government authorities of primary teacher recruitment, to help stabilize
the teaching force; (d) the significant increase in weekly teaching hours in middle schools, to
improve productivity, and (e) the merger of the two ministries, to enable the execution of the
program activities in a more coordinated manner.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The overall objective of the first phase of the Mali Education Sector Expenditure Program
(ESEP) is to provide increased and equitable access to better quality education. Specific goals
are to improve: (a) gross primary enrollment; (b) the quality of teaching and learning; and (c)
decentralized management of the education sector.

The key indicators in the PAD to assess the achievement of the PDO for Phase I are:
                                            Quality of education
(i)   A textbook ratio of two books per primary and four per middle school student would be reached;
(ii)  Primary repetition would drop from 22% in 1999-00 to 13% in 2003-04; dropout rate would decrease from 8
      to 5%. Repetition in middle school would decrease from 20 to 10%, and in secondary, from 25 to 13%;
(iii) Budget for secondary scholarships amounting to CFAF 2.4 billion in 2000 would be reallocated entirely to
      quality-enhancing inputs by 2004;



                                                       1

(iv)   80% of children would read at an acceptable level of fluency by the end of Grade 2 (N.B. the PAD Annex 1
       sets this as target for 2010, but it is also unrealistically set as 2004 target - PAD, page 3).
                                                    Access of education
(v)    Primary gross enrollment rate would reach 70% by the 2003-04 school year from about 56% in the 1999-
      2000 school year; that of girls would increase from 46% to 58%;
(vi)   Class size in primary schools would decrease from 56 to 53 students per class;
(vii) At least 32% of secondary students would be enrolled in vocational education;
(viii) Community school teachers would receive a monthly stipend of 25,000 CFAF from Government.
                                               Decentralized management
(ix)   Weekly hours taught by middle school teachers would increase from 15 to 18 by 2003-04;
(x)    Education's share of the total budget would increase to 27%, with basic education increasing from 55.9% in
       2000 to 59% in 2004; secondary would decrease from 28.2% in 2000 to 26.5% by 2004 while higher
       education would drop from 15.9% in 2000 to 14.5% by 2004. Teacher training would remain at 1%;
(xi)  Decentralized development plans would be prepared and implemented in at least 7 of the 9 regions for the
       2003-04 school year;
(xii) The portion of the Ministry's non-salary budget administered by the deconcentrated Académies would
      increase to 40% by the year 2004.


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The original objective and key indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Program initiatives targeted a range of beneficiaries: pre-school children ages five and under,
school-age children, teachers, urban and rural adults (women in particular) between 15 and 49
years of age, administrative personnel of the Ministry of Education at central, regional and local
levels, parents, and local governments and communities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Phase 1 of ESEP had three main components, each of which had sub-components that covered
all levels of Mali's education system, from pre-school to university. Detailed sub-components
are provided in Annex 2.

Component 1: Improving the quality of teaching and learning (US$149.00 million, of which
IDA financed US$16.4 million)
The objective of this component was to improve the quality of teaching and learning by focusing
on the basic educational needs of the individual learner, and by: (i) improving student learning,
particularly for girls; and (ii) aligning children's education with the needs of their community and
nation as a whole, strengthening the links between community and school.

Component 2: Improving Access to Schooling (US$189.00 million, of which IDA financed
US$19.5 million)
The objective of this component was to rapidly increase coverage and equity, particularly at the
primary school level.

Component 3:             Strengthening education system capacity for decentralization and policy
monitoring (US$202.2 million, of which IDA financed US$1.9 million)




                                                               2

The objective of this component was to modernize and strengthen management of the education
sector. It aimed to strengthen the capacity of the MoE to implement its policies and to improve
the overall service delivery capacity, particularly at the school level. A particular focus was
placed on policy monitoring and impact evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components

None of the components was revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

The Project was amended in September 2004 to allow: (a) an extension of the Credit Closing
Date to December 31, 2005 to enable the Government to complete planned activities and achieve
the Project Development Objectives; (b) the addition of a category for grants to eligible schools
to finance school supplies; and (c) changes of the prior review thresholds for procurement of
civil works and goods.


                2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

A broad-based participatory process was carried out under Government leadership.
Although it was lengthy (lasting more than two years), the process created important
Government and stakeholder ownership of the PRODEC. The same participative method was
used in the preparation of ESEP I. All key stakeholders, including teachers and other education
professionals, parents, members of civil society, as well as technical and financial partners
(donors) participated in program preparation, leading to a consensual analysis of the issues
underlying the education sector. The Government created a multi-disciplinary group of high-
level staff who took the lead during the preparation, thus demonstrating its commitment and
political will.

Lessons Learned at Project Design. The ESEP I benefited from key lessons learned in previous
projects in Mali such as the Education Sector Consolidation Project, the Education Sector
Adjustment Credit, the Improving Learning in Primary Schools Project (LIL), as well as from
experiences in other African countries. The main lessons drawn from the ICRs of these projects,
and other sources include: (i) up-front and sustained participation of all major stakeholders in
the design of reforms; (ii) the presence of a comprehensive and coherent Government sector
strategy as the basis for all donor intervention; (iii) the need to focus on the school level as the
locus of change for improving teaching and learning through empowering teachers and school
directors; (iv) the importance of shifting from a centrally-managed teaching force to a locally
managed one; (v) the adaptation of the project instrument to the specific circumstances of the
country and sector; and (vi) the value of national languages for children to acquire basic literacy
and comprehension skills more easily, and to facilitate second-language acquisition. It also can
help forge strong links between the community and the school. These key lessons are reflected in
the preparation and the design of the Program. As a result, the design was spared a number of
political difficulties inherent in education reform, various actors became involved in the design
process, and the focus on the school and its direct actors (school heads, teachers, parents) to
improve learning achievements is clearly stated.


                                                  3

Assessment of program design

The ten-year sector program provided a sector-wide vision, which was in turn
operationalized in the expenditure program (ESEP), divided into three phases. The ESEP
captured the main strengths and weaknesses of the entire education sector, from pre-school to
university, within a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) integrating operational and
investment budgets, creating the conditions for identifying a range of needs, clarifying donor
support, and monitoring implementation in a coherent manner.

The first phase of the ESEP (ESEP I: 2001-2004) was ambitious and complex. The overall
program was sound, as it gives a global view of sectoral needs. However, the first phase
seriously underestimated institutional capacity requirements, and included numerous pilot
projects without having sufficiently taken into account their institutional feasibility. This is true
of the following pilots, most of which came from donor and not Government initiatives:
Reading First; the contracting of adult literacy management to private service providers; life
skills/reproductive health courses; curriculum reform; and the establishment of a competitive
research fund. The quality component alone had 20 sub-components composed of numerous
innovations and reforms to be undertaken during the first phase. Beyond the number, sub-
components were often too complex.

ESEP addressed the needs of children out of school, of girls and of rural populations.
Important gains were registered for these important target groups. However, ESEP did not
take into account the needs of specific groups, such as nomads. As a result, the level of
education for this group remains low, and progress in areas such as Kidal, Gao, Timbuktu and
Mopti is very slow.

The Program preparation was long (16 months from concept to appraisal) but well
justified upon further reflection.      The complexity of the program, the need to reach a
consensus with all key stakeholders around these reforms, and the political implications of some
of the reforms (such as the merging of the two ministries) were at the origin of these delays. The
two ministers disagreed on reforms process since the Minister of Secondary and Tertiary
Education (MESSRS) became involved in the program preparation process only in 1999 after
certain orientations had already been decided upon. The extra time spent was worthwhile, as the
merging of the ministries created more institutional coherence, and the reforms agreed upon
consensually were more likely to be sustained.

Assessment of risks.

Not all main risks were identified, and not all mitigation measures implemented led to the
achievement of the expected objectives. Eleven risks were identified, including two high and
three substantial risks. The most important risks referred to institutional arrangements (fiduciary
aspects), to the lack of MEN's institutional capacities, and to misunderstandings over policy
reforms.   Changes in the contracting of teachers and reform of the scholarship policy at
secondary and tertiary education were also identified as controversial areas. However, there was
insufficient focus on the risk related to the resistance of the university to reform and the



                                                4

weakness of the Directorate in charge of this subcomponent, which had never been able to
initiate a constructive dialogue with the stakeholders. Therefore, the majority of the activities
foreseen in tertiary education were not carried out. In addition, the implementation of mitigation
measures for two other risks did not lead to the achievement of the objectives within the time
limits: (i) the gap between the MEN capacities and the program requirements, and (ii) the
institutional and behavioral constraints in the system for improving internal efficiency. Although
the mitigation measures were implemented, the identified risks impacted the achievement of the
objectives.

2.2 Implementation

Program coordination benefited from a functional coordination mechanism among donors
and between donor group and Government at the central level. The partnership framework
made official by the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding by the majority of donors
(15) in July 2001 has maintained a sector dynamic that translated into more coherent support to
the Government (financing, concerted technical assistance), into common actions (joint field
visits, joint missions) and into a division of leadership by partners on some of the components.
Regular meetings involving all program stakeholders (Government, civil society and donors)
have facilitated this exchange of information important to the concerted implementation of
activities. The coordination facilitated also the organization of thematic groups to support
program implementation. This helped limit risks linked to problems that could have surfaced
due to lack of coordination and harmonization of donor procedures.

Readiness of the implementation arrangements. Important actions were undertaken to ensure
the readiness of the ME at program effectiveness, including the merger of the two ministries in
2000, and the assignment of qualified staff to the key directions (DAF, CPS). Short- and long-
term solutions, derived from the results of institutional analysis, were defined to launch program
implementation. Capacity development plans were formulated for key implementation and
management structures. The construction sub-component was delegated to a private enterprise.
In the short term, the CT (Cellule Technique- Technical Unit), which led the preparatory phase,
began program implementation during a transitional phase. Human resources and management
tools of ongoing education projects (VET and LIL) were transferred to the DAF, which was the
key structure to manage fiduciary aspects.

Despite institutional preparation, many sub-components started with delays, and many of
them did not start before the mid-term review (see section below).                    Some of the
responsibilities were new and remained poorly defined for local actors.           The decisions to
strengthen key structures were made in 2001, at the same time as the execution of activities and
reforms was to start. The time needed for the stabilization of the institution after the merging of
two ministries and the reorganization of the main directorates was under-estimated.

At the MTR in January 2004, the main causes of the weak implementation performance
were identified: The MTR, which had to be delayed due to the slow start of project activities,
raised important issues. These included the complexity of the program, the size of some sub-
components, the large number of sub-components, the numerous innovations and reforms to be
undertaken during the first phase, and lastly, unrealistic expectations in terms of human and



                                                  5

financial resources at the MoE. Ten months before the official Closing Date of the program,
only one-third of the activities of the quality component had been carried out, one-third were
underway, and one-third had not yet begun.             The MTR recommended the following:
identification of priority activities compatible with existing capacities, merging of some sub-
components, development of a clearer and more user-friendly logical framework, reallocation of
funds, and extension of the Closing Date to December 2006. Overall, project performance after
the MTR confirmed the relevance of the decisions that were taken. It is worth noting, however,
that the MTR did not review and revise the triggers, despite the fact that they lacked clarity, were
not aligned with the program objectives, and had evaluation criteria that were not coherent.

Government decision-making led to delays in effectiveness. Effectiveness was deferred twice,
mainly due to delays in payment of the counterpart funds. This was a common problem for the
Mali portfolio at the time, however, and was not limited to this sector.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design

The M&E system put in place was incomplete, and some indicators were inadequate. The
main structures (CPS, DAF, CNE) and their roles were clearly defined. For each component and
sub-component, the PAD clearly specified indicators for outputs and outcomes. However, ESEP
I lacked a comprehensive M&E framework accepted by all stockholders, which compromised
the clarity of the M&E system under this sector-wide program. The M&E system suffered from
an absence of a precise list of tools and reporting arrangements, including the frequency and
methods for gathering data, and specific responsibilities for reporting. Furthermore, five types of
limitations characterized the indicators: (i) too many indicators were defined (12 to measure the
DO progress alone). (ii) They missed the "completion rate", a key indicator for IDA14 and for
MDGs, widely used to measure access to education. (iii) Although the "girls' gross enrollment"
tracks their progress, it does not focus enough on the reduction of the gap between boys' and
girls' access, which remains the main issue. (iv) The indicator for increasing education
expenditures as a share of total expenditures, while important, is only one measure of the
expenditures allocated to the sector. Setting 27 percent as a target is not very instructive, as it
does not necessarily reflect a situation qualitatively different from that at 24 percent; and (v) the
triggers for moving to the next phase were inadequate, as mentioned above.

M&E implementation

The M&E system did not produce the information necessary for piloting the education
system in a timely manner. During the MTR, it was noted that the data needed to measure
progress on the physical and financial realizations was not available. It was not possible to report
on the totality of funds mobilized (internal and external) and to reconcile financial resources
expenditures and physical progress due to the quality of data that was produced. Furthermore, the
monitoring of learning achievements, which is crucial for quality improvements, was not
sufficiently implemented. However, substantial progress was noted in M&E after the MTR. The
subsequent introduction of the EMIS for primary education helped improve the
operationalization of the M&E system. This led to the retroactive production of statistical



                                                  6

yearbooks for 2001 to 2004, and to the timely production of those from 2004 to 2006. Moreover,
specific studies relating to the training of the teachers, the distribution of textbooks, the disparity
in access to education, the evaluation of the primary school curriculum, the evaluation of
learning achievements (see section 2.2) were carried out. Some studies such as the pre-service
training assessment, led to revisions in key strategies. Periodic independent assessments of
program implementation were undertaken, complementing annual reports produced by the MEN.

M&E utilization

In spite of the limitations in the quality and timeliness of data, especially at the beginning of the
program, these data are now used by the various stakeholders. The regular production of
statistical yearbooks by the EMIS constitutes the main source of information for school mapping,
and facilitates the resource planning process. The recommendations resulting from the reports
and the various studies are validated by the annual joint review, which uses them to adjust the
orientations of the Program.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

ESEP was a category C project, and there were no safeguard issues. In the area of financial
management and procurement, it was necessary to provide initial capacity building to the DAF.
External financial audits were completed on time and were satisfactory to IDA during the years
2001-2006.

In October 2004, an amount totaling 1 568 184 975 CFAF (about US$2,090,913) was transferred
to the AGETIPE account housed at a Malian commercial bank for primary school construction.
The MoE cancelled this contract, but the commercial bank that received the transfer was going
bankrupt and could not proceed with the reimbursement of the unspent funds. , The Malian
Government reimbursed the funds for the AGETIPE and the total amount was transferred back to
the project account.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The second phase of the Program (ESEP II) was designed, appraised and negotiated before the
end of ESEP I.       It built on the continuity of objectives, institutional arrangements and
management systems set up during the first phase, which allowed for a smooth transition. ESEP
II evolved further at this stage, shifting the loan instrument from an APL to a SIL for the
following reasons: (i) the earlier framework was too rigid given the changes in the environment
and the program proposed by the Government; (ii) some monitoring indicators and baseline
values needed to be changed and improved with the results of the Education Country Status
Report (CSR); (iii) some of the triggers, in particular those with respect to decentralized
management, were too vaguely defined; and (iv) as recommended in the CAS, a PRSC may well
replace the third phase initially envisioned under the APL.

The new project incorporated lessons from the first phase and benefited from improved
implementation and monitoring mechanisms. The ESEP II is much simpler (focusing on basic
education and institutional strengthening) and has more direct poverty targeting. It is also much
more decentralized, financing municipalities for construction through ANICT.               Substantial


                                                   7

progress was made in the financial management system with the introduction of quarterly
Financial Monitoring Reports. The M&E system was strengthened by the simplification of the
logical framework and the EMIS set-up. System coordination and piloting are in place, and
training was conducted to enable actors to play their roles in reforming various components.
Moreover, the commitment of Government and of local stakeholders in program implementation,
which is anchored in national institutions as well as capacity building efforts, is a basis for the
sustainability of ESEP's achievement and reforms. The Government is launching major reforms,
including: i) the financing of community school teachers; (ii) decentralization of primary
education to municipalities; (iii) provision of school grants for quality inputs; and (iv) increased
funding to basic education. IDA helped mobilize funds and encouraged several other donors to
support the program.



                                  3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance is rated substantial based on the following. The Program is relevant to the CAS and
to the country's current development priorities, which consist of poverty alleviation supported by
qualified human resources to maintain the growth of the Malian economy. ESEP supports the
objective of the CAS, one of the pillars of which aims to develop a quality basic education
accessible to all as the building block of qualified human resources. Moreover, the project
included reforms key to ensuring the financial sustainability of the expansion of basic education
(teaching hours, secondary scholarships) and the quality of education (decentralization,
community involvement). By covering the entire sector, the project created the conditions for a
cohesive development of the education system. In supporting key reforms such as the adaptation
of curriculum to local realities, the introduction of national languages in teaching, and
decentralized management, ESEP helped bring schools closer to communities and to the needs of
the economy.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The overall program objective for ESEP I is rated moderately satisfactory. This rating is
based on the performance under the three components of program.

* A few indicators were added to respond to IDA14 and MDG reporting requirements, and to inform policy.

As shown in the table above:
Access increased beyond expectations: The primary gross enrollment rate (GER) increased
from 56.6 percent in 1999-2000 to 72 percent in 2004-2005, and 75 percent in 2005-2006, versus
an expected rate of 70 percent in 2004. Mali experienced 8.5 percent growth in primary
education enrollment, 14.4 percent in lower secondary, 8 percent in upper secondary education,
and 21 percent in higher education.

The objectives for girls' GER were also reached and even surpassed. Girls' GER was 65.1
percent compared to the 56 percent anticipated at the end of the project, exceeding expected
outcomes by 9 points.

                   GER by sex                                  2002-03   2003-04    2004-05      2005-06
                                            Boys (B)             77.9       81.3      85.0          85.1
                                            Girls (G)            56.4       59.9      63.4          65.1
                 National                      Total             67.0       70.5      74.0          75.0
                                       Gender Gap (B-G)          21.5       21.4      21.6          20.0

Despite the increase in girls' GER, the gap between boys and girls stagnated around 20 points
throughout the first phase. The fact that the national policy to accelerate girls' education was not
completed on time influenced this outcome.

Expanded access was accompanied by a substantial improvement in the completion rate,
which increased from 32 percent in 1999-2000 to 48 percent in 2005-2006. As envisaged, more
and more students who completed lower secondary were oriented to VET.

About 40 percent of graduates of lower secondary in 2006 were oriented to VET, thus
exceeding the target of 32 percent. To support VET development, eight VET establishments,
of which four were Female Training Centers (4 CAFE, Centres d'Apprentissage Féminins) and 4
IFP were built; and at least two establishments (20 classrooms and workshops) were renovated.




                                                                 9

The increase in primary school access was due to the rapid growth in the grade one intake rate.
Indeed, the number admitted into grade 1 more than doubled between 2001/2002 and 2005/2006,
going from 190,820 to 300,611, at an average annual growth of 12.2 percent. This expansion is
mainly linked to three factors: increased classroom construction; recruitment of teachers, and in
particular contractual teachers; and community initiatives in schooling. However, the GER
increase was slightly influenced by the repetition rate, which remained high (see Annex 10).

The objective set for classroom construction was achieved and even exceeded. For a target
of 6,000 classrooms, 6,336 were built in total, including 1,953 by ANICT and 489 by the
Ministry for Social Development. IDA financed the construction of 1,230 classrooms compared
to the planned 1,400 and rehabilitated 105; the decrease in the number of classrooms constructed
is due to low unit cost estimates used at appraisal. The construction of classrooms by other
partners more than compensated for this decrease. It should be noted that a non-negligible
number of classrooms were built by NGOs and associations that eluded the monitoring and
evaluation system in place.

The student:teacher ratio was reduced from 56 to 53, as planned. During ESEP 1, 17,343
teachers were recruited, of whom 6,343 were for community schools. However, this alone does
not explain the difference between the number of recruited teachers, the new students (110,000)
and that of classrooms built. Several factors can justify this variation (teachers' retirement,
reduction of multigrade and double-shift classes, etc). A full analysis could not be carried out
because of the lack of data. Nevertheless, this situation may reflect weak human resources
management.

An increasing number of community school teachers are receiving 25,000 CFAF per month
from the Government. In 2005, 6,348 community school teachers (about 84 percent) of a total
of 7,532 received this financial support. The growth in student numbers was more than three
times higher in the community schools and medersa than in public schools. From 2001 to 2006,
the number of students from schools supported by community initiatives increased on average by
14 percent, whereas it grew by only 4.6 percent in public schools over the same period.
Government financially supported community schools in order to reduce schooling costs and
promote equitable access.

In 2005, 24.4 percent of the budget was allocated to the sector, against a target of 27
percent, within which the share for basic education reached 63 percent against an initial
objective of 61 percent. Although the target of 27 percent was not reached, given the limitations
of this indicator (as noted above), the fact that the target was not achieved is of little importance.

Component of education quality improvement: this component is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

      * This is an incomplete indicator, based on a 2005 UNESCO study in 3 regions
       ** PAD Annex 1 sets this as target for 2010, but PAD page 3 also sets it as target for Phase 1 in 2004. Given lack of data
              or measurement instrument, the ICR is determining that this is not a Phase 1 target.

As shown in the table above:

The objective of the entire three-phase ESEP was that 80 percent of students would read
fluently at the end of Grade 2. The PAD introduces some confusion about this target.
Although Annex 1 (the logical framework) clearly states that this is a goal for the end of the
program (in 2010), the list of key performance indicators in the PAD (page 3) also includes this
target for 2004. This is exacerbated by the fact that the M&E system could not provide data for
this indicator; however, another survey provides some information. Test results from a study
conducted by UNESCO in three Regions in 2005 measuring an "acceptable minimum level of
proficiency" in language and mathematics recorded on average 51.5 (on a scale 0-100) for
languages and 48.5 for math in second grade; and 43.1 in French and 42.5 in mathematics in 5th
grade. These findings are similar to previous evaluations done in 2003.

Although the dropout rate in primary decreased, the targets for reducing repetition in
primary and secondary were not reached, and in some cases, even increased. The dropout
rate decreased from 8 to 4.6 percent in primary schools, but the target to reduce repetition rates
was not achieved. In primary school, the repetition rate showed important improvements, going
from 23 percent at the beginning of the project to 18.6 percent at the end, but did not reach the
projected target of 13 percent. For middle school and secondary, this rate actually was higher
than the baseline values, rising to 24 percent compared to the target of 10 percent in middle
schools, and to 29 percent against a target of 13 percent in secondary. More pronounced for girls
than boys (17.3% for primary schools girls in 2006), repetition remained high in part due to the
fact the Girls' Education Division that was responsible for driving the activities to reduce
repetition was not active during a large part of the first phase.                             Therefore, the internal
efficiency improvement objectives were not satisfactorily reached.

The implementation of the subcomponents related to quality was delayed, in turn having
an impact on the expected results. The program aimed at improving education quality (i.e.
learning achievements, internal efficiency): textbooks ratio improvement, reading first program,
teacher training, and curriculum reform. For example, the "reading first" subcomponent is only


                                                            11

now ready to be implemented. The learning materials subcomponent as well as the pre-service
teacher training showed considerable improvements between 2005 and 2006. The textbook:pupil
ratio increased from 1.4 to 2 in primary school (as expected); however, it only increased from 2
to 2.3 in lower secondary, less than the 4 textbooks targeted. Together, the textbook:pupil ratio
reached about 80 percent of its target value.               For pre-service training, 12 IFM became
operational, of which 7 were newly built; this allowed a significant increase in the numbers of
teachers trained (a 192 percent increase between 2002/03 and 2005/06 in graduates). To deal
with the lack of trained teachers and the pressures for increasing access, a 45-day training
method (SARPE) was adopted. The total number of trained teachers is as follows:

                                          Pre-service teacher training
                                         2001-2002    2002-2003     2003-2004 2004-2005 2005-2006

         Accelerate training (SARPE)                      1,780         1,600     1,200       950
         Total trained                        609         2,403         2,629     2,555     2,730


The curriculum reform didn't achieve the expected target, but substantial progress was
made. New curricula for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades were developed and tested. Curricula for
grades 6th and 7th were developed and more than 9,000 actors (trainers, school heads, and
teachers) were trained. During the school year 2005-06, the 1st and 2nd grade curricula were
implemented in 2,550 schools, including 1,250 pédagogie convergente (PC) schools.

Government improved the adequacy and quality of expenditures by reallocating the
secondary scholarship budget amounting to CFAF 2.4 billion in 2000 to quality-enhancing
inputs. This shift enabled the equipment of: 65 percent of middle schools with laboratories and
computer rooms; 31 classrooms with internet access; 100 percent of middle schools with science
kits; 15 middle schools with Computer and Resource centers (TDCI); and the financing of annual
pedagogical supervision missions and the training of contractual teachers. This reallocation is of
special note, as this politically sensitive was a strong indication of Government's commitment
and political will.

The majority of the objectives under the quality component, including improved learning
achievements and reduction of repetition rates, were either partially met or were unmet, with the
exception of the objectives for increasing textbook coverage and reducing dropout rates.
However, although the implementation of the activities discussed above did not result in the
expected outcomes within the time limits, they have put into place a dynamic process that is
beginning to show some progress, including the sharp increase in trained teachers, the increase in
the delivery of learning materials, the launching of the `reading first" program, among others.
These elements, therefore, justify the Moderately Unsatisfactory rating.

Component of decentralized management of the education sector: This component is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

     teachers

As shown in the table above and from other sources:

The objective of preparing education development plans in 7 regions was achieved and
exceeded. All nine regions and all 703 municipalities completed their plans.

Government made a significant effort to deconcentrate the budget (26.2%), even if the
ambitious objective of 40 percent of MoE non-salary operating budget to be managed at the
deconcentrated level was not realized.                      Given the importance of the large centralized
procurement of textbooks and learning materials in the non-salary operating budget, this target
may have been unrealistic. Despite the non-attainment of this objective, deconcentrated and
decentralized management showed considerable improvements.                     Budgetary credits given to
regions grew six-fold, moving from 2.15 billion CFAF in 2001 to 14.70 billion CFAF in 2006.
About 57 percent of the education budget (including salaries for contractual teachers) was
decentralized. Educational administration continues to be decentralized, and responsibilities for
human and financial resource management have been partially transferred from the central level
to regions. During 2006, about 1,500 schools in poor communities in all regions received grants
from the new "school grants" component to buy school supplies, and these grants are managed
by school committees. To consolidate decentralized education management, ESEP II will now
pursue reforms adapting the resource management system and giving preference to gains in
efficiency. To this effect, improvement is needed in the following weak areas:
· Reform the current system of payment orders to deconcentrated structures to enable smooth
    transfer of resources;
· Address needs of CAP, which only receive 2 percent of the education budget transferred to
    the regions; this limits their efficiency and ownership; and
· Adapt human resource management tools to the context of decentralization. The status of
    contractual teachers and the relationship with communes is not sufficiently clear.                 For
    administrative personnel, central services remain overstaffed in relation to the norms,
    depriving decentralized structures of qualified personnel.

The number of weekly hours taught by middle school teachers increased from 15 to 24,
against an initial target of 18. This resulted in significant efficiency and productivity gains.
These gains, however, could be further enhanced by ensuring that middle school teachers teach
more than one subject.




                                                              13

Education's share of the total budget increased from 24 to 24.4 percent, but remained
slightly below the target of 27 percent (see above comment on relevance on the indicator). The
basic education share of the total education budget increased from 56 percent in 2000 to 63
percent, against a target of 61 percent. The objective of keeping the teacher-training budget at 1
percent of the total education budget was also reached. However, the objective of reducing the
share of secondary and tertiary in the education budget was exceeded to such a large extent that
there is a risk that this has gone too far.

Triggers: As Annex 11 indicates, all three triggers related to access, quality and decentralized
management of education were moderately achieved. First, regarding access, the school map is
in place and operational; however, schools are not yet geo-referenced and low-cost construction
is not incorporated into education development plans. Second, the Reading First program is
lagging; while the pedagogie convergente program was evaluated, the extension is going on
through curriculum reform which is lagging. Government developed a textbook policy that
aimed to implement a multiple-title textbook program. Finally, regarding the objective of
achieving sufficient capacity, the regional development plans were available, but capacity at
local level was still weak. At regional level the objective is reached and they have capacity to
manage 57% of education budget, to recruit and paid contractual teachers. It should be noted,
however, that the triggers were not clear; nor were they well-aligned to program objectives.


3.3 Efficiency

This section summarizes the cost-effectiveness analysis that is provided in detail in Annex 5.

Mali has an acceptable budget allocation to the education sector. The measurement of education
expenditures as a ratio of GDP shows positive developments, passing from 2.7 percent in 1999 to 3.2 in
2004. Even if the target of 27 percent of recurrent expenditures was not met, the percentage of domestic
revenue allocated to education improved during the same time period from 15 percent in 1999 to 21
percent in 2004.

The results achieved were significant. The primary gross enrollment (GER) rate increased from 56.6
percent in 1999-2000 to 72 percent in 2004-2005 and 75 percent in 2005-2006 against a target of 70
percent in 2004. The primary completion rate increased from 32 percent in 1999-2000 to 48 percent in
2005-06.

Important efficiency gains were made during the implementation of ESEP 1.                The recruitment of
contractual teachers at decentralized level helped to reduce considerably the unit cost. In addition, the
number of hours that teachers taught at middle school, the reduction of the drop-out rate, and the
elimination of secondary scholarships and the reallocation of these savings into quality inputs
resulted in considerable efficiency improvements.

However, inefficiencies still persist within the system. The share of recurrent expenditures for primary
(35.0% in total) is low when compared with other similar countries, for which the average is 49.3 percent.
In addition, the high repetition rate of 18 percent in primary education is a clear waste of scarce resources.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.



                                                      14

This rating is based on the relevance of the program, satisfactory achievement of PDOs,
and the efficiency of the interventions. The project is relevant to the development priorities of
Mali and of the Bank as set forth in the CAS (see Section 3.1). Based on KPI mentioned in
section 1.2, the access component satisfactory; the decentralized management component was
rated moderately satisfactory, against a moderately unsatisfactory rating for the education quality
component (see Section 3.1).       The overall achievement of the PDO is rated Moderately
Satisfactory (see Section 3.2). The performance of the Program in terms of efficiency was
moderately satisfactory (see Section 3.3).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty in Mali is mainly rural and female. Based on a poverty profile analysis done in 2001,
about half of rural households (49%) are poor, against 6 percent in urban areas. About 65.1
percent of women aged 15 to 49 are poor. Under the program, significant progress has been
made in rural areas. Increases in gross enrollment in mainly rural CAPs (Kayes Rive Droite,
Sikasso II, and Sévaré) were 8.7 point higher than increases in mainly urban CAPs (Kayes Rive
Gauche, Sikasso-I and Mopti). This confirms the poverty orientation of the program. According
to the CSR, which used EPAM 2004 data, investment in schooling has had a high rate of
economic return in Mali: about 10 percent for the first years of schooling, 15 percent for a
complete primary education, and about 25 percent for secondary level education.

The Mali Poverty Profile document (ODHD) shows that, in 2001, the incidence of poverty
decreased significantly when the head of household completed primary school as compared to a
household where the head had had no schooling. In terms of social impact, this study showed
that the child's opportunity to access education increases with the length of schooling of his/her
parents and that the gender gap decreases as the schooling of the head of household increases.
There is also evidence that education had a positive effect on maternal health, child health and
child mortality. A 2004 household survey shows that about 50 percent of the social impact of
education cited above is generated during the first six years of schooling.

By supporting community schools through payment of teacher salaries, the program contributed
to the reduction of the direct cost of schooling for rural populations, who are disproportionately
poor. Consequently, this stimulated their demand for education.

The program was able to significantly improve girls' gross enrollment, which grew from 46
percent to 62 percent during the first phase. The completion rate for girls grew from 16.8
percent in 1997 to 31.5 percent in 2005. However, the gender gap in the completion rate
continued to widen, the difference between boys and girls growing from 13.8 points to 18.6
points during the first phase. The system has not been able to significantly increase the number
of female teachers, although the construction of additional latrines has been important for
helping maintain girls in school. The gross intake rate was 66.6 percent in 2004, with a 15 point
gap between boys and girls. Therefore, despite these gains, the program has not been able to
close the gender gap.




                                                15

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

ESEP implementation motivated a profound institutional structural change, with the merger of
the two ministries in charge of education into one. In alignment with the new institutional design,
new central structures (CNECE, IES, CNOU, ILAB, CADDE, and CNR-ENF) were created, and
some central services of the Ministry (DAF, CPS, DNESG, DNETP, CNE, DNEB, UB, CNRST,
DNESRS) were restructured. Long-term capacity-building plans were developed according to
the new and revised functions. This dynamic institutional reform and decentralization follows a
progressive and almost irreversible capacity-building process.              Institutional analysis and
experience gained through program implementation allowed the identification of institutional
bottlenecks and capacity-building needs.

During ESEP I, supported by the CADDE, decentralized institutions were set up with the
overarching goal of implementation the decentralization agenda. At regional level Regional
Directorates were set up (with a total staff of 707) and 70 CAP were created at local level to
provide support to the teaching staff and the schools. Essential functions were transferred from
the central level to local structures, with the effective involvement of communities through the
creation of school management committee (CGS). Local structures managed 57 percent of the
2006 education budget. This prepared the full transfer of the responsibility of primary schools to
the Municipalities in 2007. At the same time, however, the administrative personnel at the
central level increased from 786 to 983 without any clear justification, limiting the potential
impact of restructuring and gains in efficiency.

Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A beneficiary survey was not available, nor was the team able to hold a stakeholder workshop specifically
for this ICR due to budget constraints.


                      4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate.

The risk to development outcome is moderate for the following reasons:

ESEP relevance in view of the national development strategy and community expectations.
PRODEC, which provides the conceptual framework for ESEP, is an expression of the
Government's willingness to reform the education system and to contribute to the creation of the
human capital necessary to face growth challenges in the fight against poverty. This willingness
comes as a response to two main opportunities: the increased competitiveness of the Malian
economy and improvements in the national political climate.               Moreover, ESEP is seen as
responsive to local communities, who have adopted it. First, by involving local communities in
school life and by bringing the school closer to their social and cultural context, ESEP positioned
itself to gain the support of the population. Second, the development of community schools




                                                   16

under the program demonstrates the strong demand from communities, and the system's
response.

The Government's political will to support ESEP I and ensure its sustainability. The
Government's political will and commitment were clearly demonstrated during the preparation
and implementation of the ESEP I, and constitutes one of the main indicators for the
sustainability of the program's accomplishments. This commitment falls within the context of a
stable socio-political environment.      Government has committed both human and budgetary
resources over the long term to achieve the program objectives. A multidisciplinary team of
high-level national staff was assigned to the preparation and execution of ESEP I. The education
budget constituted about 23 percent of the total recurrent budget throughout the program. Over
the last decade, the education budget has quadrupled, based on budget simulation exercises that
led to the selection of strategic options for expanding education in line with long-term budget
capacity. The contracting of teachers, the increase of private schools with consequent education
cost sharing, and the regulation of students flows are strategic options that support the feasibility
of ESEP I. Based on these options, the Government worked out a medium-term expenditure
framework (CDMT) coherent with the national development priorities and compatible with the
macro-economic constraints.

Donors remain interested in and committed to the education sector. At least 15 donors,
including IDA, provide support to the ESEP. Beyond individual conventions signed with the
Government, the Memorandum of Understanding signed between donors and the MoE has
increased the efficiency of donor interventions. The commitment of external partners not only
translates into financial support, but also technical assistance able to draw lessons from many
countries.

ESEP I ambitions challenge national capacities. As a comprehensive sector program, ESEP
carries great ambitions for reform, innovations, and quantitative and qualitative improvements.
Since program conception and throughout its implementation, the gap between its ambitions and
the national capacity for implementation has become evident. The program faces two main
challenges as it strives to realize its goals: availability of institutional and technical capacity, and
the political feasibility to carry out difficult reforms, such as secondary and tertiary scholarships
policies and teacher contracting. Delays and difficulties in launching several sub-components of
the program demonstrate that there was a real risk that program objectives would be
compromised, mostly as a result of weak capacity.

5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

To prepare the program design, the Bank produced analytical work to support the MoE in
identifying constraints and alternative solutions. Studies conducted covered, among other
areas, cost-benefit and effectiveness analyses, and an education sector expenditure review (see
list of studies in Annex 9). These provided the Government and other donors with a reference


                                                    17

point to design a program that would be economically viable and sustainable in the context of
Mali.

The IDA team involved in the preparation and appraisal mission represented a range of
technical and disciplinary backgrounds. Many team members were associated with successful
design and implementation of education reforms in the region, including teacher financing,
textbook rental and use, curriculum enrichment and school improvement initiatives, low-cost
primary school construction, gender equity, adult literacy, and school health, etc. This helped to
bring in experiences and lessons learnt from other countries to enhance ESEP I design.

Advice and support from the Bank determined the design and realization of a Sector-Wide
Approach (SWAP) which was the first of its kind in Mali and among the first in the Bank. The
Bank played the role of a strategic and advising partner to the Government from the concept to
the implementation phase. This contribution can be resumed in three points:

a) IDA provided strategic advice for mobilizing donor financial and technical support and
facilitating consensus, which is essential in the SWAP. To be in line with this option, the ESEP
I Appraisal was participatory through a series of workshops involving other donors and the MoE.
This participatory method was the most reliable way to establish a sense of ownership. The draft
PAD was prepared through these workshops. This process provided a framework for the
preparation of other donor projects.

b) Technical advice on education, financing and management issues: Financing mechanisms
put in place were based on those of the Improving Learning in Primary Schools Project that was
underway at the DAF, along with a plan for subsequent capacity-building in fiduciary
management. As a result, ESEP I was able to fulfill its fiduciary commitments.

c) The choice of loan instrument. APL (Adaptable Program Loan) was chosen as the loan
instrument most appropriate for supporting a long-term program and with the flexibility required
to carry out political reforms. Through this choice, IDA showed by example the importance of
providing a predictable and flexible source of funds to ensure financing for the core program
while other donors finalized their contributions.

The following insufficiencies raised at the quality at entry section impacted negatively the
program performances: the gap between program complexity and institutional capacity;
limitations of the risks assessment; and flaws in the design of the M&E system (see section 2).
This in turn influences the rating of the Bank performance. However, the ICR Team agreed that
Bank responsibility is limited in the case of a multi-donor program such as ESEP, in which
various partners are involved and took the lead on the design and the financing of some sub-
components.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

Frequency of supervision missions. Since the start-up of the ESEP I, the Bank team organized
at least two missions a year, with one always coupled with the Joint Annual Review.



                                                18

IDA played a central role in donor coordination and in joint annual reviews.                    The
organization of missions followed the participatory dynamic that characterized the preparation of
ESEP I. Other experts from the donor group were associated to the IDA supervision missions, as
their fields of intervention went beyond the scope of activities financed by IDA. The results of
the missions complemented the work of the annual joint reviews. In addition, the IDA team
played a coordinating role, serving as leader in preparing and organizing these regular annual
reviews.

The MTR review took relevant decisions, but was held late, only 10 months before the
initial closing date. The decisions taken by the MTR mentioned earlier in this document
(extension of closing date, creation of EMIS, simplification of project design, among others)
helped improve the performance of the ESEP I. The one-year extension after the Mid-Term
Review allowed the execution of more than one-third of the activities under Component I, which
constituted the largest number of activities compared to the other two components. However, the
ICR team thinks that an early organization of the MTR could have made a difference. It should
also be noted that not all of the recommendations of the MTR were taken into account, including
those related to higher education. Moreover, the Bank team missed the opportunity to review
and revise the triggers, as mentioned in Section 2.2 above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank team performance was rated moderately satisfactory based on the moderately
satisfactory rating for the quality at entry and the satisfactory supervision which corrected some
insufficiencies of the design.

5.2 Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Strong Government commitment. The Government has shown strong commitment through: (i)
the creation of the technical unit (Cellule Technique) of the PRODEC which brought in
specialists from other sectoral departments; (ii) the fusion of the two ministries into one Ministry
of Education; and (iii) the strengthening of the technical directorates by assigning qualified staff.
In addition, the Government initiated a proactive communications strategy with students and
teachers and adopted legal texts reforming scholarship policy at secondary school in order to
improve education quality inputs.

From 2001 to 2006, the Government mobilized on a regular basis more than 3 percent of GDP
for the education sector. This did not reach the 3.8 percent indicated within the framework of the
Fast Track Initiative, but remained within the average of comparable countries. Moreover, in
view of the limited public financial resources, the Government knew how to mobilize and
coordinate donors and communities in support of program preparation, financing and
implementation.

Program ownership by the Government. The technical unit assured the preparation of ESEP I
and coordinated program implementation during a transitional phase, transferring responsibilities
to Government structures once they had the necessary qualifications. This mechanism ensured



                                                 19

Government ownership of the program. It also enabled national structures to lead the program
execution process. Qualified managers were assigned to the main divisions in the capacity
development process. This professionalization of management posts improved program
performance and strengthened sustainability.

Government decision-making was slow throughout the process from identification to
effectiveness. Due to differences in approach between the two Ministries, as discussed above,
there was a delay of 16 months between identification and appraisal. Effectiveness was deferred
twice, mainly due to delays in payment of the counterpart funds which lasted more than seven
months.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory.

The MEN did strive to adapt to the structural changes required by the program. Personnel
made the effort to adapt their normal working behavior to the new paradigms of planning,
coordination, information sharing, monitoring, and fiduciary management. The leadership role
in facilitating this change was satisfactory.       Necessary decisions about restructuring and
institutional strengthening were taken to improve performance of central and deconcentrated
units (CPS, DAF, AE, and CAP).

However, three weaknesses should be highlighted. First, it took the Ministry more than three
years to launch some activities of strategic importance identified since program appraisal in 2000.
It was the case for the national policies regarding textbooks and pedagogical materials, the pre-
and in-service teacher training policy, the communication plan and the girls' education policy.
These activities were not fully implemented before the Mid-Term Review in 2004. These delays
cannot be totally explained by the lack of capacities of the MoE, as some partners had offered
their technical support. Second, the MoE did not take the decision to redeploy administrative
staff from the central to the deconcentrated level, whereas decentralized structures faced a lack
of qualified human resources, and central units were overstaffed. Third, capacity building was
influenced by the instability of people at the central and decentralized levels, such as the changes
in CAP directors, and affected the achievement of program objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This rating is based on elements referred to above, in particular on the Government commitment
throughout program duration, on the efforts made by MoE to adapt to reform requirements, but
also on weaknesses highlighted.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

More attention should be given to encouraging a culture of learning assessments to
improve quality. This can be achieved through the creation of assessment skills throughout the
entire pedagogical management, from the central level to the classroom. Monitoring learning
achievement on a regular basis enables periodic adjustments in terms of inputs, pedagogical
methods, curriculum changes, and necessary training in order to improve the quality of education.


                                                 20

The policy consisting in recruiting contractual teachers locally, implementing the alternative
recruitment strategy (SARPE), establishing teacher training institutions in each region and
organizing in service training locally under the supervision of CAP is an efficient way to respond
to the demand and prepare the transfer of primary schools to municipalities.

To improve quality, more attention should be given to the management of human resources.
The massive recruitment of teachers was carried out in parallel with the inefficient use of
administrative staff at the central level and a lack of supervision of teaching staff. This situation
is highlighted by the following: (i) large concentration of personnel at the central level and in
urban centers; (ii) lack of qualified personnel at the decentralized level; (iii) unequal distribution
of teachers between urban and rural centers; and (iv) absenteeism of teachers, which negatively
impacted learning and teaching time.

Financing the community school teachers and providing text books and school supplies is a
very cost effective and pragmatic way to respond to the demand and to promote equity by
reducing the cost for the families.

More emphasis should be given to monitoring and evaluation as the education policy
become more and more decentralized and responsibilities are given to the Municipalities for
school construction and managing primary schools. Local capacities should be strengthened and
personnel trained to make sure that the standards are respected and sufficient attention is given to
assessing quality and monitoring results.

The launching of a series of studies on the main issues and the preparation of a Country
Status Report during the two last years of the implementation of the project was extremely
useful to: (i) correct some of the initial orientations of the PRODEC; (ii) set up good baseline
values for the monitoring and evaluation framework; (iii) prepare the second phase of the
program on a solid analytical base; and (iv) update the MTEF.

Pilot projects and innovations are more likely to be completed under a comprehensive
framework when they are based on a careful assessment of the realism, the phasing, ownership,
implementation capacity, technical skills and human resources adequate for implementation,
financial resources availability and a detailed strategy for scaling up. This is the case for
example of national languages teaching linked to the curriculum reform. Before including such
innovations in the program the above aspects should be examined.

Coordination and harmonization among the key donor agencies facilitated program
implementation. For two of the subcomponents (capacity building and classroom construction),
donor coordination had to be translated into a more operational form (harmonization of
procedures, alignment and common planning of interventions) for a better synergy : (i) for
capacity building, an institutional analysis would enable the preparation of a cohesive plan to
enhance the synergy of actions; (ii) for classroom construction the adoption of a common
classroom plan, standardization of unit costs, and an operating mechanism agreed by all would
not only allow for accelerating construction work, but also for improving the efficiency of
resource use.



                                                  21

The design of the project should be kept simple, with a focus on the key areas of basic
education (teacher training, provision of textbooks, classrooms infrastructure, and direct support
to schools) and on monitoring the action plan/policy measures at all levels of the education
system that are needed to improve the overall efficiency of the education sector and to ensure
that the country remains on track for reaching universal primary education.

The design and financing modalities would have to go much further to harmonize donors'
rules and procedures with government systems so as to increase government ownership and
reduce transaction costs. The APL framework is too rigid given the changes in the environment,
the large number of donors programs, and the strategy proposed by the government.

7. COMMENTS ON ISSUES RAISED BY BORROWER/IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES/PARTNERS

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The Borrower issues were primarily the same as the ones indicated in the ICR, and were not only
expressed during the discussion of the last supervision mission and the ICR mission, but are
reflected in the aide-memoire shared and agreed upon by both parties. There are no major areas
of disagreement or divergence.

(b) Co-financiers
The project had two co-financiers which provided trust funds for specific activities: the
Government of Belgium, which supported classroom construction in primary and VET, and the
Government of Japan, which supported the piloting of early childhood development
interventions. There were no issues raised by either of these co-financiers.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

                              ANNEX 2. OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT


A. ACCES
In general, the performance under this component was satisfactory.

Extension of Early Childhood Development Centers (DPE)

The first phase aimed to (i) put into place mechanisms for the implementation of the DPE
program; (ii) define policies and strategies; (iii)0 establish norms and test the new integrated
model in 180 centers.

During the ESEP, an intra- and multi-sectoral coordination framework was put into place in 2003
under the Local Capacity Strengthening Program (PRCL), which enabled capacity building for
local elected officials in 30 municipalities and 10 local non-governmental organizations. The
DPE policy was defined. However, instead of being tested in180 centers, the model was tested in
only 120.

Classroom construction in basic education

ESEP I aimed to construct 1,500 classrooms per year, rehabilitate 500 classrooms, replace about
250 classrooms, construct school cantines, conduct a study on construction management, pilot
low-cost alternative construction materials and launch the school mapping process. IDA support
was expected to construct and equip a total of 1,400 classes (with office/store and two latrine
blocks).

Overall, instead of 6,000 classrooms, 6,336 were constructed, including 1,953 by ANICT and 489
by the Ministry of Social Development. Under IDA financing, 1,230 new classrooms (of the
estimated 1,400), 1026 latrine blocks (of the estimated 900) and 105 rehabilitated classrooms (of
an estimated 500) were delivered. School cantines were put into place in selected zones. The
study of construction quality was launched but has not yet been concluded. Low-cost alternative
construction materials remain at the experimental stage.

Construction and rehabilitation of training centers

The program aimed to construct/renovate 55 CAP and 10 IFM in addition to the extension under
IDA financing of 9 Academie d'enseignement (AE). A total of 50 new CAP were constructed,
bringing to 70 the total number of operational CAPs. A total of 12 IFM are already operational,
of which 8 were constructed and equipped. Of the 9 AEs envisaged, IDA financed the
construction of two.

Construction and rehabilitation of secondary schools

The program planned to construct 5 senior secondary schools with 12 classes each (with IDA
financing two schools) and to renovate 16 existing structures. Although 60 classrooms had been
planned (5 senior secondary schools), in fact 175 classrooms were completed, including three
new schools and classroom extensions in existing schools. Of the three new senior secondary
schools, IDA financed two in Mopti and Kalabancoro. The other classes are divided up as
follows: Kayes (20), Koulikoro (27), Sikasso (24), Ségou (19), Mopti (10), Gao (10), and the
District of Bamako (29). The planned rehabilitations were not realized.



                                                   25

For technical education and vocational training (ETFP), although six training centers were
planned, only three were constructed. Two centers were rehabilitated of a total of four planned,
including the CFPAA of GAO where six classes were constructed and equipped. Of the 9
Apprenticeships Centers for Women planned, four were constructed.

Access to higher education

The renovation of the faculty libraries and of science laboratories was completed as planned. The
feasibility study for the central library at the University of Bamako has been transferred to the
second phase (ESEP 2). The other feasibility studies were not conducted as planned.


B. QUALITY

The performances under this component were moderately unsatisfactory.

Early Childhood Development (Développement de la Petite Enfance or DPE)

Two principal activities had been envisaged : (i) testing a new model and new pedagogic
materials in 180 community centers, and strengthen the capacities of the different actors including
NGOs; and (ii) improving existing programs by adopting an integrated approach.

During the implementation of ESEP 1, curricula and pedagogic guides were consolidated,
improved and validated in 2003. Preschool educators were training in the use of the guide and
the curricula (173 in 2003 and 220 in 2004). In addition, 100 preschool educators were trained in
the elaboration of low-cost didactic materials in 2002, 120 in 2003 and 120 in 2004. Moreover,
200 preschool educators were trained in the didactics for specific disciplines. Social mobilization
activities were conducted in 500 communities, of which 300 were in the context of the Local
Capacity Building Program (PRCL). The policy document for early childhood development was
drafted and validated, and construction norms were written in 2004. A coordination framework
(inter- and multi-sectoral) was put in place in 2003 thanks to the PRCL, which also contributed
by building capacity among the locally elected officials in 30 municipalities and 10 local NGOs.
Practical training on DPE issues was provided to 250 women in 2002 and in 2005. In addition,
200 Koranic school teachers were trained on DPE in 2005 as well as 300 agents of the education
sector. Of the 180 DPE Centers that were to have been constructed, 120 were completed and
tested.

Pre-service and in-service training of teachers
The program envisaged training about 2,500 new teachers per year as well as the development
and implementation of an in-service training strategy at national, regional and local levels.

Pre-service training: A pre-service training policy was developed. During the year 2005/06,
2,730 teachers completed pre-service training (including 1,780 from IFMs and 950 under new,
shorter SARPE method). This is significant when compared with 609 teachers trained in 2002/03.
Of the 1,780 basic education teachers trained, 1,226 were for basic 1 and 554 were for basic 2.
These 2,730 teachers were recruited as contractuals by the local government authorities. The
objective of increasing the share of women among the teachers was not achieved.

In-service training: A policy for in-service teacher training has been defined. Within the context
of the generalization of the curriculum, 1,639 education advisers and 17 Arabic advisers were
trained on the integrated module for pédagogie convergent/curriculum. About 191 education
advisers (generalists) and 1,119 school directors were trained in management and animation of
Communities of Learning. The training of 110 education advisers and 600 school directors were
conducted by radio. In addition, 72 advisers and 300 directors were trained in modular
conception.

A curriculum linked to the basic educational needs

During the first phase, the new curricula for grades 1-4 were finalized and applied, and those for
grades 5 and 6 are being prepared and tested. During the testing phase, 9 DAE, 25 DCAP, 50
education advisers, 80 school directors and 320 teachers were trained.             In 2005/2006, the
curricula for grades 1 and 2 were being applied in 2,550 schools (about 8,000 in total). Of the
2,550, about 1,250 were PC schools, 800 were community schools, and 500 were "classical"
schools. During the generalization, 80 national trainers, 365 trainers from the deconcentrated
levels, 2,550 school directors and 6,100 teachers were trained. The 3rd and 4th grade classes are
being applied in 80 schools. The 5th and 6th grade curricula have been finalized. The new
curriculum for teacher training has been written, and the Curriculum Development Unit and the
regional teams were provided with logistical and computer means. However, the curricula for
grades 7, 8 and 9 have not been prepared.

Evaluation of learning achievements and examinations reform

Standardized tests were to be developed, and a training program was to have been provided for
teachers and school heads in the conception and use of diagnostic assessment tests in class. The
standardized tests for grades 1-4 were designed. These tests are administered each year in the
"curriculum" classes. One module for teacher training in evaluation of basic competencies has
also been designed.

Reading first

The first phase of the ESEP aimed at developing a program of "Reading First" in 345 PC schools.
This sub-component had a delayed start : the 345 PC schools were identified, the list of books
was drawn up by an ad hoc committee. The training module for teachers on the use of reading
corners was designed. However, the training activities did not take place.

Textbooks and didactic materials

The textbook policy was adopted in 2004. A Textbook Management Unit (UGMS) was created
within the CNE and is operational. A total of 473 teacher trainers, 38 of whom are women, were
trained in administrative and pedagogic management of textbooks. Regarding the procurement




                                                   27

and distribution of textbooks, a total of 12,222,618 textbooks for basic education were acquired,
of which 335,740 were IDA financed.

Children with special needs (EBES)

The first phase of the ESEP was to develop, together with other ministries, NGOs and the
professional associations, a survey of the situation of children with disabilities, to develop a
policy and to put place pilot interventions. The diagnostic study of the educational situation of
children with disabilities from 0 to 15 years was carried out in Kayes, Mopti and in the District of
Bamako in 2002 with the support of UNICEF. The National Policy as regards special education
and inclusive education was drafted and validated in 2004, with the participation of the social
development sector and of NGOs. Within this framework, 70 education advisers, 297 school
directors and 465 teachers were trained. A training manual in special education was also
validated in 2005. The survey into the situation of children with disabilities, including an
inventory of resources, a study on the prevalence and a study on Knowledge, Attitudes and
Practices (CAP) was not carried out, even if the terms of reference had been drafted.

Strengthening of Medersas (Koranic schools)

The first phase was supposed to support the development of new curriculum materials for the
"harmonized medersas" that teach the official curriculum, to provide training for 750 teachers and
education advisers charged with Arabic language education, to develop didactic tools and to put
in place a strategy for the introduction of French in medersas as a second language.

During implementation, the curricula of medersa were harmonized (integrating French education)
with the official curricula, and were validated. The DNEB created a section charged with
medersas. The program provided: (i) training for 1,186 medersa teachers in the didactics of
education in 3 AEs; (ii) the training in non-formal education of 50 teachers of Islamic education
and of Arabic language; (iii) the training of 51 Arabic education advisers in school
administration, professional ethics and education legislation; (iv) the training of 240 medersa
teachers on didactics of Arabic; (v) training of 229 medersa directors in education legislation,
professional ethics and school administration; (vi) technical validation of medersa draft curricula;
(vii) drafting of textbooks for mathematics, sciences and geography for grades 4-9. In addition,
an existing Teacher Training Institute (IFM) for medersas was equipped.

School health and nutrition

Programs of deworming and of micronutrient supplementation, the production of instruments,
and training on health issues were envisaged under the project. The implementation of the
activities for school health was delayed. However, between 2002 and 2006, an Action Plan for
School Health had been validated, and the school health themes to be integrated into the curricula
of CEDs were designed. In 2005/2006, the deworming of 69,044 children, and the provision of
micronutrients in all target schools in two CAPs in Kayes (46,700), Ségou/Niono (7,810) and
Mopti/Djenne (15,534) were realized.        The component also designed a teachers' guide on
deworming and a guide for a communications strategy for the prevention of HIV/AIDS.

Reduction of repetition and dropout

Tutoring and remediation activities, and make-up classes were to be provided in collaboration
with Mothers' Associations (AME) in the three regions were the repetition rate was very high.
During implementation, make-up classes were organized in 60 schools, and remediation classes


                                                  28

in 100 schools in the regions of Kayes, Mopti and Gao. In addition, 51 offices of AMEs were set
up in the Academies of Kayes, Kita, Mopti, Douentza and Gao, and capacity building in
management of AMEs was provided in those areas.                Moreover, 100 school directors, 40
education advisers and 15 agents from the AEs of Kayes, Kita, Mopti, Douentza and Gao were
trained in the production of statistics related to the remediation courses. The supervision of these
courses in 100 public schools in those same Academies, i.e. 20 schools per Academy, was put in
place. In general, all of the activities were carried out at the end of the phase; therefore, although
the impact was weak with regard to repetitions (which stayed high when measured against
targets). The dropout rate decreased from 8 to 4.6 percent in basic education, but the repetition
rate fell from 18 to 16.9 percent, against a target of 13 percent.

Non-formal education (ENF)

The program aimed to build capacity in the implementation of ENF programs.                     During
implementation, (i) 140 CAP education advisers were trained, 45 heads of CED and CAF at the
AE level and 981 educators received pre- and in-service training. Each educator received guides
for reading, writing and arithmetic, a reading/writing textbook, an arithmetic manual and 10
specialized guides; each learner CED received two textbooks, which were written in 11 languages
for the 4 CED years; (ii) management committees were put in place in all of the CEDs, and the
supervisory personnel at AEs and CAPs were trained; (iii) to improve partnership between CEDs,
CAFs and NGOs, four review seminars and three orientation committee meetings were organized,
with the participation of different actors; in addition, a non-formal education development policy
was developed in partnership in 2005; (v) with the new curriculum, textbooks were developed
that integrate life skills competencies in seven languages (of 11 total) to take into account local
needs and interests. Fourteen professional training modules for CAFs and CEDs were developed;
(vi) 981 trainers are currently having their salaries paid by Government.

Supervision of instruction in secondary

Official documents were to be prepared regarding the inspection function, the recruitment of
different inspectors and the preparation of a training plan. This was not done within the time
limits. Regarding the evaluation of the inspection function, draft legal texts were prepared to
create an Inspector-General of National Education, with the aim of creating 5 Inspection Centers
at the level of AEs; however, the implementation has not begun.

Teaching/learning handbook (secondary)

An inventory of libraries was to have been finalized, and a seed stock of books financed. The
library inventory was conducted, and 38 senior secondary school libraries were provided with
1,600 books on average; in addition, 38 librarians were trained, 39 public and 3 private senior
secondary schools were given computer materials and Internet connections.

Science and technology education

The review of curricula, the identification of pilot schools for mini-laboratories and for provision
of science kits, and the creation of a Documentation and Information Center (CDI) in 50 percent
of secondary schools (60) and the training of teachers in these schools were planned under the
first phase. The revision of curricula has begun but remains unfinished. The policy document
has been drafted and adopted by the Cabinet of the MEN. A total of 36 computer rooms were
built, equipped and connected to Internet as one of the quality inputs that resulted from the
reallocation of secondary student scholarships; 10 CDI were created, 493 professors were trained


                                                   29

in the use of the science kits; 520 collective professors were trained in the didactic of disciplines,
245 professors were trained in the use of informatics, 82 school-life agents were trained in school
administration, 50 general supervisors and agents of DNESG were trained in gender approaches.

Vocational Education and Training

The national policy of VET was elaborated with the participation of the MEN, the MEFP and
other actors. A related action plan was also elaborated. The inventory of the libraries of 13
public secondary schools was carried out. A total of 13 computer rooms were equipped with 20
computers (9 are connected to Internet) within the framework of the conversion of the
scholarships into quality inputs. About 161 professors were trained to implement new accounting
software through a competence-based approach (APC). A total of 89 professors of industrial
subjects were trained in use the competence-based approach, and 38 professors of the industrial
subjects were trained in the use of auto-mechanic equipment, mechanical engineering and general
mechanics. About 19 inspectors are trained in docimology, 70 public and private school
administrators (heads of secondary schools, directors of studies, heads of public works) were
trained to use competence-based approaches. A total of 30 heads of private secondary schools
were trained in entrepreneurial management of schools, 11 librarians were trained in documentary
techniques.

Supervision of classroom instruction

The project aimed to: (i) prepare official documents on the inspection function (including a
general evaluation); (ii) recruitment in different inspectorates; and (iii) the preparation of a
training plan.

The evaluation of the inspection function was finalized and the document is available. The
support to and pedagogic supervision of teachers in classrooms is done regularly in secondary
public and private schools, as is administrative supervision of public and private schools.
Pedagogic evaluation for the management of secondary teachers' careers is done on demand.

However, the recruitment of new inspectors (especially for and technical and vocational
education) did not take place.

Life skills and reproductive health courses

Under this sub-component, curricula were to have been developed adapted to family life and
reproductive health for secondary and university students in active collaboration with NGOs.
The curricula were not developed.

Management of higher education

During the phase, the following activities were completed:          (i) the creation of a steering
committee at the University rectory, with inter-faculty and inter-institutional collaboration; (ii)
the development of a curriculum; (iii) a feasibility study on a regional university approach ; (iv)
development of policies to support private tertiary education ; (v) private management of student
dormitories; (vi) in-service training; (vii) implementation of methods for the regulation of student
flows by faculty; (viii) development of an experimental Internet job creation program at the
university ; (ix) implementation of proactive communication policy, leading to a dialogue within
the university community on improving quality ; (x) implementation of thematic issues: (xi)
increasing completion rate for women in tertiary education; (xi) development by each faculty of


                                                  30

  gender policies; (xii) cooperation between faculties and secondary schools to increase the number
  of female university candidates; (xiii) preferential selection of women in scholarship programs,
  and construction of dormitories.

Strengthening library and information services

  The program aimed to: (i) rehabilitate and equip libraries in the key faculties (Grandes Ecoles)
  and in the University Faculties (preliminary work including the drafting of terms of reference, the
  preparation of commitment documents, studies and architectural plans, selection of the architect
  and the contractor, and the preparation of the site, construction and equipping of the first modular
  buildings that can function autonomously; (ii) the development of a general concept of a library,
  placing the library within the context of a detailed plan for the development of higher education
  in Mali.

  The implementation of ESEP I enabled the rehabilitation of the ENI and the ENSUP, the
  construction and equipping of a pedagogical wing for the FLASH, the construction of four
  amphitheaters with a total of 2,500 seats and the construction of the Rectory of the University of
  Bamako. In addition, the rehabilitation and equipping of university residences are underway
  (FMPOS, IPR/IFRA, IUG, FAST).

Provision of scientific equipment

  The program aimed to: (i) evaluate the need for scientific material and equipment; (ii) train
  personnel; (iii) draft contract documents; (iv) construct laboratories; (v) purchase audio-visual
  equipment, computer equipment and software adapted for the teaching of sciences; laboratory kits
  and demonstration materials and supplies. The rehabilitation and equipping of laboratories at the
  University and its Schools has been ongoing since 2002, due to an annual financing of 600
  million FCFA from the BSI. The University has also benefited from access to intranet services
  linked to the Internet.

Establishment of a Competitive Research Fund

  The program aimed to: (i) train personnel; (ii) set up a Research Committee; (iii) set up the first
  research funds; (iv) create scientific journals for the different Faculties. The Research Committee
  and the funds were not put in place, and the scientific journals were not created.

C. MANAGEMENT AND DECENTRALIZATION
  The performance under this component is considered satisfactory.

Transfer of responsibilities and resources to local government authorities and schools

The first phase aimed to put in place a Decentralization Unit with the mandate to: (i) lead studies;
(ii) monitor/analyze past and current experiences of donors that support increased community
participation in school management; and (iii) set up pilot tests. The Decentralization Unit (Cellule
d'Appui à la Déconcentration et à la Décentralisation de l'Education, CADDE) was created. Under
its leadership, the reference framework for decentralization was drafted, and Decree N° 313/PRM
of 04 June 2002 provided details regarding the transfer of skills to local government authorities
(collectivités territoriales or CT) in education, especially with regard to examinations
responsibilities, management of school supplies, mobilization of contributions or responsibility for
personnel and management of contractual staff.            In addition, CTs are in charge of school


                                                    31

construction. In the regions of Kayes, Gao, Tombouctou and Kidal, in a pilot test, resources were
transferred for the equipment of classrooms and for water points. School management committees
(CGS) were put in place in 90 percent of schools in accordance with Arrêté N°. 04-0469/MEN/SG
of 9 March 2004. However, less than 60 percent of CGS signed accords with CTs. Initially
envisaged for Phase 2, Direct Support to Improve School Performance (ADARS) was put into place
under Phase 1. In 2005, 1,500 schools with CGS benefited ADARS support in the poorest areas.
The procedures were continuously improved to adapt the amount of the support to the size of
schools. In addition, MEN is now using decentralized financial services for these transfers.

Implementation of decentralization master plan

The sub-component aimed to put into place an institutional plan for decentralization. A central and
regional institutional plan was put into place in line with the decentralization master plan. In line
with the institutional plan, new central structures were created (CNECE, IES, CNOU, ILAB,
CADDE, CNR-ENF) and some central services of the MEN were restructured (DAF, CPS, DNESG,
DNETP, CNE, DNEB, UB, CNRST, DNESRS). However, during the first phase, the number of
administrative staff at central level grew from 786 à 983 without a consequent redeployment
towards the core functions of the MEN, which limits the impact of the restructuring and the
efficiency gains.

            CAP                     1,375                  1,529                  +200
            Total                   2,816                  3,219                  +403

  At the deconcentrated level, the total number of Academies went from 9 to 15, and their staff
  grew from 655 in 2001 to 707 in 2006 (above the ESEP I estimate of 500), and the CAP went
  from 35 to 70 in number, with staff growing from 1,375 in 2001 to 1,529 in 2006 (below the
  ESEP I estimate of 2,000). This capacity development at the decentralized level was not due to a
  redeployment of central level agents, but instead was due to the transformation of teachers at the
  local level into administrative staff.

  Preparation of Regional Education Development Plans (PRDE)

  This sub-component envisaged the drafting of 7 regional development plans that would be
  integrated into a national development plan with: (i) comprehensive assumptions about the budget
  framework; (ii) development of objectives. During implementation, nine PRDEs were developed
  as well as Education Development Plans for 703 municipalities.

  Financial management

  This sub-component aimed to build financial management capacity at central and local levels.
  The financial management capacities of the central and deconcentrated Services of MEN were
  strengthened in terms of qualified personnel. Staff with the appropriate profiles were trained and
  deployed to central and deconcentrated Services (each AE or CAP now has a professional
  accountant and each central Service has a financial inspector); the Administrative and Financial



                                                  32

Directorate (DAF) was restructured and now has two sections for managing external resources
and one material accounting division and an Informatics Unit. The agents of the DAF have
benefited from numerous training opportunities (in financial management, procurement, etc.) and
regional agents have been trained in decentralized financial management.


Personnel Management

With regards to human resource management, there were important gains under ESEP 1: (i) there
was a policy change with the local recruitment of new personnel by the local government
authorities (CT); in 2005, 10,995 new contractual teachers in basic education, and 1,824 in
secondary were recruited; (ii) part of the salaries of community teachers up to 25,000 FCFA per
month was provided (in 2005, 6,348 community school teachers received this, whereas in 2001,
community teachers, of whom there were 3,000, did not received any such contribution); (iii)
alignment of contractual teacher salaries with the civil servant salary scale; (iv) improvements in
salary conditions, a fixed formula and the standardization of contracts for accelerating payment of
salaries; (v) creation of new community schools with a view of transforming them into communal
schools.

During implementation, the human resources team (GRH) in collaboration with the DAF made
remarkable progress in putting into place organigrams and in defining profiles for positions.
However, the MEN does not have an adequate instrument for the management of human
resources, in particular regarding previsions and control of staff numbers. Much remains to be
done to arrive at real mastery over the management of teaching personnel within a decentralized
context. Contractual teachers do not yet recognize the authority of the municipality as their
employer, as they are not paid directly by them. With regard to administrative personnel, central
services are still over-subscribed with regard to the organigram and the redefinition of their
functions, while at the decentralized levels, there is a real lack of qualified personnel who can
provide technical support to the CTs. The establishment of a personnel database to support the
management of human resources was initiated but remains unfinished.

    I. Economic and social impact of education investment (or Justification for
        investing in education)

 1.1. Social impact

 The estimated impacts have been consolidated into a global score of the social sectors
 based on the Household Survey done in 2004. The analysis shows that the first cycle of
 basic education (grades 1-6) is the level that generates the main social impacts. In total,
 about 50 percent of social effects are already reached within the six years of primary
 education. This figure is high for health variables (over 60%) and low in terms of
 population variables (about 40%). Additionally, the second cycle of basic education
 (grades 7-10) has positive impacts as well even though the margin is sensibly low (about
 25 points) and in secondary education the margin is only estimated at 20 points.

      1.2. Economic return

      The analysis shows that the investment in schooling, in terms of mobilizing resources
      (public and private, financial and on time) in order to produce qualified individuals for
      productive life, has a high rate of return in Mali. The analysis is based on the human
      capital theory that provides a strategy that allows estimating the increase of individual
      incomes resulting from one year of additional schooling. The model standard of human
      capital by Mincer and Becker assumes that employees are more or less paid by their
      marginal productivity and that this will increase with the cumulated human capital. The
      table below, from EPAM survey in 2004, provides data on income per category of
      employee.

      To determine the private rate of return of N years of education, a standard practice based
      on Mincer's model that estimates an equation which basic denomination is the following:

                             Ln(Y) = c + rN + aE + bE² + u

      The econometric estimation is conducted for the young population, between 25 to 35
      years old, in order to identify the trends for young graduates from formal education
      institutions. The table below provides the results for active employed population (data
      from EPAM 2004).

The rate of return of education is about 10% for the first years of schooling and
substantially increases with the number of years of education (15% for a complete
primary education and about 25% at the secondary level). In reference to comparable
studies, those who have enrolled in vocational institutions make more income than those
who have followed the general stream; the differential in income is however moderate
(7.3% in average) and a key question will be to know whether this supplemental gains of
those who have enrolled in vocational schools is comparable to the more or less high
costs for training; the answer to this question is in fact negative.

 II. Achievement of ESEP 1

The primary gross enrollment (GER) rate increased from 56.6 percent in 1999-2000 to 72
percent in 2004-2005 and 75 percent in 2005-2006 against an expected of 70%. On
average, Mali has experienced 8.5 percent growth in primary education enrollment, 14.4
percent in lower secondary, 8 percent in upper secondary education and 21 percent in
higher education. The number admitted into grade1 more than doubled between
2001/2002 and 2005/2006 going from 190 820 to 300 611, which makes averages an
annual progress of 12.2% during the period.

The primary completion rate increased from 32 percent in 1999-2000 to 48 percent in
2005-06. Despite this growth, the challenge remains critical to reach the expected goal of
100% by 2015. The rate for girls' completion also improved from 27,2% in 2000-01 to
42% in 2005-06.

Available data on learning achievement does not allow measurement of progress against
the PDO indicator. Test results from a study conducted by UNESCO in 2005 in 3
Regions indicate an "acceptable minimum level of proficiency" in language and
mathematics: 51.5 (on a scale 0-100) for languages and 48.5 for math in 2nd grade; and
43.1 in French and 42.5 in mathematics in 5th grade respectively.




                                                  37

The dropout rate decreased from 8 to 4.6 percent in primary schools. In primary school,
the repetition rate went from 18% in the beginning of the project to 16.9% at the end
compared to a projected target of 13%. For middle school and secondary, this rate is
respectively at 22% compared to the target of 10%, and 25,3% against a target of 13%.
More pronounced for girls than boys (17,3% for primary schools girls in 2006) repetition
remained high in part due to the fact the Girls Education Division that was responsible
for driving the activities to reduce it, was not active during a large part of the first
program phase.

III. Financing education

3.1. Public expenditures for the education sector

The following table suggests major trends since 1999.                  While recurrent education
expenditures represented only 13% of the government revenue in 1995, now it is 21%
that are allocated to the sector; as well more emphasis on the education sector could be
illustrated by the fact that the share of recurrent expenditures excluding debt service has
increased to 19% in 1995 to a current figure between 23 and 24%.

The measurement of education expenditures in ratio of the country GDP shows positive
developments. That is, this figure of 3.1% remains moderate in the intent of reaching the

performing countries vis-à-vis universal primary education.

       3.2 Intra-sectoral allocation

       Regarding the data in the table, Mali marginally distinguishes itself from other countries
       in the region with a structure of recurrent expenditures per level of education that is quite
       particular:
       i)       The share of recurrent expenditures for primary level or the first cycle of primary
                education (35.0% in total) is low in comparison with what is observed in other
                countries where an average figure of 49.3% is recorded.
       ii)      The second factor that is highlighted by the suggested international comparison is
                about the share of recurrent expenditures allocated to secondary education
                (second cycle of primary education, secondary general and technical). With a
                figure estimated here at 43.5%, Mali allocates the highest share of recurrent
                expenditures to these levels of education than other countries considered in the
                comparison (the average value for the 10 countries is 31.3%). This situation is as
                well exceptional as for the second cycle of primary education that lasts only three
                years in Mali whereas the standard in the other countries is four years and that this
                country is far from reaching universal primary education.
       iii)     There is also a relative reduction of the share of higher education that was 23% in
                1995 to a figure between 15 and 18% and others.

       3.3. Household education expenditures for children

       In the case of Mali, the survey on poverty assessment (EMEP) of 2001 provides useful
       information on household spending. The analysis of EMEP data shows a growth structure
       with the level of education in the average expenses of average families while enrolling
       their children, from 3,541 CFAF per year in first cycle primary education to 11,019 per
       year in higher education. An exception to this growth is at the preschool level where
       family contribution is slightly high (11,888 CFAF per year).




                                                      39

    In comparison of private education expenditures with the total spending in each level of
    education, the analyses show (see table below) that, in exception to pre-school, the share
    of household financing of educational services is generally very low when the level of
    education is high, from 46% in pre-school to 4% in secondary and less than 3% in higher
    education.

    The table succinctly illustrates that the more the families are wealthy the more they
    financially contribute to the first cycle of primary education, households annual spending
    in education is 2,810 CFAF if they are located in the two income quintiles of the poorest,
    however 8,326 CFAF are spent when the family is among the 20% of the wealthiest.

    IV. Efficiency and equity in the distribution of spending in education

    4.1. Economic distribution of spending
    On the entire sector, more than 56% of recurrent expenditures are allocated to teaching
    and learning activities with an estimate of 32% in the first cycle of primary education,
    which has increased to 48% in the second cycle of primary education, 74% in secondary
    general and over 80% in technical, higher and teacher education.

Overall, in the education sector we can count 18.8% of 35,049 individuals employed in
schools (about one out of five) do not have a teaching position ; if we analyze the entire
38,075 accounted individuals in the table, we find that 24.4% of them (9,300) would hold
non-teaching position (6,674 in schools and 2,626 in line services).

Regarding the allocation of recurrent expenditures per category, we note that 58.7% of
recurrent budget is devoted to salaries, 29.1% in operating costs and 12.3% in
scholarships and transfers.

4.2. Unit costs

Public spending per student varies from 25,000 CFAF in the first cycle of primary
education to 392,000 CFAF in the university, 59,700 CFAF in the second cycle of
primary education and 264,000 CFAF in secondary general, with some indexes between
1 in the first cycle of primary education to 16 at the higher education level. The unit cost
for teacher education is estimated at 340,000 CFAF, slightly below the one for higher
education. The costs for technical and vocational education are higher than those of the
secondary general with a figure of 457,000 CFAF at the secondary level and 753,000 at
the higher level (schools and institutes).

Even though it is mainly on a comparative basis that provides a clear idea about these
enrollment unit costs, four major patterns emerge from an internal comparison between
different levels of education:

i) In the secondary general, it is normal to have growing unit costs. However, we notice
that secondary education is especially characterized by higher unit costs (8 times more
than those of the first cycle of primary education and 4 times more than those of the
second cycle of primary education).

ii) These high costs in the higher level of Mali educational system are confirmed by the
gap in unit cost between primary and the university levels (from 1 to 16), which seem to
be very substantial.

iv) The unit costs of students supported by the government in private schools are close to
those recorded in public schools in both cycles of primary education. Whereas at the
secondary general as well as technical levels, the level of grants to the private sector by
the government is lower than the cost per student observed in public schools; in
secondary general, the financing is only about half of the unit cost in public while those
of technical and vocational is ¼ of the average cost observed in public schools (however,
we must take into consideration private technical schools providing most of the time
higher level of education less costly).




                                             41

While going beyond initial observations, it is interesting to place the assessment of
enrollment unit costs in a larger comparative scope.

International comparison of the unit costs per level of education
The situation in Mali in 2004 is compared, on one hand to the situation 6 years ago in
order to assess on-going dynamics and on the other hand with the one in 12 French
speaking countries in the region over current period (country data are essentially from
selected years from 2001 and 2004). The table below outlines available information in
the public system (public and community) knowing that we use the index for unit costs
expressed by units of GDP per inhabitant to conduct a comparative study.

      ANNEX 7. SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR

  A.     History and institutional organization
The Program for Sectoral Investment in Education (ESEP) operationalizes the Ten-Year
Program for the Development of Education (PRODEC).               Investments were foreseen
stretching over three successive phases: 2001-2007 (extended until the end of 2005), 2006-
2008 and 2009-2010.

  B.     Objectives and expected project results
As indicated in the Letter on Educational Policy and the project evaluation document from
December 2000, the overall objective of the first phase of the Mali Education Sector
Expenditure Program (ESEP) is to provide increased and equitable access to better quality
education..  In other words, it dealt with putting in place a sustainable strategy for
achieving universal quality education. Specific goals are to improve: (a) gross primary
enrollment; (b) the quality of teaching and learning; and (c) decentralized management of
the education sector.

  C.     Components of the ESEP
The program is made up of three components relating to quality, access and education
management and 30 subcomponents. The subcomponents of the components dealing with
quality and access are divided among the different levels and types of education.

  D.     Note on the objectives and expected project results
Significant and satisfactory progress has been made in the sector concerning access to
education even if information given on certain quality indicators shows that school
performance is below expected rates.

Performance achievements are as follows:
The Gross Enrollment Rate reached 72.2 percent by the end of the first initial phase against
an expected 70 percent, reaching 74 percent and 75 percent in 2004 and 2005. At the same
time, the gap between boys and girls went form 21.5 to 20.0. Current strategies to reduce
these gaps used under the terms of bilateral aide, namely with UNICEF (mothers' stipends),
UNESCO and USAID (scholarships for girls in the north), showed tendencies to reverse
this problem in favor of girls.

The completion rate for primary education improved from 35.6 percent in 2001 to 48.4
percent in 2005-2006. In terms of resource allocation, basic education remained the sub-
sector of greatest concentration with 56.4 percent of recurrent educational expenditures in
2001-02 against 63.1 percent in 2005-2006 compared to a target of 61 percent at the end of
phase 1. For students holding a diploma in basic education (DEF) in secondary education,
it was expected that at least 32 percent would be oriented towards VET. In 2005-2006,
around 40 percent were oriented towards these technical and professional tracks. Finally,
the education sector is achieving and reinforcing its role in decentralization.

During ESEP I, the institutional schema at the central and deconcentrated levels was put
into place according to the overarching schema of decentralization, thus directing the
creation of new central structure and the restructuring of others. At the deconcentrated


                                              46

levels, the Regional Directions of Education (DRE) and the Inspections of Fundamental
Teaching (IEF) were restructured to become Academic Directions of Teaching (DAE) and
Centers of Pedagogy (CAP) while bringing their respective numbers from 9 to 15 and from
35 to 70. Bringing these instructional structures closer together was also accompanied by
capacity reinforcement for management, including human and financial resources.

  E.      Realization of objectives and results

  Component I : Improving the quality of teaching and learning

  I.1. Basic education

  I.1.1. Early childhood development
In the implementation of the first phase of ESEP, this sub-component allowed the
conception and validation of the early childhood development policy document and the
creation of programs and teaching guides for preschools. Training was done for around
1500 preschool educators; 1000 staff from ECD training structures/institutions.          100
Koranic school teachers and 15 women's cooperatives were also reached through this
training.

  I.1.2. Pre- and In-service teacher training
National policies for pre- and in-service teacher training were developed. In the course of
ESEP I, the system allowed the pre-service training of 5396 teachers through teacher
training centers (IFM) and 5530 other teachers through alternative recruitment strategy of
teachers (SARPE). This is an annual average of 2461 teachers who were trained. These are
contractual teachers of local collectivities. Through in-service training 1639 educational
advisors (conseillers pédagogiques), 1119 school directors and 17 Arabic advisors were
trained.

  1.1.3. A Curriculum linked to basic educational needs
The implementation of this sub-component materialized through: the creation and adoption
of General Curriculum Framework Guidelines for basic education; the development and
testing of grade 1 curriculum (training, monitoring and evaluation); the development of
grade 2 curriculum; the development of General Framework Guidelines for teacher
training; the development of new curriculum for teacher training. On an institutional level,
the rehabilitation and equipping of the Curriculum Development Unit was noted. During
the 2005-06 school year, first and second grade levels were already being used in 2550
schools (of about 8000 total). In terms of training, in the test stage, nine (9) directors of
teaching academies, 25 directors of centers of pedagogy (CAP), 50 educational advisors, 80
school directors and 320 teachers were trained.

  1.1.4. Evaluation of learning outcomes / exam reform
In the course of phase 1, a bank of items in national languages was put together, including
French, Mathematics and early learning. Standard exams were developed for grade 1, 2, 3,
and 4. Educational advisors and staff of teaching academies were trained in monitoring
and evaluation techniques. An evaluation study was undertaken on the performance in



                                              47

French, Mathematics and national languages of grade 4 students in primary school at
schools using pédagogie convergente and classical pedagogy.

  1.1.5. Textbooks and reading materials
According to plans, the national textbook and didactic material policy was developed and
adopted; a concessionary contract between the Ministry of Education (MEN) and the
private sector on editing, printing, distribution and free sale of textbooks and didactic
material was passed; national capacities were reinforced in the development, editing and
management of textbooks.
176,000 books (student and teacher guides) and 2000 visual teaching supports (1 and 2) in
the national languages of Bamanakan, Fulfuldé, Songhoï, Tamasheq, Soninké and Dogoso
« Dogon » for the first three grades of basic education were edited and distributed,
contributing to the improvement of the student/textbook ratio for this level; 147,600 library
books were acquired, enabling a supply to 40 high schools, 11 institutes of professional
training, 8 teacher training institutes and 17 "groupes scolaires".. In total, 15,581,231
textbooks were supplied during the first phase of the program.

  1.1.6. Children with special education needs (EBES)
During the first phase, a national policy document for special and integrated education was
developed and validated. A diagnostic study on the educational status of children aged 0 to
15 years with disabilities in the regions of Kayes, Mopti and the district of Bamako was
undertaken with the support of UNICEF. In-service training on teaching children with
special needs was carried out for 297 school directors, 465 teachers and 70 educational
advisors, and around 20 integrated schools began functioning across the country.

  1.1.7. Strengthening of Medersa schools
During the first phase, the syllabus of medersas was harmonized with the official syllabus;
didactic documents written with Arabic characters in Fulfulde and in Bamanakan were
developed; 50 technical advisors were trained in learning monitoring and evaluation and
900 Arabic teachers in didactic disciplines; a specific program to introduce French as a
second language in selected classrooms was developed and implemented.

  1.1.8. School health and nutrition.
During the first phase, a school health policy document was developed; aspects of health
were identified and integrated into the curriculum of Education Centers for Development
(CED) and in grades 1 and 2; a pilot program for de-worming and micro-nutriment
supplementation in schools in the regions of Kayes, Segou and Mopti was developed;
training of trainers modules on the fight against HIV/AIDS were developed and validated.

  1.1.9. Reducing repetition and dropout
During the first phase, the repetition rate improved going from 20 percent in 2001 to 19.4
percent in 2004 for primary education. This rate remains high compared to the objective
set at 13 percent for the primary education. Catch-up courses were organized and were
supported by the creation of mothers of students associations in the initially targeted school
in districts of Kayes, Mopti and Gao, as well as Kita.




                                              48

Workshops to define strategies for the retention of girls in school were organized and home
economics modules were produced and disseminated.

  1.1.10. Non Formal Education
The Non Formal Education policy has been articulated and validated. Various trainings
have been identified for the Centers for Women's Learning (Centres d'Apprentissage
Féminin (CAFE)). During phase 1, guides and textbooks for grades 1, 2, and 3 were
produced in eleven national languages and given to Education Centers for Development
(CEDs); a set-up guide for CEDs was developed in eleven national languages; monitoring

guaranteed teaching of certain subjects that often lack specialists.

  Component II: Improving access to schooling.


  II.1 For basic education:

The objective for classroom building was achieved, and even surpassed. Compared to an
objective of 6000 classrooms, a total of 6336 were build, of which 1953 by ANICT, 489 by
the Ministry of Social Development. IDA financed the building of 1230 classrooms,
compared to the targeted 1400 built, and 105 rehabilitated. A significant number of
classrooms built by NGOs and associations fall outside the monitoring and evaluation
system in place.

  II.2. Promoting Girls' Education
A policy document was developed, but not yet adopted by the Government. ; Four (04)
female learning centers (Kalabancoro Commune V of the District of Bamako, Nara,
Bourem and Koutiala) were built and equipped.

  II.3. Reinforcing Capacities of Functional Literacy Centres (CAF) and Centres of
  Education for Development (CED)
A national policy document on literacy and non formal education was developed and
validated but has not yet been adopted by the government ; 960 educators were trained (of
which 300 new) and 300 CED opened in 2005.

  II.4. General Secondary, Technical and Professional Teaching :
Compared to 60 classrooms targeted (5 high schools), 175 classrooms were built including
3 new high schools and classrooms built as extension for existing high schools. Of 3 high
schools, IDA built two (2) (Mopti and Kalabancoro). For technical teaching and
professional training (ETEP), of a targeted 6 ETEP institutions (Ségou, Sévaré and
Bankass), two (2) out of four (4) were rehabilitated (the IFP of Dire with 14 classrooms, 2
workshops, one enclosure, and one director's quarters); the CFPAA of Gao with 6
classrooms built and equipped. Four (4) Centers of Female Learning (CAFE), out of 9

the Faculty of Juridical and Economic Sciences (FSJE) are under way : the restructuring of
the FSJE includes the creation of two distinct faculties, one for juridical and political
science and the other for the sciences of economics and management. Construction work
for these facilities is at 70 percent.

  Component III: Improving human, material and financial resource management.



                                              51

  III. 1. Deconcentration - decentralization of education

  III.1.1. Support for transfer of skills and means to territorial collectivities
During the first phase of ESEP, the decentralization unit (CADDE) was created. This unit
carried out a baseline study on decentralization and contributed to the decree n° 313/PRM
of 04 June 2002 transferring skills to territorial collectivities. (CT). On the demand of the
CADDE, school management committees (CGS) were put in place in 90 percent of basic
education schools, and a Direct Support to Improve School Performance (ADARS) was put
into place. In 2005, 1500 schools with CGS benefited from the direct support (ADARS) in
the poorest districts. A first financial disbursement from ADARS (World Bank financed),
FCFA 241 millions benefited to 2855 schools in 2007.

  III.1.2. Implementation of decentralization guidelines
An educational management information system (EMIS) was launched, which enabled the
production of yearbooks for 2004-2005 and 2005-2006. Trainings in micro-planning were
organized in all of the Teaching Academies and Centers of Pedagogy. Educational
Development Plans for 703 communes were done.

  III. 2. Implementation of institutional changes and creation of regional development
  plans.
In the course of ESEP I, an institutional design at the central and decentralized levels was
put in place following decentralized guidelines, thus creating new central structures
(CNECE, IES, CNOU, ILAB, CADDE) and the restructuring of regional education
directions (DRE) to become regional education academies (DAE) and of inspections of
basic education (IEF) to become Centers of Pedagogy increasing their numbers from 9 to
15 and 35 to 70 and the restructuring of certain central services (DAF, CPS, DNESG,
DNETP, CNE). In terms of planning, from 2001 to 2004 the mid-term expenditure
framework was developed and validated by the Ministry of Economics and Finance; the
training and set-up of planning teams at central and regional levels; adoption of a planning
system based on an Results-based management approach (GAR). Concerning the
information system, they put in place a computerized information database on basic and
Secondary education; applied the management of students in tertiary education; conducted
joint monitoring missions for the ESEP; produced semester and annual reports; trained
actors on strategic and functional planning tools.

  III. 3. Financial management

The total budget share going to education went from 26.6 percent to 30.06 percent ;
accounts for the ESEP were audited and certified every year ; acquisitions were made for :
407000 books for a total of 17,224 billion FCFA ; 1887 computers with accessories for a
total of 1,381 billion FCFA ; 399 air conditioners for a total of 294 million FCFA ; 160
vehicles for a total of 2,496 billions FCFA ; 232 motorcycles for a total of 221 million
FCFA and 262 photocopiers for a total of 1,023 billion FCFA. 456 staff were trained in
financial management, 323 in personnel management and 7 in selection of suppliers at
centralized and deconcentrated levels ; recommendations of the institutional analysis in
human resource management were adopted; the units "communication and financial
management" in the DAE and accounts at the CAP and economics office at secondary



                                               52

education institutions received administrative and financial personnel according to the
organizational structure.

 III. 4. Personnel Management

Teachers in community schools received 25,000 FCFA per month as a stipend; certain
existing community schools have become communal schools; all new teacher recruitment
was done at local and regional levels; from 2001 to 2004: 9547 non-teacher civil servants;
321 tertiary instructors; 7235 basic education contractual teachers, 864 CED advisors, 1096
secondary contractual teachers, 5709 community school teachers and 383 CIES educators
were recruited; in addition, the in-service training of 465 administrative staff was organized.

 F.       Performance of the Bank
The Bank played a key role in: (i) program preparation bringing its expertise in scaling-up
pilot projects and technical assistance in the development of guiding documents (action
plans, logical framework, etc.); (ii) organizing regular supervision missions with much-
appreciated expertise, and (iii) technical preparation and realization of joint annual reviews
of the program.
Moreover, the Bank made significant efforts to improve the quality of the dialogue
(political and technical) through task managers and resident missions. The effects have
been felt not only on the ways of achieving results but on the results themselves.

 G.       Lessons to be learned

· Coordination under the formal Memorandum of Understanding between the MoE and
  donors facilitated the implementation, the joint monitoring, the coherence of
  interventions, and synergy of financial resources.

· The harmonization of procedures of fundraising and management of financial resources,
  while creating the conditions to increase expenditures, would allow a significant increase
  in the achievement of program results.

· The choice to entrust program management to permanent structures facilitated capacity
  reinforcement of the MoE and program ownership by the various actors. It also created
  favorable conditions to assure the sustainability of interventions.

· Progress achieved in the implementation of decentralization, as part of the transfer of
  means and skills to deconcentrated structures, opens the opportunity to increase
  educational services and education quality namely through introducing performance
  contracts and accountability.

ADDITIONAL ANNEX 10: CONTRIBUTIONS OF INTAKE RATE AND
REPETITIONS IN GROSS ENROLMENT RATE AT PRIMARY SCHOOL

                                        1. INTRODUCTION

Progress in gross enrollments is not always the result of children's increasing access to the
education system. This could simply be linked to an education policy that encourages repetitions.
For a country that has not yet achieved universal enrolment in the first year of primary, it is
preferable that GER progress be strongly tied to the improvement of the Gross Intake Rate (GIR).
In a country where enrolment issues are already resolved, GER progress would depend on the
improvement of student retention rates in the education system while maintaining achievements
made in admissions that promote a decrease in repetitions in order to limit children dropping out
of school early on.

In Mali's case, where universal enrolment in the first cycle of primary is not yet a reality (with a
Gross Intake Rate of 74 percent in 2005-2006), we can examine GER progress as distinguishing
between the contribution of the Gross Intake Rate and repetitions.

      2. I ­ RELATIVE PROGRESSION OF GROSS ENROLMENT RATES (GER)
                         COMPARED TO GROSS INTAKE RATES (GIR)

In Mali, first year intake rate at primary school went from 60.5 percent in 2002-2003 to 74.2
percent in 2005-2006. The GER went from 67 percent to 75 percent in the same period. One can
see that during the period under consideration, GIR are below those of GER. In general, GER
being an average of access rates in the different grades of primary school, it should be lower than
the GIR.

The following graph, which represents the progression in GER compared to GIR, also shows that
there exists a positive correlation (0.84) between the two ratios. The majority of points is situated
above on the right at 45°. This means that the global capacity of the education system increases
more quickly than the number of children admitted into the system each year.

In Mali's case, where GIR is lower than GER, if there is not a sociological fact that explains this
situation, it would be the result of an educational policy that encourages repetitions. First of all,
considering the percentage of repetitions in the system, Mali reaches numbers which vary
between 11 percent and 28 percent.

1Here the GIR is calculated taking into account the first grade non-repeats, while as those in the statistical yearbook include the "new
admissions" variable, which is not low since the number of new first year students should be equal to the number of non-repeats. In
addition, the "new admissions" variable is collected according to student age, which also creates some uncertainty, resulting in the fact
that the yearbook's GIR are still very low and far from the GIR calculated here and even further still from the GER.




                                                                  57

The faster progression of GER in relation to GIR raises questions on the policy of
repetition that is at the root of the artificial inflation of the education system's capacity,
since students are repeating grades and thus filling the seats that should be allocated for
new admissions.

The following paragraph, that disaggregates GER of new admissions and repetitions in first year,
will shed some light on the question.

      3. II ­ DISAGGREGATING GER ACCORDING TO NEW ADMISSIONS AND
                                                    REPETITIONS

In disaggregating GER according to new admissions in first year primary school, repetitions and
non-repetitions in the system, we can see that at the beginning of the program, repetitions
contributed more to GER than new admissions did. This means that the policy of repetitions
artificially inflated children's access to primary. In 2003, the GER attributed to repetitions was
13.2 points while that attributed to new admissions reached only 12.2 points. In 2006, the GER
attributed to repetitions lowered slightly reaching 12.7 points, compared to that attributed to new
admissions, which improved slightly reaching 14 points. Up until 2005, the contribution of
repetitions to the progression of GER was much higher than that of new admissions, but in 2006,
this tendency was barely reversed in favor of new admissions.

In general, the contribution of repetitions to GER regresses during this period; however, it still
remains high (52% in 2002 and 47% in 2006) and the rate of change is still slow. In an efficient
education system, the contribution of repetitions to GER should be very low and close to zero.
This means that in Mali's case, efforts must be made to sustain increases in GER through real
improvement of children's access to the education system.

Comparing the current state of the Malian education system with one where repetitions do not
exist shows that GER are much lower than current levels. The GER increases artificially each
year by an average of 2 points due to the policy of repetitions that leads to the use of relatively
higher rates.

The progress in GER in Mali is not only the result of children's improved access to the education
system. In effect, Gross Intake Rate (GIR) is considerably lower than Gross Enrolment Rates
(GER). This leads to the observation that the education system increases its capacity through an
educational policy that encourages repetitions, which results in the fact that repetitions represent
around one-third of student numbers. The consequence of this situation is reduced numbers of
places attributed to new admissions in first grade. However, this phenomenon is regressing and
the gap between GIR and GER is decreasing progressively, making way for positive predictions
for the future.
