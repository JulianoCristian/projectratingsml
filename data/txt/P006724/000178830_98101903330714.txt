APPRAISAL 0? THE CAI '-TER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
SUIAUIRY AND CONCLUSIONS
This report appraises a water supply and sewerage project in Cali,
Colombia, for which a Bank loan of US$18.5 million equivalent is proposed.
Cali and other major urban centers in Colombia have grown very rapidly,
with the urban services becoming more and more inadequate. Water supply
and sewerage especially have lagged.
ii.       Although the problem of insufficient water supply and waste removal
exists in all Colombian urban centers, the attention of the Bank is first
being directed toward the larger cities as the places where given inputs of
resources would have the most impact. The Bank has made a US$14 million
loan for water supply in Bogota (Loan 536-CO), and the proposed loan is to
Cali, the third largest city of Colombia. The Colombian Government is
making a sector study that should establish a long-range program and priori-
ties for all urban services.
iii.      The project includes a new water supply treatment plant on the
Cauca River and water supply lines to areas to be developed in the near
future and to reinforce service in existing areas. Sewerage and drainage
facilities would be constructed to relieve existing areas, but primarily
to service the newly developing areas. A historical annual grow^th rate of
7.9% has brought Cali's present population to 920,000; it is expected to
exceed 1.5 million by 1978. Thus one major objective of the project is to
provide water supply and sewerage to enough land to supply future demand and
thus help keep land prices at moderate levels.
iv.       The financial requirement of the project totals USi37-5 million,
consisting of US$33.5 million estimated project cost and US$410 million
estimated interest on the Bank and local loans. The Bank loan would finance
about 49% of the total requirements, and consit of US$11 million foreign
exchange cost (including US$2 million for interest) and US$7.5 million of
local currency costs. A Government loan would finance 24h of total require -
ments and the remaining 27% would be financed from internally generated
funds through earnings and customers' contributions.
v.        All project elements would be subject to international competitive
bidding.
vi.       The borrower would be the Establecimiento Piblico Empresas
Municipales de Cali (Emcali), a municipal company set up to provide water
supply, sewerage, electrical power distribution, and telephone services.
Although each service is operated separately, with accounts also kept
separately, they share the same senior management and central administration.



-ii-
vii.      Emcali is a well run public utility on the whole, but some ad-
ministrative reforms would be required under the loan. Emcali would be
responsible for construction of the project, while consultants would do
the design and supervise construction.
viii.     The borrower's present financial position is fairly sound.  The
water supply/sewerage tariffs are already at a profitable level, but will
have to be increased to meet rising costs as well as debt service on the
project loans. Ilonthly increases in tariffs of Col$0.016/m3 (with an
assumed 8% annual rise in prices), are required for the construction period
(1970-1973), which would raise the rate of return on regularly revalued
assets from about 3% in 1969 to 5% by 1973. In 1977, four years after
project completion, the rate of return would be almost 8%. The Government
considers the increases in tariffs politically feasible. The incremental
rate of return of the project is 13.5%.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$18.5 million equi-
valent, for a term of 25 years including a 4-year grace period. The loan
would cover 50% of total costs, including some US$7.5 million of local
currency expenditures.



COLOIMIA
APPRAISAL OF THE CALI WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia has applied for a Bank loan to help
finance a water supply and sewerage project for the City of Cali (see
Map).
1.02      The water supply portion of the project includes a new intake
and a water treatment plant on the Cauca River, new supply and distribution
pipe lines and house connections, and improvements to some existing supply
lines and house connections. The sewerage portion includes a major sewage
interceptor and pumping station, trunk and secondary sewers, and drainage
canals for the removal of storm water.
1.03      The project's total cost is estimated at Col$670 million (US$33.5
million), plus interest and commitment charges during construction of about
Col$42 million (US$2.1 million) on the proposed Bank loan and Col$40 million
(US$1.9 million) on a national loan. The proposed Bank loan would be for
US$18.5 million, of which US$11 million would cover the estimated total
foreign exchange cost.
1.04      The borrower would be the Establecimiento Ptblico Empresas
Municipales de Cali (Emcali), an independent authority owned by the Cali
Municipality which provides water supply, sewerage, telephone, and electrical
distribution services in the metropolitan area.
1.05      The feasibility study for the project was prepared by an engineering
consortium composed of Hazen & Sawyer of New York City and Gonzales & Llano
of Cali. The portion of the study concerned with sewerage and drainage was
based largely on a master plan drawn up by the Gonzales firm and Buck,
Seifert & Jost of Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Their report also served
as a basis for a US-AID financed program of sewerage and drainage works now
nearing completion. Juan Marchant, a local urban architect consultant,
prepared the projections of Calits population growth and urban development;
Thomas Kehler, a North American consultant living in Colombia, prepared
the financial projections included in the feasibility study.
1.06      This appraisal is based on the feasibility study and on the
findings of a Bank mission composed of Mlessrs. C. A. Morse and J.L. Ropiteau,
who visited Cali in September 1969.

IIT. WATER SUPPLY 91D SEWERAGE SECTOR
A. Basic Data
2.01      Colombia has a population of about 21 million.  The Gross Domestic
Product in 1968 was about Col$95 billion, equivalent to an average per
capita income of about US$285. The population is growing at a rate of
approximately 3.3% per year, and emigration from rural to urban areas has
resulted in urban growth of 5% to 8% annually. The urban population
represents about 57% of the total, compared to less than 40% in 1950.
2.02      The Bank estimates that Colombia's real growth may reach 6.5% in
1969, c%ypared to the 6% target set by the Government and the 5.5% realized
in 1968-l . Recent increases in coffee prices could raise the economic
growfth rate even higher. Public revenues are expected to finance 15% higher
public investment in 1970 than in 1969, although further growth will require
an expanded tax base.
B. Urban Development
2.03      The Government of Colombia's policy for urban and regional deve-
lopment (set forth in its 1970-72 Development Plan) addresses itself to
the problem of the growing concentration of economic activity, wealth,
and population in the four principal cities of Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and
Barranquilla, which include nearly 60% of the urban population and account
for 75% of industrial employment and value-added in industry.
2.04      The Government's urban development policy is intended to preserve
some reasonable balance and proportion in the rates of growth of the
various cities.  For this purpose, the cities have been divided into cate-
gories, each of which is intended to have a specific role in balanced
development. The categories begin with the national metropolis, Bogota,
where the intent is to reduce demographic and social pressures. The
remedy in the short term is to promote growth in the next ranking cities,
the equilibrium metropolises of Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla, so as
to offer alternative centers to attract economic activity and internal
migration.
2.05     W4hile these equilibriuw  metropolises provide the most immediate
alternative growth centers, the Government is taking a longer view to
direct future economic growth and migration towards the next tier of
cities, called regional centers.  These cities have populations of 30,000
to 200,000 and serve as development poles for their respective regions,
Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Manizales, Pereira, and Palmira. The Government's
policy towards these regional centers is to establish small and medium
industry, integrate agriculture with industry, and to provide the necessary
public services.

-3-
C. Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
2.06      The rapid growth of the Colombian cities has resulted in inade-
quate urban services of all kinds. The inadequacy has been especially
marked in the supply of potable water and the removal of liquid wastes,
and is due to the inability of the municipalities to provide the large
capital requirements for such services because of the traditionally low
tariffs charged for them. Often these services have not earned even
their cash operating costs, much less generated funds for the very large
investments required.
2.07      The country's urban water supply and sewerage sector can be
divided into three categories, described below.
(a) Some 15 cities with populations above 50,000 have organized
their own municipal empresas (companies) to provide such public
services as water supply, sewerage, garbage disposal, electric
power distribution, telecommunications, marketplaces, and the
like. These cities have about 6 million of the total urban
population of some 7 million. The empresas are generally well
run. US-AID has financed a number of pre-investment studies
for these empresas for submission to external lending agencies.
(b) There are about 600 water supply systems in the smaller cities,
which are under the control of the national water supply agency,
Instituto Ilacional de Fomento Municipal (Insfopal), recently
transferred to the Ministry of Health. These systems are run
on a regional cooperative basis, with the cash profits of the
few profitable systems partially covering the cash deficits of
the majority and Government grants making up the difference.
Their administrative competence is usually poor. The major
source of funds for their investments is Government grants,
which have been about Col$100 million (US$6 million) annually
in recent years. The Inter-American Development Bank made two
loans to Insfopal for US$11 million in 1962. The program was
scheduled for 2 years but lasted 5-1/2 years; Insfopal took
insufficient care in project preparation and execution.
(c) The systems administered directly as municipal departments by
the smaller municipalities make up the third category. For
the most part these systems are poorly administered and their
services are grossly inadequate. Their number is unknown but
may amount to a few hundred. The tendency is for them to
affiliate with Insfopal's system in order to get government funds.
2.08      The rural water systems, defined as those in towns of less than
2,500 population, are the responsibility of the lMinistry of Public Health's
rural water supply program, although some affiliated with Insfopal before
the rural program was fully established. The Ministry has started a com-
bination loan/grant program which includes technical assistance; the
program's success cannot be assessed as yet.



-4-
2.09      With an initial assistance from Bank staff in 1968 and with their
continuing encouragement, Insfopal and the National Planning Department
are studying the national water supply and sewerage sector to assess needs,
identify problems, establish sector priorities, and prepare long-range
goals and a short-term program. The results of this sector study should
be available in late 1970.
2.10      The Colombian Government gives first priority to the municipal
empresas. Because of their size, managerial competence, and the concen-
tration of population, the empresas offer the best hope for achieving the
greatest benefits and institutional improvements relative to the other
categories of the sector. Also, this is the category where the major
obstacle to development of the sector -- low tariffs -- can be most easily
overcome.
2.11      The Bank made a loan of US$14 million to the Empresa de Acueducto
y Alcantarillado Bogota in June 1968 (536-Co). At that time, the tariffs
for Bogota were raised about 80% and the public utility is now able to
finance about 25% of its investment program from internally generated cash
after debt service. A second Bank loan for expansion of the water supply
service in Bogota is contemplated for fiscal year 1972 or 1973.
2.12      The proposed loan for the Cali project would form one of two
proposed Bank loans for water and sewerage in Colombia during financial
year 1970. The other would be for a sewerage and erosion control project
in Bucaramanga. By late 1970, another group of water supply and sewerage
projects in other Colombian cities are expected to be ready for appraisal.
As the sector program progresses, the Bank may be asked to consider
financing projects in the Insfopal system.
D. Cali
2.13      Cali is the third city of Colombia and the principal city and
the administrative capital of the Department of Valle. Along with the
other cities of the Department, Cali has experienced rapid growth; its
population estimated at 920,000 in 1970 has been increasing at nearly 8%
annually and by 1980 may reach 1.7 million (Annex 1). This is partly the
result of agricultural mechanization in the Department, which tended to
reduce the demand for labor; with only 1X of Colombia's land area, the
Department of Valle has nearly 25% of the country's stock of agricultural
machinery. Cali has also served as a focus of migration from neighboring
Departments where people have left the land on account of overpopulation
and sub-division of holdings into minifundia. Thus about 60% of Cali's
population were borne elsewhere, divided more or less equally between those
originating in the Department of Valle and those from other neighboring
regions.
2.14      Cali experienced rapid industrial growth in the 1950rs, but in
the mid-1960's industrial employment declined from nearly 30,000 in 1963
to 28,000 in 1967 and the rate of unemployment increased from 13% in 1964
to 15;% in 1967.  However, by 1969, substantial local expenditures on public
works had stimulated a revival of private investment and employment.



-5-
Principal indnstries in teriis of gross value of output are food and drink.
chemicals, printing, paper, textiles, clothing and electrical products.  At
least as many workers are employed in handicrafts as in mainufacturing
industries. Wage levels in both industry and agriculture are at a low ave-
rage level. It is of critical importance to the city t]bat the current
revival of private economic activity be maintained, and that public services
be developed to catch up with the demand which is substantially in excess
of supply.
2.15      The project would enable Encali to continue to provide adequate
water supply and sewerage services in this rapidly growing city. It would
extend services to four unserved areas populated by the lowest income groups,
in which sanitation is inadequate and health conditions inferior to Cali
as a whole because of the lack of basic sanitation services. WJith the large
rural immigration to Cali, it is particularly important that water supply
and sewerage services be made available to all parJts of the metropolitan
area in order to maintain Cali's present basic sanitation infrastructure.
2.16      With the project, the percentage of population served directly by
the water supply and sewerage systems in Cali should increase from less than
80% at present to 90% by 1973 (Annex 2). Thereafter, no substantial increase
in coverage can be expected.  Total average daily consufption for all
purposes is expected to increase from a restricted 230 liters per capita in
1969 to 325 in 1979. IWater lost or unaccounted for should decrease from
22% at present to 15% by the end of the project construction period. Annex
3 shows graphically the projected water use by major consumer category and
the toual projected use.



-6-
III.  THE BORROWER
A. Emcali
3.01      The proposed borrower, Establecimiento P.blico Empresas Municipales
de Cali (Emcali), is a fairly well managed and independent organization.
The services of power distribution, water supply, and telephone (each is
called an empresa) are operated individually and separate accounts are kept,
though they do share senior management and central administration (Annex 4).
This chapter on the borrower deals mainly with considerations common to all
services. Specific references to the water supply and sewerage service are
made in 3.11a (training), 3.13 and 3.14 (billing and collection), and
section D on Present Finances.
3.02      Emcali was created in 1961 by Acuerdo MTunicipal No. 50 as a de-
centralized public entity with its own assets and juridicial personality.
It succeeded the Empresas ilunicipales de Cali set up in 1931, which the
Municipality administered directly.
3.03      Encali provides the services of water supply and sewerage, power
distribution, and telephones in the Cali municipal area and, to a limited
extent, to the adjacent municipality of Yumbo. Recent financial statements
are shown in Annex 6. The relative contributions of the three services for
1968 are shown in the following table, Returns on revalued assets would be
less.
Return on
Sales    Profit   Book Value
Power Distribution           69%       69         20%
Telephones                   13'g      26%          7%
Water Supply and Sewerage      1        5%          1%
Total                   100%     100%           8%
3.04      Future investments in power and telephones would require rate
increases and some borrowings by these services (see paragraph 7.15).
3.05      Emcali is required to provide free electrical energy, telephone,
and water supply services to municipal offices as well as street lighting;
it also must pay 4% of its gross revenues to the municipality.  Emcali
does not pay any taxes.
3.06      Emcali's Board is composed of six members:  two elected by the
Iunicipal Council, one nominated by the Mayor, one nominated by the Board
of the Banco de la Republica in Cali, and two members who represent major
Colombian creditors. Following Colombian practice, membership on the Board
is arranged so as to maintain parity between the two traditional political
parties (Liberal and Conservative); for instance, the members representing
the banking community cannot be of the same party, and the General Manager
and the Mayor must belong to different parties.  All indications are that
partisan influence is kept to a minimum, that there is a general consensus
among the Board members, and that the Board has good rapport with the
Municipal Council.



-7-
3.07      The Board has the authority to appoint and dismiss employees and
the responsibility for making detailed operating decisions. This followfs
Colombian practice.  In practice, however, the day-to-day decisions are
made by the General Manager.
B. Management and Personnel
3.08      Management is good but there are some weaknesses in training and
management information.
3.09      The General Manager, who has served as Cali's M1ayor, came to Emcali
less than two years ago. A dynamic person, he seems to be exceptionally
competent. He has no deputy, although the head of the Financial Department
is "primus inter pares." The general management and the administrative
services apportion about 50% of their time for water supply and sewerage,
25% for power, and 25$ for telephone services.  Upon completion of the
project, the importance of the water supply and sewerage services will
increase in both sales and utilization of manpower.
3.10      The utility's relationship with its blue-collar employees is good,
and there have been no strikes since 1964. The employees belong to a union.
They have a social security program and a cooperative. Amongst the engineers
and other skilled staff, however, there is a high turnover which may be due
to low salaries and lack of opportunity for professional improvement and
advancement. Manpower distribution is shown in Annex 5.
3.11      Institutional reforms are necessary in the areas of manpower
training and management information systems. These reforms were agreed
upon during negotiations.
(a)  Number and quality of the water supply and sewerage technical
staff would be increased. The consultants recommend a program
for the next two years that would train 220 skilled workers each
year (such as plumbers, maintenance men, and plant operators) to
meet the needs in water supply and sewerage. This would provide
for the increase in trained staff needed to catch up with present
requirements (78), to meet normal expansion needs during the
construction period (60), and to replace losses through attrition
(82). Most of this training would be conducted within Emcali
because of its specialized nature. Emcali has promised to
prepare a training plan which would be reviewed with the Bank by
August 31, 1970.
(b)  Management information systems are inadequate.  For instance, the
statistical section is not producing needed and reliable data and,
as noted below, accounting information is not presented in a
useful fashion. Such data are available in the computer programs
and could be retrieved easily. A refomr of the statistical
section is underway.



-8-
C. Billing and Accounting
3.12      Billing and collections are adequate, whereas budgeting, accounting,
and reporting definitely need improvement.
3.13      A single bill is rendered for all Emcali services with the water
supply and sewerage charges shown separately. Payment is made at Emcali
or through local banks. Delays in payment are short since there is a sur-
charge after the 10th of the month until the 21st, when services are
suspended if a bill is not paid.
3.14      The bills include charges not related to consumption, such as the
monthly portion of new connection costs. The bills will also include an
improvement tax for certain customers in the future. This tax recovers the
cost of works from the customers benefiting from the works. A similar tax
is collected by a municipal office for streets paving and municipal lighting.
Emcali plans to use the improvement tax for the mains to be built in unserved
districts and is legally authorized to do so. At the time of negotiation
it was confirmed that there will be no conflict with the municipal office
over the collection of this tax.
3.15      Budgeting is more an academic exercise than a planning process.
It is done in September/October by the Financial Department with limited
participation by the operating units. Emcali's management is aware of the
necessity to improve budgeting. The solutions would be to advance the
budget cycle, to increase the operating units' participation in the elabo-
ration of the budget, and to enroll divisional management support by making
it accountable for the financial results of its division.  Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that budgeting would be improved.
3.16      Budget controls are non-existent.  There are no systematic com-
parisons of actual versus budgeted reults and, therefore, no analysis of
the variances. Management knows its performance compared with the original
budget only when accounts are closed at the end of the year. Assurances
were obtained during negotiaticns that budget controls would be instituted.
3.17      Reforms are likewise needed in accounting and are required under tho
Loan Agreement. The accounts are overly detailed.   There is a poor
record of customers' contribution and new investments. The accounting
staff are separated into a commercial accounting staff (sales, payments)
and a cost accounting staff. Accounts are separate for each service, with
a general fund for cash. Billing and accounting are done on computers and
the programmers are able to design programs for financial reporting and
budget control.  It was agreed during negotiations that all changes in
accounting necaesary to improva budget control, capital investment records,
and repcrtin; wrould be made.



-9-
3.18      The flows of information are inadequate.  There are no useful
internal reports from the divisions to the General Mianager. Emcali is
required by law to report yearly to the lMunicipal Council and give all
details of past operations. In practice, Emcali presents the Council with
the external auditor's report. Though the "Auditor Fiscal" should report
every three mronths to the Council, he has never done so. The improved
budget controls and accounting system, which would be necessary in any
event to satisfy the Bank's reporting requirements, should establish the
base for a useful reporting system.
3.19      Auditing is performed by three different groups.  The first two
are required by the statutes. There has been a commercial auditor since
1965, as required by an Inter-American Development Bank loan.
(a)  The "Auditor Fiscal," appointed by the Municipal Council, has a
staff of 22 who perform audit functions as required by Colombian
law, assist in budget preparation, verify the legality of
payments, and check inventory quantities. The function of
"Auditor Fiscal" is found in all Colombian entities.
(b)  The "Revisor Interno," or internal auditor, has a staff of 16
and is statutorily responsible for improvement of systems and
information flows within Emcali. Reform of this group was
agreed upon durin- negotiaticns.
(c)  The external auditor? Peat, Marwick & Mitchell, has been per-
forming audits since 1968 and has contracts for 1969 and 1970.
This firm is acceptable to the Bank. The continued employment
of an independent outside auditor was agreed upon during
negotiations.
D. Present Finances
3.20      As mentioned in paragraph 3.03, water supply and sewerage is the
smaller service in terms of sales and profits and has the lowest return
on assets. In 1968 the combined water supply and sewerage operations
(see Annex 7) showed profits after depreciation of Col$4 million on sales
of Col$41 million   A substantial tariff increase late in 1968 is expected
to result in 1969 income before interest of Col$12 million on sales of
Col$68 million. The return on revalued net fixed assets would increase
from less than l1/o in 1968 to about 3C4 in 1969.
3.21      The combined tariffs for water supply and sewerage average about
Col$1.12/m3 (US$0.24/1,000 gallons), sewerage being 60% of the water bill.
The last tariff increase occurred on October 1, 1968, when the tariffs were
more than doubled.  This increase, the first since 1965, was followed by a
power tariff increase of about 20% on Nlovember 1, 1968.  These increases
coincided with higher bus fares and caused strong public resentment. The
tariff increases proposed by the Borrower, Dncali,   (Col$0.016/m3 per month
during construction) are considered feasible because they are smaller and
would be applied on a monthly basis.



-10-
3.22      Until 1968, investments in water and sewerage were limited by a
lack of resources. Less than half the sewerage works programmed for 1966-
1968 were realized. Most of the investments made were financed with
internally generated funds, primarily transfers of profits from the power
service. Power transferred to the other services Col$11 million in 1967
and Col$3Bmillion in 1968; through 1968, cLumulative transfers from power
totaled Col$55 million. These transfers have no specific terms and do not
carry any interest; they cannot be repaid during the construction period
of the proposed project as all the water supply and sewerage funds will be
needed to finance the project.
3.23      The financial structure of the water supply and sewerage division
and of Emeali overall is good. At December 1968 outstanding long-term debts
for water supply and sewerage amounted to Col$79 million compared with total
equity of Col$185 million. Total equity included assets at original book
value, earned surplus, and customers' contribution. With the revaluation
of the assets (see paragraph 7.08 below), total equity would increase to
about Col$300 million at the end of 1968. Emcali total debt amounted to
Col$176 million as of December 1968, compared with Ool'$469 million of
equity before revaluation (a 25/75 ratio).
3.24      The water supply and sewerage current position must be looked at
as part of the whole Emcali position because cash is common for all services.
Although at December 31, 1968 Encali current ratio was 2 to 1, most of the
current assets were in inventory and the utility had difficulty paying its
current bills on time.  The largest account payable (to Central Hidroelectrica
del Rio Anchicaya Ltda. for slightly over 3 months' power supply) amounted
to Col$25 million; this has since been reduced to Col$10 million. Total
water supply and sewerage accounts receivable including official accounts
improved to 76 days in 1969 from 116 days in 1968.
3.25      Annex 8 shows the structure of the water supply tariff, which is
complicated by an excessive number of property classifications. Moreover,
there are high minimums which have the twofold disadvantage of encouraging
waste and penalizing the small consumer. Emcali should simplify the tariff
structure, perhaps by adopting the pattern achieved in Bogota and reducing
the customersI categories from 12 to 5. Tariff simplication will be
studied by Emcali and kept under review by the Bank.



-11-
IV. EXISTIIUG WATER SUPPLY AM1D SEWERAGE FACILITIES
A. Water Supply
4.01      Cali is served by two water treatment plants (see Map).  The San
Antonio plant on the Cali River can produce 1.3 m3/sec and the Rio Cauca
plant on the Cauca River 1.2 m3/sec. Thus the two plants can meet the
estimated present average demand of 2.4 m3/sec, but not the maximum daily
demand (estimated to be 1.25 times average demand) of 3 m3/sec. An addition
to the Rio Cauca plant of 1.5 m3/sec is expected to go into operation early
in 1970 and permit the system to meet t2ae maximum daily demand until 1972.
The proposed project would start producing in 1973.
4.02      There are two distribution networks:  the high level service net-
work fed by the San Antonio plant, and the low-level service network fed by
the Rio Cauca plant (see Map). There are some interconnections between the
two and the high-level service area can feed the low-level service area to
a limited extent. Total storage capacity in these distribution networks is
100,000 m3, which is sufficient. There are four isolated areas supplied
by booster pumping stations.
4.03      Seventy-seven percent of Cali's estimated population of 920,000 are
served by house connections. Most of the 200,000 people with no house
connections live in two low-priced real estate developments, El Rodeo and
Uni6n de Vivienda Popular, and in two illegally invaded areas, Siloe and
Terron Colorado; the project would provide service to these four areas.
With the exception of these instances, Cali has been successful in pre-
venting the development of land areas which have no water supply and
sewerage. One of the objectives of the project is to provide water supply
and sewerage services to enough areas so that the supply of land for housing
will be sufficient to meet the demand for land with services and thus help
keep land prices moderate.
4.04      At the end of June 1969, there were 85,360 connections, of which
all but 3,420 had meters. Some 20%a of the rmeters, however, were not
operative. At that time there were also 5,960 public standpipes in service,
a large increase from the 3,960 at the beginning of the year. lHlost of them
will be removed when proper service can be extended to all areas.
4.05      Operation of the water supply system in Cali is generally good,
but there are some deficient areas which the management has recognized and
begun to improve. These include an inadequate meter repair and mairntenance
program, poor record-keeping for the distribution system and valves, and
little routine preventive maintenance. A study of the use of plastic pipe
to replace expensive copper pipe or unsatisfactory galvanized steel pipe
in house connections is being made. A leak detection program needs to be
reinstated.  It wTas agreed during negotiations that revised worlc progrEms
for these areas would be prepared and reviewed with the Bank by August 31,
1970.



-12-
4.06      The chemical and bacteriological quality of the water supplied
to the consuner is good. However, the Cauca River is heavily polluted by
sewage and pre-chlorination of its water is needed, and will be undertaken
when the addition to the Rio Cauca plant is finished.  The poUution will
be substantially reduced by the proposed sewerage works, which will inter-
cept most of the wastes entering the river and carry them below the water
supply intakes. Water distribution pressure falls as low as 0.1 kg/nm2 in
some of the small diameter pipes in the low-level service network, but
there always seems to be some positive pressure in the lines. With the
completion of the present treatment plant addition, pressure should improve
but an adequate level will only be reached after the proposed project is
finished.
B. Sewerage and Drainage
4.07      Almost everyone in Cali who has a water connection has a sewerage
connection, which means that 77% of the total population is served by the
sewerage system.  At the end of June 1969, there were 8h,580 sewerage
connections. Some three-fourths of the area served has combined sewers
(for both sanitary wastes and surface run-off), and 1M, has separate sewers
(for sanitary wastes, with run-off removed separately). Emcali has pro-
hibited the construction of combined sewers since 1962.
4.08      A program of separate sewers and drainage works amounting to
ColhO140 million is expected to be completed by mid-1970. These works are
financed by a US-AID loan of US$3.7 million equivalent and a local loan of
Col$ZO million from the Instituto de Fomento Industrial. As in the case
of the project under appraisal, the works being constructed provide
essentially main se-wer collectors and drainage canals.
h.09      Secondary sewers are either built by developers and paid for by
property owners in the purchase price of the lots or built by the munici-
pality and paid for by householders through special assessments. Each
householder pays for his sewerage house connection.
4.10      The operation of the sewerage system suffers from not having
enough personnel and equipment. The US-AID assisted program is supplying
some needed equipment to alleviate the situation.  A program to improve
the records of existing sewers and drains and to establish routine pre-
ventive maintenance will be reviewed by August 31, 1970, as for water
supply (see paragraph 4.05).
4.11       The maintenance of large drainage canals and operation of a storm-
water pumping station for the Cali metropolitan area have been the responsi-
bilities of the Cauca Valley Corporation, a regional development agency.
Some of these facilities will have to be enlarged by 1985.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Water Supply and Sewerage Program, 1970-1982
5.01      The total water supply, sewerage, and drainage program includes
investments to be made by Emcali and investments by urban developers to
meet the expected needs of the Cali urban area. The program was prepared
jointly by the consultants and Emcali staff and is summarized below. The
proposed project includes the investments by Emcali in the years 1970-1973.

Total    671            207               730              880
B.  Project Description - Water Supply
5.02      The water supply portion of the project, which would cost Col$468
million, consists of treatment facilities on the Cauca River with an initial
capacity of 3m3/sec and an eventual capacity of 9 m3/sec. The project
would include booster pumping stations and storage tanks, as well as ex-
tensive water supply mains and new house connections. Distribution lines
and house connections would be constructed in the four low-income districts
of  El Rodeo, Uni6n de Vivienda Popular, Siloe, and Terron Colorado, none
of which have services. Although these last-named works were estimated for
a conventional water distribution system and metered house connections,
the use of devices to control use and other cheaper methods of providing
satisfactory service for the immediate future (such as the use of plastic
pipe) will be studied before final design. In Annex 9 is a more detailed
description of the project and its estimated costs.
5.03      The Cauca River water is of excellent chemical quality and is
easy to treat. The minimum flow is 40 m3/sec, and 90% of the time it is
more than 100 m3/sec. Its principal drawback - excessive pollution - will
be substantially reduced with present US-AID financed sewerage construction
and the construction under the project of a major sewage collector and the
Aguablanca pumping station, which will intercept and discharge wastes
downstream of the plant intalkes.



-14-
5.04      In order to economize pipe sizes and storage requirements, peak
hour demand minimum pressure would be allowed to fall to 1 kg/cm2 ( a
moderately low level). There is enough storage capacity for the maximum
day plus 6 hours of reserve. With the increased water consumption, present
reserves would be equivalent to about 3 hours by 1985, which would be
sufficient if the present unreliable power supply is improved - as it is
projected to be. Therefore only local increases in storage capacity are
proposed in the project.
5.05      Additional distribution lines amounting to Col$96 million for
new real estate developments will be constructed by the urban developers,
with the cost included in the price of the lot. Thus, these works are not
included in the project for Bank financing, though they are part of the
total water supply program.
5.06      A number of alternative water sources were considered.  The
principal alternative was the Ponce River, south of the city, which would
have been a gravity supply source but would have had to be supplemented
by pumping from the Cauca River. The extra capital investment in trans-
mission would be greater than the savings in pumping, due to the distance
to the consuming center.  However, when the city grows toward the south,
as is expected, this source may become attractive. Further development
of existing sources will be studied, but the increments in supply are
expected to be small. These include a dam on the Cali River to provide
an extra 0.7 m3/sec. to the San Antonio Plant and the reinstatement of
wells (they yield 0.2 m3/sec. each) in the urban area.
C. Project Description - Sewerage and Drainage
5.07      The sewerage project (including drainage) provides for the con-
struction of an interceptor sewer, a pumping station, a large number of
secondary sewers, and some house connections. No sewage treatment plant
is needed at present. The sewerage project is expected to cost Col$160
million.
5.08      As in the water supply project, the four unserved districts
would be provided with lateral sewers and house connections. Other
lateral sewers and house connections to be built during the period would
amount to Col$62 million; as in the case of the water distribution system
in new developments, this investment would be made by developers and
recovered in lot sales and would not be a charge to Emcali.
5.09      The drainage portion (ool$h3 million) would consist primarily
of canals. In addition, storm drains (Col$49 million) would be built by
private real estate developers.

5.11      The project cost estimates were prepared by the consultants.  The
unit costs seem generally reliable; much of the detailed design is already
done and present works provide an excellent basis. The estimates for the
distribution lines and lateral sewers were based on a per hectare average
and, although conservatively high, they do contain a larger element of
uncertainty.
5.12      The consultants provided a total of 21% for contingencies and
engineering.  The Bank increased this to 25% for technical contingencies
and 8% for engineering and contract administration and consultants. Costs
were based on 1969 prices and the Bank has assumed a factor for price
contingencies of 8% annually for local costs and 3% for foreign costs
through the construction period, i.e., through 1973.  The December 31, 1968
Economic Report on Colombia had estimated an 8% inflation rate for 1969,
decreasing to 5% by 1972, but these have since been revised upward because
of the boom in coffee prices.



-16-
E. Loan Amount
5.13      A loan amount of US$18.5 million is proposed, equivalent to about
49% of the project's financial requirements totaling US$37.5 million, after
adding to the estimated cost of works of US$33.5 million, estimated interest
and other financial charges payable during construction on the proposed
Bank and National loans of US$4.0 million.
5.14      The proposed loan amount would cover the following:
(a)  US$8.9 million, the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project,
of which half would be for the cost of direct imports and half
for the foreign exchange component of local materials and equip-
ment and of civil works;
(b)  US$2.1 million, estimated interest and commitment charges on the
Bark loan during construction; and
(c) US$7.5 million of local currency expenditures.
F. Disbursement
5.15      The Bank loan would be disbursed against the CIF cost of all direct
imports and in addition a percentage (41%) of all local procurement and
civil works to reach 50% of all contracts. If the project cost is greater
than estimated, Emcali would be expected to meet the overrun and the Colom-
bian Government would be asked to guarantee that funds be provided in case
Emcali could not do so. In the event the project costs are less than
estimated, the Bank should be willing to finance 50% of the cost of related
works now proposed for beyond 1973, either by advancing them or extending
the closing date of the loan.
G. Project Construction
5.16      The construction period for the project would run from 1970 through
1973. The works programs are shown in Annex 11. Consultants would be
required for supervision of construction. Emcali is establishing a new
office under the General Manager to plan the preparation and control the
implementation of this and other Emcali projects.
5.17      Emcali engaged Hazen and Sawyer of New York and Gonzales & Llano
of Cali to prepare the feasibility study and then to undertake the detailed
design work under contracts financed by the Colombian Government in the
form of loans from Fondo Nacional de Proyectos de Desarrallo (Fonade).
The consultants have completed the feasibility study and are now starting
the design.
H. Procurement
5.18      All contracts would be bid on an international competitive basis.
It is expected that local firms will win all civil works contracts because
the works are within the technical and financial capacity of local con-
tractors who have a natural competitive advantage.



-17-
5.ig      Foreign bidders would supply treatment plant equipment, major
valves and accessories and water meters. Experience in the Bogota water
supply project has shown that local pipe manufacturers are easily compe-
titive but local meter manufacturers are not, either in price or quality.



-18-
VI. JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The project is the least cost alternative to provide the planned
additional water supply and sewerage services to Cali. A discount rate
of 12% was used in project selection and design. The selected water
supply source was the most desirable at discount rates above 6%.
6.02      Water supply to the smaller and newer industries and provision
of adequate fire protection should stimulate development in the two areas
planned for this purpose, the one between Cali and Yumbo and the Aguablanca
area.
6.03      The incremental rate of return for the project, including sewerage
and drainage works, as measured by total water supply and sewerage sales
is 13.5%. The calculation is shown in Annex 12. The benefits are
measured by the additional quantities of water provided, valued at the
proposed combined water supply and sewerage tariff after deducting
incremental operating costs due to the project. The costs are those of
building the project and the post-construction period investments
necessary to utilize it fully.
6.o4      Not all of the benefits are included in this type of measurement,
which relies on the willingness to pay as a measure of the value of the
benefits. Health benefits, both those directly accruing to the consumers
and indirectly accruing through a general improvement in the health of the
whole ccmmunity, are examples of benefits which may be understated or
completely omitted by this analysis.
6.05     With tariff increases of Col$ 0.016/m3 a month during construction,
a 5% rate of return on water supply and sewerage together should be obtained
by 1973, increasing to 9% by 1978.
6.o6      Additionally, although Encali is already a relatively well run
public utility, operational improvements such as staff training, improved
budgeting, and better maintenance will result from the project. Further-
more, Emcali occupies a favorable position for influencing the operating
practices of other municipal empresas in the Cauca Valley through its
training and technical assistance.

VII. FUJTURE FINANCF_
A. Financing Plan
7.01      The water supply and sewerage forecast of sources and applications
of funds is attached as Annex 14. The Financing Plan for the years of the
project implementation, 1970-1973, is summarized below:

Total Sources of Funds              791.4       39.47        100
7.02      Because part of the loan would be for financing local expendi-
tures, the exchange rate used in the financing plan for the construction
period to convert the proposed loan to Col$ was adjusted to reflect the
following assumptions on price increases duiring the construction period
(1970-1973):  8% annually for local costs and 3% for foreign costs.  The
atverage rate of US$1.00 = Col$ 17.33 for 1969 was thus increased by 5%
annuaIly through 1973. Financial forecasts beyond 1973 are shown at
constant 1973 prices.
7.03      The funds required would be made available as follo-ws:
(a)  The Bank loan would be US$ 18.5 million at an assumed
interest of 7%' plus a commitment fee of 0.755 and
amortization over 21 years after a 4-year grace period;



-20-
(b) The national loan would be Col$ 180 million at 14%, repaid
in equal semi-annual payments over 11 years after a 4-year
grace period; and
(c) Earnings and customers' contribution of Elcalits water
supply and sewerage division.
7.04      During the same period urban developers will build Col$ 207
million of vworks that they  nill turn over to Emcali upon completion.
B. Water Supply and Sewerage Tariffs
7.05      To meet the proposed financing plan, it was agreed during
negotiations that tariffs wAll be increased by Col$ 0.016/m3 per month,
beginning June 1, 1970, to reach Col$ 1.73/m3 (US$0.31/1,000 US gal.)
in 1973. As an 8% cost inflation rate is assumed, the real increase in
tariffs would amount to less than 4% a year at constant prices.  Fmcali
and the National Planning Department agreed to the proposed level of
tariff increases. If the tariffs were kept at 1968 level, there would be
a Col$ 45 million deficit in the financing plan.
7.06      In order to assure that the projected annual tariff increases
through 1973 are sufficient to achieve the carnings objectives, a rate of
return convenant was introduced with the following minimum requirements:
Rate of Return
on Revalued
Year              Net Fixed Assets
1970                    2.5%
1971                    3.5%
1972                    4.0%
1973                    h.5%
1974                    5.0%
1975                    5.5%
1976                    6.o%
1977                    7.5%
1973                    8.0%
7.07      The tariff levels and the valuation of the assets would be
reviewed each semester in order to make needed adjustments by the end of
the semester.
7.08      The rate of return would be calculated taking income before
interest as a percentage of revalued net fixed assets (excluding assets
financed by customers' and urban developers' contributions). Assets
would be revalued by using the cost of living index for workcers developed
by the Departamento Administrativo Nlacional de Estadistica (DANE) for the
City of Cali, and using as a base the value of the fixed assets as of
Decembar 1968 as determined by the ccasultants in their feasibility study-
,nd used for the attached projections (see paragraph 15, Annex !6).



-21-
7.09      As the needed water supply and sewerage tariff increases must
be authorized by the National Tariff Board of the National Planning
Department, Emcali can only promise to apply for the necessary tariff
increases and to implement them to the extent the Board allows. The
Government has therefore undertaken to have the Board or any successor
agency promptly approve the applications within the terms set forth in
the Loan Agreement.
C. Future Finances
7.10      If the financing plan is realized, the future finances of the
water supply and sewerage division should be sound. The estimated income
and expense statements are presented in Annex 13 and summarized below.
The assumptions in the financial projections are presented in Annex 16.
The projected operating expenses include the cost of operational improve-
ments discussed in Chapters III and IV.

7.11      The cash flow projections in Annex 14, and summarized in para-
graph 7.01, show a cash surplus of Col$10.1 million by 1973, or 1-1/2%
of project works. It was assumed for the purpose of the financial pro-
jections that the Bank loan would be disbursed as 50% of works - and
the national loan as needed to meet the total cash requirements.
7.12      The construction of the project will constitute a considerable
financial burden on Emali and any expansion beyond its scope should
therefore be carefully watched. It was therefore agreed during negotiations
that Emcali would not borrow for water supply or sewerage during the cons-
truction period, in addition to the project loans, unless the Bank otherwise
agrees. Borrowings for power and telephones during construction period
would be limited so that earnings would cover maximum future debt service
1.5 times for each service. After the project is completed the 1.5 debt
service test wauld be applied to, all the services,



-22-
7.13      Ehcali has a central bank account and does not earmark internally
generated funds from the different divisions.  The Financing Plan assumes
that cash generated by the water supply and sewerage services would be
reinvested in the project, and that there wfould not be any repayments of
past transfers from the power division to the water supply and sewerage
division (Col$ 55 million at the end of 1968). It was agreed during
negotiations that funds generated by water supply and sewerage would be
used only for the project and any reimbursement of inter-company transfers
would be postponed until after project completion.
7.14      Balance Sheet projections are shown in Annex 15 and abstracted
below.  Debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreases from 37%
in 1973 to 25% in 197?.

7.15      With respect to its electric power service, Emcali purchases
all of its requirements from Central Hidroelectrica del Rio Anchicaya
(CHIDRAL), a local bulk supplier in w^Jhich Encali has an equity interest.
CHIDRAL, a Bank borrower under a number of power loans, is now experiencing
financial difficulties. It will be required to provide funds toward a
power project expected to be financed by a Bank loan to Interconnexion
S.A.  To do this, as well as meet its other financial commitments, a
tariff increase by CHIDRAL is foreseen that probably would require a
parallel increase by Ehcali. There has been difficulty in the past in
coordinating such electrical tariff increases and Emcali has not always
been prompt in paying its bills to CHIDRAL. Moreover, the power
distribution and telephone divisions have investment programs of Col$ 150
million and Col$ 200 million respectively in the 1970-75 period. To
ensure that sufficient funds are generated to meet these investment
requirements and pay its bills promptly to the power company, it wras egreed
during negotiations that the power and telephone divisions wfould earn at
least a 7% return on revalued net fixed assets.



-23-
D. Sensitivity
7.16      The sensitivity analysis, presented in Annex 17, shows that
cash generation is most sensitive to changes in project costs. An
increase of 10% in the anticipated costs of the project wiould result in
a cash deficit of Col$ 57 million. The likelihood of such an occurrence
is low given the contingencies included in the project cost estimates
and the quality of the cost estimates themselves.

VIII. RECOA=ATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  Water supply and sewerage tariffs would be raised on a
monthly basis to levels necessary to meet specified rates
of return on revalued net assets (paragraphs 7.05-7.07);
(b)  Borrowing limits would be established for all three
services (power, telephone and water supply and sewerage)
(paragraph 7.12);
(c)  Improvements would be implemented in various administrative
and technical functions (paragraphs 3.11, 3.15-3.17, 3.19(b),
4.05 and 4.10); and
(d) Power and telephone tariffs would be maintained at levels
necessary to meet a rate of return of 7% on revalued net
assets (paragraph 7.15).
8.02      The Government agreed to provide Col$ 180 million as a 14%
interest bearing loan to be repaid over 15 years (paragraph 7.03(b)).
8.03      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of us$ 18.5
million for a term of 25 years, including a 4-year grace period.

Comment on Past Financial Statements
Sales
1.      Sales revenues include only revenues from services billed.
Since 1967 customers' contributions do not figure in the income
statements.
2.      Emcali must render free services to the Municipality.   Those
services (Col $ 8.3 million in 1968) are carried both in revenues
and in costs.
Direct Costs
3.      Inter-company costs are charged at the normal customerstrate.
For instance, cost of power used by water services is charged at the
industrial customers' rate.   Maintenance and repair costs may decrease
in the future as large replacements of obsolete or worn-out assets will
be capitalized.
Indirect Costs
,'.     Costs of administration are pro-rated to the operating services
according to a time study made in 1965.   The allocation formula is:
WTater      -  35.0%
Sewerage    -  12.0%
Power       -  27.7%
Telephones - 25.3%
Contribution to Municipality includes costs of free services to
Municipality and a 4% tax on sales revenues and customers' contribution
excluding extension of distribution system and connections.   Proceeds
from this tax were formerly allocated to a street improvement fund but
since 1968 these are used to finance an administrative building for the
Municipality.
Depreciation
5.      Depreciation is straight line, with a salvage value of 10%.
Fixed Assets
6.      Fixed assets are s`-ated at tblf orig'.nal cost.  Additions are; enterede
at cost with related indirect costs being capitalized.   Scme adjust-ments

took place in 1959, 1961 and 1963 for telephones, power and market
place.   After the 1966 Col $ devaluation of 75%, there was also a 1967
upward adjustment of Col $ 24 million on assets financed externally.
The 1968 decreases in land and buildings were due to the transfer of
market places and slaughter houses to another Municipal Empresa, Emsirva.
Portfolio
7.      Portfolio consists of 17.8% equity in Central Hidroelectrica del
Rio Anchicaya.   Dividends are paid in shares and Emeali received
Col $ 1.4 million worth of shares in 1967, and Coy1 1.5 million in 1968.
Reserve for Bad Debts
8.      Reserve for bad debts is based on actual experience and calculated

COLOIMBIA
CALI WATER SUPPLY AND SEWEWAGE PROJECT
Project Description
1.        This section describes in brief detail the water supply, sewer-
age, and drainage elements of the project. The description follows the
list of elements and their costs shown in pages 6 and 7 of this Annex.
Water Treatment Plant
2.        The treatment plant design criteria are primarily based on a
November l964 report of Hazen and Sawyer, modified by later information
obtained in other places, particularly Washington D.C., Greensboro N.C.,
Dansville, Va., and Rio de Janeiro. The experiences in Barranquilla and
Medellin were also taken into account, especially in relation with the
design and operation of solids contact units.
3.        A plant with solids contact units and high rate filters has been
chosen because construction and operation costs are lower than for a con-
ventional plant (see figure 1 attached to this Annex). The ultimate capa-
city of the Puerto Mallarino plant would be 18 m3/sec, composed of two sub-
plants of 9 m3/sec, of which a first stage would be built in this project
with a nominal capacity of 3 m3/sec. The design permits an overload of 33%
to have a reserve for delays in future expansion or for emergencies inother
plants. This is the reason the intake lagoon and other elements have a capa-
city of 4 m3/sec, or some multiple thereof, while the nominal capacity of
the treatment plant elements is 3 m3/sec.
t.        The intake would be constructed on the left bank of the Rio Cauca
upstream of the present intake. It would have an initial capacity of 12 m3/sec
and the first stage would provide one siphon for 4 m3/sec of an eventual three
siphons. The siphon would discharge into a structure at the end of the
lagoon which would house the vacuum equipment and carry the raw water to the
deepest part of the lagoon.
5.        A lagoon of 115 m x 45 m would be excavated.  It would act as a
combination grit chamber and preliminary sedimentation with a minimum deten-
tion period of 10 minutes. The sludge would be removed by a dredge and dis-
charged downstream of the existing Rio Cauca plant intake.
6.        A raw wrater pumping station wzould be constructed in the lagoon
with mechanical screens, low lift vertical pumps, and operating controls.
The station would have an eventual capacity of 12 m3/sec but the initial
mechanical equipment would have a capacity of 4 m3/sec. The pumps would
discharge into one 1500 mm raw water line.



ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 8 pag3s
7.        Chemicals would be mixed by a rapid mixer placed in the raw wTater
line for each two solids contact unit. After mixing, the water would be
divided and metered for each solids contact unit. If necessary, prechlori-
nation would be done in the suction well of the raw water pumping station.
8.        The solids contact units (for flocculation and settling) would
be of the sludge recirculation type and not the sludge blanket type used
in the existing Rio Cauca plant. Such units should out-perform and be
cheaper to build than conventional units. The sludge recirculation types
are more stable and do not require the supplementary chemical treatment,
such as, polyelectrolytes, activated silica, and/or the addition of clay,
required by the sludge blanket type in order for it to perform as well as
the recirculation type. Each solids contact uniQ would be 50 m in diameter
and 6.5 m high, with a nominal capacity of 1.5 m'/sec based on a settling
velocity of 6 cm/min. The effluent would be delivered to the filters by
elevated canals.
9.        The filters would be of a new patented design without the customary
valves and filter galleries and are expected to be much cheaper than conven-
tional rapid sand filters. They would be controlled by influent siphons
and backwash siphons which would be put into operation by a vacuum and
broken by ventilating. Each of the four filters (with a capacity of
0.75 m3/sec) would be composed of four cells. The influent water would
enter by a central canal and be divided by the four siphons. When a filter
is backwashed its inflow siphon would be interrupted and its raw water flow
delivered to the other three cells. An auxiliary wash device will be in-
stalled 5 cm above the surface of the sand, where mud balls are most likely to
form and where the energy of the wash water would be absorbed by the ex-
panding sand bed (to reduce loss of anthracite). There would be no wash
water canals. The filters will be of a mixed media of 45 cms of anthracite
coal with an effective size of 1.2 mm and 30 cms of sand with an effective
size of 0.45 mm, supported by 30 cm of graded gravel over Leopold bottoms
(produced under license in Bogota).
10.       The patent owner of the filter, Infilco of the United States,
generally supplies the central nucleus with the siphons, canals, filter
bottoms, vacuum system, and a central automatic control system. However,
the consultants propose to use manual controls and a single central vacuum
system, purchasing only the patent use.
ll.       A canal large enough for 12 m3/sec would carry the filtered water
to the filtered water storage tank under the high pressure pumping station.
Lime for corrosion control would be added in this canal and the required
agitator installed in it.
12.       The filtered water pumping station would be located over the
filter watered reservoir and would have four vertical pumps of 1 m3/sec
each. The reservoir would have a capacity of 2500 m3.



ANNEX 9

13.        Although both the raw pumps and filtered water pumps were to be
housed inside and air conditioned, it was agreed they could be left in the
open, thus reducing structures and eliminating air conditioned equipment.
The filters will also be left in the open. Appropriate deductions have
been made in these three elements.
14.        The chemical house will contain offices, laboratory, shops, stores,
and the equipment to store and handle the chemicals on one floor to fzacilitate
handling of the chemicalse As the chemicals would be added in solution,
they would be prepared in the basement and pumped to the points of application.
15.        Sewerage and miscellaneous includes removal of sludge from the solids
contact units and of wash water from the filters to a receiving tank under
the chemical house. Vertical pumps would discharge these wastes through
a pipe into the Rio Cauca below the intake of the existing plant, the sludge
from the lagoon would be discharged through tPB same pipe by the dredge.
16.        Electrical equipment provides for power lines, transformers, and
the like for power and lighting.
Water Distribution Facilities
17.        Two booster pumping stations wJould be required to take the water
from the treatment plant to the two most important zones of the high service
area, San Antonio and Ciudad Jardin, with capacities of 300 1/sec and 200 1/sec
respectively.
18.        One storage tank of 15,000 m3 would be located in Napoles and
another in La Campina. They would be constructed of pretensioned concrete.
19.        The major transmission mains have been designed to meet the
requirements of the maximum day of 1985. The unit costs include 25% for
valves and fittings and allow 40% for contractor's supervision, profit, and
administration. The supply mains to existing service areas are to correct
existing deficiencies and provide for anticipated increase in consumption
in those areas. The transmission mains to the new areas include inhabited
areas without service, areas presently vacant, and capacity for future
growth of consumption.
20.        Large supply lines are larger than 12 inches in diameter (12 inches
and below are included as secondary distribution lines and provided by cus-
tomers' contributions) but smaller than the main supply lines. The require-
ments were based on a 1961 study by Pitometer Associates which was updated
and projected and the estimated quantities taken off a curve. 30% was added
to the cost for valves and fittings. The reinforcement of existing lines
was also based on the Pitometer Associates study.

21.        The costs of the distribution system of Col$ 90,000 per hectare
were derived from a recent bid covering some 40 hectares in the el Rodeo
Barrio. The bid price of Col$ 55,000 per hectare for 0.9 m of distribution
system per capita was multiplied by the relation of the 1.5 m per person
recommended in the feasibility report. The number of hectares which would
be developed each year was estimated by dividing the increase in population
served by the average population density. These distribution system works
were then included in works to be provided by customers' contributions and
do not form part of the project per se, although they are included in the
cash flow projections.
22.        The distribution lines to the four barrios of Union de Vivienda
Popular, 1L Rodeo,  =iloe, and Terron Colorado, were based on the above method
of estimating but because of the difficult topography in Siloe the hectare
price was increased there arbitrarily to Col$ 130,000.
23.        House connections in the four barrios, where an estimated poten-
tial of 18,500 connections exists,would follow installation of the dis-
tribution system. The number of new house connections for normal expansion
was calculated by assuming 36 connections per hectare at a unit cost of
Col$ 1,150.
24.        An amount was assigned for the development of an inventory of
tools and equipments for construction.
25.        Land purchases include 3.5 hectares for the treatment plant at
Puerto I4allarino at Col$ 10/m2 and a lump sum of Col$ 1 million for land
for storage tanks and pumping stations.
Sewerage Facilities
26.        The facilities for the collection and disposal of sanitary wastes
have been presented in the feasibility study (Volume II) for construction in
the following periods: 1971-1973 first stage immediate program, 1975-1978
second stage, and 1981-1983 third stage. This has been modified to provide
fairly constant investment levels from 1974 through 1982.
27.        These programs have been coordinated with the water supply im-
provements and follow the policy of Emcali of supplying both water supply
and sewerage services at the same time. All the facilities proposed would
serve areas whose densities of saturation would be reached within 10 to 25
years.  Interceptors and trunk lines, which normally are designed to receive
flows of 40 years hence, have been designed for flows corresponding to the
saturation density. The pumping station would have equipment for the next
15 years and could be enlarged.
28.        The average sanitary flow has been calculated as 90% of the water
to be supplied, based on the consumption per person and per day and the
saturation densities of population. A maximum sewage flow is based on co-
efficients taken from the ASCE Manual #37. An infiltration of 0.12 litres
per second per hectare has been assumed.



Annex 9
Page Tof 8 pages
29.       The major part of the sewerage system is made up of combined
sewers and Emcali recognizes that it is not practical nor economical to
carry combined flows through the sanitary system. Therefore, for the areas
with combined systems, overflow structures have been designed to discharge
more than twice the sanitary flow into the canals.
30.       The sewers to be constructed in 1971 to 1973 can be classified
as follows:
(a)  Lateral sewers in areas presently populated.
(b) Trunk and lateral sewers in areas still undeveloped, but
which will be urbanized in the 1970's.
(c) Trunk sewers required in areas presently developed.
(d) A southern interceptor to serve the southern extension south
of Cali.
31.       The southern interceptor is the largest sewer in the project and
would serve the southern extension of the area expected to be occupied by
1985. and would relieve the intercepuor Canaveralejo. The southern
interceptor would discharge into a sewage pumping station, Aguablanca.
32.       This pumping station would have two pumps of 1 m3/sec in the
first stage, one with a constant speed motor and the other with a variable
speed motor to facilitate pumping during periods of low flow. The pumping
station would discharge the sewage by means of a force main of 1.6 m dia-
meter to the Rio Cauca about 300 m below the present raw water intake.
33.       No sewage treatment plant is proposed at present.  Assuming an
unregulated seasonally lo01 flow of 70 m-/sec in the Cauca River, treatment
would probably be required in 1975 to maintain dissolved oxygen of 1 mg/l
below Cali and limit the biochemical oxygen demand to some 10 mg/l in the
industrial area of Yumbo. Should the proposed regulation of the Cauca pro-
ceed with the construction of a dam at Salvajina by the Cauca Valley
Corporation for power generation, the seasonally low flow of 130 m3/sec
would postpone the need for treatment to 1985.
Drainage
34.       The proposed drainage works follow the system proposed initially
by Tipton and afterwards revised by Buck, Seifert and Jost. The structures
have been designed by the rational method and their general layout and capa-
cities have, with minor exceptions, been found to be satisfactory.
35.       The drainage works whose construction is recommended can be
classified as follows:
(a) Storm drainage in areas not yet developed but whose development
is necessary in the 1970's.
(b) Storm drains to protect areas already developed.
(c) Storm drains required within the areas already developed.

CALI WATER SUPPLY AID SEWERAGE PROJECT
Incremental Rate of Return
Assumptions
1.        Benefits: The quantity of water sold and the operating expenses
for 1972 from AnEex 13, Estimated Income & Expense Statements, represent
the situation without the project. (Although project construction
continues into 1973, the increased sales in 1973 are due to elements of
the project previously completed.)
2.        The benefits are equal to Total Revenues minus Operating Expenses,
i.e. Income Before Depreciation, plus the 4% Contribution to Mlunicipality
and the IMlunicipal Services. These last two are benefits to the community
even though they are operating expenses to Emoali. The net annual benefits
due to the project are the increases in the benefits over the 1972 base
year (increases through 1972 are due to pre-project investments).
3.        Costs:  The Project T,orks and New Program from Annex 14, Estimated
Cash Flow Staterents, are reduced by the Customers' Contribution on the
grounds that the latter represents value received and only the difference
has to be offset by the benefits.
4.        Works Done by Urban Developers (Annex 14) are equal to and offset
by Developers' Contribution.  In other words, the costs of the works are
equal to the benefits as measured by the additional price of the lot paid
by the lot purchasers.
Calculations
5.        Total revenues of 1972 were increased to the rate level of
Co,l$.73/N3 for 1973 and subsequent years. Operating costs of 1972 were
increased by 8% to reach the constant price level of 1973 and later years.
The 10' Contribution to Iunicipality and the 1i''unicipal Services remained
functions of revenues. The 1972 base "benefit" without the project,
expressed in 1973 prices, was then calculated:

7.       Projections were made through 1982 for this incremental rate of
return calculation.  A treatment plant expansion and booster pumping
stations in 1980-1982 were omitted from the cost stream as part of a sub-
sequent project whose benefits would be the sales increments after 1982.
No further investments would be required after 1982 without thXe subsequent
project. The benefits of 1982 are the maximum level that can be extracted
from the present project and will continue through 2020.
Rate of Return
8.       The rate of return is the discount rate at which the present values
of costs and benefits are equal.

13.      The 4% contribution to Municipality is calculated on billings only.
No lag in payment is assumed.
14.       Municipal services:  the cost of water and sewerage services to
the P$nicipality is forecast at current level (2.4% of water billings, 1.1%
of sewerage billings).
Balance Sheet Items
15.      Assets and depreciation were revalued as of the end of 1968
using the cost of living index of the Departamento Administrativo Nac-
ional de Estadistica (DANE) for the city of Cali which is the most
accepted.  Records of assets prior to 1963 for sewerage did not exist.
Several assunptions were therefore made for those assets.  Assets were
then arbitrarily broken down between customers' contribution and assets
financed by Emcali assuming a relationship of 24%/76%.  Total gross
assets increased Col $ 296 million or 86%, and depreciation Col $ 163
million or 228%.  Distribution of assets and depreciation by source was
as follows: (at December 1968)

16.       In the projections:
- works are incorporated with fixed assets in the year these
are built.
- there is an increase for inflation of 8% each year in 1970
through 1973.
- works financed by Fncali and contribution from customers and
urban developers are kept separate.

18.       Depreciation is calculated at 3%, straight line without salvage
value. New assets incorporated in the year are depreciated at 1.5%.
19.       Accounts receivable on sales will average 2-1/2 months.
20.       Accounts receivable on customers' contribution Twill be determined
by the following terms:
Connection fee/connection cost         5 years
Valorization                            3 years
In 1972-73 the terms will be extended to eight years to take into account
the very low economic level of the districts to be served.
21.       Customers' contribution will be as follows:  connection fee 3%
of construction estimate (Col $ 30,000 average in 1969). There will be
one new connection per 7.5 new inhabitants served.
Connection cost:  Water    - Col $ 300 for the meter
Sewerage - Col $ 780
Valorization:  Appropriate customers share in the cost of main or
secondary lines profiting him directly or indirectly.
22.       Inventory increases with sales.

23.       Accounts payable decrease to three months of material costs by
1971, after wihich they remain constant.
24.       Social security reserve is projected at 12% of payroll cost.
This is a legal reserve for benefits not paid in the year to employees
but due to the employees upon retirement.
25.       Long-term debt in addition to project loans include the
remaining of Col$ 79.4 outstanding at December 31, 1968, and Col$ 142.5
of new IFl-AID loan disbursed in 1969 (Col$ 127.5) and 1970 (Col$ 15.0).
