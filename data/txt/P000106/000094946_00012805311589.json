institutional capacity. Lessons drawn from project\n            implementation include: 1) Participatory management of\n            state-owned forests resources is technically, socially, and\n            economically feasible. 2) When encroachment by\n            agriculturists has gone beyond a certain level (50 to 60\n            percent), the project's approach to formulation of\n            collaborative management plans is not viable. 3) Management\n            plans that only rely upon promotion of sustainable\n            forest-based income generating activities do not take into\n            account the full extent of the existing sources of\n            livelihood of local people. Future management plans need to\n            take a more holistic view of people's sources of income\n            and not just from the perspective of the resource being\n            managed. 4) Government commitment is variable on two fronts:\n            a) planning and budgeting, and b) commitment to\n            institutional reform. 5) There are important trade-offs\n            between building government capacity to monitor impact and\n            the need for projects to obtain objective data on impact in\n            order to learn lessons and justify investments. 6) There are\n            many tested technologies for natural resource management\n            that are available \"off the shelf.\" Therefore,\n            research should not be supply driven but rather demand driven."}, "docdt": "1999-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
