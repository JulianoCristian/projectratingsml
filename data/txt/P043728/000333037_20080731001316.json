the Environmental Management\n            Capacity Building (EMCB) Technical Assistance Project for\n            India were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Lessons learned\n            from the projects included: strengthening management\n            capacity does not necessarily or automatically lead to\n            improvements in environmental quality. Improving management\n            capacity focused on a well-defined and socially demanded set\n            of environmental goals would probably yield better results.\n            Environmental monitoring is a necessary but not sufficient\n            condition for improving environmental quality. Monitoring\n            programs should be designed around the demand for data by\n            decision makers rather than the simple demand for data. To\n            enhance the effectiveness of projects like EMCB, a\n            priority-setting process which involves various stakeholders\n            should precede project design and appraisal. Associated\n            lessons are that a sharper focus on environmental results\n            and a better ex ante analysis of the political economy of\n            environmental regulation could have made this a more\n            successful project with more sustainable outcomes. Finally,\n            the project also clearly demonstrates the risks of designing\n            an operation around the interests of individual\n            institutional champions, as occurred both at the central\n            Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) and in the\n            Gujarat Ecology Commission (GEC), because, once those\n            champions leave, the impetus may soon be lost. A strong\n            focus on specific desired environmental outcomes and basing\n            project design on a broader up-front stakeholder\n            consultation process would help to insulate it from the\n            kinds of abrupt changes and insufficient follow-through that\n            characterized implementation of the EMCB operation and could\n            also contribute to more effective enforcement of and\n            compliance with environmental laws and regulations."}, "docdt": "2008-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
