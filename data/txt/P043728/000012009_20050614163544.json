Some lessons of experience reinforce\n            previous notions, and are suggested as follows. Clear\n            definition of, and agreement on, a small number of\n            significant, national scale problems, is most likely to lead\n            to measurable impacts. The desired outcomes and essential\n            outputs should be articulated early during preparation;\n            components can then be designed to support this small set of\n            priorities, and should build on relevant ongoing activities\n            in order to help the Government achieve these priority\n            outcomes. Project design should generate a sense that this\n            project can make a difference. Specifically, a practical\n            balance has to reached between integrating components into\n            the regular activities of the implementing unit (which can\n            bring additional administrative burdens), and centralizing\n            control in a Project Unit, which simplifies administration\n            and reporting (but which may distance the project support\n            from the relevant operational units). This question should\n            be specifically discussed during preparation. Most\n            importantly, an effective coordinating mechanism should be\n            established, based on monitoring overall outcomes. Moreover,\n            Bank procedures for implementing capacity building projects\n            should be structured to be flexible, and to rely, wherever\n            possible, on local rules and procedures. Appropriate\n            training should be provided for key implementing staff,\n            again, at a very early stage. A significant part of the\n            value added by the Bank in capacity building, comes through\n            regular, consistent, and responsive involvement during the\n            implementation period. This requires careful planning of\n            supervision and depends on continuity of staff throughout\n            the period."}, "docdt": "2004-12-23T08:26:04Z"}
