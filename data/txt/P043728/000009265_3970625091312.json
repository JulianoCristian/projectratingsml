outlined in the Environmental Action Program\n            (EAP).  The specific objective of the project is to enhance\n            environmental management capacity to ensure effective\n            implementation of EAP priorities.  The Project includes six\n            components: a) environmental policy planning; b)\n            environmental administration; c) decentralization of\n            environmental management; d) environmental law\n            implementation; e) monitoring and compliance in high\n            priority environmental problem areas; and f) Gujarat- where\n            the project will strengthen the Department of Forests and\n            Environment and the Gujarat Ecology Commission, as well as\n            prepare a State Environmental Action Program."}, "docdt": "1996-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
