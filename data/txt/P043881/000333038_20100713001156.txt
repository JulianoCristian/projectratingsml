SUMMARY
The Bank has received a request from the Government of Romania for a 12-month
extension of the project closing date, from March 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012, in order to
complete the rehabilitation works for the primary and secondary irrigation infrastructure
in two irrigation schemes (Terasa Brailei and Terasa Viziru) and, thus, fully achieve the
project development objectives (PDO). There are no changes to the PDO, design, or
outcomes. The scope of the investment program envisaged under the project needs to be
reduced due to increased costs and depreciation of the loan currency, which entails the
reduction of some project output indicators. The Results Framework will be further
revised with the addition of four new intermediate outcome indicators and the elimination
of others to improve monitoring of project results.


PROJECT STATUS
Project implementation has been moderately satisfactory in the last two years, mainly
because of the lack of a comprehensive policy to phase out the operational subsidies for
irrigation. The PDOs are expected to be substantially achieved by the revised closing
date of March 31, 2012, despite the substantial impact on irrigation activity expected
after operational subsidies are terminated as of January 2010. The Rehabilitation of
Irrigation Schemes component has successfully completed rehabilitation of two schemes
with rehabilitation of two other schemes ongoing. Five main pumping stations and
tertiary infrastructure owned by 47 water users' organizations (WUOs) have been
rehabilitated, while water meters have been installed in 190 smaller pumping stations
with additional water meters to be installed in 130 pump stations by the revised closing
date.
Implementation of the component meant to provide support for institutional reform in
land reclamation sector progressed well with respect to the Support Program for WUOs,
with field irrigation equipment and office and communication equipment procured for
136 WUOs. In addition, an institutional reform of the sector was implemented,
complemented by a completely new system of tariff setting, service charges and subsidy
distribution for irrigation which will remain applicable after the project is complete. A
comprehensive economic, technical and social analysis of the irrigation sub-sector was
prepared as the basis of an investment program to guide further government capital
investment in rehabilitation and modernization of economically viable irrigation schemes.
Commitment of project funds reached 84.4% of loan funds ($68 million), while
disbursement reached only 59% of loan funds ($47 million). Financial management
arrangements are moderately satisfactory because of the insufficient funds allocated to
the project from the state budget. All audits have been prepared on time and have been
unqualified.

PROPOSED CHANGES
       ·   Closing date: The proposed extension seeks to extend the project closing date by
           12 months, from March 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012. The proposed extension is
           necessary to complete the rehabilitation works for the primary and secondary
           irrigation infrastructure in two schemes as well as rehabilitation of tertiary
           infrastructure owned by 18 water users' organizations. In addition, provision of
           new field irrigation equipment will continue until the full utilization of funds
           allocated to this project activity. The proposed extension will not entail a revision
           of the procurement plan, which was updated in April 2010.

       ·   Implementation schedule: All project components are expected to be completed
           by the new closing date. The implementation schedule of project activities will be
           revised accordingly, to comply with the extended closing date.

      ·    Results Framework and Monitoring: The results framework included in the
           PAD is proposed to be modified by introducing baseline and target values to each
           indicator monitored during project implementation to strengthen the Results
           Framework. Baseline values were derived from a survey undertaken in 2006. In
           addition, four new intermediate results indicators have also been included to
           improve monitoring of project results.
           In addition, some of the original output targets1 cannot be met because of the
           reduced scope of activities given the increased costs, loan currency depreciation,
           and overestimated WUO coverage areas. These are briefly described in the
           following:
               o Eight major pump stations will be rehabilitated instead of 20 because the
                 initial rehabilitation costs have been underestimated;
               o Water metering equipment will be installed in 320 WUOs covering a total
                 area of about 250,000 ha instead of 400 WUOs with 500,000 ha, mainly
                 because of costs increases and overestimated average area of WUOs;
               o Rehabilitation of tertiary infrastructure: will be completed for 65 WUOs
                 covering about 150,000 ha instead of 160 WUOs with 800,000 ha because
                 of increased rehabilitation costs and overestimated average area of WUOs
                 (5,000 ha);
               o Field irrigation equipment will be supplied for about 145 WUOs covering
                 about 350,000 ha instead of 160 WUOS covering 800,000 ha, mainly
                 because the overestimated average area of WUOs;
               o Office and communication equipment will be supplied for about 150
                 WUOs covering about 340,000 ha instead of 160 WUOs covering 800,000
                 ha, because of the overestimated average area of WUOs;

            The table of Results Framework and Monitoring is attached as Annex 1.

        ROMANIA -- IRRIGATION REHABILITATION & REFORM PROJECT

                                  Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Romania, Irrigation Rehabilitation & Reform Project, Loan
   No47170, P043881 will be extended from March 31, 2011 until March 31, 2012.

2.       Through the proposed extension the project would be able to achieve most of
project outcome indicators reflected in the total area of viable irrigation infrastructure
rehabilitated (both public and privately owned by water users' associations - WUA) and
implementation of the support program for WUAs. In addition, the institutional reform
of the irrigation sector promoted through the project achieved most of its objectives: the
tariff setting and charging for services has been fundamentally restructured, the role of
institutions has been redefined and separation of functions between the public
responsibilities and commercial activities implemented. The operational subsidies for
irrigation have ceased and new forms of state support, compliant with EC regulations, are
being put in place with project support.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to complete the rehabilitation works for the
primary and secondary irrigation infrastructure in two schemes as well as rehabilitation of
tertiary infrastructure owned by 18 water users' organizations. In addition, provision of
new field irrigation equipment will continue until the full utilization of funds allocated.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project.
