                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project would close on June 30, 2012 with most outcome indicators related to the project area fully or substantially met. The target for the increase in the agricultural productivity
                         measured in yields (tons/ha) in the project area was met and exceeded; the average yield for corn increased from the baseline 5.0 t/ha in 2005 to 7.04 t/ha in 2011 (exceeding the
                         target of 6.5 t/ha); for vegetables, the average yield was over 23 t/ha, while the baseline value was 14.2 t/ha (exceeding the target of 20 t/ha); the percentage of the area with high
                         value crops irrigated in the project area reached 88% compared with the target of 70%. Most of the area irrigated in 2011 (over 94% countrywide and 100% in the project area) is

                         located on lower terraces requiring water lift of less than 70 m from water source. The concentration of irrigation on lower terraces contributed to a more economic use of irrigation
                         reducing the energy consumed for water pumping by 40% country-wide; the energy consumption to deliver water to crops dropped from an average of 922 kWh/1000 m3 in
                         1997-2004 (before the project) to 553 kWh/1000 m3 in 2005-2011 (during project implementation). Last but not least, the charging for water delivered to users changed under the
                         project following installation of water meters in all pump stations. However, the long-term sustainability of these outcomes is at risk because the maintenance expenditures are

                         substantially below the requirements for long-term functionality of the primary infrastructure (an insufficient increase in expenditures for infrastructure maintenance in 2012 was note.
                         The system of tariff setting and charging for services established under the project has been maintained throughout project implementation and would continue after project closure.

                         Progress occurred also on institutional development: establishment of new WUOs continued despite the termination of operational subsidies but few more years would be needed to
                         reach a stable situation (in terms of number and area coverage) once the water users' organizations (WUOs) and their farmer-members find the means to fully cope with effects of
                         subsidy termination. In addition, formation of federations of WUOs (F-WUOs) is picking-up; 15 F-WUOs have been established to date, of which 12 F-WUOs for irrigation and 3 F-
                         WUOs for irrigation and drainage. Eight of these have recently (in 2012) taken over the management of the respective infrastructure from ANIF and the process continues. A
                         revision of the ANIF organization enacted in 2011 is being discussed by the new Government with the Parliament to address the shortfalls in functional and financing arrangements.
                         The decision regarding closing down the nonviable schemes is still to be made by MARD.

                         The irrigation activity in 2011 remained low compared with 2009 (the last year with operational subsidies), but it seems to have slightly improved in 2012 under much drier weather
                         conditions than in 2011. The farmers appear willing to adjust to the changed financing conditions after termination of subsidies but they perceive the water tariffs charged both by
                         ANIF and WUOs (internally) as too high, triggering selective use of irrigation (mainly on cash crops) and discouraging large-scale irrigation. This downward trend in irrigated area
                         should be of special concern for the Government reflection regarding the role of irrigation in agriculture to secure stable yields and quality products for markets.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The new Government expressed a strong commitment to start a new investment program for rehabilitation of viable irrigation schemes, based on the Investment Strategy developed
                         under the Project and approved by MARD in December 2011, and embedding the lessons learned from the implementation of the Project. The state financing of capital investment in
                         construction of new irrigation schemes and rehabilitation or modernization of existing schemes is the only mechanism for state support under EU state aid regulations. The sources of
                         financing this new program are being discussed with the EC but other options are also considered.
