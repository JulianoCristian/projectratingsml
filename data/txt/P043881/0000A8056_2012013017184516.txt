                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards meeting the project development objectives continued. Most of the area irrigated in 2011 (over 95% countrywide and 100% in the project area) is located on lower
                         terraces requiring water lift of less than 70 m from water source, and most irrigation – 73% of the area - has been applied to cash crops. Although the maintenance expenditures
                         dropped dramatically in 2010 and 2011 (compared to 2009), the water users in the schemes with constant irrigation activity understood the need to keep the schemes in good
                         condition and agreed to increase the expenditures for infrastructure maintenance in 2012. The new system of tariff setting and charging for services established under the project has

                         been maintained throughout project implementation and would continue after project closure. The operational subsidies for irrigation have been discontinued and the state support
                         would continue only through capital investment in rehabilitation of viable schemes.

                         Progress occurred also on institutional development: the Government approved recently a new reform of the irrigation agency (ANIF - National Agency for Land Reclamation) turning

                         it into a public institution within the structure of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), reducing the staffing by 70% (from about 5,000 staff to 1,500 staff), and
                         transferring the flood protection infrastructure to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF). Provisions for a new "land reclamation tax" to be imposed upon farmers having their
                         land benefiting directly or indirectly of land reclamation services (irrigation, drainage, soil erosion control) also accompany the ANIF reorganization but the mechanism for calculation
                         and collection is yet to be developed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and Ministry of Public Finance. The decision regarding closing down the nonviable
                         schemes is still to be made by MARD. On the other hand, establishment of WUOs and federations of WUOs (FWUO) continued in 2011 with 20 new WUOs (to a total of 453 WUOs)
                         and seven FWUOs, the latter aiming at assuming management of entire schemes where they operate. Protocols for transfer of management of two schemes to FWUOs have been
                         concluded and will become effective in early 2012.

                         The irrigation activity in 2011 remained low compared with 2009 (the last year with operational subsidies) both for climatic and financial reasons. The total area irrigated in 2011 was
                         of 94,450 ha, with 30% more than in 2010 but at 30% of the area irrigated in 2009 (295,000 ha) and only 7% of the command area of viable schemes (1,350,000 ha). The year 2011
                         was the second wet year in a row with sufficient rainfall during cropping season, leading to an unusual high output from agriculture (for cereals, sunflower, sugar beet, rapeseed, etc.)
                         with a substantial contribution to GDP and growth. The high water tariffs also discouraged the WUOs and member-farmers to irrigate, particularly the small ones. This downward
                         trend in irrigated area should be of special concern for the Government introspection regarding the role of irrigation in agriculture to secure stable yields and quality products for
                         markets.

                         A special attention should be given by the Government to starting a new investment program for rehabilitation of viable irrigation schemes, based on the Investment Strategy finalized
                         in February 2011 and yet to be discussed and approved by MARD. The state financing of capital investment in construction of new irrigation schemes and rehabilitation or
                         modernization of existing schemes is the only mechanism for state support under EU state aid regulations.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government should decide, at MARD proposal, to close-down all irrigation schemes demonstrated as economically unviable and write them off ANIF books, to stop the drainage
                         of public funds for their conservation.

                         The Government needs to urgently adopt the required measures to mitigate the social impact of the ANIF staff lay-off and mechanism for implementation of the new "land reclamation
                         tax".
