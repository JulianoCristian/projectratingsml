LAND ACQUISITION POLICY FRAMEWORK 
FOR THE ROMANIA: HAZARD RISK MITIGATION AND EMERGENCY 
PREPAREDNESS PROJECT (HRMEP) P 075163 
Loan: 4736 RO 
 
1. The purpose of the Land Acquisition Policy Framework (LAPF) is to clarify land acquisition 
principles, together with organizational arrangements under the Romania HRMEP.    
2. The overall objective of the Romania HRMEP
is to assist the Government in reducing the 
environmental, social, and economic vulnerability to natural disasters, and catastrophic mining 
accidental spills of pollutants, by strengthening the institutional and technical capacity for 
disaster management and emergency response, through upgrading communication and 
information systems; implementing specific risk reduction investments for floods, landslides and 
earthquakes; improving the safety of selected water-retention dams; and, improving, on a pilot 
basis, the management and safety of tailings dams, and waste dump facilities. Through its 
components the project will: 1) strengthen and enhance the capacity of Romanian authorities to 
better prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural or man-made disasters, through 
modernization of information technology and communications systems, public awareness and 
preparedness, and technical feasibility work, and institutional framework for launching of the 
Romanian Catastrophe Insurance Program; 2) reduce the seismic vulnerability of priority 
technical and social infrastructure, through the retrofitting of key structures, and institutional 
strengthening; 3) reduce flood risk and vulnerability in critical areas in Romania, to improve 
safety of large and small dams, in order for these to function as designed, and, to map and model 
the risk of landslides, so as to reduce losses, providing better land use planning tools; 4) reduce 
the risk of water and soil contamination, and loss of human and aquatic life from catastrophic 
mining accidental spills of pollutants. The global environmental objective is to demonstrate, and 
provide replication for the reduction of catastrophic accidental spills of trans-boundary pollution 
loads, from mine operations flowing into the Danube and Black Sea basins. Finally, Project 
management unit costs will be financed, to be established in the respective ministries responsible 
for each related component. 
3. The project consists of the following components and activities: 
 
Component A: Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing Capacity 
The objective of component A is to enhance the capacity of the Romanian authorities to better 
prepare for, respond to and recover from natural or man-made disasters, through modernization 
of information technology and communications systems, activities which would increase the 
planning and training efforts of all levels of government, public awareness and preparedness, and 
complete technical feasibility work and institutional framework for launching of the Romanian 
Catastrophe Insurance Program.

Component C: Flood and Landslide Risk Reduction  
The objective of component C is to reduce flood risk and vulnerability in critical areas in 
Romania, to improve safety of large and small dams so that these structures can function as 
designed, and to map and model the risk of landslides in Romania in order to reduce losses and 
provide for better land use planning tools.

Component D: Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin  
The development objective of this component is to reduce the risk of water and soil 
contamination and loss of human and aquatic life from catastrophic mining accidental spills of 
pollutants. The global environmental objective is to demonstrate and provide for replication for 
the reduction of catastrophic accidental spills of trans-boundary pollution loads from mine 
operations flowing into the Danube and Black Sea basins. In support of the above-mentioned 
development and global objectives, the project will assist in the implementation o f mitigation 
and hazard prevention activities. Two high-risk and high-priority sites, Rosia Poieni and Baia 
Borsa mines, have been identified for hazard prevention interventions during the initial phase of 
the project. These sites require emergency action. Additional sites for intervention will be 
identified during project implementation. A key indicator o
f
this component’s success is the 
gradual reduction in number and the negative impacts of mining accidental spills of pollutants 
into the Tisza Basin and in the volume of toxic releases from mines downstream. The successful 
implementation o f this component will serve as a model for replication for reducing mining 
accident risks to human and aquatic ecosystem health throughout Romania and other parts o f the 
Tisza and Danube basins.

components. 
 
4. This Land Acquisition Policy Framework will apply to all components of HRMEP that are 
still under implementation. 
 
5. The Policy Framework covers the following elements, consistent with the provisions described 
in the World Bank Policy, OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement: 
(i) Activities for which land acquisition is required 
 
(a)
 
Restriction of land use or access 
6. Under OP 4.12, restrictions on access to land or on use of land are regarded as a form of land 
acquisition.  Romanian Water Law (Law nr. 107/1996 with modifications and republished) 
provides indications regarding the regime of restrictions. Other regime of restrictions is imposed 
for waters used as drinking sources, by the Governmental Decision nr. 930 / 2005 for approval of 
special norms regarding the characteristics and dimensions of sanitary protection zones and 
hydro-geological protection zones. For both legal regulation, the zones with the strongest 
restrictions should become public property and should be the subject of expropriation.  
 
Based on Law 107/1996, permanent Protection Zones (e.g. for Dams) must be subject to 
expropriation, at replacement cost which will be determined based on a process of negotiation 
with the affected people.  In the case of temporary protection zones, which refers to land use and 
access restrictions that are not permanent, such restrictions may result in loss of assets and 
income, and under the LAPF, the corresponding compensation amount at replacement cost will 
be estimated whenever they occur according to the Romanian legislation.    
 (b) 
Expropriation of land 
7. The land that has been or may in future need to be expropriated includes the area on which the 
permanent structures will be constructed and the protection zone, delineated according to the 
legislation requirements.      
 
8. Any expropriation of land required for or directly linked to the permanently built structures 
will be carried out following well-established procedures specified in Romanian laws and 
procedures relating to land purchase and expropriation and World Bank Operational Policy (OP) 
4.12 and Bank Procedures (BP) 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. Wherever Romanian Laws 
and World Bank policies are not in agreement, the principles agreed upon in the LAPF will be 
Page  4
4
followed (as further specified in the following sections). 
However, the total value of 
compensation provided for any expropriation in any case should not be less than the amount 
which the individual or household would receive under the Government’s legal framework for 
land restitution and expropriation.   It should be noted that no displacement of population is 
expected. 
9. The LAPF does cover any cases in which the initial land claim restitution of agricultural or 
forest land was made prior to the legal deadline and in accordance with the law, but which have 
not yet been resolved.   
 (ii) Principles and objectives governing land acquisition 
10. For construction works associated with Hazard Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness 
Project (HRMEP), it is likely that there is need for limited acquisition and this may result in the 
loss of land and perhaps the loss of sources of income. Loss of shelter is highly unlikely as 
people are not expected to lose their residences or other structures.  
11. The premise governing the LAPF is that land acquisition may cause hardship and 
impoverishment, and therefore where it is not feasible to avoid land acquisition, project affected 
persons (PAPs) will consulted and compensated and assisted in their efforts to improve or restore 
their livelihoods and standards of living to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project 
implementation. To support this objective, the following principles will apply: 
·
During the sub-project preparation process, consideration of technical options shall 
involve a concurrent assessment of potential associated land acquisition impacts, so that, 
where feasible, design alternatives to minimize such impacts can be identified as early as 
possible. 
·
Consultation arrangements during the project sub-component preparation process shall be 
transparent and inclusive to ensure that all persons affected by involuntary land 
acquisition are consulted on the mitigation measures. 
·
Compensation for lost assets shall be provided before land and other assets are taken into 
possession.  
(iii) Legal framework reviewing the fit between Romanian laws and regulations and World 
Bank OP 4.12 requirements, and measures proposed to bridge any gaps between them, 
and description of entitlements 
12. Romania has a legal framework which regulates the expropriation and defines the procedures 
for expropriation of immovable properties initiated by Law nr. 33 / 1994 concerning 
expropriation for cause of public interest and detailed by the Government Decision nr. 583/1994 
for approving the Regulation regarding the commissions’ working procedure for the preliminary 
research in order to declare public utility of the national or local interest projects. The 
expropriation of private properties is done only for a public interest and with fair compensation. 
If all parts involved agree about the transfer of ownership and the nature or amount of 
compensations, respecting the conditions regarding public information, the meaning and the 
form of law, expropriation is not necessary. If the parts involved will not agree about transfer of 
ownership or about the amount and nature of compensation, is necessary to follow the procedure 
of law.    
 
Page  5

13. First legal step for expropriation is the declaration of public utility of investment. The law 
specifies that “storage areas for flood risk reduction” (the case under the Project) is a public 
utility investment. Public utility is declared by the Romanian Government for projects of national 
importance, or by the County Council for local importance projects, after a preliminary analysis 
conducted by a Commission assigned by the Romanian Government in the case of national 
importance projects or by the County Council for local importance projects, based on a 
documentation called Preliminary Analysis/Inquiry File. The Preliminary Analysis/Inquiry File 
must be registered with the Secretariat of the commissions conducting the preliminary research 
in order to declare public utility of national interest works within the Ministry of Regional 
Development and Tourism, of national importance works, as well as with the Secretariat of the 
commissions conducting preliminary analysis for declaring public utility of local interest projects 
within the County Council.        
14. As per the law, for the national importance projects, the Preliminary Analysis Commission is 
composed by representatives of Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), of Ministry of 
Public Finances (MPF), of Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism (MRDT) and the 
local authorities on whose territory the project is being developed are represented by the 
President/s of County Council and Directors of concerned departments of County Council, the 
director of the County Agency for Cadastre and Land Registration and the Mayors of the 
administrative territories affected by the project. The Commission will analyze the economic – 
social – environmental and other impacts of the project, the motivations due to which the project 
cannot be developed otherwise except through expropriation and also if the investment is 
mentioned by the territory’s Land Planning Acts approved according to law. The Commission 
will complete a Report/Minute which will be the base of the governmental act for declaration of 
public utility. The governmental act is published in the Official Journal and the owners of fields 
and constructions proposed for expropriation will be notified in a period of 15 days after 
publication. If the owners of the lands and constructions proposed for the expropriation are not 
known, there is no obligation to have the owners notified, and, in this case it is considered 
enough to make public the document declaring public utility of national interest by having it 
posted at the local administration building within the area of the expropriated real estate property 
and published in the Romanian Official Journal.           
15. Next step is made by Investor which will endorse to the City Hall the plans of fields and 
constructions proposed for expropriation, with indication of owners and the proposal for 
compensations. The owners and the holders of legal titles to the respective estates may address 
petitions of contestation within 45 days from receiving notification, filed with the Mayor’s office 
from the locality where the real estate is located. Upon expiry of this deadline the entire file 
containing documentations about expropriation and alleged petitions will be endorsed in a period 
of 30 days to the General Secretary of Government. Petitions will be solved in a period of 30 
days by a Commission, appointed by Governmental decision, under the legal stipulations.
 
16. Under the Project, the PMU will take supplemental measures to ensure that all affected 
people are notified in a timely way regarding their lands that are expected to be expropriated, in 
addition to the endorsement of documents for expropriation proposal to the City Hall by the 
Investor (e.g., National Administration “Apele Române”).  
17. Requests for expropriation will be solved by the County Law Court within the range of 
which the real estate proposed for expropriation is located. In case of agreements both on 
expropriation and on the compensations between the parties, the court will acknowledge the 
Page  6
6
agreement by releasing a final resolution. In case parties agree only on expropriation, the court 
will acknowledge the settlement and will decide the compensations. In order to establish the 
amount of compensations the County Law Court establishes a Commission of 3 Experts (one 
independent, one representing the investor and one representing the party which is to be 
expropriated) 
–
see no. 18. Resolutions County Law Court within the range the real estate 
proposed for expropriation is located do not cancel the expropriation procedure.      
18. The amount of compensation includes, under the law stipulation, the real value of the lands 
or constructions and the loss caused to the owners. For the calculation of above mentioned 
amount, the law stipulates that the Experts must take into account the market price of lands or 
construction in the area at the moment of expertise and the losses caused to the owners or other 
persons, proved by them.
 
The World Bank policy requires compensation for land to be at 
“replacement value,” enabling the affected person to purchase land of equivalent area and quality 
in the vicinity, so the World Bank policy and Romanian legislation are in agreement regarding 
the amount of compensation.   Under the project, the PMU will appoint the investor Expert if 
will be the case.
 
19. 
Loss of Income
:
It should also be noted that less than 10-20% of an individual’s land holding 
is expected to be adversely affected by the land acquisition process for the project – therefore, no 
significant loss of income is expected and impacts can be generally considered to be minor. 
However, if PAPs suffer loss of income through loss of more than 20% of their land holding, 
income restoration assistance will be provided if required, despite the fact that Romanian law 
does not call for this.  This will take the form of “Rehabilitation Assistance” meaning assistance 
comprising job placement, job training, cash compensation, transition support or other forms of 
support to enable displaced persons, who have lost their source of livelihood as a result of the 
displacement, to improve or at least restore their income levels and standard of living to pre-
project levels. 
20. 
Loss of Structures
:
No losses of residential or other structures are anticipated under the 
project.  However, in the event that there are structures (barns, kiosks, small commercial 
buildings etc.,) that will need to be demolished, “depreciation” will not be considered in 
calculating the compensation payable for affected structures. Although this differs from the 
provisions of Romanian law, the affected people will be compensated at full replacement cost of 
their structures."
 
21. 
Bans and Restrictions on Protection Zones and Restriction Zones
:
The compensation for the 
expropriation of the lands in the Protection Zone will be carried out as per the details set out in 
the Policy Framework. The lands that are envisioned to be periodically impacted are not subject 
to expropriation; however, some bans and restrictions on carrying out certain activities that are 
likely to have negative impacts on the purpose for which the restriction zones have been created 
will be established. Should such occur under this project, the restrictions on land use on the 
restriction zones will be treated as loss of assets and income triggering the Bank’s Policy on 
Involuntary Resettlement and the corresponding compensation amount at replacement cost will 
be determined based on a process of negotiation with the affected people and will be of a size 
sufficient to restore their livelihoods that are adversely affected.   
22.
 
Informal Land Use
:
Under the LAPF, informal users of land directly affected by the project 
will be eligible to some support depending of nature of use (see entitlement matrix).  Data from 
the last available survey will be used as the basis for delineating any required protected and 
Page  7
7
restricted areas that may need to be expropriated and/or acquired, and the specific usage of these 
lands by PAP (including informal users).   
23. While the World Bank OP 4.12 embodies the principle that a lack of legal land title does not 
disqualify people from resettlement assistance, under relevant Romanian legislation, 
discrepancies with this principle arise. However, as mentioned above, within the scope of this 
project, informal users of land without title or lease who use the land for temporary or seasonal 
purposes such as grazing will be entitled to alternative spaces for grazing.  All informal users of 
land directly affected by project activities will also be entitled to rehabilitation assistance or 
some form of support to enable affected persons, who have lost their source of livelihood, to 
restore their income levels to pre-project levels.  
24. However, the government wants to prevent false claims for assistance appearing after 
disclosure of project plans. Therefore, the last date of the survey will be chosen as a cut-off date 
after which any person carrying out illegal/ informal activities in the area is not eligible to 
receive any assistance as a result of project activities.  This cut-off date is the date the consultants 
carried out the land-use survey to examine public lands allocated for the project for evidence of 
private use.  
25. A comprehensive Gap Analysis between the Romanian Legislation and OP/BP 4.12 is 
attached (Annex 4). 
 
(iv) Eligibility and entitlements 
26. 
The following entitlement matrix describes the eligibility for compensation and/or 
assistance for impacts/losses for different types of assets and categories of project affected

(v) 
Mechanisms for consultations 
27. 
In addition to documenting the expropriation procedures indicated above, once the scope 
of the civil works is identified, the concerned City Hall and other institutions will hold public 
consultations to discuss the expropriation and its implications, to which all land users whose 
lands will be affected by the expropriation will be invited. The PMU will also take the lead in 
ensuring that consultations are held with affected people and not entirely transfer the 
Page  9
9
responsibility to the concerned City Hall. The content and results of the consultation will be 
recorded in Minutes that are maintained in the sub-project files and made available to the PMU 
and the Bank team.  
 
(vi) 
 Description of the implementation process and Arrangements for funding land 
acquisition 
28. 
For construction works activity that requires land acquisition, a specific Resettlement/ 
Land Acquisition Action Plan will be prepared and submitted to the Bank for approval. The 
implementation of land acquisition activities will be linked to the implementation of the 
construction works to ensure that such works or access restrictions do not occur before the 
payment of compensation is made or other activities have been carried out. To repeat, land and 
related assets will be taken only after compensation has been paid. 
 
29. 
The overall responsibility for expropriation for the Project is under the Investor as well as 
the financial responsibility for expropriation. Allocation of relevant funds will be envisaged by 
Investor.  
30. The decision for expropriation, for national importance works/projects, is taken by the 
Romanian Government and the procedure is as follows:  
·
The Preliminary Analysis/Inquiry File
for expropriation is prepared by Investor (e.g. 
National Administration “Apele Române”) and endorsed to the ministry in charge; 
·
The ministry in charge endorses the Preliminary Analysis File to the Secretariat of the 
commissions conducting preliminary research in order to declare public utility of national 
interest projects within the Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism which 
reviews the documentation and runs through the steps provisioned by law in order to 
draw up the normative act concerning the declaration of public utility of the project 
through approval from the Romanian Government.  
After publication, in case the expropriation proposals resulted from the petitions solving 
Commission are rejected, the expropriator, as well as the owners or other holders of legal titles to 
the property proposed for expropriation, may challenge the commission’s decision, appointed as 
per art. 15, at the Court of Appeal within the range of which the property is situated, but if such 
complaints against the declaration of public utility are not filed within statutory time, it enters 
into force and can be implemented; 
·
Otherwise after the Appeal Court passes judgment on the lodged complaint, the 
respective decision should be implemented.   
·
Passing judgement on the expropriation request is the competence of the law courts 
stipulated by law, irrespective of the existence or non-existence of complaints against the 
expropriation proposal. 
31. 
The concerned Ministry in change will be responsible for following up and concluding of 
the expropriation procedures which include payment of compensation as well. The decision will 
a
lso specify that the Investor will bear the cost of the expropriation expenditures. The concerned 
Ministry is responsible for the legal aspect of the expropriation request. The land acquisition 
transfer must be fully completed, and payment made, before any work can begin on the 
expropriated or acquired property. According to the Romanian legislation no civil works can 
start unless expropriation and compensation procedures have been completed. The land can be 
Page  10
10
considered as expropriated from the moment of transfer of the compensation that is due to the 
affected parties. 
 (vii) Responsible Institutions and/or Agencies  
32. 
The key activities and responsible actors in the planning and implementation of the 
specific Land Acquisition Plan are outlined in the table below:

PMU 
(viii) Grievance Redress Mechanisms 
33. The Expropriation Law provide for an appeals process against the proposed award for 
compensation. The PMU staff also plays an advisory and facilitating role in resolving 
grievances. Grievances related to land acquisition impacts should be pursued at the municipality/ 
community level with facilitation by PMU staff together with design consultants in order to find 
technical solutions that avoid or further minimize the need for land acquisition. Solutions to 
grievances related to compensation amounts, delays in compensation payments should be 
pursued directly by the designated authorities in liaison with the PMU staff who will inform 
PAPs about the avenues for grievance redress, and will maintain a record of grievances received, 
and the result of attempts to resolve them (Annex 1).  This information will be entered into the 
Management Information System (MIS) and be included in the regular progress reporting.  
(ix) Process for preparing and approving Land Acquisition Plan and arrangements for 
monitoring  
34. The PMU on the basis of completed and approved design including the Parcel Layout Plan 
for Land Acquisition will prepare a site-specific 
Land Acquisition Plan
 for all the expropriation 
required which will be submitted to the Bank for review and approval prior to commencing 
Page  11
11
physical works. The Plan will include details about any prior steps taken, such as notification or 
consultation with owners, and description of the land acquisition process and mitigation 
measures.  The Resettlement / Land Acquisition Plan will cover the following: 
·
A
census of persons affected by involuntary land acquisition including an inventory of 
lost assets and valuation of these, and socio-economic data.  
·
Description of the compensation  to be provided  
·
Minutes of the public consultations with affected/persons  
·
Institutional responsibility for implementation and procedures for grievance redress  
·
Arrangements for monitoring and implementation  
·
A
time-bound implementation plan and budget. 
35. The implementation of the Land Acquisition Plan will be monitored by PMU as well as 
Bank supervision missions. The sources of funding for the different activities in the Land 
Acquisition Plan shall be clearly specified in the budget. The time-bound implementation plan 
will specify the delivery of land acquisition compensation and entitlements in relation to the 
timing of physical construction activities.

Annex 4 
Equivalence of the Romanian Applicable Law with OP/BP 4.12
 
The similarities and differences between principles in OP/BP 4.12 and Romanian legal 
requirements and practices are highlighted below.  
OBJECTIVE 
OP/BP 4.12 Objective: 
To avoid 
or minimize involuntary 
resettlement and, where this is not 
feasible, to assist displaced 
persons in improving or at least 
restoring their livelihoods and 
standards of living in real terms 
relative to pre-displacement levels 
or to levels prevailing prior to the 
beginning of project 
implementation, whichever is 
higher
.
Romanian Law :
 The Romanian Constitution protects private property and 
provides that “nobody may be expropriated unless for a cause of public use, 
established according to law, subject to a fair and prior compensation” (Art. 
44, para.3.6). 
 These provisions were further elaborated in the Expropriation Law (Law 
33/1994) and Government Resolution 583/1994, which establish a standard that 
applies to all levels of government. Each act of expropriation is based on a 
request for an expropriation decision, which must justify “the national or local 
interest, the economical-social, environmental or any other kind of advantages 
that justify the necessary character of works and could not be carried out except 
by means of expropriation (Art. 10 Expropriation Law).   
The Expropriation Law is based on the assumption that compensation at market 
value and “prejudice” (real value of the premises and the prejudice caused to 
the owner or other entitled persons (Art. 26, Expropriation Law) should be 
adequate to enable the affected people to maintain the value of their assets and, 
if relevant, to re-establish themselves under similar circumstances. 
 Article 26 of the Expropriation Law loosely characterizes prejudice as 
“damages caused to the owner or, if the case may be, to other entitled persons, 
also considering the justification submitted by them.” The Civil Code defines 
prejudice as “damage effectively suffered and unrealized benefits.” 
Expropriation cancels tenancy agreements and the tenants are “entitled to 
compensation” (Art. 28, Expropriation Law). It appears that prejudice thus 
covers impacts on income and livelihoods beyond the cost of affected assets, 
including impacts on third parties.
 
OP/BP 4.12 
Operation 
Principles 
Romanian Law 
Operational Principle
 
1.
 Assess 
all viable alternative project 
designs to avoid, where feasible, 
or minimize involuntary 
resettlement
 
Article 10 of the Expropriation Law requires a project proponent/expropriator 
to justify the need for expropriation and to demonstrate that the investment 
cannot occur without expropriation. A commission (at national, county or local 
level) is set up to review each proposal, obtain technical inputs from 
government agencies and inputs from interest parties, and recommend an 
expropriation decision or return the proposal to the project proponent. Various 
agencies and ministries also append specific requirements that must be fulfilled 
in the Technical Design. The process is essentially repeated when the Technical 
Design is completed and affected persons are identified. 
Operational Principle 2.
 Through 
census and socio-economic 
surveys of the affected population, 
identify, assess, and address the 
potential economic and social 
impacts of the project that are 
caused by involuntary taking of 
land (e.g. relocation or loss of 
shelter, loss of assets or access to 
assets, loss of income sources or 
means of livelihood, whether or 
not the affected perso
n
must move 
The Expropriation Law does not require a baseline census or socio-economic 
survey. The expropriation request must identify economic and social benefits of 
the investment, however, and the Technical Design includes detailed 
information about land ownership and use (confirmed by the Cadastre Office) 
and estimated value of the land to be expropriated (Art. 12, Expropriation 
Law). This constitutes a de facto household census. Cases involving physical 
relocation and loss of access to assets are identified through the process of 
collecting information for the Technical Design. The loss of income sources or 
means of livelihood and transition costs can be included in calculations of 
compensation for “prejudice,” but they must be claimed by the owner or other 
affected person.  
No socio-economic surveys are required for expropriation.

to another location) or 
involuntary restriction of access 
to legally designated parks and 
protected areas.  
 
Operational Principle
 
3.
 Identify 
and address impacts also if they 
result from other activities that 
are (a) directly and significantly 
related to the proposed project, 
(b) necessary to achieve its 
objectives, and (c) carried out or 
planned to be carried out 
contemporaneously with the 
project. 
 
Legal expropriation standards and procedures and compensation standards 
apply equally to all aspects of an investment 
Operational Principle
 
4.
 Consult 
project-affected persons, host 
communities and local 
nongovernmental organizations, 
as appropriate. Provide them 
opportunities to participate in the 
planning, implementation, and 
monitoring of the resettlement 
program, especially in the process 
of developing and implementing 
the procedures for determining 
eligibility for compensation 
benefits and development 
assistance (as documented in a 
resettlement plan), and for 
establishing appropriate and 
accessible grievance mechanisms. 
Pay particular attention to the 
needs of vulnerable groups among 
those displaced, especially those 
below the poverty line, the 
landless, the elderly, women and 
children, Indigenous Peoples, 
ethnic minorities, or other 
displaced persons who may not be 
protected through national land 
compensation legislation. 
 
Investments must be embedded in urban or regional spatial plans, which are 
adopted and revised through open meetings. Documentation related to 
justifying an investment and implementing it, to obtain a Location Permit and 
then Construction License, must be posted in County and Local Councils, 
offices of the expropriator, the official gazette and local newspapers. The 
documentation constitutes both expropriation and construction plans, owners 
and proposed compensation. The documentation prepared to request an 
expropriation decision and to obtain a Location Permit, is reviewed by officials 
from different agencies. The process is relatively open, although no public 
meetings are required. Affected persons are not specifically contacted at this 
point, but they and all other interested parties have access to officials to discuss 
various aspects directly or submit written questions or objections, which are 
considered in making the decision.   
Once the Location Permit is issued, the Technical Design is completed and 
posted in the country or local government offices, as well as the office of the 
expropriator. Interested parties who have questions or objections can express 
their reservations in writing to the mayor or head of the county, who establishes 
a
commission to review and address each petition and consult with interested 
parties. These consultations can lead to revisions of the Technical Design. 
Although there are no resettlement plans, as such, the documentation for the 
expropriation decision and the Technical Design can be seen as a reasonable 
proxy for a land acquisition or resettlement plan, especially since the system is 
almost exclusively based on paying cash compensation to affected persons for 
lost assets and opportunities.  Grievance mechanisms exist at successive stages 
in preparation and design of the investment. Prior to the issue of the Location 
Permit and completion of the Technical Design, interested parties can address 
their concerns regarding location, alignments and the scope of expropriation to 
agencies involved in the decision-making process, the mayor, and negotiation 
representatives of the expropriator (Art. 12-19 Expropriation Law).  
Expropriation must be concluded before the Construction License is issued. 
Once that occurs, affected persons can challenge the level of compensation in 
the courts, but cannot reverse the expropriation process. There are no regular 
mechanisms for public participation in monitoring the implementation of the 
investment and the impact of expropriation, although controversial projects are 
generally actively scrutinized by the press.   
Eligibility for compensation is consistent and straightforward, including 
owners, tenants and tenants whose lease contract has been lawfully drawn up 
(Art. 28 and Art. 29 of the Law of Expropriation) 
.
There are no special provisions for the vulnerable, minorities or others and, 
with the ex
ception of squatters, there appear to be no displaced persons or 
Page  17
17
minorities who are not protected through national land compensation 
legislation.   
Operational Principle
 
5.
 Inform 
displaced persons of their rights, 
consult them on options, and 
provide them with technically and 
economically feasible resettlement 
alternatives and needed 
assistance, including (a) prompt 
compensation at full replacement 
cost for loss of assets attributable 
to the project; (b) if there is 
relocation, assistance during 
relocation, and residual housing, 
or housing sites, or agricultural 
sites of equivalent potential, as 
required; (c) transitional support 
and development assistance, such 
as land preparation, credit 
facilities, training or job 
opportunities as required, in 
addition to compensation 
measures; (d) cash compensation 
for land when the impact of 
 
land acquisition on livelihoods is 
minor; and (e) provision of civic 
infrastructure and community 
services as required. 
 
Owners are notified by letter of the intent to expropriate, which includes a copy 
of the minutes of the expropriation decision. Since compensation is in cash, 
affected people are not given different options; rather, it is assumed that they 
can use the compensation to choose their own options.  
(a) Land acquisition must be completed
—compensation must be paid and titles 
transferred—before a Construction License is issued for the investment. 
Compensation must be paid within the deadline established by the parties, or 
otherwise, by the deadline decided by the court. In case the deadline is settled 
by the Court it mustn’t exceed 30 days from court’s final judgment date.  
.
Compensation is at market value, plus prejudice, which is considered sufficient 
to replace assets and restore incomes, and therefore equivalent to replacement 
cost. Occupants without legal titles to affected land can be compensated for 
their lost above-ground assets, expressed as “value added.” Affected persons 
and third parties who seek compensation for prejudice must present their cases 
to negotiators or the court. Crop loss is the only form of damage that is 
explicitly stated in the law; claims for other losses must be documented by 
affected persons on a case-by-case basis. They must claim compensation as 
“prejudice.”  
(b) Residences are rarely affected. If they are, the residents of expropriated 
properties move to housing arranged by themselves, following negotiation, 
compensation and the transfer of titles. If they ultimately need to be evicted, the 
expropriator must provide another “dwelling space, in conformity with the 
law” (Art. 29 Expropriation Law). Tenants and illegal occupants of 
expropriated residences, even more rare, will be provided with acceptable 
alternative housing to which to move (Art. 29 Expropriation Law).  
(c) Relocation costs will be included in compensation for “prejudice.” Owners 
and others who have cause must make the claim for damages during the 
negotiation process or, in court, if their claim is not resolved to their 
satisfaction. The court renders the resolution on compensation levels that are 
under question. In the absence of strict guidelines, “prejudice” can cover a 
range of impacts, but it is up to the claimant to make the case.  
(d) Cash compensation is the norm. If most of a parcel is subject to 
expropriation, and the remainder is not viable or without value, the owner can 
ask the court for the expropriation of the entire plot. 
 (Art. 24 Expropriation Law).  
(e) No community-wide involuntary physical relocation that would require the 
development of new urban infrastructure and services is envisioned under the 
pilot projects. The expropriation law will apply to all expropriation related to 
project investments. In the unlikely event that an investment entails the 
relocation of individual households, people would move to residences with 
appropriate infrastructure and community services, rather than to green field 
sites.  
Operational Principle
 
6.
 Give 
preference to land-based 
resettlement strategies for 
displaced persons whose 
livelihoods are land-based. 
 
Expropriation laws and procedures are based on cash compensation at market 
rate, which is assumed to enable owners to purchase land to replace the 
expropriated land. Land replacement is not prohibited by the law, but it is not 
expected and it would be impractical in the Romanian context to make 
administered land substitution a standard policy, given limited amounts of state 
land and the prevalence of ownership issues related to re-privatization and 
restitution of previously nationalized lands.  Land can be bought and sold freely 
in urban and rural areas. The rural land market is open, but it is not really 
active, as sales are very limited. All informants claim that owners are generally  
amenable to sell land and buyers can find land easily. Reportedly, those who 
lose land to expropriation can readily purchase alternative land from others 
who would like to sell. Consequently, as the land market is open and active on 
Page  18
18
the supply side, affected persons use the market for land and housing, if needed, 
and there is sufficient supply of land and housing, a land-based expropriation 
strategy is not necessary.  Municipalities and local self-government authorities 
may own land that can be sold and/or exchanged to owners of expropriated 
land on a case-by case basis. When this occurs, if the alternative plot is either 
m
ore valuable or less valuable than the expropriated land, the difference is 
settled in cash.  
Operational Principle
 
7.
 For 
those without formal legal rights 
to lands or claims to such land 
that could be recognized under 
the laws of the country, provide 
resettlement assistance in lieu of 
compensation for land to help 
improve or at least restore their 
livelihoods
.
The expropriator/project developer advises owners about the registration 
process for unregistered lands. This is a mutual interest, as lands have to be 
registered to be purchased. People who have been using state land for 30 years 
can apply for ownership and registration (governed by the Civil and Civil 
Procedure Codes). Households living on or using land they do not own are only 
compensated for their “value added” contributions (lost above-ground assets) 
(Art. 26 and 28 Expropriation Law). There is no specific provision for 
resettlement assistance in lieu of compensation for land, except as it would be 
claimed and included under “prejudice.”  
Operational Principle 8.
 Disclose 
draft resettlement plans, including 
documentation of the consultation 
process, in a timely manner, 
before appraisal formally begins, 
in an accessible place and in a 
form and language that are 
understandable to key 
stakeholders. 
 
Proposals for expropriation and Location Permits and Technical Designs are 
prepared in the local language and made available in the respective county or 
local council office and the expropriator’s office and are posted in the official 
gazette and local newspapers before expropriation is initiated. Interested 
parties, including actual or potential affected persons, can register their 
concerns verbally or in writing when the expropriation decision is under 
consideration and later, after the Technical Design is completed. No formal 
resettlement or land acquisition plans are issued in addition to the 
documentation required to justify expropriation and the Technical Design, but 
these documents are essentially equivalent to the plans specified in the 
principle. Documentation of the consultation process includes the minutes of the 
expropriation decision and the findings of the commission established by the 
mayor respond to complaints and objections.   
Operational Principle
 
9.
 Apply 
the principles described in the 
involuntary resettlement section of 
this Table, as applicable and 
relevant, to subprojects requiring 
land acquisition. 
 
The principles apply to all aspects of an investment involving expropriation, at 
each level of government, including all subprojects.   
 
Operational Principle 10.
 Design, 
document, and disclose before 
appraisal of projects involving 
involuntary restriction of access 
to legally designated parks and 
protected areas, a participatory 
process for: (a) preparing and 
implementing project 
components; (b) establishing 
eligibility criteria; (c) agreeing on 
mitigation measures that help 
improve or restore livelihoods in 
a
manner that maintains the 
sustainability of the park or 
protected area; (d) resolving 
conflicts; and (e) monitoring 
implementation. 
 
Romanian law and practices do not require monitoring or assessment of the 
impact of expropriation. This is a divergence that will be addressed through 
independent monitoring and regular Bank supervision.   
 
Operational Principle 11.
 
Implement all relevant 
Expropriation must be completed before a Construction License is issued, 
which enables the project proponent/expropriator to start civil works.  There 
Page  19
19
resettlement plans before project 
completion and provide 
resettlement entitlements before 
displacement or restriction of 
access. For projects involving 
r
estriction of access, impose the 
restrictions in accordance with 
the timetable in the plan of 
actions. 
 
are no restrictions on access that require mitigation.  
 
Operational Principle 12.
 Assess 
whether the objectives of the 
resettlement instrument have been 
achieved, upon completion of the 
project, taking account of the 
baseline conditions and the 
results of resettlement monitoring. 
No ongoing monitoring of the expropriation process is required. Similarly, no 
follow-up assessments are undertaken, as compensation is assumed to be 
adequate unless it is revised by a court decision in response to a challenge. 
Analysis of Gaps  
 
There are no salient differences between Romanian expropriation laws and Table A1 of OP 
4.12 in the objectives and principles 1, 3, 8, 9 and 11. Principle 10 is not relevant for the 
pilot projects. The principles in which there are differences are discussed below, with 
abbreviated titles of the respective principles.  
 
Operational Principle 2. Census 
and Survey.
 
The expropriation documents and Technical Design include information on 
household land ownership, which constitutes a proxy for a household census.  
This operational principle also requires a baseline household socio-economic 
survey to be carried out. However, Romanian expropriation laws and 
procedures do not require a survey. The pilot projects primarily involve land 
acquisition, not physical relocation, and would not require affected persons to 
change occupations, for which a socio-economic survey might have some value. 
Therefore, this difference does not compromise the objectives or outcome of the 
process and this is not a significant gap that would need to be filled in order for 
the projects to be piloted under OP 4.12 
Operational Principle 4. 
Consultation, Entitlements and 
Special Groups.
 
The consultation and disclosure process is adequate, although a specific 
resettlement document is not required. The  documents prepared for the 
Expropriation Decision and the Technical Design can be considered reasonable 
proxies for the plan specified in the principle.  Eligibility for compensation is 
based on documentation of ownership or claims for damages. Within 15 days of 
the completion of the Technical Design, which identifies affected persons 
specifically, these are notified by letter of the intent to expropriate, along with a 
copy of the minutes of the Expropriation Decision. Negotiation for 
compensation can be complicated if the land is not titled and ownership is 
contested, however. The estimated cost of expropriation is included in the 
expropriation request and refined in the Technical Design, which includes 
estimates of the value of each parcel. Affected persons must request 
compensation f
or “prejudice,” during negotiation or in the court, if they are not 
Page  20
20
satisfied with the outcome of negotiations. The process does not give special 
consideration to the vulnerable or excluded groups, but that difference is not 
considered to be significant if (a) assessed valuation is adequate and consistent 
and (b) people are informed of their rights and entitlements. Informants 
indicated little experience with the issue of illegal occupation and squatters, 
a
nd this needs to be monitored closely during implementation.   
Operational Principle 5. Inform 
People of Rights, Compensate 
and Support Transition.
 
There are no provisions that require the expropriator to inform people of their 
rights. If information is provided, however, it is cursory and appears to be 
inadequate. This is a salient divergence from the principle which could have 
significant impact if it results in compensation below market value and people 
are unaware of opportunities to contest the amount. This gap will have to be 
filled. Prompt payment of compensation is required, and consistent with the 
principle, but violations of this principle in major highway construction have 
been reported, thus the issue will need to be monitored closely during 
implementation. Property values are assessed by certified assessors. Informants 
indicated some discrepancies in the extent to which specific assessment reports 
are prepared and whether they are prepared before or after negotiations. If the 
reports are prepared before negotiations, they are not necessarily shared with 
owners, thus potentially disadvantaging them in negotiations. This is a salient 
divergence which will be mitigated by standardizing the timing of assessments 
as well as requiring them to be shared with owners at the start of negotiations. 
The quality and consistency of assessors appears to be subject to dispute, which 
undermines public confidence in the valuation process and could result in 
under-valuation, which would violate the principle. This divergence in practice 
will be mitigated.  If people are adequately informed about their rights, a 
combination of compensation for assets and prejudice should be adequate for 
households to restore their assets, livelihoods and, if relevant, transition to 
another location. Improving the dissemination of information will help reduce 
the likelihood that compensation is inadequate, making the process and practice 
equivalent to the principle. To address the divergence in practice related to 
information dissemination, the letter that announces the intent to expropriate 
will be accompanied by a brochure that clearly describes the expropriation 
process and the rights of owners in the process, including the scope of 
prejudice.  If affected persons are compensated adequately for their losses, 
there is land is available for owners to make their own adjustments, thus the 
divergence from the principle of a land based strategy is not considered to be 
material. Special cases involving major land losses and the loss of businesses 
and residences would need to be managed on a case-by-case basis in 
consultation with the Bank.   
Operational Principle 6. 
Preference for a Land Based 
Strategy.
 
The use of cash compensation for expropriation in Romania differs from the 
principle that compensation of people displaced from land-based livelihoods 
and expropriation should be land based. Given the complex landholding 
situation in Romania and the lack of availability of State land that could be 
traded, and given the availability of private land for purchase and open access 
to the land market, the current arrangement is adequate to enable affected 
households to pursue a land based solution on their own, if they so desire. This 
difference from the principle is therefore not considered to be significant.  
Operational Principle 7. Provide 
Resettlement Assistance to those 
Without Formal Legal Rights to 
Land.
 
Informants indicated little experience expropriating land used by people who 
are without use or ownership rights. Romanian law does not make specific 
provision to compensate people without legal rights to land, although they may 
be eligible to claim damages (prejudice). It is not expected that the pilot 
projects will encounter such situations, and Bank and Romanian authorities will 
establish a mechanism to address this issue in the unlikely event that people 
without legal title to land are affected by the pilot projects. Each case should 
subsequently be monitored.
