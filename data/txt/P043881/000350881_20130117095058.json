There were some important\n            project lessons learned. Where difficult reforms and\n            entrenched interests are involved, the Bank should require\n            more concrete evidence of commitment to the project's\n            objectives before approval. As such, the Law on Land\n            Reclamation should have been made a condition of\n            negotiations rather than a condition of effectiveness.\n            During implementation, when it became clear that the\n            government commitment to the project was no longer there,\n            the Bank should have acted more proactively to suspend or\n            drastically restructure the project. The economic analysis\n            of projects under preparation should be used as an iterative\n            planning and design tool, rather than as a simple requisite\n            to justify pre-defined investments. Project impact could be\n            significantly enhanced and failures reduced, as the best\n            investment alternatives are better checked and identified at appraisal."}, "docdt": "2012-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
