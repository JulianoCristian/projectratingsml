                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation progressed both with respect to rehabilitation of main irrigation infrastructure in three schemes and support for strengthening the Water Users' Organizations
                         (WUO) within and outside the project area. Insufficient funds allocated to the project in 2010 did not allow for implementation of all activities planned for WUO support, affecting
                         mostly procurement of irrigation equipment, installation of water meters in the pressure pumping stations owned by WUOs and rehabilitation of on-farm infrastructure. Insufficient
                         funds (by about $20 million) have also been provisionally allocated to the project for 2011, which would affect not only project implementation but also meeting the project

                         The current limited availability of funds for project implementation is one of the effects of the economic and financial crisis which seriously affected Romania in 2010 and is likely to
                         continue in 2011, imposing tough budget austerity actions. In addition, the government changed the rules of public financing in 2009 and decided to pre-finance the project activities
                         and seek reimbursement from the loans, thus depending fully on cash available in the budget. So, although sufficient funds are available in the Loan account, the Borrower's strict
                         regulations for management of scarce fiscal space under the current economic and financial crisis impose limited fund allocations to the implementing agencies, in this case the
                         Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

                         The National Administration of Land Reclamation (ANIF) continues to operate inefficiently and with little attention to farmers' needs. Therefore, a thorough review of ANIF current
                         functional and organization arrangements, with reflection on customer relations is urgently needed to identify the means to enhance its functioning. Instead, The Ministry of
                         Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has drafted a new law to restructure ANIF and replace its local units (regional branches and scheme-based management units) with 42
                         state-owned county-based commercial companies requiring substantial budget support, a structure which proved unsustainable in 1991-1994.

                         The irrigation activity diminished drastically (by 75%) in 2010 compared with 2009 both because sufficient rainfall fell during the cropping season and because MARD stopped
                         distribution of operational subsidies which were in conflict with the EU Common Agricultural Policy.

                         additional funds some of the works contracts underway would not be completed within project lifetime and would have to be continued until completion with budgetary funds. In the
                         same time, substantial loan funds (about $10 million) would remain unused and the Borrower may have to cancel them from the loan.

                         A thorough analysis of ANIF organization, functions, and activities by MARD is needed to identify the weak points and remedies to correlate its organization and functions with the
                         sector reform principles, focusing on its core functions. ANIF's operational inefficiency and deficient relations with farmers should be addressed by in-depth governance reform that
                         make ANIF deconcentrate, accountable to users and transparent. Increased responsibilities need to be delegated to branches and administrative units (AU) by establishing legal
                         personality for regional branches and decentralizing the decision-making responsibility at branch and AU level for operative activities. Beneficiaries' role in supervision of ANIF
                         activities at branch and AU level need to be strengthened by restoring the functionality of supervisory boards at both branch and scheme level. In addition, it is important that the
                         economically unviable irrigation schemes be closed down and written-off ANIF books while utilization of viable schemes with gravity or low pumping supply is strongly encouraged
                         through infrastructure rehabilitation.
