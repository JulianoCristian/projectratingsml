                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards meeting the project development objectives is mixed. Most of the area contracted for irrigation in 2011 (about 90% countrywide and 100% in the project area) is
                         located on lower terraces requiring water lift of less than 70 m from water source. In addition, anecdotal evidence shows that most irrigation has been contracted for cash crops which
                         better pay for irrigation. The rehabilitation of main irrigation infrastructure have been completed in Campia Covurlui scheme and are in advanced stage for Terasa Brailei North, likely
                         to be completed by end-July. However, the rehabilitation works for Terasa Viziru scheme progressed slowly because of insufficient funding available for this contract in the budget

                         allocated to the project in 2011. In addition, the support program for strengthening the Water Users' Organizations (WUO) within and outside the project area was put on hold
                         because of the insufficient funds allocated to the project in 2011. There is hope for additional funds be allocated at the upcoming budget rectification not only for completion of the

                         ongoing contract for rehabilitation of Terasa Viziru scheme but for continuing to the end the WUO support program too. Otherwise, some of the expected outputs would not be
                         achieved with impact on project outcomes.

                         Although the farmers# behavior changed with project support, the National Administration of Land Reclamation (ANIF) continues to operate inefficiently and with less attention to
                         farmers# needs, mainly because of the unfinished reforms agreed at the project outset as part of overall institutional reform in agriculture and rural development.

                         The downward trend in irrigation activity started in 2010 after the operational subsidies stopped appears to continue in 2011; the area contracted at country level is smaller than in
                         2010 by 95,000 ha (338,000 ha compared with 423,000 ha), while in the project area the area contracted for 2011 is 45% of total command area (compared with 62% in 2010). This
                         also shows the adaptation of farmers to high costs of irrigation and the emerging signs of irrigation use mainly by commercial farmers and mostly for cash crops. The operational
                         costs could be reduced through rehabilitation and modernization of primary and secondary infrastructure, thus reducing the energy consumption and reducing the water losses.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government should allocate additional funds of about $12 million in the second half of 2011 (as part of budget rectification) to allow completion of the ongoing works contract for
                         Terasa Viziru scheme and contracting additional activities under the WUO support program. In addition, about $5 million would be needed in 2012 to finance the activities completed
                         before project closing. This would allow for completion of all activities planned and to meet the project development objectives.

                         The review of the National Administration of Land Reclamation (ANIF) organization, functions, and activities by MARD needs to take place as soon as possible to adapt it to the
                         changing financial conditions and correlate its organization and functions with the sector reform principles, in accordance with the local public administration reform intended in
                         Romania. An in-depth governance reform would make ANIF decentralize, accountable to users and transparent, with increased decision-making responsibilities delegated to local
                         level units and strengthening the role of beneficiaries in ANIF management and supervision. It is important that the economically nonviable irrigation schemes be closed down and
                         written-off ANIF books while utilization of viable schemes with gravity or low pumping supply be strongly encouraged through infrastructure rehabilitation. For this, MARD needs to
                         review and approve the investment strategy for rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation schemes and start its implementation even in 2012 with state budget funding.
