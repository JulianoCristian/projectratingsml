Project\n            will help the Ecuadorian Training Service carry out its long\n            range development plan by: (i) increasing output of its\n            centers and mobile units annually to about 2,800 new skilled\n            workers and by upgrading skills of about 13,400 workers;\n            (ii) improving quality of instruction through equipment\n            installation, teacher training, and instructional materials\n            production; and (iii) strengthening SECAP's planning,\n            supervision, and evaluation ability. Ten new training\n            centers will be built and equipped, two existing centers\n            will be expanded and another re-equipped, five mobile\n            training units will be acquired, and a facility for\n            instructor training and materials production will be\n            provided. Technical assistance and training for SECAP staff\n            will improve the capacity of the institution to plan and\n            deliver training programs."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
