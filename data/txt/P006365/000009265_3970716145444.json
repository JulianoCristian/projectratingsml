While these components did much to\n            improve access to services, they were generally not designed\n            to improve the management and quality of health services.\n            The Bank's first free-standing health project (Ln.\n            2061-BR), in Rondonia, was designed to improve, among other\n            things, access to basic health services. A second health\n            project (Ln. 2447-BR) was approved in June 1984. It aimed at\n            supporting the development of a new model of basic health\n            services in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo by addressing\n            health care needs in an equitable and efficient manner. In\n            April 1985 the Brazilian Government approved a 15-year\n            development plan for the Northeast region. The health part\n            of this plan was the Northeast Basic Health Services Project\n            which would be implemented in three phases, according to the\n            different capacities of the states to carry it out. The\n            Government of Brazil requested Bank financial support to\n            that effect. The main objective of the Project was to\n            support the Borrower's effort to improve equity,\n            efficiency and effectiveness of basic health care in the\n            project area by: (a) improving and expanding the operation\n            of the basic health facilities network; and (b) improving\n            the institutional capabilities of the Ministry of Health\n            (MOH) and State Health Secretariats (SESs). The project was\n            designed to assist the Government in improving the health\n            status of the rural poor, about 5 million small farm\n            families, living in four states of the Northeast of Brazil\n            (Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, Piaui and a part of Minas Gerais)."}, "docdt": "1997-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
