                         It is also important to highlight the successful implementation of the GOPBA pilots in Morocco, the World Bank launched a Documentary movie on November 29th, 2011 at its
                         headquarters, in Washington DC, to initiate a discussion with project stakeholders and experts on this leading experience and strengthen opportunities for adopting this approach
                         throughout Morocco but also in other countries.
