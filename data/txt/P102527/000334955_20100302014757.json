The extension is necessary to\n            allow the full utilization of the Grant's proceeds.\n            Some delays in the implementation have been due to obstacles\n            independent from the three service providers regarding which\n            encouraging progress have been noted during the last\n            supervision mission. In addition to this, the current\n            numbers of household connected do not reflect the current\n            progress in the extension of distribution lines within the\n            targeted areas which will soon lead to a higher rate of\n            household connections. The extension will allow further\n            achieving the project's development objective through\n            the provision of subsidized access to water and sanitation\n            to an additional 8,500 poor households currently without\n            services.
