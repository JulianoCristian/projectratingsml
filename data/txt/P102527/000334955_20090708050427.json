The project will be\n            coordinated and administered by the Ministry of Interior,\n            and implemented by the three incumbent providers of water\n            supply and sewerage services in the three selected urban\n            centers, namely Casablanca, Tangiers, and Meknes. All\n            participating utilities will promote the 'National\n            Initiative for Human Development-Global Partnership on\n            Output-Based Aid (INDH-GPOBA) connection program' to\n            households in the selected 'quartiers', will\n            receive applications from individual households, make\n            connections and be reimbursed a pre-agreed amount upon\n            evidence of a functional and used connection.
