Services Project for Morocco were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and grantee\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: the experience in Meknes revealed that the public\n            sector could also bear the performance risk and that a\n            public utility provider could successfully adopt the\n            Output-Based Aid (OBA) methodology to ensure the provision\n            of basic services to the neglected segments of the\n            population. Organization of awareness and information\n            campaigns was crucial to guaranteeing the populations buy-in\n            in the social program.

Addressing the\n            poor in informal settlements relies on experience, mature\n            knowledge and adequate strategy on the part of the\n            operators. Monitoring and evaluation is key to achieving a\n            rigorous framework to measure, report, and amend especially\n            to ensure successful replication of the Pilot.
