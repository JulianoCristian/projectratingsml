                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Grant made available by GPOBA has been fully committed. Amendis-Tanger is the first operator to have committed 100% of the subsidy allocated to Tangier, thereby

                         completing its pilot at the end of June 2010. RADEM in Meknes was in the same position by the end of September 2010. LYDEC in Casablanca has consistently set records high
                         connection delivery rate each quarter of 2010 and jumped its completion rate from 24% to 93% completion rate in 2010. LYDEC delivered more connections by the end of March
                         2011 to allow committing the remainder of the subsidy made available to the Casablanca pilot. The pilot allowed providing subsidized access to water supply to a total of 10,484
                         households and sanitation services to a total of 9,016 households. 5,573 households in Casablanca and 2,909 in Tangiers were simultaneously connected to water supply and
                         sanitation services. in Meknes, 2,002 households got access to water supply services and 534 to sanitation services.

                         Although the GPOBA Grant has reached the maximum number of connection it allowed subsidizing under each pilot, the needs for additional connection remains great and the
                         operators continued to deliver connections under the same conditions, but without subsidy... There is therefore an immediate need for concrete action from the Government to to
                         decide and implement the program to bridge the gap of service deficit to low-income population in periurban settlements throughout Morocco. The discontinuity between the pilots
                         and their scale up should be minimized, in order to capitalize on the momentum generated by the GPOBA Grant.

                         Taking into consideration the two tranche disbursement arrangements under this Pilot, the Operators and the Government requested another extension to allow disbursement of the
                         subsidy for connections made in each pilot. A second extension of the Grant closing date was agreed. The revised closing date of the Grant Agreement is December 31, 2011.
