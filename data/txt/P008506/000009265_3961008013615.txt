MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN
FOR A SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the equivalent of US$41.1 million to help finance a
Social Protection Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity
of 17 years, including five years of grace.
Country/Sector Background
2.           At independence in 1992, Kazakhstan inherited a reasonably well-developed industrial
base. Industry, dominated by mining and processing activities, accounted for about 40% of GDP and
agriculture 34%. Per capita GNP was estimated at US$1,690. Trade was heavily dependent on
exchanges with other FSU republics, especially Russia, which in 1991 accounted for 91 % of exports and
88% of imports. The economic situation in the country since 1992 has deteriorated sharply. GDP
declined by 15% per annum in 1992 and by 25% in 1994. The monthly inflation accelerated throughout
1993 and early 1994, to peak at 35 percent monthly during the second quarter of 1994. It has declined
sharply since, to 5 percent a month by March 1995. The decline has been in response to the tightening
of monetary policies, which followed the inter-enterprise arrears refinancing of April 1994. While
registered unemployment has remained low, real wages fell by 30% in 1992, 7% in 1993, and an
estimated 23% in 1994.
3.           The Government's reform program progressed well initially, before stalling somewhat
in 1993 and the first half of 1994. A new Government appointed in October 1994 and confirmed in
March 1995 has shown greater commitment to deepening critical reforms. Enterprise restructuring and
privatization have been important elements of the reform program, with the adoption of a three-pronged
approach to privatization, embodied in a "National privatization program for 1993-95". Under the Soviet
system, enterprises functioned both as productive units and instruments of state social protection policy.
This encouraged overstaffing, which is estimated to have been in the range of 20-30%. In addition,
non-cash income constituted a substantial proportion of labor remuneration: housing, kindergartens, health
facilities, food stores, and other facilities. As budget constraints on enterprises have increased, the
management response has been to place workers on unpaid leave or part-time work, resulting in
increasing under-employment. Enterprises are likely to be forced to lay off workers permanently, as state
credits dry up and increasing numbers of enterprises are privatized, and current under-employment
converts to open unemployment. The Bank estimates that open unemployment could reach around 10%
by the end of 1996. These developments will increase the potential for social dislocation, and place new
and increasing burdens on the Employment Service (ES).
4.           Overall, non-productive social assets accounted for 31 % of all capital assets in Kazakhstan
at the end of 1991; 63% was housing stock owned by enterprises, 11% municipal services, 10% health
care facilities, and 5 % educational facilities. Other enterprise social assets included sanatoria, children's
summer camps, sport and cultural facilities, and subsidized canteens. In many areas, enterprises have
provided social services not only to current and past employees and their families, but also to members
of the surrounding community. Under the economic transition, many of these social assets are being



-2-
transferred to the local administrations, which do not have the institutional and financial means to meet
the minimum operating or rehabilitation costs. Key aspects of the Government's economic restructuring
program, therefore, are to establish the financial and institutional conditions for the divestiture of these
assets in an organized and non-disruptive way, including provision for their irmnediate needs to maintain
essential services.
Project Objectives
5.           The project seeks to: (a) develop the capacity of the Employment Service (ES) in the
Department of Employment (DOE) of the Ministry of Labor (MOL) to manage the expected increase in
the number of registered unemployed and attendant benefit claims following the restructuring and
privatization of enterprises; and (b) ensure continued availability of essential social services, by promoting
orderly divestiture of social assets from enterprises, and efficient management by municipalities of a
unified system of services. The project would be implemented with a view to determining suitable
models for the design and implementation of a comprehensive national strategy for the divestiture of
enterprise social assets, thereby removing obstacles to restructuring, and enhancing the competitiveness
of enterprises. The project would provide the institutional underpinning for the implementation of social
policies supported by the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL).
Project Description
6.           To meet these objectives, the project has two main components: an Employment Service
Component to be implemented at both the national and regional levels; and a Social Services
Component, to be implemented in selected cities of South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar oblasts.
7.           The Employment Service Component would strengthen the institutional capacity of the
ES to register the unemployed and calculate and pay unemployment benefits; provide a more effective
service to unemployed jobseekers; and analyze labor markets and formulate labor market policies. It
would also develop a sharper focus for training and retraining of the unemployed, particularly women
and youth, through orienting the work of the ES towards promoting demand-driven training and through
a greater use of external training providers.
8.           With technical assistance under a Japanese Grant, the DOE has conmmenced work on a
number of initiatives, including a review of its organizational structure to provide stronger management
and direction to the ES. It has also initiated a revision of existing procedures for dealing with the
unemployed. The project would help accelerate this work and concentrate on specific strategies for
improving the overall operational effectiveness of the ES. Project financing under the ES component
would support: (a) institutional strengthening of the ES; (b) development and implementation of a
simplified unemployment benefits (UB) system and service delivery; (c) training and development of staff;
and (d) a pilot program in three oblasts (para. 12) to strengthen counselling and retraining of the
unemployed. Particular attention would be given to assisting women and young workers, who are most
affected by unemployment. The component would comprise four sub-components:
Inistitutional Strengthening (US$1.2 million of base costs)
9.           The sub-component would concentrate on improving the skills and experience of senior
managers in policy development, operational planning and financial management.



-3-
Unemployment Benefits and Service Delivery (US$13.7 million of base costs)
10.          This sub-component is designed to improve 2;he daily operations of the ES. The
operations would be upgraded through the preparation of new guidelines and procedures for basic
employment center functions, including assessing the eligibility of applicants for unemployment benefits.
Employment Offices (EO) would be upgraded and re-equipped to cope with the growing number of
unemployed. The project would finance 20 months of technical assistance, computer equipment, and the
establishment of a Model Office (MO) in each of the 19 oblasts of the country.
Staff Training and Development (US$0.4 million of base costs)
11.          The large increase in numbers of unemployed needing assistance from EOs would place
additional demands on staff working in these offices. This sub-cornponent aims at strengthening the
organizational capacity at the supervisory and operational levels to respond to the increasing demaands.
While much of the traininig would be procedural - e.g. in new rules for administerilig UB - it would also
include the introduction of new systems and improved mechanisms. Training would also focus in
providing staff with multi-skills to enable them to handle a variety of tasks.
Pilot Programs for Training and Retraining of the Unemployed (US$0.4 mIllion of base costs)
12.          This sub-component is intended to assist the ES to develop a sharper focus for training
and retraining of the unemployed through orienting the work of training ceiiters, under the MOL, towards
demand-driven training and a greater use of external training providers. The sub-component would lun
as a pilot program in three training centers -- Almaty, Pavlodar and Sbvmkenit.
13.          The Social Services Component would facilitate the transfer of essential social services
from restructuring enterprises to local governments, and rationalize managemrent of all basiC socLial
services in five selected cities -- South Kazakhstan Oblast: Shymkent City, Keraau. and Lenger; anid
Pavlodar Oblast: Pavlodar City and Aksu. Local social service budget management would be reformed
and social assistance targeting improved. While different types of socially irnportant facilities are run hy
the enterprises, the project would focus only on essential services such as health and early education,
which are critical elements of the social safety net.
14.          The component would comprise a pilot project in a limited numbei of oilasts and cities.
The pilot would be monitored and evaluated early in the process in conjunctiion with annual work
programs and budgets in order to draw lessons that can be integrated into the implementation of a national
strategy for an orderlv transfer of social assets from enterprises to local administrations, or for their
privatization. Consistent with the pilot nature of the project, the Social Service Component would be
implemented in the five selected cities of South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar Oblast outlined above
15.          The component would provide support for management efficiency irmprovements, capital
and incremental recurrent costs and technical assistance for kindergartens and medical facilities. The
main vehicle for the component would be rationalization plans for the managemrent of social services.
On the basis of the plans and taking into account other factors that might subsequently emerge. local
administrations would be expected to manage the transfer of assets andi maintain these services at
acceptable standards. Specific monitoring arrangements wouid be put in place and regular reviews carried
out to ensure that the plans agreed upon with the cities are implemnenited in a timiely manner. Continued
funding would be subject to satisfactory progress with the implementation of the rationalization plans.



-4-
The component has two main sub-components: (i) Social Service Support, and (ii) Institutional Support.
Social Services Support (US$28.5 million of base costs)
16.          This sub-component would finance upgrading and rehabilitation of critical infrastructure
of social facilities in two categories: health (modest rehabilitation of hospitals and polyclinics, and
purchase of essential medical equipment, supplies, vaccines and drugs), and education (modest
rehabilitation of kindergartens and provision of training materials and books). In addition, project
financing would support incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis and with local counterpart
contribution. The oblasts/cities will be responsible for interest payments on the loan and the central
Government for the repayment of the principal. The project would include rationalization of local social
service budget management. To this end, the project would aim at improving management of oblast and
municipal public expenditures, so as to rationalize social expenditures and improve targeting of social
assistance.
Institutional Support (US$2.6 million of base costs)
17.          Institutional support would be provided by financial, health care and kindergartens
management specialists. Additional short-term technical assistance would be financed in areas such as
medical equipment/supplies, pharmaceuticals, civil engineering, social impact monitoring, and social
service management training.
18.          In order to maintain the momentum achieved during project preparation and to ensure
early project start-up, the Loan would provide for retroactive financing up to 10 percent of the loan
amount in respect of expenditures incurred since January 1995. Expenditures would relate to works for
refitting of employment offices and facilities to be supported under the Social Service Component, and
for incremental recurrent costs for the Social Services Component.
Project Implementation
19.          The Borrower of the Loan would be the Republic of Kazakhstan. The proposed project
would be implemented by three implementing agencies -- the Ministry of Labor would be responsible for
the Employment Service Component, and the administrations of South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar oblasts
for the Social Service Component. Overall responsibility for project coordination would rest with a
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) established in the Ministry of Finance.  In addition to overall
coordination, the PCU would be responsible for common implementation functions such as project
accounting, procurement, disbursements, consolidation for submission to the Bank of annual work
programs and budgets, and progress and annual reports. The PCU would be supported by a Project
Coordinating Council (PCC), whose main task would be to oversee project implementation. The inter-
ministerial Working Group established to provide policy guidance for the preparation of the project would
become the PCC. The PCC would be chaired by a senior management official of the Ministry of
Finance. As the Working Group, the PCC would be integrated by high-level representation (minister and
deputy minister level) from the Apparatus of the Government, the Ministries of Finance, Economy,
Labor, Social Protection, Health, Education, and Justice, oblast and city authorities, the State Committee
on Management of State Property, and the State Committee on Privatization. The PCC would meet once
every three months or more frequently when necessary.



-5-
20.           In addition, to ensure efficient implementation of all project activities, Component
Coordinators (CCs) for each component have been nominated from existing staff in MOL and the oblasts
and city administrations in the participating cities. The CCs would be the focal points for all project
activities related to their components and would report directly to the minister/authority concerned. These
arrangements would remove the need to create a separate structure within each implementing agency.
The investments to be financed under the project would not produce the desired results if the overall
management of the social assets is not improved. The project includes technical assistance and training
to local and national administrators in the areas of financial and budgetary management and expenditure
control and reporting. Assistance would be directed particularly towards developing sector-specific
management skills in the health and education sectors, so that, in addition to the benefits to facilities
supported by the project, there would be efficiency gains in the management of primary and secondary
education.
Project Sustainabiity
21.           Cost increases for budget social services as a result of divestiture will be offset by the
end of the project by: (i) rationalization/cost savings in the health and kindergarten systems; (ii) fee
revenue in the project cities, from the introduction of health care user charges and increases in
kindergarten fees; and (iii) removal/reduction of inefficiencies within the municipal kindergarten system,
resulting in savings without affecting the quality of service (e.g. more competitive procurement practices).
After the project, the Government will not be required to spend more in real terms, than it does currently
on the selected services in the project cities. In addition, creation of replicable models for sustained
implementation of social services divested by enterprises would promote competitiveness of enterprises
in the selected localities. In the Employment Service side, the project will help to develop unemployment
assistance policies which will balance more effectively fiscal and social protection objectives. In terms
of institutional sustainability, the project would finance technical assistance and training of Employment
Service and financial staff within central Ministries, the PCU, and the two oblasts. This would ensure
adequate numbers of skilled officials to provide improved UB and service delivery and design and
implement improved social service budget management practices throughout the country.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement
22.           Bank experience in implementing Employment Service projects in other countries
suggests that the quality of staff is critical. Upgrading staff skills, automation with well selected
computer applications, and proactive measures such as retraining, counselling and temporary employment
schemes are essential.  Regarding social asset divestiture, although the Bank has not, to date,
implemented such a project, operations dealing with this matter are being prepared for Russia and China.
In addition, under the on-going Russia Privatization Implementation Assistance Loan, US$20 million were
reallocated in August 1994, at the request of the Government, to help finance a component in support of
the divestiture of kindergartens from privatized enterprises to municipal authorities. Evidence from
elsewhere in the FSU and in Kazakhstan itself, as well as from parts of Eastern and Central Europe,
suggests that enterprise social services need to be transferred to local governments or to other providers
in order for enterprise restructuring and workers layoffs to take place. Orderly divestiture arrangements
are necessary to ensure continued access to basic social services for large sections of the population.
These observations are supported by OED, which has concluded that the Bank should place greater
emphasis on project-related institutional development and financial management, including cost recovery
and adequate counterpart funds, in the preparation and implementation of projects.



-6-
Rationale for Batik Involvement
23.           Kazakhlstaii is entering its third year as an indepeindenit nation. After bold reforms in the
first yea . the Government has had to contend with the complexities of implementing the transition to a
market economy while at the same time trying to maintain its existing system of social provision and
protection. The Government now recognizes that it cannot afford its system of social protection and
accepts that it needs to change it. It has made enterprise reform and restructuring a key element of its
economic reform program. The project addresses directly the Government's concern to strengthen its
institutional capacity to carry out reforms in social sectors at the pace necessary to support the economic
transition. It also addresses an important element of the Governrent's economic reform program -- to
adopt suitable and affordable social safety net measures to protect the unemployed during this period of
dramatic change, ln line with Bank concerns about poverty reduction and promoting the efficient use of
resources, the prsoject would support measures to strengthen the social safety net to protect vulnerable
groups, particuilarly retrenched workers and the long-term unemployed; develop institutional capacity to
improve the functionirig of the labor market; speed up redeployment of skills to support the emerging
nmarket economy; and support the process of divestiture of social assets from enterprises to ensure the
continuation of essential social services while promoting the competitiveness of enterprises.
24.           rhe project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the
Board in the context of the Technical Assistance Project (Ln-3642-KZ) on August 3, 1993. The CAS
planned a series of adjustment operations that started in 1993 with a Rehabilitation Loan (Ln-3649-KZ),
which is being followed by a Str;uctural Adjustment Loan. scheduled for Board Presentation in June 1995.
The proposed project, togetlher with the Financial and Enterprises Development Project, approved by the
Board in April 1995, would provide the institutional underpinning for the implementation of policies
supported by the SAL. In addition, as discussed in the CAS the project focuses on developing the
capacity of relevant Government agencies to design and implement a targeted and cost-effective system
of social protection, including deepening the capacity and enhancing the efficiency of the Employment
Service Specifically, the proposed project would strengthen the institutional capacity of the Employment
Service, and would ensure continued delivery of essentia! social services, by promoting orderly divestiture
of social asse!s from enteiprises, and efficient management by municipalities of a unified system of social
services. This would allow acceleration of the privatization program as the social responsibilities of state
enterprises are transferred to local governments.  The status of Bank Group operations and IFC
investments is shown in Schedule D.
Agreed Actions
25.           At negotiations, the Government and the Bank agreed tihat prior to Loan effectiveness
the Borrower would: (a) fuirnish to the Bank evaluation reports of proposals for the provision of technical
assistance services for: (i) the Project Coordination Unit/the Social Service Component and (ii) the
Employment Service Cornponent and (b) have executed subsidiary agreements with each participating
oblast and city. As part of the agreed Implementation Program, the Government, in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank will: (a) by December 31, 1995, design a comprehensive national strategy, for
the divestiture of social assets of state-owned and state-controlled enterprises, and develop, as part of such
strategy, a set of principles covering access to essential social services; (b) by June 30, 1996, adopt
policies related to eligibility of unemployment benefits beyond the existing six-month period; define
alternative support and training options for school graduates and other new or returning entrants into the
labor market; streamlinie the procedures for applying for unemployment benefits, including delegating
responsibility for approval of unemployment benefits from the existing commissions to the staff of the
Employment Service; and develop guidelines to modify its overall staffing distribution.



-7-
Poverty Category
26.           The project falls into the category of "Program of Targeted Interventions". Because the
unemployed include a greater proportion of poor people than in the population at large, and the poor have
less access to private social facilities, their benefit under the project would be substantially larger than
their proportion in the overall population.
Environmental Aspects
27.           The proposed project comprises technical assistance, training, introduction of management
information systems, modest rehabilitation of health care facilities and kindergartens; and provision of
essential medical equipment and drugs. As such, no adverse impact on the environment is expected from
the proposed project (Screening Category C).
Program Objective Categories
28.           The proposed project would make a direct contribution to better public administration and
regional economic management by: improving the policy making capacity of the Employment Service,
fostering rationalization of local social service budget management; and improving public social
investment programs in the selected cities.
Participatory Approach
29.           Both technical and management staff from the Ministry of Labor and oblast/city
administrations were closely involved in design/preparation of the proposed project. In addition, as far
as feasible, views of social services' beneficiaries have been taken into account in defining essential
services and general service standards.
Project Benefits
30.           The policy making capacity of the Employment Service would be improved, and the basis
laid for a program of social protection to retrenched workers. The provision of an effective social safety
net would reduce constraints on labor mobility and improve public support for the Government's
economic strategy. Enterprise restructuring would be facilitated in the selected cities by the orderly
divestiture of social assets. The project would foster rationalization of local social service budget
management and improve public social investment programs in the selected cities. Improvements in the
cost effectiveness of local social expenditures would have a net positive impact on the central budget,
minimizing the need for increased budgetary allocations resulting from divestiture, while allowing local
governments to operate additional divested social services. Experience with the rationalization programs
in the two oblasts would facilitate replication/improvement of the approach subsequently throughout the
country. The project would finance training of financial staff within central Ministries, the PCU and the
oblasts, which would ensure adequate number of skilled officials to design and implement improved social
service budget management practices, throughout the country.



-8-
Risks
31.          In a newly independent country undergoing fundamental economic transformation, there
is an inevitable risk of policy changes and implementation delays. The project faces five main risks: (i)
the Government's limited experience with Bank-financed projects and overall limited administrative
capacity; (ii) the complexity of the issues to be addressed; (iii) introduction of user fees for health care
services and increase of kindergartens fees may be delayed because changes in the legislation need to be
introduced; (iv) the Government may find it difficult to sustain the level of management, coordination,
and budgetary effort required to succeed in the divestiture process; and (v) delays in implementing policy
reforms may jeopardize project implementation. The project would help offset these risks by: putting
in place strong institutional arrangements; implementing the Social Services Component in oblasts/cities
where the local administrations are committed to implementing structural changes in the social sector,
through rationalization of social service expenditures, generating substantial cost savings in the running
of social assets; providing management support and training for the implementation of the rationalization
plans, including building a national capacity through the training of financial staff both at the central and
oblast/city level; and providing technical assistance to the ES to implement improved organizational
procedures prior to project start-up. In addition, the project's technical assistance inputs and the reporting
relationships and responsibilities of the PCU are being designed so as to minimize the risks, which would
also be given particular attention by supervision missions.
Recommendation
32.          I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
