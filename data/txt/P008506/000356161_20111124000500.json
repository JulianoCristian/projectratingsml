To meet these objectives,\n            the project has two main components: 1) an Employment\n            Service (ES) Component to be implemented at both national\n            and regional levels; and a Social Services Component, to be\n            implemented in selected cities of South Kazakstan and\n            Pavlodar oblasts. The Employment Service (ES) Component will\n            strengthen the institutional capacity of the ES to register\n            the unemployed and calculate and pay unemployment benefits;\n            provide a more effective service to unemployed jobseekers;\n            and analyze labor markets and formulate labor market\n            policies.
