impact as negligible, Bank\n            performance as satisfactory, and borrower performance as\n            unsatisfactory. In late 1998, the Republic introduced\n            drastic policy changes regarding social protection and\n            employment services which completely undermined the\n            rationale for the project. The 1998 Russian financial crisis\n            and diminishing oil revenue were important in motivating the\n            government's 1998 policy changes and affected the\n            implementation of the project. The key lessons learned\n            include: An investment project not linked to a policy-based\n            loan has little ability to influence policy. By mid-1999, it\n            was evident that the priorities of the government had\n            changed and no longer included the goals for which the\n            project had been established. Where appropriate, the Bank\n            should give greater consideration to project closure.\n            Building capacity among regional and local officials at the\n            point of service delivery can yield large benefits."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
