MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:          Project Completion Report on Guinea - Mineral
Sector Management Proiect (Credit 1637-GUI)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Guinea - Mineral Sector
Management Project (Credit 1637-GUI)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office, with Part II contributed
by the Borrower.
The project appears to have had positive results in assisting the Guinean Government conduct
negotiation with Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinea and to restructure the contract in such a way as to
augment the export tonnages and fiscal revenues. Unfortunately this conclusion is not well supported by
data in the PCR and we, therefore, consider the PCR in its current form as inadequate. The PCR also
contains some data errors in the project cost tables.
Part II of the report speaks of an underlying tension between the Bank and the borrower in the
matter of consultation. The borrower complains that its working level staff were not sufficiently consulted
in contract negotiations with the foreign consultants; nor were they fully integrated into the preparation of
the project reports.
The sustainability of this project is doubtful, especially in areas of management and project
execution once technical assistance is terminated or the operating budget is depleted. The PCR should have
included recommendations to ensure sustainability for the project benefits.
The project is likely to form part of a cluster audit based on similar projects in Sub-Saharan Africa.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUINEA
MINERAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1637-GUI)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Mineral Sector Management
Project in Guinea for which Credit 1637-GUI in the amount of SDR 3.7 million, (equivalent
to US$3.9), was approved on November 26, 1985. The Credit was closed on December 31,
1990, six months behind schedule. It was fully disbursed except for an amount of SDR
3,880.36, which was canceled.
The PCR was prepared jointly by the Energy Division of Asia Technical
Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and by the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of the PCR was started during the Bank's final Supervision Mission
in July 1991, and is based, inter alia, on the President's Report, supervision reports, legal
documents, miscellaneous correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower and internal
Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUINEA
MINERAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1637-GUI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives. The project objectives were to: (a) strengthen Guinea's capabilities
to represent, as shareholder, its economic and commercial interests in ongoing and new
proposed mining activities so as to maximize benefits from these operations; (b) improve the
mining sector investment climate so as to accelerate mineral development, in particular the
flow of exploration capital; and (c) increase the Government's efficiency in meeting these
objectives (para. 3.01).
Implementation. The Credit Effectiveness was delayed by almost a year due to
the failure of the Government to publish promptly the Credit Agreement in the prescribed
form. As a result the dated covenants on consultant selection and publication of the
Investment Code became Conditions of Effectiveness. A waiver of the latter was granted
(para. 5.01).
Once the Credit was declared effective, it proceeded extremely well with the
only minor delay in Closing being attributed to minor changes in the project scope together
with associated technical problems (para. 5.02).
Results. The objective of strengthening Guinea's capabilities to represent its
economic and financial interest in ongoing and proposed new projects was completed and
highlighted by the completion of new contractual arrangements for the Compagnie des
Bauxites de Guinee (CBG). The exploration and training associated with the second objective
of attracting new investment to Guinea was successfully achieved although the promotion of
new projects to potential investors was handled poorly by the Government. The objective of
reorganizing and strengthening the Ministry was only partly achieved (para. 6.01).
Sustainability. Although the project succeeded in strengthening MRNE, given
the absence of an annual budget, it is doubtful that MNRE will be able to sustain the
improvements made during project implementation. However, the country has certainly
gained substantially from the technical assistance and training components (para. 7.01).
Conclusions and Lessons Learned. The Bank made a positive contribution to:
(a) the management of the Government's shareholdings in the mining sector; (b) the
identification and promotion of mineral potential; (c) the training of Guinean nationals; and
(d) the reorganization and strengthening of the MRNE. In retrospect, however, the benefit of
the project could have been enhanced by more careful project preparation, particularly in
coordination with other donors, better project definition and stronger conditionality.
Furthermore, it would have been more beneficial and effective, if the consultants had
prepared their final reports in the field, in consultation with Guinean counterparts, instead of
preparing them in their home country.

2. BACKGROUND
2.01       Guinea has considerable mining resources, which are only in the early stages of
full appraisal and exploitation. The industrial mining sector, consisting principally of bauxite
and alumina production, plays an important role in the Guinean economy. In the years 1980-
1984, the formal mining industry generated 12-16 percent of GDP, 96-99 percent of export
revenues and 26-33 percent of total Government revenues. In addition, the informal mining
sector, essentially gold and diamond producers, are estimated to produce minerals valued at
10-25 percent of those produced by the formal mining industry.
2.02       In view of the current importance and future potential of the sector, the
Government has developed a two-pronged strategy for the sector. The first strategic priority
was to maintain the benefits derived from the bauxite and alumina subsector whose foreign
exchange and tax contributions were of crucial importance. This priority required that the
Government be responsive to the business proposals made by its foreign multinational partners
in the mining companies, and at the same time effectively represent its own interests, a
difficult and delicate task. The second strategic priority was to increase exploration work by
the private sector, a precondition for eventually diversifying mineral production through
implementation of new mining projects.
3. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01       Project Obiectives. The project's major objectives were to: (a) strengthen
Guinea's capabilities to represent, as shareholder, its economic and commercial interests in
ongoing and new proposed mining activities so as to maximize benefits from these operations;
(b) improve the mining sector investment climate so as to accelerate mineral development, in
particular the flow of exploration capital. This objective required an expansion of the



geological data base and the establishment of an effective regulatory framework; and (c)
increase the Government's efficiency in achieving the above two objectives, and in making
them an integral part of Guinea's national program of administrative reform.
3.02        Project Description. The project consisted of the following four components:
(a)   Management of the Borrower's Shareholdings in mining companies. This
component was to provide twenty-four staff-months of investment consulting
services to assist DGMG in: (i) defining a new corporate strategy for the Office
des Bauxites de Kindia (OBK) and in responding to various tax restructuring,
marketing, staffing and productivity issues and proposals raised by CBG's
foreign partners; and (ii) preparing a plan to restructure MIFERGUI and the
proposed Mifergui Iron Ore Project at Mt. Nimba in southeast Guinea;
(b)   Exploration Promotion. This component was to focus on: (i) the
development of new and the upgrading of old geological data for Guinea,
and the design of an exploration program, concentrating on those minerals
which can be marketed and which would not require major investments in
infrastructure; (ii) execution of the exploration program identified in (i)
above including, inter alia, mapping, trenching, pitting and sampling for
those minerals, preparation of technical reports integrating new and old
geological data, and establishment of a geological data center; (iii)
preparation of exploration promotion packages for distribution to potential
investors in the Borrower's mining sector; and (iv) acquisition of existing
proprietary geophysical data;
(c)   Strengthening of Mining Services and Regulatory Control in
MRNEE. The third component involved the services of a Resident
Advisor for a period of two years to assist DGMG in fulfilling its
regulatory functions, including : (i) reorganizing the mining
inspection service and monitoring of mining activities being carried
out by mining title holders; (ii) refurbishing and equipping of the
DGMG laboratories; and (iii) Carrying out of a study to assess
staffing needs and organization of tests of present mining staff in
MRNEE to determine the level of qualifications and experience of
each staff member; and
(d)   Training and Fellowships. The fourth component involved 8 staff-
months of personnel consulting services to assess DGMD's staffing
needs based on sector requirements, and to determine, through
testing, the qualifications and experience of DGMG employees.
This component also included: (i) on-the-job training and
organization of seminars for DGMG staff on specialized aspects of
mineral exploration and mineral prospect marketing; and (ii)
fellowships to DGMG staff for short-term visits and training
abroad.

3.03       In addition to the components outlined in the original project description, IDA
assisted the Government in the establishment of a documentation center for the mineral sector,
as agreed in an amendment to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) dated September 7,
1988.
4.   PROJECT DESIGN AND ORAGNIZATION
4.01       The project was to be implemented under the authority of MPRN over a three
year period. A Guinean project administrator would be responsible for overall project
coordination and the training programs. He would also manage the accounts of the project
and the procurement and disbursement functions.
4.02       An investment bank was already retained under PPF funding (US$900,000
equivalent) to advise the Government of its shareholdings. Internationally recruited geology
and mining consultants were to be recruited to assist with components (b), (c) and (d) of the
project. They were required to work closely with the project administrator.
5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.01       Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up. Although Credit 1637-GUI was
approved on November 26, 1985 and signed on April 8, 1986 it did not become effective
until November 19, 1986. The delay was due principally to failure by the Government to
publish the Credit Agreement in the prescribed manner and resulted in converting two dated
covenants - consultant selection and promulgation of an Investment Code - into conditions of
effectiveness. Consultant selection, originally required by July 31, 1986, (Section 3.02 (b) of
the DCA) was completed in October 1986. IDA waived the promulgation of an Investment
Code, as it had become a condition of the First Structural Adjustment Credit to Guinea. As a
result of these delays, start-up of the geological and training work was also delayed for about
six months, to March 1987.
5.02       Implementation Schedule. The project was originally scheduled to be completed
by December 31, 1989. While the principal component of geological database acquisition and
promotion, together with reorganization of the Ministry and training were completed
essentially on schedule, the establishment of the documentation center delayed project closing
by six months. This delay was caused by unanticipated geo-technical problems relating to the
foundations of the Center. Following these initial delays in effectiveness, project
implementation proceeded efficiently on schedule.
5.03       Procurement. Overall, procurement for services and goods during project
implementation was acceptable. The selection of consultants was efficiently carried out within
Bank guidelines. Delays in the procurement of goods usually due to the inefficiencies of
Guinean suppliers rather than to slow evaluation and contract placement by MPNR.
5.04       Proiect Costs. The total project costs were estimated at appraisal to be about
US$4.25 million of which US$3.86 million would be in foreign exchange. The project was
essentially completed within the budgeted costs. No detailed breakdown of local costs is



- 4 -
available but it is believed that, while they exceeded the budgeted Guinean francs, they were
generally in line with the budgeted dollar equivalent sum.
5.05        Disbursements. The estimated disbursements of Credit 1637-GUI relative to
actual disbursements are given in Part 111, Table C. After an initial delay in project start-up
the rate of disbursement exceeded the appraisal estimate throughout the project. Total
disbursement in US dollar terms exceeded the appraisal estimate by US$0.44 million when
additional funding became available as a result of changes in the SDR to US dollar exchange
rate.
6. PROJECT RESULTS
6.01        Project results varied in their success from one component to another. With
regard to the management of the Government's shareholdings in mining companies the project
was successful. The Project provided assistance which enabled the Government to restructure
its contract with CBG in such a way that export tonnages of bauxite were augmented and
fiscal revenues were preserved. While the likely additional revenues derived by the
Government under the revised contract agreement have not been calculated, they very clearly
exceed the total Credit amount several fold. At the same time, an analysis of OBK was
completed and the restructuring of Government interests in the Mifergui Ore Project became
the basis for future negotiations with potential foreign investors. The development of the
geological data base/exploration promotion component had mixed results. The exploration
program component was well designed and executed but the Government failed to undertake a
legitimate promotion exercise. Instead of completing the exploration, negotiations were
initiated with selected, poorly qualified investors during the exploration program. This
approach to promotion has served the Government poorly, as negotiations are still not
completed. The proprietary geophysical data was not acquired due to legal complications
associated with its valuation. The reorganization and strengthening of mining services
component also had mixed results. While monitoring of mining activities has improved,
enforcement of legal obligations remains weak. Staff reductions took place but the
testing/selection was apparently sub-optimal. (This program was not financed directly the
Credit). The training and fellowships program was successful. Training seminars and on-the-
job instruction by the consultants in Guinea was supplemented by the attachment of ten
Guinean geologists for three months to the geological field parties of Canadian corporations
working in Quebec. As a result, Guinean personnel were able to effectively continue the
project after the departure of the consultants until such time as operating budgets were
depleted.
6.02        Environmental Impact. The execution of the project did not entail any
environmental issues, as disturbances of the surface such as test pits, trenches and line
cutting, were very minor.
6.03        Financial Performance. As the project was a technical assistance project there
are no directly measurable financial parameters. The project enabled the Government to
maintain the benefit of its shareholdings in mining ventures and to maximize its fiscal revenue
from CBG.



-5-
7. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
7.01 It is doubtful whether MRNE will be able to sustain the improvement in management
and project execution following the termination of technical assistance and, perhaps more
importantly, of the necessary foreign exchange funding for consumables and equipment.
While the direct benefits to MRNE may deteriorate the more qualified personnel will continue
to assist in the development of the mining sector either in MRNE or in the private sector.
8.   BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01       Throughout the implementation of the project the Bank made a positive
contribution to the management of Government shareholdings in mining operations and to the
implementation of the major consulting contract for assistance to MRNE in the establishment
of a geological database and promotional activities. However, in retrospect, the project could
have been improved by:
(a)   better integration of project activities with the technical assistance being provided
to MRNE by other multi-laterals and bi-laterals;
(b)  improved definition of the exact scope of technical assistance during project
preparation. While the assistance provided valuable data and training to MRNE,
supervision should have been intensified to maximize the benefits; and
(c)  stronger conditionality with regard to promotion activities and the administration
of the existing mining concessions would have increased the benefits to the
Government.
9.   BORROWER PERFORMANCE
9.01       MRNE played only a minor role in project implementation and all project
activities, with the exception of liaison with the management consultants, were carried out by
the DNM under the guidance of the Project Manager. The Project Manager carried out his
responsibilities in a competent and timely manner. Minor delays in project implementation
were attributable to Guinean country difficulties including communication problems and the
complexities of the port system. With regard to the promotion component MRNE failed to
seek qualified investors, as had been anticipated, and continued to issue exploration
concessions to "friends". Similarly a "clean-up" of the confused concession system had been
anticipated under the Credit but this failed to happen because of political pressures. Table 7,
Part III contains a review of the performance of the Borrower with respect to the legal
covenants.

10. BANK/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP
10.1       The relationship of IDA with the Government and with MRNE officials directly
involved in the project was good. Some difficulties were encountered at Credit Closing due
to delays on the part of the Borrower in submitting final disbursement requests.
11.  CONSULTANT SERVICES
11.01 Two extensive consultant contracts were provided under credit financing: one for
investment banking management advisors and one for geological/mining consultants. The
Bank was actively involved in supervising the consultants and their overall performance was
considered technically satisfactory. The contract for the investment banking service was
effective in assisting the Government but it is believed that the professional fees were
excessive for the services rendered. Closer supervision by MRNE may have reduced the
costs of what, by its very nature, was an open ended technical assistance contract. The
geological/mining consultants did a good job especially with respect to the technology transfer
and training aspects of the project. They were weaker than anticipated in assisting the
Government to reorganize procedures in MRNE with respect the administration of mining
rights. Although, overall consultant performance was satisfactory, it would have been more
effective and beneficial to the Guineans involved, if the consultants had prepared their final
report in the field, in consultation with their Guinean counterparts, instead of preparing the
report in their home country.
12.  Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01 The Credit Agreement and Project Agreement were adequate and appropriate for
achieving project objectives, although additional conditionality may have improved the
benefits to the Government. Various covenants provided opportunity for periodic review of
progress of work up to that stage, before proceeding to the next stage. However, it was not
possible to collect accurate data of local costs incurred by the Borrower.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER's PERSPECTIVE
1.   Evaluation of Bank Performance and Lessons Learned
1.01       The Bank staff, charged with supervising the project, were fully capable in
undertaking their responsibilities with regard to the smooth implementation of the project
without usurping those of the Borrower. The few problems encountered during the
implementation of the project related mainly to the nonexecution or partial execution of
certain tasks such as: (a) preparation and distribution of promotional brochures; (b)
reorganization of the mines inspectorate; and (c) renovation and re-equipping of the
laboratory of DNMG. It should be noted that the funds earmarked for these components were
usefully reassigned to strengthen the other priority activities. It should also be noted that the
shareholder management component resulted in the absorption of significant amounts of the
credit with only a marginal participation by Guinean personnel.
1.02       The main lesson to be learned is that from the beginning Guinean working level
staff should be consulted in contract negotiation to avoid interminable discussions with the
consultant after contract signature. In addition, the consulting firm selected for project
coordination must manage to maintain the expert staffing as long as possible to facilitate
continuation of the work, especially in the field of training higher level Guinean staff.
Furthermore Guinean staff should be more fully integrated into the preparation of project
reports.
2.   Evaluation of Performance of the Borrower and Lessons Learned
2.02       The performance of the institutions involved in the project was satisfactory
except at the beginning of the project. After the training seminar and after a few months in
the field considerable progress was made in project structure as well as in the performance of
the staff.
