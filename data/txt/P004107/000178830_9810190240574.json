Provincial and County Roads Project\n            will improve economic efficiency by reducing transport costs\n            in rural areas through the development of the county or\n            tertiary road system and by improving the maintenance of the\n            provincial and county roads. The project will also promote\n            improved integration of the road system through a review of\n            investment plans to assure that county road development is\n            coordinated with the development of the national and\n            provincial road networks. In addition, it will promote the\n            adoption of low costs paving techniques not heretofore used\n            in the country, help Government improve road safety and\n            improve transport services in remote areas. Specifically,\n            the project will: (a) improve about 1,000 km of provincial\n            and county roads of which 820 km will be paved and the\n            remainder gravel surfaced; (b) assist in setting up and\n            providing equipment for organizations at central, provincial\n            and county administrative levels to implement a maintenance\n            program; (c) provide consultant services'; and (d)\n            provide overseas fellowships for training of MOHA staff."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
