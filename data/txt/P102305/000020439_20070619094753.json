"The overall objective of the Global\n            Program for Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness\n            and Response Project is to minimize the threat posed by\n            highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to humans in\n            Bangladesh by controlling such infections in domestic\n            poultry, and preparing for, controlling, and responding to\n            possible human infections, especially an influenza epidemic\n            and related emergencies. This objective will be achieved\n            through three types of interventions: (i) prevention; (ii)\n            preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and\n            containment. The project has three components: (i) animal\n            health, which concentrates on enhancing prevention and\n            preparedness, strengthening disease surveillance and\n            diagnostic capacity, strengthening control programs,\n            improving biosecurity, providing support for surveillance o\n            f migratory birds and establishing a contingency fund; (ii)\n            public awareness and information, which is designed to\n            safeguard human health, in particular for extension staff,\n            animal health workers, poultry producers, poultry traders,\n            poultry processors and other stakeholders dealing with\n            poultry, by improving public awareness and information about\n            the HPAI; and finally (iii) implementation support and\n            monitoring & evaluation (M&E) component to provide\n            financial and technical support for regular internal M&E\n            of the Project as well as for an independent evaluation on a\n            periodic basis."}, "docdt": "2007-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
