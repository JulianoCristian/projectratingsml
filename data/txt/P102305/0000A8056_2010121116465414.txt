                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to humans in Bangladesh by controlling such
                         infections in domestic poultry, and preparing for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an influenza epidemic and related
                         emergencies. Though the objective is specific to HPAI, the interventions are expected to contribute to the control of other zoonotic diseases and other types of
                         infectious diseases, in terms of building overall response capacity in the country.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Outbreak situation in Bangladesh is now relatively stable and manageable compared to 2007/2008. However, the country continues to have outbreaks and remains at high risk with
                         31 avian flu outbreaks in 2010 alone. Under this scenario a project cancellation is notan option, especially now that this operation has become the only avian flu intervention after

                         momentum, the Project Performances is expected to continue improving, with accelerated disbursement. In light of the above and based on overall implementation status, the IP has
                         been upgraded to MS from MU, while PDO rating continues as MS. Meanwhile a new scope of activities is being finalized by the on-going supervision mission and it is anticipated
                         that the funds by categories be reallocated, if necessary. As a result, preliminary projections suggest that actual balance of IDA portion will be used up by the project closing.
