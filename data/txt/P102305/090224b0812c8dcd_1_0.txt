Project Development Objectives
Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to humans in Bangladesh by controlling such infections
in domestic poultry, and preparing for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an influenza epidemic and related emergencies. Though the
objective is specific to HPAI, the interventions are expected to contribute to the control of other zoonotic diseases and other types of infectious diseases, in terms of
building overall response capacity in the country.
Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

& Implementation Status Overview
1.     A renewed outbreak wave which began in January 2011 has, by end-November, resulted in 168 new outbreaks, bringing the total to 526 outbreaks since the initial
outbreaks that began in March 2007. Out of these outbreaks, 469 were in commercial farms and 57 in back yard poultry. To date 160 Upazilas and 15 Metro Thanas are concerned.

Last outbreaks were reported on November 24, 2011. The capacity of the Government, as well as of community and private commercial sector for preparedness, diagnosis,
response, and containment is being enhanced with continued financial assistance from the project and other development partners. As a consequence, the country has so far
managed reasonably well to control the outbreaks .
2.     Overall, the implementation of the project continues to be moderately satisfactory, although it has picked up since February 2010. All critical activities listed in the June 2011
O   Action Plan have been completed. This includes among others: (i) issuing the Government Order for the transfer to DLS of 88 Assistant Veterinary Surgeons (AVS) working with the
SMS Gateway system for active surveillance program; (ii) satisfactorily completion of the geo-positioning and registration of poultry farms and Live Bird markets under the SMS
cn  Gateway active surveillance system. The system is now fully functional and capable of rapid detection, diagnosis and counter measures in case of avian flu outbreaks; (iii) renovation

-6  and equipment of the Field Disease Investigation Labs; (iv) completion of all preparatory activities for the upgrading of the ten pilots bio-secured poultry market chains, including the
.   recruitment of of an engineering firm; (v) mobilization of an M&E Firm and its draft Inception Report submitted in Nov-201 1; and (vi) approval of the Revised Development Project
Proforma (DPP) , though the Government Order (GO) is still to be issued.
3.     In spite of these achievements, the following agreed actions which are holding back effective project implementation are still to be addressed: (i) issuing the GO for the
revised DPP; (ii) fully staffing of the refurbished seven Field Diseases Investigation Laboratories with trained laboratory technicians; and (iii) initiating the upgrading of the bio-secured
poultry market chains. Overall disbursement remains still low. Cumulative disbursement as of December 31, 2011 stands at US$ 6.1 million , and is estimated to be at about US$ 8.6
million by the closure of the project which may result in the cancellation of about US$ 3.0 million. During its next mission scheduled for May 2012, the Bank team will, in coordination
with government, assess the disbursement status for FY13, prepare disbursement projections for the remaining six-seven months and agree with Government on necessary follow up
actions.
