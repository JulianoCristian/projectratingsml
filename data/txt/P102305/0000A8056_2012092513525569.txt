                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to humans in Bangladesh by controlling such infections
                         in domestic poultry, and preparing for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an influenza epidemic and related emergencies. Though the
                         objective is specific to HPAI, the interventions are expected to contribute to the control of other zoonotic diseases and other types of infectious diseases, in terms of
                         building overall response capacity in the country.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         1. Despite the decreasing number of avian flu outbreaks in Bangladesh in 2012 compared to last year, Bangladesh still continues to be one of the six countries, as being endemically
                         infected by avian influenza according to FAO assessment. The last outbreak has been reported on April 5, 2012 from Rajbari. Three human cases of Avian Influenza (H5N1) have so

                         survived through treatment.

                         2. The project implementation continues to make good progress:(i) the active surveillance for HPAI using the SMS Gateway System, which was established first at the FAO AI -

                         enhanced and the country is now not only able to diagnose avian flu and other emergencies diseases, but also capable of avian flu virus characterization by means of gene
                         sequencing; (iii) gradual, but consistent progress is also being made toward fully staffing the incremental human resources needed to render the surveillance, diagnostic laboratory
                         and epidemiology activities fully operational and sustainable, and to internalize the budgetary requirements to sustain these operations; and (iv) compensation rates for culled poultry
                         have been adjusted to ongoing market prices and are paid out quickly to affected farmers. This, together with the distribution of substantial quantities of multimedia public awareness
                         materials is resulting in increased farmer awareness and incentives to report outbreaks. However though weak farm bio-security continues to be a major cause of avian influenza
