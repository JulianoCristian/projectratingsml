                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to humans in Bangladesh by controlling such
                         infections in domestic poultry, and preparing for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an influenza epidemic and related
                         emergencies. Though the objective is specific to HPAI, the interventions are expected to contribute to the control of other zoonotic diseases and other types of
                         infectious diseases, in terms of building overall response capacity in the country.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         1.       A renewed outbreak wave which began in January 2011 has, by end-May, resulted in 71 new outbreaks, bringing the total to 519 outbreaks since the initial outbreaks that
                         began in March 2007. Out of these outbreaks, 362 were in commercial farms and 57 in back yard poultry. To date 492 Upazilas and 15 Metro Thanas are concerned. No new

                         outbreak has been reported since June 23, 2011. The capacity of the Government, as well as of community and private commercial sector for preparedness, diagnosis, response,
                         and containment is being enhanced with continued financial assistance from the project and other development partners. As a consequence, the country has so far managed
                         reasonably well to control the outbreaks .

                         2.         Overall, the implementation of the project continues to be moderately satisfactory, although it has started picking up significantly since February 2010. All critical activities
                         listed in the December 2010 Action Plan have been completed. This includes among others:

                         (i)        The surveillance activities using the SMS Gateway website, initiated by USAID has now been partly transferred to the Project and covers 306 Upazilas, supported by 1008
                         Avian Influenza Worker (AIW). 103 veterinarians are presently supervising AIWs and supporting the Upazila Livestock Officers (ULOs) in operating the web-based SMS Gateway
                         disease reporting system.
                         (ii) Coordinated Plans for Training and Risk Communications for various stake holders are being satisfactorily implemented. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between DLS
                         and Department of Mass Communication (DMC) has been signed to carry out risk communication campaigns.
                         (iii) A budgeted business plan for upgrading biosecurity of 26 LBMs. The Plan has been revised to include 10 (ten) poultry market chains from farm to consumer (Annex IV).
                         Mobilization and roll out of the modified Plan, which will convert 10 locations from single LBM biosecurity to market chain biosecurity, will take place in the following months and is
                         expected to be completed by the next implementation support mission by end November 2011.
                         (iv) The recruitment of an independent M&E consulting firm is in advanced stage and being finalized by July 2011.

                         3.       Despite this progress, project disbursement remains still quite low. Only about thirty percent of IDA credit has been utilized with less than 18 months left before project
                         closure in December 2012. The co-financing arrangement through AHI Trust Fund Grant has closed on June 30, 2011 with an expected undisbursed balance of about US$0.9 million
                         to be cancelled.

                         4. The country still remains as one of the high risk countries in the world. Hence, during the June 2011 mission, the scope of priority activities required to maintain satisfactory project
                         performance and to ensure timely utilization of the Credit proceeds has been reviewed and agreed to reflect the changing situation and emerging issues. The agreed actions, among
                         others, include: (i) initiating the implementation of the agreed plan for improving bio-security in about 10 Poultry Market Chains by November 31, 2011; (ii) taking concrete steps for
                         integrating the Epidemiology Unit, including Surveillance System, within the Department of Livestock Services; and (iv) finalizing the renovation of, and providing appropriate
                         equipment to the two remaining FDILs (Feni and Sirajganj) by August 15, 2011. It is expected that with the fulfillment of these actions, the overall implementation pace could be
                         significantly improved along with disbursement. The project performance and ratings will be assessed in December, and if implementation and disbursement progress slows down,
                         the ratings may require downgrading.

                         5. In light of the above, the Government's Development Project Proposal is to be promptly revised and approved to trigger the enhanced implementation pace. Disbursement for FY12
                         are estimated at about $3.0 million and are likely to be accomplished, given the enhanced PCU's capacity and inclusion of a new activity aimed at improving bio-security in about 10
                         Poultry Market Chains including Live Bird Markets.

                         6. During its next mission scheduled for December 2011, the Bank team will, in coordination with government, assess the disbursement status for FY12, prepare disbursement
                         projections for the remaining twelve months and agree with Government on necessary follow up actions.
