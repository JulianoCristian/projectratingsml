(BSES) in India. The\n            principal objectives of the Project were to: (a) provide\n            additional generation, transmission and distribution\n            capacity to meet the increasing demand for electricity in\n            the Mumbai area; and (b) maintain the high quality of\n            service to BSES consumers. The performance of International\n            Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) in respect of\n            project identification, preparation, appraisal and\n            subsequent project implementation was satisfactory. The\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory throughout the\n            project from preparation to implementation and operation.\n            Major findings of the project are summarized as follows: (i)\n            a private company is better suited to making strategic\n            decisions which might be considered risky by public\n            concerns; (ii) an utility should begin public consultations\n            and dissemination of detailed information in respect of\n            social and environmental impacts of any project at a very\n            early stage of preparation; (iii) employment of competent\n            consultants would help an utility to complete its project on\n            time; (iv) use of higher quality of coal should be\n            encouraged; and (v) it is important to set up a high-powered\n            coordination committee to ensure that each institution plays\n            its part as demanded by the schedule."}, "docdt": "1997-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
