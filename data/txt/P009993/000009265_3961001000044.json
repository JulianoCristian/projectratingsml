capacity to meet\n            increasing electricity demand in the Bombay area, maintain\n            good service quality provided to Bombay Suburban Electric\n            Supply Company's (BSES's) consumers, support the\n            government's endeavors to increase private sector\n            participation in the supply of power, and assist BSES in its\n            transformation from a distribution company to an integrated\n            power utility which operates generation, transmission and\n            distribution facilities.  The project comprises:  (a) a\n            power plant comprising two 250 MW coal-fired units located\n            at Dahanu, including a flue gas desulphurization plant as\n            mandated by the government's environmental clearance;\n            (b) two double circuit 220 kV transmission lines of about\n            105 km, to transmit power from Dahanu to BSES's license\n            area, and three 220/33 kV receiving stations; and (c)\n            strengthening and extension of BSES's 33 kV and 11 kV\n            subtransmission and distribution system."}, "docdt": "1991-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
