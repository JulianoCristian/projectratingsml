It also contributed\n            to a 40 percent rise in household incomes for small and\n            marginal farmers, a gain of more than 50 percent for\n            landless farmers, and a jump of almost 80 percent for larger\n            farms. The lives of people in 400,000 households were\n            improved, helping curb outward migration by about 70\n            percent. More than 6,000 women\u2019s self-help groups were\n            formed to foster sustainable livelihoods. Many of the\n            project\u2019s innovative monitoring and evaluation systems have\n            been adopted by India\u2019s central ministry of agriculture and\n            its new national rain fed area authority to be used in all\n            government watershed programs throughout India. Lessons\n            learned from the project have been incorporated into India\u2019s\n            new draft national watershed guidelines and its national\n            integrated watershed management program."}, "docdt": "2012-05-09T03:15:00Z"}
