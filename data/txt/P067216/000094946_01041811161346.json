adversity on the environment, as a result of the\n            Karnataka Watershed Development Project, and proposes the\n            following mitigation measures. Soil erosion and water\n            drainage will be minimized by reducing gully inflows,\n            through vegetative measures. Treatment of the gully system\n            should start downstream, to slowly progress upstream, while\n            the design of gully control structures should be specific to\n            each work site. Likewise, the site for check-dams shall be\n            site-specific, to include low slope gully checks, and silt\n            basins shall be used for steep slopes, to include silt traps\n            of bench types. Vegetative measures may be combined with\n            possible cut-off drains to prevent rapid overland flow into\n            roadsides, and should as well stabilize erosion on side\n            slopes, along with retaining walls. High soil erosion will\n            be contained through the installation of stone rip-rap or\n            pitching wooden wooden piles. Adequate water catchment areas\n            will be located for water harvesting with eco-engineering\n            devices, but provisions should be made to trap flowing\n            debris and sediment loads located at the inlet for easy\n            access for cleaning purposes. Scour protection should be\n            provided at the overflow spillway base, where a stone\n            pitched channel should conduct excess water from the structure."}, "docdt": "2002-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
