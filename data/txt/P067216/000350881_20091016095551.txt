F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
 A. The key development objective is to improve the productive potential of selected
watersheds and their associated natural resource base, and strengthen community and
institutional arrangements for natural resource management.

  B.       An associated objective is to strengthen the capacity of communities in the
project districts for participatory involvement in planning , implementation, social and
environmental management, maintenance of assets emanating from local level
development program, and to have the implementing department operate in a more
socially inclusive manner, with the framework of a convergent watershed development
plan.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Karnataka Watershed Development Project (KWDP)1, known locally as the `Sujala'
project, addressed two key national and state government concerns at the time of design:
a) rural poverty and agriculture growth, and b) declining agricultural productivity. The
design strongly addressed a priority in the World Bank's India Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) that complemented the government of Karnataka's (GoK) emphasis on
holistic development of rainfed areas, where the rural poor tend to reside. While the
original design did not explicitly express clear poverty outcomes, during implementation
the importance of reaching marginalized and vulnerable groups was clearly recognized
and addressed by the project partners.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The primary PDO was to improve the productive potential of selected watersheds and
their associated natural resource base, and strengthen community and institutional
arrangements for natural resource management. An associated development objective
was to strengthen the capacity of communities in project districts for participatory
involvement in planning, implementation, social and environmental management,
maintenance of assets emanating from local level development program, and to have the
implementing department operate in a more socially inclusive manner, within the
framework of a convergent watershed development plan.

From the Project Appraisal Document (PAD - page 2), the main performance indicators
for the project development objectives were:

    1. Household income increased:
         i. Overall income of various stakeholder groups at the village level increased
            (the log frame does not refer to various groups)
        ii. Agricultural income per hectare (ha) increased
    2. Crop yields increased
    3. Groundwater recharged:
          i. Cropping intensity on rainfed areas improved
         ii. Percentage of irrigated area increased
        iii. drinking water availability improved
        iv. number of wells recharged
    4. Soil erosion reduced
    5. Cropping pattern diversified to high value crops
    6. Milk, fuel and fodder production increased

1
 The KWDP was known locally as "Sujala", which in the vernacular means "good water". Both KWDP
and Sujala are used interchangeably in this ICRR, particularly in the Borrower's report (Annex 13).


                                                  1
    7. Productivity of non-arable lands improved - forest cover, and forest produce
       increased, output from revenue lands increased
    8. Project-created community based organizations involved in broader community
       affairs.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

The PDO and key indicators were not formally revised during implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The project would be taken up in five, arid rainfed agriculture districts 2 . The PAD
estimated that about 350,000 families (approximately 1.8 million people) would benefit
directly from increased agricultural productivity and diversification of land uses across a
geographic area of 518,000 ha. Attention to women's development was to be through
increased availability of fodder, fuelwood, and water, and special Income Generating
Activity (IGA) schemes. An estimated 25,000 landless families would benefit from
increased labor demands for construction of civil works for soil and water conservation,
subsequent intensification of agriculture, and from IGA programs.

1.5 Original Components
Based on a standard credit instrument, the project was to be implemented through four
components with the following baseline costs, excluding contingencies (PAD - Annex 3):

A. Participatory Watershed Development and Protection (US$104 million). This
component was to finance: (a) social mobilization, institution building, and developing
micro-watershed plans; (b) physical soil and water conservation treatment of sub-
watersheds (arable and non-arable lands), and (c) entry-point investments to help
communities learn to make collective development decisions. Seventy-seven sub-
watersheds, encompassing 742 micro-watersheds (MWS) were targeted with an average
size of about 5,500 ha. Implementation was to be in three phases; 10 sub-watersheds in
Phase I, another 25 in Phase II, and the remaining 42 in Phase III.

B. Farming System Intensification (US$5.5 million). This component was to finance (a)
participatory farmer-driven research and extension; (b) farm demonstrations, and farmer
training for introduction of improved practices for agriculture and horticulture; (c) for
livestock: silvi-pastoral treatments, demonstrations, extension improvement, private
participation in artificial insemination and veterinary services, and capacity building; and
(d) forestry-related institution and capacity building.


2
 Late into implementation, two of the five project districts were split into two districts. This resulted in the
project being delivered across seven districts, but still within the original geographic area in the PAD. For
convenience and consistency, the report will continue to present results across the five original districts.



                                                       2
C. Income Generation Activities (US$4.1 million). The project would (a) finance Non-
Government Organization (NGO) support for the formation of beneficiary groups, with a
focus on linking up with the government's on-going schemes, disseminating information
on marketing and credit opportunities, and subsequent training of members; (b) provide
equipment and materials for demonstrations; and (c) support study tours for group
members.

D. Institutional Strengthening (US$3.8 million). The project would finance: (a)
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), which includes additional environmental and social
assessments, and development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) database
through the Karnataka Remote Sensing Applications Center (KRSAC); and (b) Project
Management and Coordination.

1.6 Revised Components
The project had slow disbursement in the initial three years, due to recurrent drought
(making it harder for farmers to raise their contributions for arable land works and
limiting forestry activities on common lands); challenges organizing and training large
numbers of field NGOs; a steep learning curve to introduce new, participatory watershed
management systems; and slow recruitment of local watershed staff. A Mid-Term
Review (MTR) in May, 2003 restructured the project phasing to 10 sub-watersheds in
Phase I, 20 in Phase II, and 47 in the Phase III. No changes were made to the PDO,
indicators or targets. From an assessment of Phase I, greater equity was addressed in
2004 by reallocating forecast savings in land treatments to establish revolving funds for
IGA, mainly targeted towards SHGs and landless.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
With the Indian Ocean Tsunami on December 26, 2004, the Bank developed an
emergency rehabilitation project for Tamil Nadu, financed from forecast savings of
SDR272 million from 15 active lending operations in India. The KWDP reallocated
US$19.34 million to the new rehabilitation project, based on forecast savings while
maintaining original project targets. With continuing improvement in implementation
pace and quality, and recognizing the need to continue catching up from the slow start, in
2007, the project closing date was formally extended by two years to March 31, 2009,
along with minor reallocation of funds across components. At closure, the remaining
undisbursed IDA credit of US$11.4 million was cancelled.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The rationale for Bank involvement was strong, building on a solid foundation of
experience from a range of Bank, GoK, and bilateral-supported projects in India. The
GoK commitment prior to the project start was good, with the establishment of a
Watershed Development Department (WDD) in 2000. The objectives and components,


                                            3
interventions, processes, and institutional arrangements were generally sound and have
stood the test of time. The components were all highly relevant and complementary,
down to the village level, especially in balancing agricultural, social, and livelihoods
needs of watershed development. The risks and mitigation measures (PAD, page 35)
were generally well identified and appropriate, including the `inadequate capacity at
community level to undertake project management' which was considered a substantial
risk. At the same time however, the original project period was probably over-optimistic,
given that the project design was testing integrated, participatory watershed projects for
the first time in Karnataka. These projects are fairly complex and require considerable
"front-end" time to build experience, especially as new institutions needed to be set up
and supported. Also, the design underestimated the considerable intricacy and effort
required to create enduring benefit sharing mechanisms for common property resources
managed by communities. The lessons learned in this project should reduce start-up times
for similar project designs in India. Related, and again in hindsight, the involvement of
the GoK Forestry Department in early project development seems to have been
insufficient.

2.2 Implementation
With the two-year extension to March 31, 2009, the project essentially completed its
main activities, and did so at reduced costs. Key reasons for this overall success include:

(a) appropriate technical planning tools and capacity were put in place, albeit after some
    delay and simplification;
(b) the M&E system provided a strong tracking and learning mechanism, correcting and
    realigning the project, and pushing for better performance and accountability through
    on-the-ground results - project management was very responsive to issues raised in
    the M&E system and supervision, with corrective actions taken;
(c) quality control mechanisms were created for farm and community-level land and
    water treatments;
(d) district-level technical teams that effectively coordinated inputs to communities and
    NGOs, led by the District Watershed Development Officer (DWDO) and supported
    by field officers from other departments to bring cross-cutting skills in agriculture,
    animal husbandry, forestry, etc,
(e) a high level of transparency was used at the community level including, process
    monitoring; open village meetings; wall paintings listing project activities,
    beneficiaries and financing; and use of satellite imagery to track individual land
    interventions, and;
(f) a new, performance based contracting system with field NGOs was facilitated by the
    new WDD Commissioner soon after he took office in 2007, greatly improving NGO
    execution of field activities with communities;

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design: In hindsight, the PDO and associated key performance indicators in the
PAD had several issues. First, there were definitional contradictions of household income
in the PAD main text and Annex 1 of the PAD. Second, there was no clear specification
of quantitative targets for many of the outcome indicators. Third, there was inadequate
attention to indicators for hydrological or soil monitoring, and studies needed to evaluate
related environmental impacts of the project (although this was generally the case for
Bank watershed management projects globally at that time). Finally, the PAD target for
treatment of non-arable land was 100 percent of available areas in selected communities,
which was unrealistic (later confirmed by more detailed micro-watershed plans). A
positive point is that a decision was made to use a third party M&E agency to support the
small M&E team in the implementing agency, drawing in wider expertise and technology.

M&E implementation: While the PAD provided little guidance on technical
specifications of the M&E system, the eventual design produced by the project's third
party M&E agency (Antrix Corporation ­ the commercial arm of the Indian Space
Research Organization) and WDD was highly innovative and played a key role in
improving project implementation. The M&E system made use of remote sensing and
GIS, combined with a more conventional Management Information System (MIS) and
field surveys. The system was unique for watershed development projects and has
attracted significant international attention. The impact surveys conducted by Antrix were
in general, carefully designed, including control and treatment groups, and using
multistage random sampling method to collect both quantitative and qualitative data.
However, some data and survey instrument issues existed, particularly for household
income3.

M&E utilization: The M&E data from input-output assessment, process monitoring,
impact analyses, and many thematic/case studies had a strong impact on improving
project implementation. In particular, thematic studies and ongoing analyses helped
project management make major changes to implementation strategies that resulted for
example, in sharper poverty focus and opportunities for women and landless; better
equity among small, medium and large farmers; and greater cost efficiency in soil and
water conservation works.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environment safeguards: The project is inherently a natural resource management project,
without major large-scale civil works; therefore environment management was implicit in
the project design. To address moderate environmental risks during implementation,

3
 The FAO team `s detailed analysis of Antrix data and impact reports raised a few questions about
household income based on small control groups and some of the survey instruments, and the implications
on statistical causality between project activities and household income. At the same time however, field
visits, detailed case studies by Antrix, and other information gathered by the FAO Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICRR) team, clearly suggest that positive and high income impacts did
occur.



                                                    5
processes were built into local MWS planning and decision-making in 2003 through the
project operating manual. It was updated in 2005 to emphasize a ridge to valley approach
in micro-plans that promoted soil and water conservation in the entire watershed, both in
the upper ridge areas (often common lands) and privately owned arable lands that
predominate in the lower valleys. Criteria in the operating manual for selecting
intervention types and guidance on designs led to better intervention choices by
communities and technical teams, improved construction methods for small-scale works,
and introduced quality control that minimized potential local environmental issues.

Social safeguards: As noted in the PAD, based on the regional environmental and social
assessment, and the tribal (and vulnerable groups) plan, it is clear that the scheduled caste
and tribal groups, though more vulnerable than non-tribals and other castes, were not
considered strongly discriminated against or marginalized in GoK development efforts.
The expansion of project financing to IGAs and use of careful targeting systems
significantly improved the share of benefits flowing to these vulnerable groups.

Procurement: Procurement was satisfactory in complying with Bank guidelines and
procedures, confirmed through regular Statement of Expenditure and post-contract
reviews in the field. For implementation of the land treatment activities at micro-
watershed level, a participatory accounting system was developed, which was very
simple and transparent. Stringent guidelines were adopted for identification, execution
and release of payments. In some cases, there were delays in finalizing specific contracts
to meet the Bank's rigorous procurement guidelines, particularly under single source
selection and for participatory research. The transformation to performance based
contracts with NGOs in 2007 was a very positive step.

Financial management: The financial management (FM) rating gradually improved over
the life of the project. Following initial technical and WDD capacity problems with the
selected custom FM software package, an accounting firm was contracted to provide
technical support. While the consultancy improved overall efficiency and aided project
FM staff in maintaining the software, the consultancy had to be maintained on a part-time
basis throughout the project. This is not viewed as a major problem, however because in
the latter stages of the project, the GoK began unrolling a new and much simpler off-the-
shelf FM software package to all departments. The fund flow for field activities through
the District Watershed office to the communities, and subsequent reconciliation was
satisfactory. The accounting and record keeping for the project has been satisfactory. The
external audit has been carried out by the Auditor General (GoK) and audit reports
submitted to the Bank, albeit in some cases with considerable delay. Internal auditing has
been an integral design of the project and one of its strengths.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase
A major share of the project investments has been to private farmers, and to members of
Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and their IGAs with individual benefits. Hence, ongoing
maintenance will generally continue by farmers, SHGs and individual members of SHGs.
District and Taluk (sub-district administrative areas) level WDD offices are now largely
established and staffed on a permanent basis. These will no doubt continue to provide


                                             6
some level of ongoing support to the established community based organizations (CBOs)
and related agencies in project areas. Due to the timing of Phase III and the end of project,
an impact evaluation of Phase III investments could not be undertaken before March 31,
2009. The project was marketed well during implementation; one result has been GoK
replicating the model in other districts through Government of India (GoI) watershed
schemes. A repeater project proposal has been referred to the Bank by the GoI for the
remaining arid, rainfed districts in Karnataka. The proposed project is now under
consideration for financing, possibly as part of a larger programmatic approach in several
states, based largely on the lessons learned from KWDP.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project objectives of land and water management continue to be highly relevant.
Pressures on water use are likely to increase, and rural poverty alleviation is still an issue
for the GoK and the Bank. In particular, soil and water conservation are central to the
2006 GoK Agriculture Policy. The core design elements of on-and-off-farm watershed
treatments planned and implemented through a participatory process, are still sound. In
future project designs, more emphasis is needed on groundwater management, which was
not part of the original design. The combination of watershed treatment with income
generating activities and SHG strengthening in the same communities stands as very
relevant, for equity purposes. Moreover, such an inclusive approach may impact overall
project performance for several reasons that some of the thematic studies M&E seem to
raise including: (i) inter-relationships between activities (such as water for agriculture
and livestock feeding), (ii) improved social atmosphere and community cooperation, and
(iii) overall wealth effects due to more pro-poor targeting vis-à-vis a pure "technical"
watershed treatment approach. An increasing emphasis on participatory processes,
alignment of SHGs with the expanding microfinance systems across India, and use of
performance based contracting is in line with best practices.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDO)

PDO 1 - Improved productive potential of selected watersheds and their associated
natural resource base (Satisfactory). Based on detailed targets from MWS plans,
268,000 ha of land received soil and water conservation treatments, or 72 percent of the
land available for treatment4. From a physical watershed development perspective, this is
a very solid achievement. While results on arable lands are very successful, achievements
were more limited on non-arable lands, including State Reserved Forests, and common
property areas. Based on the Food and Agriculture (FAO) team's review, only 15,000 ha


4
  Refer to Annex 11 for a detailed discussion of area treated. While project documents show 398,000 ha of
land treatments, in some cases farmers used more than one treatment (farm ponds and bunding for
example), which meant the same area was sometimes counted twice. The FAO team disaggregated all
treatments to estimate the actual area treated from the detailed targets in micro-watershed plans.



                                                   7
were treated against a target of 70,000 ha due to the small area of state Reserved Forest
actually available from MWS plans (about 10 percent of the area originally estimated in
the PAD), legal and policy constraints governing work in State Reserved Forests, and
because of the apparent low interest by many communities stemming from a lack of trust
about future benefit sharing with GoK. At the same time however, the area dedicated to
horticulture reached around 54,000 ha, or 80 percent above the original PAD target. The
bulk of soil and water conservation treatments (an estimated 254,000 ha versus target of
304,000 ha) were on private lands.

M&E data, augmented by data from local International Crops Research Institute for the
Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) monitoring stations, suggest the project has had a positive
impact on the productive potential of watersheds and their natural resource base,
including groundwater, reduced surface runoff, and soil erosion. For example, at selected
borewells in the three main agro-ecological zones, increases in ground water levels by 50
feet (ft), 61 ft and 90 ft were observed respectively. Based on Phase I and II results, it is
likely that the productive potential of Phase III watersheds has also been improved
relative to comparable non-treated areas. While the monitoring methods for these soil and
water conservation indicators were adequate, the overall data base would have been
improved had the monitoring been started earlier in the project.

Sample surveys for Phases I and II indicate that both crop yields and cropping intensity in
rainfed areas increased significantly and were accompanied by a move towards higher
value annual and permanent crops (especially horticultural). As an example, average crop
yields increased by 24 percent in Phase I and 26 percent in Phase II. The percentage of
irrigated area increased between 6 percent and 14 percent across project sites, along with
a marginal reduction in the dependency on fodder and fuel wood from common lands.
For Phase II, the project resulted in average increases in milk yields of around 20 percent
over control groups.

PDO 2 - Strengthened community and institutional arrangements for natural
resource management (Moderately Unsatisfactory). Key indicators are: (a) common
property resource management and maintenance improved on community lands, and
Forest Department (FD) lands, and (b) funds in Micro-Watershed Management Group
(MWMG) bank account increased and used for post-development maintenance (assumed
to be for common resources). Overall, the project achieved considerable results in
participatory planning and implementing land and water measures by establishing 742
community based Sujala Watershed Societies (SWSs) and 4,394 Area Groups (AGs).
However, whether the long-term sustainability of these groups was intended as a project
goal is not clear from the PAD. On the one hand, a study by Antrix (albeit from a small
sample) indicated that less than 5 percent of SWSs and AGs were fully functioning after
project withdrawal in Phases I and II and maintaining accounts for common land
sustainability. On the other hand, this result could be expected as the majority of land
treatment activities took place on private arable land with these groups mainly serving as
the intended channel for individual farm interventions, based on micro-watershed plans.
These groups effectively fulfilled this purpose during project implementation, but only a
small proportion carried on after project withdrawal.



                                             8
This situation has implications with respect to maintenance of the nearly 15,000 ha of
non-arable, Common Property Resource (CPR) lands treated under the project. It is clear
that a few, but very good examples of CPR management by SWSs, AGs, and most
encouragingly women's SHGs, have emerged and will likely be sustained. In fact, most
of the 6,648 SHGs comprising females from poorer households have continued
functioning, and a considerable number have had successful engagement in CPR
management. Outside of those CPR lands managed by SHGs however, long-term
sustainability of CPR lands is likely to be weaker because of many SWSs and AGs
ceasing to operate and more important, continued concerns over benefit sharing with
GoK by many communities, especially in Phases I and II. To address this issue, the
project commissioned a legal study, leading to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
between local government, the agency responsible for the land, and the CBOs for Phases
II and III. Even with an MOU in place however, many communities still lacked full
confidence that the agreements would assure full benefit sharing with GoK in future.
Better results may be evident for Phase III with lessons learned from earlier experiences
and improved negotiation of MOUs, but this could not be determined during the ICRR
mission. The impact of uncertain sustainability on many CPR lands treated under the
project must be viewed in the broader context. These treatments encompassed less than
15,000 ha compared to an estimated 254,000 ha of arable lands treated, where private
ownership and incentives to maintain agriculture productivity provide better assurances
of sustainability.

PDO 3 - Poverty focus (Satisfactory): All classes of beneficiaries had incremental
increases in income. While noting earlier questions raised by the ICRR team over control
group size and survey instruments, household income increased for all land ownership
classes of farmers. In Phase II, increases were around 40 percent for small and marginal
farmers (less than 2 ha), more than 50 percent for landless, and close to 80 percent for
larger farmers (more than 2 ha), compared to controls. Concerns over equity issues in
2003 were addressed through a special M&E study that led to reductions in
mechanization for soil and water conservation works, maximized use of local labor, and
to proportionally allocate less investment to larger farmers. It is estimated that between
12 and 25 million person-days of employment were created through the project,
particularly for physical works construction. In addition, the revolving fund introduced
after MTR for IGA and SHGs, targeting women and landless, was another positive equity
measure.

From various estimates (baselines, Phase II and III Sujala Watershed Action Plans
(SWAPs) and impact assessments), the project reached out to an estimated 400,000
households. Overall, the project improved the lives of 230,000 direct beneficiaries,
including 193,000 landholders and 40,000 landless, the latter through farm labor, SHGs
and IGA. The SHGs have also built up around US$5 million in savings, with the power to
borrow four times these savings levels from commercial banks. The number of
households rising above the poverty threshold is perhaps in the order of 50,000 or more,
at least on a temporary basis; this is a highly commendable achievement.




                                            9
PDO 4 - Communities have strengthened capacity to be involved in planning,
implementation social and environmental management, maintenance of assets
emanating from local level development programs. (Moderately satisfactory). The
indicator, "project-created CBOs (in logframe "MWMGs and beneficiary" groups)
involved in broader community affairs" is valid but poorly formulated in the PAD.
Regardless, the project successfully demonstrated the capacity of community
organizations to be involved in planning, managing funds and implementing Sujala
watershed project activities, and building awareness. As indicated earlier however, few
Sujala Watershed Society Executive Committees (SWS-ECs) and AGs continued to
function after project intervention, and there are valid concerns about maintenance of
common land assets by these groups. On the other hand, with a much greater number and
survival rate as functioning units, the SHGs are emerging as a more important channel for
addressing community affairs, even though their primary focus has been savings and
IGAs. With more homogenous groupings of poorer women, considerable leadership
developed in many cases; these groups have the potential to be a key achievement under
this PDO. This outcome offsets the poor sustainability of AGs and SWGs, and justifies a
Moderately Satisfactory rating.

PDO 5- Implementing department operating in more socially inclusive manner
(Satisfactory). The PAD indicator, "implementing department operated in a facilitator
role" is not clearly specified in what way this would be observable. Regardless, the WDD
was established only just prior to project start-up, but in a few years developed as an
effective formal institution, facilitating participatory watershed planning, implementation
and M&E. It did not impose treatment activities on communities, but rather developed
guidelines and worked closely with people to identify interventions, which would be
more environmentally beneficial and socially inclusive. This is a very positive outcome.

3.3 Efficiency
The efficiency of the project in economic and financial terms is rated satisfactory (Table
1). The estimated overall economic Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 17.7 percent, slightly
higher than the PAD estimate of 16.4 percent. The estimated Net Present Value (NPV) is
INR2.9 billion (US$62 million) at a discount rate of 12 percent (the same rate as in PAD),
which is around 20 percent higher than the PAD estimate of INR2.4 billion (adjusted to
2009 constant prices using Indian Consumer Price Index). The main drivers of the higher
results are the horticulture benefits (planted area 80 percent above PAD estimates) and
increased cultivated arable land for agriculture. The results also reflect very good cost
efficiency during project implementation. A financial analysis shows very positive
returns to farmers, for example horticulture (23 percent), agriculture (31-36 percent), and
dairy (14 percent). For IGA, tailoring (24 percent) is a positive result. Annex 3 provides
more details.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The overall rating is Satisfactory (Table 1). This is based on: (a) Relevance - Satisfactory;
(b) PDO achievement ­ Satisfactory; and (c) Efficiency - Satisfactory. Information on
Phase III impacts as yet are mostly by observation and sample investment data, but
indicate that in some areas, the results may improve. Had the PAD objectives been


                                             10
formally revised for common property resources and a `poverty focus', the achievements
of the project could be considered excellent.

Some key messages from the review of PDO achievements are:

(a) the project measurably improved the productive potential of watersheds;
(b) a high proportion of overall project achievements were through investments in soil
    and water conservation on more than 300,000 ha of private, arable lands;
(c) investments in common lands through community groups were less successful except
    for those managed by SHGs, particularly female SHGs;
(d) the project achieved significant results in addressing rural poverty;
(e) the WDD developed into an effective and inclusive implementing agency; and
(f) a robust M&E system designed and established by Antrix and WDD after project
    effectiveness, was a critical success factor in project performance and adaptability.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
As a result of increased local labor demand around soil and conservation civil works,
many villages reported decreased migration to distant areas, contributing to better family
and community relations. There has been possible (but undocumented) cases of leakage
of some labor benefits to larger farmers who requested cash from laborers before hiring
them and using the money as part of their cost-share. This practice, which is widespread
across India, was addressed as far as possible in the project with public displays of
minimum wage rates, labor allocations for specific land treatments, plus local
institutional strengthening that helped people stand up better to village elites.

Strengthened women's economic and social status was evident through their engagement
in SHGs and IGAs. Several examples of women leaders emerging in communities were
noted, some elected in village councils and local government, with others mobilizing the


                                              11
community for improved sanitation, and accessing other GoK services. Men in several
villages mentioned changing relationships with their wives who now had more influence
over household decisions. Based on case studies, in some instances, federations of
women's SHGs have formed and were instrumental in developing further linkages with
commercial banks and addressing community issues, such as alcoholism. A survey of
SWS-EC members identified gender and equity improvements as one of the major
unintended features of the watershed development project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Community para-veterinarians `Gopala Mitras', usually young men and women drawn
from project villages, were trained to provide important animal health functions to
livestock beneficiaries through primary livestock health and artificial insemination. They
have been formally recognized by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
Services (DAHVS). An estimated 77 percent of Gopala Mitras have developed into
successful independent, private service providers, while the remainder have struggled or
have failed. This success rate is a good result for small business start-ups anywhere.

The establishment of inter-agency, district level technical teams under the leadership of
the DWDO to provide coordinated support to communities during micro-watershed
planning and implementation proved quite successful. This model has been replicated in
new Watershed Management (WSM) programs in Karnataka, financed by GoI funds. In
addition, a large number of district-level agricultural, livestock, forestry, WDD, and NGO
staff have been trained and gained experience in participatory watershed and livelihoods
development. New national Common Guidelines for Watershed Development Processes
also follow many project lessons and processes. The KWDP has hosted several mission
from within India and other countries, and widely disseminated and presented its
innovative processes. These audiences, programs, and policies will serve to spread the
effects of the project far beyond its original project sub-watersheds.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)
The project was the recipient of five prestigious national awards in the latter years of
implementation; National Productivity Awards 2007 and 2009; National Water Award
2007; Earth Care Award 2008; and National E-Governance Award 2009.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A stakeholder workshop with 60 participants was used to develop the Borrowers ICRR.
Some key points were:
(a) The project adopted an inclusive approach that encompassed watershed activities with
    equity, gender sensitivity and balanced participation from government, communities
    and private sector. This model can guide new integrated project design.
(b) The project promoted high levels of transparency by displaying relevant information
    on walls in villages such as meteorological data, soil analysis results for
    micronutrients, wage rates, beneficiary financing, and decisions taken at gram sabhas.
(c) Performance based payment systems adopted for NGOs later in the project ensured
    complete compliance with project objectives and deliverables.


                                           12
(d) Exposure visits to Phase I sites motivated communities in Phases II and III to
    undertake successful interventions and reinforced their belief about what could work.
(e) Resource mapping should be combined with expertise mapping to help community
    members take up suitable IGA activities. It is important to facilitate market linkages
    for IGA. Follow-on handholding support was more important than the initial IGA
    training to assist group members in seeking loans, identifying and purchasing assets,
    raw material etc, and organizing markets.
(f) Training programs in Phase I were rushed and the reading material not fully used by
    the beneficiaries. In Phases II and III, greater efforts were made to improve training
    quality and create user-friendly training material such as booklets and posters.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
The Risk to Development Outcome is considered Moderate. There are a number of
potential risks to the longer-term productivity of treated lands:

(a) Despite considerable project efforts to implement innovative management
    mechanisms for CPRs, there is a risk that the improvements to common lands will in
    some cases not be sustained because of increasing pressure for fuelwood and grazing
    resources, especially with increasing livestock numbers, declining tree survival in
    some sites, and the related concern by some communities over the realized sharing of
    future production from CPR areas. On individual private lands, the risk of damage to
    physical structures (field bunds, farm ponds, etc) has been partly mitigated because of
    required farmer contributions acting as an incentive for maintenance, good control
    over construction quality, and training farmers in routine maintenance techniques.
(b) Considerable project resources have been invested in activities related to recharging
    groundwater (a fundamental goal of watershed management), however the already
    considerable competition for scarce water resources is exacerbated by state subsidies
    to farmers on electricity for bore well operation.
(c) Despite the numerous successes with IGAs and intensive training for beneficiaries
    and SHGs on good practices and FM, the fact that Phase III (with the largest share of
    project activities) IGAs were only able to receive project support for about one year is
    some cause for worry. The success and final impacts from these groups will only
    become evident well after project closure.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately satisfactory. While the design was generally appropriate and the core
objectives and approach are still highly relevant, there were some shortcomings and
inconsistencies including: unclear poverty focus on different farmer classes; poorly stated
objectives in the PAD (in some cases targets not specified, or inconsistent); and an



                                            13
underestimation of the complexity of implementing vegetative improvements on common
lands, and forestry interventions on state forests.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory. Supervision was generally supportive to project team decisions and
providing timely technical advice, for example on equity considerations, civil works
construction quality, and later in the project with hydrology. The Bank was particularly
responsive on the need for flexibility to address needed changes, such as for restructuring
and extensions that ensured project resources and timing would allow more time and
focus to achieving results. Cooperative efforts of Bank staff and the client began to bear
fruit by November 2007 (recorded in ISR sequence 14) when project implementation
became much more satisfactory. At the same time however, supervision could have
focused more on tracking beneficiary numbers, and formally revising PDO indicators and
targets, particularly for CPR and forestry work, as the project continued to evolve.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory. While there were some shortcomings in design, these were
mitigated somewhat by the flexibility of the project supervision team, which allowed for
substantial improvements in the project structure and implementation modalities to
support achievement of its PDO.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory. The GoI and GoK supported the project throughout with staffing
and processing of contracts, although there were occasional delays in auditing. The
project would have benefited at an early stage from greater clarity and guidance on:
institutional arrangements over the utilization of CPRs; benefit sharing and fund flow for
work proposed in state forests; the Panchayat role in CPRs; electrical subsidies to farmers
for pumping groundwater; and regulations on groundwater use. It must be recognized
however, that these are major policy issues, and not just in Karnataka. In addition, the
degree to which these could be realistically addressed solely by this project was limited
from the start. The GoI has set up a National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA) to support
watershed development throughout the country, with new guidelines drawing from
KWPD experience.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory. The WDD has played a very key role in the positive outcomes of the
project: learning, adapting and being flexible to needs and issues arising from field
experiences and open to M&E information. It has steered the project towards increasing
resources for poorer sections in the community and led the shift towards performance
based contracts for NGOs.




                                            14
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory. This is based on the positive performance of GOK and WDD in
implementing the project with a strong focus on achieving the PDO and in doing so,
being flexible to change and improvement guided by ongoing M&E results.


6. Lessons Learned
The project successfully achieved considerable results against what are still very relevant
and challenging objectives. Against some original design weaknesses, the project team,
partners and the Bank set about addressing the objectives comprehensively, learning and
adapting on the way, refining processes for streamlined training, better inclusion and
better planning mechanisms. Many positive lessons have been generated including:

Watershed planning and Implementation
(a) A combination of watershed and livelihoods interventions can create strong
    multiplication effects. Where traditional soil and water conservation programs
    (focusing on farmers and common lands) are combined with SHG and IGA activities
    (targeting small and marginal farmers, women, and landless), greater value added is
    created in terms of equity and livelihoods linkages beyond what could be achieved
    through separate watershed management and rural livelihoods projects.
(b) Participatory watershed planning and implementation requires flexibility in
    treatment options. A balance is needed between community desires for soil and
    water conservation investments, and technically effective and rational treatments.
    This was demonstrated under the project's experience through the participatory
    planning system, supported by training and intensive process monitoring, quality
    controls, cost ceilings, and beneficiary contribution rates that promoted equity.
(c) Watershed management projects need to be focused around water. New projects
    need to be framed around basin or sub-basin hydrology and land-use modeling and
    analyses that will set the context for local soil and water management plans. Future
    projects should also consider groundwater management as an integral component.
(d) Targets for land treatments should be realistic, regularly reviewed and formally
    documented. It was unrealistic to base project targets on achieving 100 percent
    coverage of treatable lands. Targets from actual micro-plans needed to be applied and
    formally adopted/documented.
(e) Adequate time and resources should be allocated to develop project
    implementation capabilities for participatory watershed development. Watershed
    development projects are complex, especially when combined with rural livelihood
    and development activities. The project demonstrated the value of comprehensive
    capacity building to all levels of stakeholders, and the value of partnering with NGOs
    experienced in participatory watershed management.
(f) Participatory watershed development projects benefit from a phased approach.
    This allows for adequate testing of methodologies for community participation




                                            15
   relevant to particular eco-regions and existing institutional capabilities, and building
   the capacities of local agencies needed for implementation.

Improving Equity
(g) The equity and poverty reduction aims and processes within watershed
    development need clear articulation. While the project was highly inclusive, a
    majority of the benefits in terms of investment flows went to the larger landowners.
    This inherent bias in watershed management of having to work with landowners who
    can afford contributions can be mitigated through a structured set of measures, which
    go beyond geographical targeting, such as changing beneficiary contributions to favor
    smaller and marginal farmers, and introducing an IGA component with a revolving
    fund to target vulnerable groups such as landless.


Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
(h) Comprehensive hydrological and soil loss assessments need to be incorporated
    into the project design and implemented early. Effective monitoring is necessary
    to capture key environmental upstream and downstream effects of watershed
    treatments on water budgets, but it must begin early and be sustained.
(i) An independent and credible partner M&E institution can complement M&E
    functions in the implementing agency and provide major contributions to
    project success. Specialist M&E agencies can deliver a range of complementary
    services, including spatial information from remote sensing and GIS, intensive
    process monitoring and thematic studies, and high quality oversight for more specific
    surveys, such as poverty assessments and improved data analysis and reporting. This
    becomes even more important if the M&E capability in the implementing agency is
    limited. The development of mechanisms to ensure feedback into project
    management and enable proper reflection on project design can yield substantial
    results towards achieving project objectives.
(j) The project duration needs to account for post-intervention support and
    monitoring. The project showed a strong need to ensure that IGAs and SHGs get
    adequate follow-up advice and linkage building to achieve longer term sustainability.

Watershed Management and Gender
(k) Direct gender targeting can have positive effects in participatory watershed
    development. Project experience suggests quotas for females in local leadership
    positions can have a positive impact on the functioning of community-based
    watershed institutions. This can include a mandated minimum composition of women
    in the local implementing institution and using women's SHGs to manage CPRs.

Managing Common Property Resources
(l) Management of common property resources needs a dedicated strategy with
    additional resources. CPRs form a key livelihood base and safety net for a large

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

The initial draft ICRR by the FAO team was reviewed by WDD and Antrix in April 2009.
A comprehensive dialogue then took place between WDD, Antrix, and FAO over a six
week period to gather additional data and clarify questions regarding specific M&E data
(particularly for household income impacts), and calculate achievements for land
treatments relative to PAD targets versus more refined targets from micro-watershed
plans.
The WDD reviewed the revised ICRR draft in August 2009. Only three additional
comments were raised with respect to:
1. Fund flow: correcting a statement in the main report that fund flow and reconciliation
   for field activities was through local authorities when in fact fund flow to
   communities was from the DWDO office to the SWS-EC. Response ­ statement was
   corrected.
2. Post-project evaluation: suggesting that 91 percent of the project area had been
   treated by the project, rather than 72 percent in the report. Response - This proposed
   figure is incorrect and includes some double counting of multiple treatments on the
   same area. We will maintain the figure of 72 percent developed by FAO based on
   detailed Antrix data and in-depth analysis (refer to Annex 11 of this ICRR)
3. Project area: correcting a statement in the main report that Phase III impact studies
   were being undertaken post-project closure, when in fact due to alternative funding
   sources not being available as assumed at closure, this initiative could not be financed.
   At the same time, results for Phase III were expected to be similar to impact study
   results from Phases I and II. Response ­ statement was corrected.

The final statement reads: "Except for the above three issues, we concur with the findings
and have no further comments to offer".

Social Mobilization and Institution Building Activities
The KWDP has successfully introduced a different organizational structure for
implementing watershed development activities than has been previously used in
Karnataka. These new arrangements brought together district-level line departments,
Zilla Panchayats, NGOs and the project beneficiaries under the direction of the WDD.
Adoption, preparation and planning in project villages were done in 77 sub-watersheds
and 743 micro-watersheds and 1,270 villages.

A nationally recognized NGO (MYRADA) developed a training manual and led the
training of trainers system in Phases I and II, which in turn built up a huge cadre of Field
NGO (FNGO) staff delivering training to communities on social mobilization, facilitating
watershed planning and basic organizational skills and systems. Training workshops and
training were provided to Watershed Development Teams and Panchayat members.
MYRADA acted as the Partner NGO (PNGO) throughout the project until 2008. Two
lead NGOs, with sub-offices, provided continuing monitoring and capacity building
support at the District level to 47 local field NGOs (FNGOs).

Overall a huge number of beneficiaries were trained: 75 different trainings provided to
SHGs, AGs and SWS-EC, to almost 300,000 community members. Based on
assessments of training, the capacity building was generally to the considerable
satisfaction of the trainees, particularly to help them implement the basic aspects of the
project. WDD, with the help of assessments and together with the PNGO were active in
streamlining modules on a continuing basis, but especially after MTR recommendations
based on experiences in the Phase I.

Training on bookkeeping, livestock, SWAP preparation through Participatory Rural
Appraisal (PRA), have generated good results among all CBO types for watershed
implementation and basic environmental awareness. Overall training was more effective
when delivered to SHGs than to AGs and SWS-EC. Overall, the impacts were better for
social and economic aspects rather than broader natural resources management. The PRA
was for example, very effective for SWAP planning, but less so for preparing community
for the post-project maintenance and extension.

For AGs, the training impacts were nevertheless greater than for SWS-EC, mainly on
project implementation level aspects rather than those for post-project concerns such as
asset maintenance. Sensitization and awareness, though generating knowledge on
environmental concerns of treatment activities of AG members, had `poor' results on
sustainability and economic awareness overall. A similar pattern applied to SWS-EC,
though here it was noted that perhaps training just by NGO personnel was insufficient to
overcome `status barriers', indicating perhaps a lack of more formal engagement by
skilled GoK personnel in more technical trainings. Training assessments indicated overall
technical inputs were relatively less structured and effective. Where it was implemented
more through inputs by technical agencies, such as District Resource Group (DRG for
example in Kolar) the result seemed more effective.

Satellite-communication based training programs were also implemented for CBOs,
Department staff and participating NGOs to help build capacities on a larger scale and at
less cost. The program helped all the stakeholders to actively participate in the training
and to get clarification for all their queries. Radio programs on different thematic areas,
which included question and answer sessions were organized between experts and
farmers.

Micro-Watershed Planning
The project achieved a good level of beneficiary and stakeholder participation in planning
and executing field actives, and this project compares well with previous Bank funded
watershed projects in India, which had similar objectives on beneficiary participation.
The PAD provided considerable detail on the proposed organizational structure, and
covenants mandated that field level implementation be through the Zilla Panchayats (ZP)
and MWS management groups. Following the MTR, the operating manual was updated,
and the resulting document provided comprehensive details on project institutions, the
preparation and implementation of SWAPs, FM and M&E. Further revisions were made
in 2005 to incorporate stronger environmental management considerations and to
emphasize the ridge to valley approach in MWS planning.

All 742 micro-watersheds have had SWS, practically all with active executive
committees (SWS-EC), and all with SWAPs. After the PRA, SWAPs and sub-plans were
then developed and validated in each micro-watershed.

The overall effectiveness of the community organizations, especially the AGs and SWSs
in implementing the project was highly impressive. Nearly all the geographical areas
included in the SWAPs, and a very large proportion of landholdings were included for


                                            20
treatment. Sub-plans for SHG and community wide activities were mandated to engage
the landless and scheduled castes and tribes, especially with regard to labor and IGAs. It
is estimated (see section 3.2) that a very large proportion of all households, both farmers
and landless in the project watershed areas were involved in the project in one way or
another as result of the process. There were CBO self assessments every 6 months.
During implementation (May 2008), over 75 percent of SWSs and SHGs were
performing at levels considered `good' ­ according to self assessment criteria. The results
were somewhat lower amongst AGs.

Common land planning formed a subset of planning within the SWAP. Nevertheless, the
level of results for increasing awareness and facilitated involvement by community in
CPRs was low. Training on CPRs was not so effective with little emphasis on longer-
term maintenance, at least initially. Where communities had benefited from exposure
visits to successful CPRs management, this proved the best method of raising awareness
and gaining useful knowledge.

A large amount of funds was raised as beneficiary counterpart contribution for land
treatment: 36 crores INR ($7.2 million). This formed a major commitment to the follow-
through of farmers to the success of the project outcomes, and a sign of the strength of
mobilization in support of land treatment. However, it should be pointed out that some of
this contribution may have been raised by larger farmers who asked for upfront cash from
laborers, which is a common practice in India. The project tried to reduce this practice by
posting wage rates prominently in villages along with other project financial information,
and through monitoring farmers and laborers.

By the time of the ICRR mission, the withdrawal strategy was completed in nearly all
sub-watersheds, following closures of accounts. The withdrawal strategy implemented
was well structured, but focused considerably on practical matters such as closing
accounts. An earlier PNGO proposal for a more comprehensive withdrawal focusing
more on sustainability was not fully adopted.

Entry-Point Investments
Entry point activities (EPAs) were designed to be implemented at the early mobilization
stage in the communities, to develop rapport with communities and help people learn to
make collective decisions over their own development. The project funded interventions
that addressed the needs identified by the community in a participatory manner and
agreed by Gram Sabha. The project specified a maximum US$2,200 per community, with
a 10 percent contribution from the same to the EPA.

A total of 1,674 EPAs were planned and followed up, most of those implemented being
community halls, but also drinking water, small roads, drainage, schools and sanitation
facilities were constructed. In 2005, a policy decision was made by GoK to channel funds
for watershed development through local authorities, including externally financed
projects like KWDP. This would have been a major departure from the existing fund flow
from the DWDO office to the SWS-EC. Given the high risk of trying to change the entire
fund flow mechanism for a project well into its planned implementation period, a


                                            21
compromise was reached for the KWDP to only direct the EPA funds through local
authorities before it reached the SWS-EC, rather than redesign the entire project. As
agreed, the new approach was monitored over the remainder of the project, and it was
noted that there was slow approval of EPAs in many cases, by Gram and ZP, and in some
cases followed by delayed payments to SWS for implementation.

Physical Treatment of Sub-Watersheds
Project activities were implemented in 743 MWS located in 77 sub-watersheds (SWSs) in
5 districts (as mentioned earlier, these five later became 7 districts during implementation
due to administrative changes to district boundaries). The total geographical area was
518,087 ha. Districts were selected based on physical (including extent of rainfed
agriculture and groundwater problem areas) and poverty indicators. The project was
implemented in three overlapping phases to allow learning and modification during
project implementation. Phase I consisted of 10 SWS covering approximately 69,000 ha
(June 2002 to June 2005), Phase II had 20 SWSs covering approximately 111,000 ha
(June 2003 to June 2006), and Phase III had more than 60 percent of the total SWSs with
47, and covered approximately 338,000 ha (April 2004 to December 2008). The district
coverage is shown below:

There were contradictions in the PAD over arable land area treatment targets, and these
were clarified to some degree during MTR. Also at the MTR, provision was made for
additional resources to be allocated to components 3 and 4; however the actual physical
targets for land treatments were not adjusted to reflect the redirection of funds. By the
end of the project the actual expenditure for Component 1 was 74 percent of total project
expenditure (PAD estimate 89 percent), Component 2 was 4 percent (PAD 5 percent),
Component 3 was 13 percent (PAD 4 percent) and Component 4 was 8 percent (PAD 4
percent).

Despite expenditure in Component 1 being less than the PAD target, the land treatment
targets were largely achieved, but with some significant variations to the initial proposals.
While the arable land treatments were in line with original targets and horticultural
targets substantially exceeded the initial area targets, there were major shortcomings in
respect of forest land (under control of the FD) and common properties (usually under the



                                               22
control of the ZPs). The PAD envisaged 80,000 ha of forestry activities (33,200 ha on
state forest land, 36,900 ha on common property and 9,900 ha of private cultivable
wasteland to be rehabilitated). Despite initial assurances given by the FD during project
preparation, there was a lack of agreement between the WDD and the FD on the control
of funds for work on state forest land. Also, the FD was unwilling to allow treatments
other than planting trees on their lands, which in many cases would do little to improve
downstream watershed benefits. In addition, the area of state forest land available for
treatment was overestimated during project design, and during the actual preparation of
detailed SWAPs during implementation, virtually no areas were identified as FD land.
The shortfall in achieving targets on common properties was partly due to the available
area being less than planned because of unauthorized encroachments, and also because
during participatory planning there was a beneficiary preference to work on privately
owned land.

As noted above, the PAD allocated about 25 percent of the total project base costs for the
treatment of 80,000 ha with forestry and silvipasture activities. By the end of the project
however, there had been no significant reforestation on FD land, and the total area of
29,000 ha of forest activities achieved were for agro-forestry, usually border plantations
on arable areas, roadside plantations, and block plantations on common property and
cultivable waste land. It should be noted however, that horticulture treatment on private
lands amounted to an additional 54,000 ha by the end of the project, adding market and
non-market forestry benefits into the micro-watershed, but not on state forests or
common lands under the authority of other government departments. Had the original
targets been formally adjusted during implementation, a better ICRR result would have
been possible.

The PAD provided flexibility to allow the selection of activities in-line with stakeholder
priorities, with watershed activities being presented as optional treatments, and it
provided indicative per/ha investment levels of INR5,000 for arable land, INR6,000 for
horticultural development, and between INR18,000 and INR22,000 for silvipasture and
forestry activities. The operation manual provides similar guidelines for per/ha
investments, and to guide the overall maximum investment at a micro-watershed level, it
also provided an overall limit of INR7, 000/ha for each SWAP.

The actual expenditure on soil and water conservation activities was 75 percent of total
Component 1 expenditure. There has been a clear priority by beneficiaries towards
investments in soil and water conservation to improve in-situ soil moisture conservation
for better crop production, on-farm water storage, ground water recharge, and drainage
line stabilization. The major physical investments for Component 1 have been:

These treatments accounted for approximately 40 percent of the total investments in
Component 1. This is not an unexpected selection by beneficiaries living in an area
characterized by low rainfall, declining groundwater levels, and a resulting shortage of
water for irrigation, livestock and domestic uses.

The M&E studies conducted at the end of Phase I revealed an emphasis on structural soil
and water conservation works, and recommended that a better balance was required,
particularly in respect of horticultural and forestry activities. As noted earlier, this
transformation was largely achieved although the original PAD targets were not formally
revised. The excessive use of machinery rather than labor for construction activities was
also identified as a problem. New guidelines were introduced for the remaining two
phases with a limit of 60 percent of SWAP investments for treating arable land and
drainage lines, 20 percent for horticulture and 20 percent for forestry. This resulted in a
better balance between activities. The use of machinery was restricted to areas where soil
conditions were difficult for manual labor, and the investment in individual farm ponds
was reduced from a maximum of INR50,000 to INR20,000.

The horticultural development activities have been particularly successful with 54,000 ha
being developed against an original target of 30,000 ha. M&E case studies show good
survival rates (70 to 80 percent) and good maintenance, and a significant conversion from
single cropping to agro-horticulture, and a reduction in fallow and cultivable wastelands.
The full benefits will be achieved post-project, with species such as mango not reaching
full production until about 7-10 years after planting.

The quality of the design and construction of the SWC structures was good. A quality
management system was introduced, including the preparation of a comprehensive
quality control handbook, the introduction of an "OK" card system7 for every structure, a
photographic record of key construction activities, and quality control training for project
staff and NGOs.

There have been major investments in SWC activities, and key PAD PDO indicators for
the environmental impact of the project included an improvement in groundwater
recharge and a reduction in soil erosion. The project did measure these impacts but not as

comprehensively as required, however at the time the project started, most Bank-financed
watershed management projects did not put enough attention on monitoring hydrology
changes and soil erosion.


Component 2. Farming System Intensification (PAD US$5.5 million, Revised US$6.2
million, Actual US$4.2 million)

Participatory Farmer-Driven Research and Extension System
The PAD envisaged a system of farmer-driven research managed as a competitive grants
program. At MTR, this was changed to sponsored research, and resulted in the formation
of a partnership between ICRISAT and University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS)
Bangalore to implement a program of "Farming System Research and Demonstration".
This involved working jointly with the WDD, relevant district-level GoK agencies,
project NGOs and project beneficiaries, to identify and introduce technologies to increase
agricultural productivity. The approach combined participatory research/demonstration
activities on the land of beneficiary farmers, larger scale farmer training, and the
establishment of soil and moisture monitoring stations.

Many of the demonstrations delivered by ICRISAT and through Farmer Field School
(FFS) were delivered to a wide group of AG members with a range of results. For the
most successful demonstrations, adoption due to exposure visits tended to be largely on
crop varietal aspects. The impacts of trainings by ICRISAT on new technology taken up,
was very District specific. The ICRISAT work was quite successful in introducing soil
health cards for farmers to better target fertilizer applications to address specific nutrient
deficiencies and reduce costs. The work also provided farmers with better information on
monsoon rain patterns to help with agricultural planning, particularly seeding. Early
results from pilot plots show high yield increases with these simple tools, especially when
combined with soil and water conservation measures as implemented by the project.

Farmer Training for Introduction of Improved Practices
There was extensive training of farmers on improved agricultural practices to
complement planned demonstration activities:
(a) technology exposure visits and field days in the project area, as well as at UAS,
    Bangalore and an ICRISAT farmers' day (out of project area), provided an
    introduction to improved technologies for more than 5,000 farmers;
(b) two hundred farmers were trained on seed production, processing, safe storage and
    establishing village based seed banks;
(c) six hundred farmers were trained on methods of treating seed with Rhizobium,
    insecticides, and fungicides;
(d) three hundred farmers were trained on integrated production and protection
    management (IPPM) techniques;




                                             25
(e) eight hundred fifty farmers were trained on improved agricultural implements, such a
    seeding tropicultors; and
(f) six hundred farmers and rural women from self-help groups (SHGs) participated in
    training on vermi-compost preparation techniques.

Initially, training on technical components such as on IPPM and integrated nutrient
management (INM), which would have been of greater interest to AGs, lagged somewhat
behind; in addition the coverage of these trainings was also limited early in the project.
The FFS model seemed to provide a useful tool for building the technical capacity of
AGs, with increased biological control and reduced pesticide use. However, the FSS
system was applied only to a limited extent, although reports noted that several WDD
staff, in association with the Agriculture Department (AD), now has the experience to
further impart FFS related skills through regular extension work.

Program of Farm Demonstrations
Field work began in 2005 with the selection of 10 Phase 1 MWSs in all project districts,
to implement participatory field trials in INM; varietal selection; land and water
management; IPPM; and integrated disease management. A total of 353 trials were
conducted in conjunction with beneficiary farmers in the first year. Based on the
experience in the first year, activities were scaled-up to add a further 33 trial sites and
378 trials were conducted in 2006. There was a further expansion in 2007 (the final year
for trials) with farmers participating in 1,164 field trials over an area of 5,900 ha in all
project districts.

The farming research and demonstration activities were assessed by a project M&E
random sample survey covering 172 farmers who had cooperated in the field trial
activities, and to ascertain the secondary impacts, an additional 234 project farmers who
had not participated in a field trial were also surveyed. The survey covered all project
districts. The adoption of new technologies varied between districts, but overall the
adoption level due to exposures to the ICRISAT farmers' day and field visits indicate that
the best adoption was for improved varieties (46 percent) and for improved cropping
pattern (27 percent). By the third year, overall crop productivity on farmer trials was
demonstrated to have increased by 45 percent to 65 percent with the application of INM
treatments. Land and water management trials in Chitradurga demonstrated that it was
possible to increase maize production by one ton/ha due to using a conservation furrow
system, which was a 25 percent increase over traditional methods. Integrated Disease
Management for groundnut resulted in identifying a superior foliar disease tolerant
cultivar. Improved location specific cultivars of groundnut, ragi, soybean and maize were
identified.

INM trials demonstrated good yield increases, but adoption was low (86 percent of
respondents indicated improved yields due to INM, however 74 percent discontinued the
INM aspects, and only 5 percent extended it to their entire cultivable area). The study
concluded that the impact of the demonstrations was much better with direct
beneficiaries, and had a lower secondary impact.


                                            26
Strengthening Disease/Pest Surveillance and Forewarning System
Project training activities have improved the general knowledge of farmers in the project
area of disease and pest identification and control, but improvements in long-term
institutional capacity is likely to be limited to individual farmers given that a high
proportion of AGs have not been sustained post project. Continued support to farmers
will be required from the trained district specialists in both the AD and WDD through
regular extension work.

Forestry-related Institutions' Capacity Building
Project activities have not resulted in any improved capacity in forestry related
institutions, as little specific FD related activities took place on the ground due to legal
and policy issues, and disagreements over fund flow that could not be resolved.

Livestock
More than 86,500 women and men were given capacity building support on livestock and
dairying through various trainings. Livestock training was considered to be one of the
most successful of the project's capacity building activities. It was well-designed and had
simple and effective delivery mechanisms given by specialist NGOs through village-
based training (VBT) and posters and charts with clear messages, with follow-up
practical animal health camps (110,000 livestock benefited from 1,435 camps). At these
camps, livestock were treated for diseases, and given vaccines against contagious
diseases. These camps also served as spaces for demonstrations, lectures, film shows and
rallies to increase awareness.

More than 64,741 farmers (community members) benefited from the project through the
purchase of livestock as part of the IGA component. In support of this, more than 6,344
ha were brought under fodder production, the majority on private land. Silvi-horti-pasture
was supported on 166 ha of common land under CBO management.

The village-based Gopala Mitras and Livestock Extension Agents were in place to
provide follow-up support. Gopala Mitra para-veterinarians formed part of the original
design. These were specially trained community members, often educated youth, who
were to provide ongoing community level support to households with livestock. During
project implementation Gopala Mitras had a modest project stipend (May 2008 WDD
progress report, p16) to help with the transition to becoming private service providers.
Agreements were reached with the Department of Veterinary Services to provide ongoing
technical support. Of the 154 Gopala Mitras trained under the project, 119 continue to
provide door-to-door delivery of support in the project area during implementation on a
fee basis, with feedback that their services were being utilized to a considerable degree
by community members. Earnings by the Gopala Mitras appear to be between US$75
and US$375 per month, with an average of around US$125.

Fisheries
A new initiative by the project was in improving fisheries in water harvesting structures
established or improved by the project. Stocking of fingerlings was done in 69 private
farm ponds, and 5 common or village ponds, resulting in very good harvests.


Component 3. Income Generation Activities (US$4.1 million, US$15.4 million,
US$14.5 million)

Formation, Strengthening and Training of Beneficiary Groups
Building on the initial mobilization by field NGOs, the project support for IGA evolved
with the burgeoning SHG movement both in Karnataka and more widely in India. The
project financed 27 Specialist NGOs (SNGOs) to support the further formation and
organization of SHGs with training of members, linking SHGs with existing GoK
development schemes, disseminating marketing information, and developing linkages
with commercial banks for capital growth post-project. Some examples of linkages
include the project convergence with the GoK Total Sanitation Campaign to construct
new toilets in all target communities. The project also linked with the state government
Yashaswini Scheme to provide low-cost health insurance to 4,000 beneficiaries.

A total of 6,648 new SHGs were formed, considerably more than the 5,080 expected in
the PAD, and complementing a nearly equal number already existing through other
previous government and NGO support. The project-supported SHGs had a considerably
stronger focus on the vulnerable ­ landless, scheduled castes and tribes. Though data on
the inclusion was not systematically presented, all landless and vulnerable were expected
to be part of SHGs. Nearly all groups were women-only SHGs. More male farmer
oriented AGs were also encouraged to generate group savings, with a possible view to
enhance their economic activities, though this was less successful.

The support process consisted of entrepreneurship awareness program training, assisting
individuals to start thinking and identifying potential IGAs, followed by an
entrepreneurship development program on basic business development issues and
features. For members with specific IGAs identified, a skills based entrepreneurship
development program was then provided, relating to the specific enterprise chosen. A
total of 11,216 community members were involved in exposure visits.

Some of the SNGOs did exceptional work, with comprehensive training programs and
follow-up handholding activities, quality and marketing support, and IGA fairs that
would bring together community producers and prospective buyers. The SNGOs were
backed up by specialized Additional Project Directors at the State level for livestock and
IGAs, and DRGs drawn from sector agencies, operating at the district level. In total, 96
traditional and 78 new skills-based non-traditional IGA were identified, both in the form
of individual and group activities.




                                           28
Income Generating Activities (IGAs)
Initially the project was designed to only support training and financial links to
commercial banks. However at MTR, and drawing from emerging lessons from the
Bank's growing rural livelihoods program in other states, it was realized a much greater
financial boost was needed for IGAs to really succeed within an integrated watershed
development project. In restructuring the project, the funds for the IGA component were
increased primarily to include a revolving fund allocation for each SHGs, initially INR
25,000 (US$556), later increased to INR 75,000 (US$1,667) per SHG as lessons were
learned and experience gained. This ultimately meant that overall, the IGA component
constituted 13 percent of project expenditures.

A total of 68,852 IGAs were set up, mostly facilitated through the SHGs. Training and
IGA implementation in relation to projects targets improved with each phase, as a result
of improved training methodology, as noted in independent assessments. Livestock based
IGA has proven highly successful, linking small producers with Karnataka's highly
efficient milk marketing system. Anecdotal information and ICRR field observations
noted that many of the non-livestock IGAs were generating small incremental, but
important incomes to households. In some cases federations that developed organically
were highly active and successful. For example, 19 SHGs in Kolar produced 127 tons of
papad in 5 months, with a net profit of around 2,500 INR (US$56) per month per
member, for 174 active members.

The SHGs built up 19 Crores INR (US$4.2 million) in savings, which they used largely
as counterpart funds for IGAs of different scales, and to leverage further loans from
banks. All SHGs were supported to make links with commercial or state banks. A total of
3,826 SHGs actually formed solid links to access further loans to the groups and
individuals. With less emphasis on more economic support to AGs initially, only about
16 percent of the AGs formed strong links with commercial financial institutions.

Component 4. Institutional Strengthening (PAD US$3.2 million, Revised US$9.2
million, Actual US$9.1 million)

Monitoring and Evaluation
The system was named a Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) structure and was
led by Antrix Corporation, an independent organization (commercial arm of the Indian
Space Research Organization), which was contracted early on by WDD. The expected
outputs were: (i) M&E system in place and operational, (ii) KRSAC assisting with GIS
and preparation of treatment plans for project watersheds. The project has successfully
achieved all output targets on M&E with a very innovative and comprehensive
MIS/M&E system involving Antrix, WDD, NGOs and CBOs (for self-assessments).
Antrix also included an important field presence (3 staff per district), which supported
data collection, regular monitoring and capacity building of field NGOs, GoK staff and
beneficiaries.




                                          29
The overall system included three main components:
(a) Impact Assessment. This included the combination of GIS and remote sensing data
    with household surveys and ground-truthing in order to follow the main outcome
    indicators of the project. In addition, several case studies and thematic research were
    conducted which supported changes to project implementation (Table A-6). Antrix
    used different methods (mix of qualitative and quantitative) for measuring among
    others: (i) impact of training and capacity building, (ii) investment patterns and (iii)
    the overall impact study.
(b) Process Monitoring. This included the use of the MIS and GIS for progress
    monitoring, as well as the development of a software for support of watershed action
    plans, which not only reduced planning time but also allowed for a consistent and
    comparable approach to all MWS and for research to be conducted using the
    compiled data.
(c) Input-output Monitoring. This included a number of activities such as participatory
    observations, focus group discussions, transect walks, informal discussions, and
    expert judgment. The fact that plans were consistent also allowed for greater
    transparency in comparing planned outputs with actual works on the field. Finally,
    experts such as those employed for civil works construction quality, secured good
    overall quality of soil and water conservation works, particularly in Phases II and III,
    after lessons had been learned from Phase I.

The M&E system generated a considerable number of practical reports (Table A-6). The
project also made extensive use of remote sensing and GIS for: (i) Watershed
characterization and prioritization, (ii) Resources Assessment and (iii) Action Plan
Preparation. In addition it had an important role in building capacity of the different
implementing agencies, raising awareness about implementation problems and
monitoring solutions found. Finally, the system put in place by the independent agency
was well embedded in the project's accountability and transparency processes and this
allowed for a good working environment and contributions to project achievements.
Examples of this are the use of satellite connectivity for weekly discussions between
project director and staff, as well as receiving feedback from beneficiaries and the
changes put in place by WDD following many of the thematic reports (such as those on
labor usage for construction works).

While the process and input-output monitoring were highly successful, the main impact
evaluation study could have benefited from more specific support on household survey
implementation, analysis and reporting. The outputs achieved are considerably above
most projects, but with household income, the use of a larger control group and better
data management might have resulted in stronger statistical links between project inputs
and income.

Project Management and Coordination
Incremental operating expenses were the main support to the project. While there were
early delays in staffing the project fully, by the end of 2003, most positions at the state
office level (20 out of 22) and District level (616 out of 685) were filled, and people were
trained. The project provided basic vehicles and equipment for operations. At MTR
allocation to the operating expenses were slightly increased. The project supported study
tours for senior WDD and lower level field staff to China, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey and
Ethiopia. These field visits supported wider sharing of information with counterparts in
these other countries. The Mexico field visit included staff from all three active Bank-
supported watershed projects in India at that time to promote inter-project dialogue and
knowledge sharing.

The project was the recipient of five prestigious national awards in the latter years of
implementation; National Productivity Awards 2007 and 2009; National Water Award
2007; Earth Care Award 2008; and National E-Governance Award 2009.

                           Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


A. Project Benefits and Expected Returns in the PAD

1.    The PAD economic analysis focused on quantifying benefits from the different
project activities included in treatment of watersheds and then aggregating the different
streams of benefits and costs to estimate an overall economic rate of return for the project.
Thus benefits were calculated for agriculture, horticulture, forestry and livestock. The
PAD calculated parity prices based on Bank forecasts for the main traded commodities
and non-tradables were adjusted by a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.9. Labor
was valued at a market wage rate of INR30 per day in financial terms and adjusted by the
SCF to obtain the economic wage rate. Since the PAD costing of the project used a GoK
minimum wage of INR75 per day, the adjustments to produce economic costs have
resulted in reducing costs by around US$32 million (or 25 percent of total financial costs
including contingencies). The latter is also based on the assumption that 60 percent of
project costs excluding price contingencies consist of manual labor8.

2.     The main economic benefits from the project were expected in agriculture (42
percent of total net benefits) and secondly in horticulture and forestry (22 percent and 19
percent respectively). In agriculture, two agro-climatic zone were considered in the PAD,
first the East and Central Dry Zone (ECDZ) with Kolar, Tumkur and Chitradurga districts
and second, the North Transitional Zone NTZ with Dharwad and Haveri districts9) with
respective typical hectare models constructed (crop models were estimated with
breakdown by season and rainfed/irrigation). The agriculture benefits were expected in
50 percent of the total cultivated arable land treated by the project, resulting in 42,800
hectares in NTZ and 89,300 hectares in ECDZ. The expected benefits would result from
two main assumptions: (i) a 15 percent increase in yields of all rainfed crops and 10
percent increase in yields of irrigated crops and (ii) area under irrigation in the project
areas would increase by 10 percent (see Table A-7 for main summary of assumptions in
the PAD).




8
  To be precise, the PAD total economic costs exclude expenditures related to forestry field operation costs,
fallow land treatment and IGA. Forestry and fallow land costs were included in the calculation of net
benefits from those operations (and therefore excluded from the cost side to avoid double counting) and
IGA was excluded from the economic analysis.

3.     Regarding horticulture, economic benefits were calculated based on a total area of
30,000 ha being developed with horticulture species. The incremental net benefits (see
Table A-8 below) were derived from a representative mango model and reduced by the
estimated net income from agriculture (which was considered to represent the
opportunity cost for the land).

4.    The PAD economic analysis also included benefits from seven different forestry
models, which consisted of a combination of short rotation crops (for poles, timber and
pulpwood) with some fruit crops, as well as teak and bamboo. The total areas to benefit
include 33,200 ha of GoK forest land, 37,000 of common and gomal lands and around
9,900 ha of cultivable wastelands under the Revenue Department, or privately owned
through encroachment. The models used are not available from the project files and
therefore only the total incremental benefits from forestry can be interpreted. Moreover, it
is not clear from the PAD whether the carbon sequestration benefits were included or not
as the text says they are [PAD, p. 86] and the economic analysis table states the opposite
[PAD, p. 91]. The project economic analysis also incorporated benefits from livestock,
which assume that from project year 12 onwards about 10 percent of cross-bread cattle,
buffalo, sheep and goats in project areas (respectively 15,000; 85,000 and 320,000) adopt
best practices on feeding and also benefit from greater availability of fodder and straw.

B. ICRR Estimation Methodology

5.       Estimation of costs and benefits for the ICRR followed a similar approach to that
of the PAD to the extent possible. There was substantial information available from the
project's M&E system, which supported the ICRR calculations and allowed checking on
key assumptions from the PAD. However, a number of difficulties were encountered at
ICRR in re-assessing the economic impact of the project as a result of, (i) non-availability
of all final economic analysis files and raw data used for deriving the results presented in
the PAD (namely forestry, horticulture and livestock); (ii) treated areas reported by the
project were based on sub-watershed plans and often included more than one project
activity, which needed to be differentiated in the economic analysis; (iii) yield and
cropping pattern data reported from project M&E did not differentiate between seasons
and rainfed/irrigated crops, although the study area selected is mostly rainfed with annual
rainfall ranging from 400 to 700 mm and having less than 10 percent of the area under
irrigation (rainfed crops constitute about 90 percent to 95 percent of agriculture output);
and (iv) details on increases in area under irrigated crops were not readily available.

6.      The ICRR estimates relied to a great extent on updating the detailed ex-ante
analysis carried out during project preparation. The revised estimates use different data
from project M&E documentation, information collected during ICRR field visits, and
detailed discussions with project stakeholders. The ICRR estimates also include IGA
costs and benefits (which are not included in the PAD analysis) given the importance
accorded to this component following MTR.

Project Costs
7.       Project economic costs at ICRR have used a 0.6 conversion factor between
economic and financial unskilled labor wage rates. This is based on the observation that
when most of project soil and water conservation works were implemented, official
wages were around INR75 and wages paid around INR45. This is higher than the
conversion factor of 0.4 used at preparation and translates everything else equal into an
increase in estimated economic costs. The ICRR estimates also assume that 60 percent of
costs related with entry-point activities and treatment of watersheds are labor costs. This
is different from the PAD assumption, which included more activities under this category
(of 60 percent labor costs) therefore translating into a greater reduction of project costs
when adjusting from a financial to an economic perspective. Finally, ICRR project
economic recurrent costs are estimated as 3 percent of economic investment costs and all
costs are adjusted to 2009 constant prices using the Indian annual Consumer Price Index
(CPI) to inflate historical prices. The total economic investment costs at ICRR were
estimated at US$89.5 million (in 2009 constant prices), i.e. around 77 percent of total
financial project costs in 2009 constant prices.

Agriculture
8.     Agriculture economic benefits use two farm models representing respectively
ECDZ (Chitradurga, Kolar and Tumkur districts) and NTZ (Dharwad and Haveri). The
farm models were changed at baseline and end of project based on the cropping pattern
data collected by the M&E system for Phases I and II. The results are presented in Table


                                            34
            10
A-9 below and indicate that in the ICRR a lower share of irrigated crops and cropping
intensity is usually assumed as per the information gathered from the project. In
particular, only a 5 percent increase in irrigated areas was considered for the ICRR given
                   11
the data collected , which falls below the PAD estimate of 10 percent. Yield increases
were adjusted and computed from data made available from the impact study Phase II
report and from analysis by the ICRR team of the dataset used in that study (comparing
control and treatment before and after project). This translated into an increase in
production of a 1ha farm by 12.8 percent in ECDZ and 14.5 percent in NTZ (versus
around 15 percent in the PAD).

9.    Historical and future economic prices (based on Bank commodity price projections)
for the main commodities and inputs were derived from international prices and analysis
was conducted in constant 2009 prices using the Manufacturing Unit Value (MUV) index
as deflator for future prices. The economic prices were annual average derived prices
weighted by the number of ha estimated to benefit each year. Financial prices were
collected locally. For wages, a financial rate of INR50 per person-day was used (in line
with field observations) and the shadow wage rate was set at INR 45 per person-day.
Finally economic benefits were calculated based on a total of 141,000 ha being treated.
This was derived from the 224,403 ha of areas treated (calculated through conversion
factors from soil and water conservation activities implemented by the project and
excludes horticulture and forestry land. This is still around 7 percent above the area used
at appraisal. The benefits were assumed to start two years after the treatments (in line
with the period between impact analysis baseline and final data collection) and lasting for
15 years. The resulting net economic margins from the project are higher for the two
regions mainly as a result of higher economic prices being used. The ICRR incremental
net economic margin as a result of the project is lower for the ECDZ region (relative to
the PAD), but higher for the NTZ region, mainly as a result of higher groundnut yields.




10
  The actual calculations differentiate between irrigated and non-irrigated crops and crop budgets were
updated with a breakdown by region, irrigation and season.

11
  The Impact Study Phase II indicates between 6 and 12 percent increase in irrigated areas. However, it is
not clear whether this accounts for the evolution in the control group. Therefore only 5 percent increase
was used in the ICRR estimates.

Horticulture
10. The ICRR economic benefits follow a 1 ha mango model since the plant represents
more than 50 percent of the horticulture species planted under KWDP according to M&E
data. Survival rates for the trees are assumed at 65 percent based on Antrix report from
2007 and the model has a 30 year horizon. Given the normal spacing (around 200 trees
per ha), the survival rate and the number of hectares covered by horticulture (53,839
according to M&E data) this means almost 7 million mango trees planted. In the PAD
horticulture was to benefit only 30,000 ha. The ICRR model includes farmer
contributions to develop the mango trees that are not accounted for by total project costs,
namely 35 percent contribution on materials and seedlings and 10 percent contribution
for a farm pond. Economic benefits from horticulture in the ICRR were not decreased by
an estimated net income from agriculture (taken to be the opportunity cost of the land as
per the PAD). In fact, M&E information and field observations indicate that most of the
land used with horticulture was being intercropped and/or was idle before the project.

Forestry
11.     The ICRR economic benefits for forestry are derived from a forest species model
which consists of planting costs and minor inputs during the first five years (and some
maintenance labor until harvesting). Survival rates for the trees are assumed at 50 percent
for private land and 40 percent for revenue land. For private land, it is assumed that the
survival rate would thus be lower than that of horticulture species and on revenue land


                                                       36
the survival rate is based on Antrix's report which estimated survival rates of 40 percent
for Phase III (57 percent for phase II and 70 percent for Phase I). A 25 year horizon is
used before harvesting and total number of hectares is based on the final number from
project M&E (29,000 ha). Since most of the planting was done as agro-forestry, the
density per ha is low and assumed at 120 trees.

IGA
12.     IGA economic benefits and costs were not included in the PAD, but the fact that
this activity became more important following MTR (around 15 percent of total financial
costs of the project) led to its inclusion at ICRR. The benefits are based on two models
(one of buffalo dairy and another of tailoring) from which an average net economic
benefit stream has been calculated with the duration of eight years per activity. These two
models represent some of the most common activities undertaken by members of SHGs
during project implementation. It is further assumed that out of the total IGAs set up
under the project (almost 69,000 according to project data), approximately 75 percent
were successful (this may be conservative given field observations but reflects the lack of
information on Phase III and the fact that project support has just ended). Since IGAs are
set up with the formation of SHGs which receive commercial bank loans, there may be
subsequent higher benefits from funds being paid back and re-used for other activities.
This has, however, not been taken into consideration in the ICRR economic analysis.

C. Economic Returns

13.     The overall economic rate of return (ERR) on the base case assumptions is highly
satisfactory at 17.7 percent, which is slightly higher than the PAD estimate of 16.4
percent. The ICRR estimates translate into an NPV of INR2.9 billion (US$62 million) if a
discount rate of 12 percent is used (the same rate as in PAD), which is around 20 percent
higher than the PAD estimate of INR2.4 billion (adjusted to 2009 constant prices using
Indian CPI). The main drivers of the valuation are the horticulture benefits and secondly
agriculture (see Table A-11 below).

                                                   37
D. Main Reasons for Higher Economic Returns

14. The higher economic returns obtained mainly reflect higher horticulture benefits
and improved cost efficiency. Regarding horticulture, the reasons for improved returns
are: (i) larger area under horticulture at ICRR (80 percent above the PAD estimate), (ii)
around 50 percent higher net income per ha (see tables 2 and 4 above) mainly as a result
of slightly higher yields and most importantly, not following the PAD approach of
reducing horticulture net income per hectare by the "income from agriculture in the with-
project situation" and (iii) differences in timing and of cash flows between ICRR and
PAD estimates.

15. ICRR estimates show improved cost efficiency, which led to above target results in
ha treated for horticulture and cultivated arable land despite a reduction in total project
economic costs. The PAD estimated present value of economic costs stood at INR 3.2
billion when adjusted to 2009 prices, while the ICRR estimate is of INR 3.0 billion
(around 6 percent lower than PAD).

16. Agriculture economic benefits were below PAD estimates mainly because of lower
than expected yield increases for several crops (when compared to the control group
evolution), particularly in the ECDZ region, which resulted in lower incremental
economic benefits per ha of respectively 25 percent and 9 percent for the ECDZ and NTZ
regions. ICRR total area benefiting from agriculture productivity improvements is,
however, larger than the PAD estimate by 7 percent. The remaining difference is due to
timing and duration of cash flows, as at ICRR, a more conservative estimate was used.

E. Financial returns

17. Given the general interest among watershed development projects in understanding
financial incentives for farmers to participate in soil and water conservation activities, a
financial analysis was conducted. The results indicate the following:

(a) Agricultural financial net margins per ha indicate a lower increase in both regions
    when compared to the PAD, however it is still very satisfactory. For NTZ the increase
    estimated at ICRR is of 32 percent very close to the PAD estimate of 34 percent. For
    ECDZ the increase is of 25 percent, while the PAD estimate is much higher with a 92
    percent increase. The ICRR estimates indicate an increase in returns to labor as a
    result of the project of around 19 percent in both regions to INR 157 per person-day
    for ECDZ and INR126 for NTZ. Moreover, simulating an investment per farmer
    household of INR 9,000 (the weighted average investment based on data from phase
    II12) and using a land size of 1.8 ha the increase in net margin is highly profitable. In
    fact, even if the farmer would pay for 100 percent of the investment and with annual


12
 This is based on the share of each type of farmer category and the investment pattern studies by Antrix,
which indicate that the investments in soil and water conservation average between INR 5,185 for the
marginal farmers to 7,273 for small farmers and 14,339 for big farmers.



                                                    38
   operating and maintenance at 3 percent of investment cost, given the margin increase
   due to the project, the implicit IRR would be of 31 percent for NTZ and 36 percent
   for ECDZ and the respective NPV at 12 percent of INR15,140 and INR19,700
   (assumed 25 years but at 10 years would still be highly profitable). This seems to
   suggest that such investments could receive a higher share of farmer contribution
   (although this would require further analysis such as of household annual distribution
   of cash flows).
(b) Horticulture financial analysis indicates strong profitability even if sensitivity
    analysis employs conservative assumptions. With a model including only 130 trees
    surviving (based on the mentioned 65 percent survival rate) and yields per tree of
    around 30 kilograms (kg) at full potential, the financial analysis indicates that even if
    the farmer would pay for 100 percent of an initial investment of around INR31,000
    (farm pond, seedlings and other), the one hectare would still yield a financial IRR of
    23 percent and a INR138,224 NPV. This is below the 39 percent IRR estimated at
    appraisal (which only accounted for labor costs but no farm pond and other), but still
    highly satisfactory.
(c) IGA financial analysis indicates good profitability of both the buffalo dairy model
    and the tailoring activities constructed from information supplied by the project M&E
    and field observations and discussions. The financial IRR calculated are respectively
    14 percent and 24 percent.

                         Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

No separate beneficiary survey was undertaken as part of the ICRR process. Beneficiary
input was captured two ways. First, a workshop was held in association with the ICRR
mission, on February 20 and 21 in Bangalore to discuss the draft ICRR from the FAO
team and gather stakeholder input for the borrowers ICRR (see section 3.6 on page 11 of
this report for a summary of key points from the workshop, and Annex 6, which provides
a summary of the borrowers ICRR). Second, the M&E system encompassed input/output
monitoring, concurrent process monitoring and impact assessment to measure progress
across a range of indicators, which included field level data collection. This information
is reflected in the Bank and Borrower ICRRs. The FAO team estimated beneficiaries and
key impacts in Annex 11, Table A-23.

Physical and financial progress monitoring of the project was facilitated through a
customized MIS package "Sujala Mahithi", designed, developed and deployed by Antrix.
This MIS package helped to create systematic database, allowed users to query, analyze
periodic field data, and prepare reports at different levels. Information can be generated
on specific project components at State/District/Taluk/SWS/MWS level on a
weekly/monthly basis. The package also helps to generate various types of charts, trend
lines, statistics, etc.

Process monitoring was designed to capture near real time information on the key
processes, particularly at the community level. It was carried out throughout the project
to provide regular timely information on the quality of processes, reflect the constraints
and successes for decision making / corrective measures. The observations were provided
fortnightly / monthly to WDD for effective project implementation and management. The
observations also recorded the outcomes of the interventions and their environmental and
social implications. As part of process monitoring, evaluation of the functioning and
performance of various stakeholders such as CBOs, NGOs, technical institutes and also
capacity building programs were carried out at discrete intervals. The monitoring strategy
was based on the linkages established between MIS data, process and implementation
monitoring.

Impact evaluations were carried out at pre-determined time intervals to establish the net
contribution of the project to poverty alleviation, capacity building and natural resource
regeneration. Impacts were evaluated using a combination of qualitative and quantitative
indicators information collected at specific time intervals viz before (baseline), during
(midterm), end of the project and after withdrawal (final). Observations were compared
between project and control areas. Judicious combination of conventional and remote
sensing approaches were adopted to generate a comprehensive data for monitoring and
impact assessment with respect to remote sensing, household survey, focus group
discussions, participatory observations, thematic studies, MIS data and case studies.

More detailed information on project results are found in section F from the Data Sheets
(Results Framework Analysis), and Annex 6.

Summary

A two-day workshop was held in association with the ICRR mission, on February 20 and
21, 2009 in Bangalore. The objectives of the workshop were to:

(a) present the holistic picture of Sujala Watershed Project to the partners and invitees;
(b) share different components and methodologies used while implementing the project;
(c) present the significant findings of impact assessment studies;
(d) share experiences of successful initiatives and the impact thereof;
(e) present and discuss unique features and strategies designed for successful
    implementation of the project; and
(f) consolidate the learning from the project and finalize recommendations, if any.

Sixty participants attended the workshop. These participants included key officers from
the WDD and specifically with KWDP, DWDOs from all the districts, researchers,
officers from Antrix, and key personnel from the external agencies who had taken up
various responsibilities in the project implementation, NGO representatives and officers
from a World Bank supported watershed project in Uttarakhand.

Key results from the workshop included:

1. The project adopted an inclusive approach that encompassed watershed activities with
   equity, gender sensitivity and balanced participation from GoK, communities and
   private sector that can guide new integrated project design.
2. The project promoted high levels of transparency by displaying relevant information
   such as meteorological data, soil analysis results for micronutrients, wage rates,
   beneficiary financing, and decisions taken at gram sabhas on walls in villages.
3. Resource mapping should be combined with expertise mapping to help community
   members take up IGA activities they are good at. It is important to facilitate market
   linkages for IGA. Handholding support was more important than the IGA training to
   assist group members in seeking loans, identifying and purchasing assets, raw
   material etc, and organizing markets. Based on the learning achieved from this project,
   in upcoming government projects, user groups would be formed from common
   interest groups and these would replace area groups.
4. Training programs in Phase I were rushed and the reading material was not fully used
   by the beneficiaries. These lessons resulted in more efforts in Phases II and III to

   improve the quality of training and creation of user-friendly training material such as
   booklets and posters.
5. The uniqueness of this project was that actual implementation was completely in the
   hands of the people. This was made possible by building capacity in the community
   through training programs that had structured modules. Experience sharing
   workshops and trainings through teleconferences were also innovations that the
   project used extensively.
6. The exposure visits organized as a part of the project motivated communities to
   undertake initiatives similar to what they had seen. It also helped that they saw
   successful interventions on the ground and this reinforced their belief about what
   could work. Consistent efforts towards capacity building resulted in total involvement
   from the concerned government offices, and in total acceptance from the community.
   With the expertise gained during implementation of the project, it is possible to
   replicate this kind of project anywhere in the state or country.
7. Social mobilization was a major strength and almost 75 percent of the communities
   involved, were aware of the project and had been actively involved in implementation.
   This was not the case in other GoK watershed projects previously taken up in the
   State.
8. The technologies developed by Antrix and WDD for monitoring and evaluation had
   an edge over all other systems because they focused on outcomes, impacts and
   sustainability. The methodology factored in mechanisms, which could validate
   achievements. The concurrent monitoring ensured that information, both positive and
   negative was collected on a continuous basis and had learning mechanisms, which
   could be integrated for corrective action to be taken without delays. Using an external
   agency brought objectivity and transparency to the process.
9. The Performance Based Payment System (PBPS) adopted later in the project for field
   NGOs was a very successful lesson. In Phases I and II, with the traditional input
   based contracts, despite 100 percent payment, work was often completed only up to
   50-70 percent of targets. The old system did not differentiate between a good
   performing NGO and non-performing NGO as both were paid on the same basis. In
   Phase III, a new PBPS was introduced linking payments to the achievement of clear
   targets and outcomes. A unique performance indicator system was developed after
   having a detailed discussion with the NGO to support the PBPS. The NGOs were
   ranked on the basis of the results. As a result, the FNGOs had more clear milestones
   and very good results were seen.

Introduction

Agriculture is the main occupation for 70 percent of India's population and 90 percent of
this population is made up of small and marginal farmers who own less than two acres of
land. Much of this population resides in semi-arid tropics and pursues agriculture in
rainfed conditions. India has around 174 million ha of rainfed area, which is already
degraded, and about 5,334 million tonnes of top soil are lost every year. The average
annual loss of topsoil per ha is estimated at 16.53 tonnes. Rainfed agriculture in semi-arid
tropics is characterized by low productivity, degraded natural resources and widespread
poverty among the community.

In Karnataka, the situation is even more severe. Around 82 lakh ha of cultivable area in
Karnataka is dry land and only 24 percent of the land is irrigated. Approximately 80
percent of Karnataka is drought prone (the highest in India) and more than 60 percent of
the land will always depend on rainfall. The prospects for increased irrigation potential
are bleak and productivity in existing irrigated lands has decreased owing to salinity and
alkalinity. Agriculture provides employment to more than 70 percent of the population of
Karnataka and there is high rural poverty and significantly higher poverty in rainfed
districts. The watershed development approach is a solution to the problems associated
with rainfed agriculture in semiarid regions by increasing productivity in degraded lands
and developing, maintaining and using natural resources on a sustainable basis. This
approach is also the most appropriate as watershed development projects address water,
soil, forest and pasture resources in an integrated and participative manner. Towards this,
Karnataka has 7.8 million ha of land which, is untreated but has potential for watershed
treatment.

The Sujala Project Approach

The conventional watershed approach in India has been to focus on technical solutions to
soil and water conservation, and delivered by government agencies with little
participation by communities and/or farmers. Unlike in the past where watershed
activities translated into benefits only for the landed population, and looked primarily at
land based activities, in the inclusive and more integrated KWDP (Sujala) approach,
agricultural productivity and natural resource management has been fused with income
generation activities for the landless and the vulnerable sections of society for overall
poverty reduction. Sujala was implemented in five districts of Karnataka state covering
5.19 lakh ha of land spread over 77 sub watersheds and 1,270 villages benefiting nearly
2.25 lakh households including the landless. As per the original plan, the project, which

  This summary was drafted by the Bank TTL from the 61 page Borrowers ICRR, completed by the WDD
of the GoK (full report attached as Annex 13). As much as possible, this summary reflects the drafting
style and terminology in the Borrower's report.

began on 10 September 2001, was due to close on 31 March 2007. It was later extended
for two years and closed on 31 March 2009. The districts and villages selected for
interventions under Sujala were rainfed areas associated with a high degree of land
degradation and suffered from a number of constraints such as low and uncertain rainfall,
poor soil fertility, sparse vegetation cover, relatively large areas under wastelands,
frequently affected by drought, drinking water scarcity, lack of infrastructure and low
productivity output. Soil erosion, runoff and water quality were some of the other
environmental problems. The areas selected had large numbers of small and marginal
farmers and landless people, most of who were below the poverty line (BPL), were
illiterate and faced hardships for their livelihoods.

The key objectives of the project were to:

(a) improve natural resource base of the selected watersheds;
(b) increase production and productivity of agricultural lands;
(c) alleviate poverty in a sustained manner;
(d) increase the productivity of non-arable lands;
(e) improve skills and create alternate livelihood options for vulnerable families in the
    watersheds;
(f) enable participatory planning and implementation, environment and social assessment
    and social inclusiveness;
(g) develop and strengthen community based institutional arrangements for sustainable
    natural resource management; and
(h) improve skills and employment opportunities under non-farm sectors.

Sujala addressed several key issues that would enable an overall better quality of life for
the community, as well as restore health to the environment through its strategy of
working with technology partners and with the community. The technology partners
provided professional inputs, and the community together with the project staff
implemented appropriate activities towards:
(a)   improving agriculture productivity and improving vegetative cover
(b)   reducing soil erosion, runoff and nutrient loss
(c)   improving water availability at surface and ground water
(d)   increasing production from dairy and horticulture activities
(e)   increasing fodder and fuel availability
(f)   increasing household incomes for enhanced quality of life among local communities
(g)   local institutional development through CBOs with the support of the watershed
      development department and NGOs

Through a holistic, integrated approach that addressed soil, forest and water management,
the Sujala project sought to restore the health of agricultural land, forest cover and the
water retaining capacity of the land. Additionally the project facilitated livelihood options
for the poor and landless, groups which would otherwise have been perceived as external
to a watershed project. The Sujala project had built in flexibility, which was particularly
significant considering it was strongly community driven. The flexibility ensured that it



                                             46
was sensitive and could adapt or alter components based on the felt needs of the
community.

These initiatives were enabled through a multi-layered system of project implementation.
At the community level, there were three entities: SWS; AGs made up of farmers who
owned land within the micro-watersheds area; and SHGs made up mostly of women from
the vulnerable sections of society. AGs and SHGs were constituted with members from
SWSs.

At the next level were NGOs who had been designated as lead, field, specialist and
partner NGOs. While their primary responsibility was to enable better cooperation
between the administration, WDD and the community, their contribution and
responsibility was significant in other important ways, such as forming the CBOs,
facilitating measures for capacity building, skills training for the community, and for
other implementation support.

At yet another level, specialist resource agencies brought in their specific skills into the
project. Specialist agencies also contributed to awareness building, social mobilization,
and other activities. The Sujala project worked with UAS in Bangalore, Antrix,
KSRSAC, ICRISAT, etc.

At the apex, the WDD administered the project and monitored the budgets through
DWDOs stationed at each district.

The Main Project Components

The Sujala project was sectioned out into four main components and budgets allocated
accordingly (Table A-14).

1. Participatory Watershed Development and Protection

Social Mobilization and Institution Building
The initial point of interaction with the community was the rapport building phase and
interactions were held with the village community in order to introduce the project, gain
the community's confidence, and set the stage for actual implementation and community
mobilization. PRAs were conducted to determine the community's perceptions of what
they wanted out of the project viz-a-viz the current situation. Sujala treated this
component as vital and took especial care to build in transparency about the project and
convey clear and consistent messages to the community.

Entry Point Activities
To meet the desires and needs of the community and develop rapport with people, entry
point activities such as infrastructure building like drinking water and sanitation systems,
community buildings, school buildings, cattle troughs, etc, were financed through the
project. These activities, undertaken as part of social mobilization, helped encourage
active participation from the community in the project. In the first two phases almost all
the activities taken up under EPAs were community halls. In this backdrop after lengthy
discussions among partners a list of EPAs were worked out and shared with the EPA
committees for other activities. However, the decision of communities received priority
even if they selected community halls in the third phase. A vital component of the project
was the baseline survey, where families were interviewed to determine their current
economic and social status, and to understand their needs with regard to livelihood
options. Baseline surveys enabled a sound understanding of village dynamics and all
existing resources in a community. This went on to support preparation of the SWAP and
for impact monitoring. Participatory methods of data collection and information sharing
were used to compile the baseline information for each village and MWS. These were:

Treatment of Watersheds

Sujala Watershed Action Plan (SWAP)
The SWAP was a comprehensive plan evolved by the primary stakeholders of a MWS to
develop its natural resources and livelihoods. The preparation of the SWAP started at the
individual farmer's level in the respective AGs and was consolidated at the MWS level.
On completion of all the pre-SWAP capacity and institution building activities, the
SWAP was prepared with active participation from all the primary stakeholders. The
main components of a SWAP were: soil and water conservation and drainage line
treatments; forestry; horticulture; livestock; farming systems intensification; fisheries;
and IGA.

Soil and Water Conservation and Drainage Line Treatments
Soil and water conservation were critical factors in stabilizing and scaling up productivity
in dry land agriculture areas. It was estimated that 10-40 percent of annual rainfall was
lost as run off, and this situation was aggravated by the fact that water run-off carried
fertile topsoil with it. The SWAPs introduced measures to check soil erosion and retain as
much rainwater as possible in the watershed area itself and utilize that water optimally for
sustained crop production. The technical methods for runoff management in watersheds
are contour and field bunding, contour trenching, terracing, check dams, gully control
structures, diversion channels, contour furrowing, percolation tanks, farm ponds and
runoff storage structures (see Table A-15 for physical achievements).

Forestry
Various forestry models are adopted to cover upper reaches of a watershed, common
lands, private lands and bunds of farmers' fields with trees and shrubs. The tree growth
intercepts rainfall, reduces drop velocity to cause less erosion and the root system acts as
vegetative check. Under this project 29,013 ha of land has been brought under tree cover.

Horticulture
To reap the benefit of growing trees on private land and reduce runoff to promote
percolation, horticulture crops were grown as they assure good economic returns. A total
of 53,893 ha of land were covered with mango, pomegranate, fig, guava, sweet lime, and
other fruit yielding trees. While forestry species are planted on the margins, the
horticulture species are planted in the center, interspersed with agricultural crops.
Structures like farm ponds ensured in providing critical irrigation and increased soil
moisture has helped these multiple crops yield good results.

Livestock
Sujala project improved the number and quality of livestock in the project area so that
high yielding breeds are able to fulfill the requirement of the local people for their
livelihoods, particularly dairying. About154 village-based (Gopala mitras) were trained
to provide minor veterinary services, artificial insemination facilities and veterinary
extension services. About 64,741 farmers were benefited from different types of
demonstrations and 6,344 ha were brought under fodder production.


2. Farming Systems Intensification

Farming System Demonstrations
Participatory on-farm research was found to be more effective while demonstrating the
efficacy of various methods, and identification of problems and solutions thereof, than on
research farms. The objectives of this sub-component were to:
(a) support participatory research in order to improve the efficiency and meet the
    emerging and future challenges facing the agriculture sector in Karnataka by
    recognizes local responses and relevance;
(b) focus on adaptive research by encompassing in-situ moisture conservation, crop
    production, agro-horticulture, silvi-pasture, livestock rearing, sericulture, forestry and
    apiculture;
(c) develop models for farming systems intensification for different agro-climatic regions
    particularly for small and marginal farmers;
(d) focus on rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and supplement incomes of farmers
    and landless farmers in selected sub-watersheds; and
(e) conduct demonstrations to promote the adoption of improved farming practices in a
    range of crops.



                                             50
Farmers Field Schools (FFS)
FFS is a demonstration school meant for teaching the new agricultural practices to the
farmers. A group of 25 farmers in each village would be provided with hands on training
about Integrated Pest Management, Integrated Nutrient Management, and eco-friendly
methods of farming.


3. Income Generation Activities (IGA)

Generally, watershed programs have mainly benefited the landowners as most of the
interventions are land based. The Sujala project worked on the belief and principle that
any rural development is successful only when it is inclusive. Landless people and other
vulnerable groups such as women, normally depend on common lands for meeting their
day to day needs and for income generation. Unless the problem of income generation of
these people is addressed, any treatment of common property resource would not be
successful. The prime objective of including IGAs in the project was to improve the
socio-economic conditions of landless and vulnerable families by supporting them to be
successful entrepreneurs. The effort was to target a majority of women. Sujala targeted
Schedule Caste (SC)/Scheduled Tribes (ST) population and other marginalized castes
thereby ensuring that gender and equity issues, as well as women's empowerment
objectives were met to the fullest extent. The uniqueness of IGAs in the Sujala project
was that they were not implemented in an ad hoc manner. There was a dedicated set of
activities built into the project design and the community was taken through the various
activities in a building block fashion to their ultimate goal of running their own
businesses or enterprises. The steps were:

(a)   awareness on entrepreneurship;
(b)   confidence building and risk management;
(c)   personality development;
(d)   analysis of successful enterprises;
(e)   pros and cons of enterprises and their management;
(f)   business plan preparation;
(g)   marketing management; and
(h)   linkages to financial institutions.

4. Institutional Strengthening

Capacity Building
The project had 19 different training modules addressing technical, social and managerial
needs of communities, field NGOs and technical staff. The project designed and
produced a variety of teaching aids including books, manuals, flip charts, posters, wall
magazines, films etc on different topics to facilitate training at different levels. Keeping
community needs in view the aids used simple language and were more dependent on
illustrations. They were also compiled in the local language. Capacity building of the
SHGs, AGs and SWSs was an essential process that continued throughout the project
period. Training focused on key thematic areas of watershed management, classified into
social and technical aspects. Exposure trips to nearby successful watershed sites by
community members to enable them to get first-hand knowledge on the various activities
associated with, and the impact of watershed initiatives. At a broader level, international
exposure visits for senior and lower-level WDD staff provided an opportunity for sharing
knowledge and experiences with counterparts in other countries.

Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning
The Sujala project had a comprehensive M&E system, with a unique learning element to
ensure that the insights that emerged from the M&E actually translated into timely
implementation correction thereafter. Monitoring in Sujala was a continuous process of
collecting and analyzing data to determine the effectiveness of implementation against
the expected outcomes. Monitoring also helped to observe and record the processes and
changes taking place among the communities, institutions and natural resources situation.
Two types of monitoring were adopted, i.e. concurrent and discrete monitoring. The first
included input and output comparison, process monitoring and self-assessment, and the
second included impact assessment, which was assigned to Antrix. Sujala relied heavily
on information technology to develop and implement the project. The MIS and GIS
packages were designed, developed and deployed under the project to capture specific
information on the various aspects of the project, coupled with remote sensing and field
monitoring.

Mid-Term Impacts

Impact assessment helped determine project contributions towards poverty alleviation,
capacity building and natural resource regeneration. Impacts were evaluated using a
variety of qualitative and quantitative indicators before, during and after the project, and
a with/without comparison of control groups. Key impacts in Phases I and II are shown in
Table A-17.

Sujala's emphasis on the participation of the community in development work and the
efforts to build their capacities to make relevant decisions resulted in a change of
knowledge, attitude, practices and behavior of the people. At one level they became
aware of the project and their role in it. Greater levels of awareness were evident in the
rural communities about the project and social responsibility towards the natural


                                            52
resources etc. The enhanced confidence and self-reliance was evident in people as their
participation in the CBO increased. It was especially seen through the empowerment of
women who were part of the SHGs. They were able to articulate their needs and plan
their livelihood strategies better and harness their productive potential optimally.

Sujala Watershed Project has made its presence felt and made a difference in the lives of
rural people from the operational area. However, the process that Sujala underwent
towards achieving its objectives was not without challenges, which impeded or slowed
down the process. Sujala was able to identify most of these in real time and address them
effectively and hence, major impediment was not evident. Yet there is a need to
acknowledge these factors that affected Sujala's progress and understand how Sujala
addressed them to gain a complete understanding of the project.

Key Factors Contributing to the Implementation

The factors which primarily contributed to Sujala's uniqueness were:

(a) involvement of various resource agencies for provision of specialized inputs;
(b) monitoring and evaluation processes developed for the project implementation
    structure and process and thrust on feeding the learning from monitoring and
    evaluation system into the decision-making process;




17
  Some results in Table A-17 for example, household income and crop yields, are lower than figures used
in the final results framework (data sheet, section F). The data in the Borrower's report reflected earlier
Antrix impact data prior to a detailed review and refinement by the FAO team after the ICRR mission.



                                                    53
(c) ensuring effective accountability and transparency through adopting appropriate
    financial management systems at all levels;
(d) ensuring gender, caste and equity;
(e) bottom ­up, participatory and integrated approach among stakeholders and helps
    them to identify themselves with the project;
(f) cost sharing by the community;
(g) adopting social and environment assessment techniques; and
(h) use of state-of-art science and technology tools for planning, implementation,
    monitoring and evaluation.

Lessons Learned
The KWDP (Sujala) project gave emphasis to learning through the implementation
process and improving the process based on the learning. The entire process was thus
under constant scrutiny and analysis. This learning process helped Sujala and others in
the sector to build on and improve on the model. Some of the significant lessons that
came out of Sujala are:

(a) The participatory approach helped to achieve results, ensuring the ownership of the
    community towards the development process and led to sustainability;
(b) The synergy between the four P's, participation; people (community); public
    (government); and private (NGOs and others) was able to bring the competencies of
    different stakeholders in respective areas and added to the impact. More importantly
    the integrated, holistic, participative watershed development approach helped in
    holistic development of the area with reference to different components and
    addressing the needs of the community and achieving equity overcoming the class,
    caste and gender boundaries;
(c) Integration of all the related sectors such as agriculture, forestry, horticulture, animal
    husbandry, fisheries, etc, into the watershed development process helped in achieving
    the project goals;
(d) It was critical to build the capacity of the community based institutions for planning
    implementation and maintenance of the assets to ensure their ownership and
    sustainability even after project closure;
(e) The post-training, hand holding support such as bank and marketing linkages was as
    important as the thrust on training and capacity building;
(f) The importance of integrating M&E in the development process on a concurrent basis
    was reinforced. The learning was used as a basis to modify strategies to enhance the
    impact and ensure there is no loss of time;
(g) Involvement of external agencies with core competence on technical aspects
    enhanced the impact of the project;




                                             54
(h) Use of IT-enabled tools such as remote-sensing, MIS, GIS, Satellite Communication
    (SATCOM) added authenticity to the data. It also made the information more
    manageable and accessible to all stakeholders;
(i) It was critical for any watershed program to be equitable. Hence inclusion of women,
    SC/ST and other vulnerable groups such as landless laborers needed to be focused.
    Apart from designing specific activities for them it was important to involve them in
    the decision-making processes on a priority basis;
(j) Accountability and transparency needed to be built into the entire process. It impacted
    the ownership of stakeholders and increased the credibility of the project and systems
    were created to ensure multilevel transparency and accountability;
(k) Ensuring Environment and Social Safeguard Assessment in every project activity at
    all stages of the project cycle helped in maximizing the social and environmental
    benefits and minimizing the social and environmental costs of the projects through
    appropriate screening, mitigation and compensation measures;
(l) Converting to the Performance Based Payment System helped to ensure that
    deadlines for deliverables were met;
(m) The revolving fund for SHGs was increased from INR35,000 to INR75,000 in
    response to a felt need;
(n) Differential rates were fixed for manual and machinery based work;
(o) A ceiling of INR70,000 was fixed for each farmer; and
(p) Payments were standardized for NGO staff.

Sir,

Sub: Comments on Draft External ICR Report reg:

This is in response to your Draft External ICR Report of Sujala Watershed Project
received through e-mail on 9 August 2009. After reviewing the draft ICR, the following
comments are offered for necessary modifications in the report.

1. In the second para of page No.6, the report says "The fund flow and reconciliation for


                                            55
field activities through Gram Parishad (GP) to the communities was periodically delayed
by the GPs, which required intervention from the project."

Comments: Since project funds flow directly from DWDOs to the SWS-EC, the question
of delay by GPs does not arise. So kindly, this sentence may be removed from the report.

2. In the third para of page No. 6, the report says "The evaluation of Phase III
investments could not be undertaken before March 31, 2009. The GOK and Antrix are
now engaged in this assessment, but the results will not be available for some time."

Comments: Since the project has closed on 30.03.2009, funds are not available to take up
this work. Similar such studies have already been taken in the project and there was not
much difference between the results of mid-term impacts of Phase I and Phase II. Hence
expecting similar results from phase 111 the idea was dropped.

3. In the second para of page No. 7, the report says "Using M&E data, 72 percent of the
total project area has been treated through physical soil and water conservation works and
vegetative improvements."

Comments: As per the project reports 4.35 lakh ha is the total treatable area of the
project, out of which 3.98 lakh ha (91.49 percent) has been treated through soil and water
conservation works and vegetative improvements. Accordingly information may be
supplemented in the report. Hence 72 percent should be replaced by 91.49 percent.

Except the above three issues, we concur with the findings and have no further comments
to offer".

Yours faithfully

                  Annex 11. Assumptions on Area Targets Achieved


The tables in this annex show the ICRR team's assumptions and estimates of PAD area
targets achieved by the project. It also includes short explanations to clarify some of the
terminology used in the PAD, which was often confusing.

The project's reports include data on total ha treated as per the SWAPs and also
horticulture and forest areas planted. However, there is potential overlap between
activities for the same area. The analysis contained in the tables below tries to clarify this
point through two main estimations. First, to approximately calculate from the SWC
works, how many ha could have potentially been treated by the project (Table A-21).
Secondly, to calculate net area treated through estimates of the overlap (areas that
benefited from more than just SWC works). The assumptions for this are shown in Table
A-22, which in the shaded cells shows the overlap areas. Finally, the overall results of
achievements relative to PAD targets are shown in Table A-19, which includes
explanations of terminology used in the PAD and the ICRR team's interpretation in the
footnotes and also further in Table A-20.

The results point to an overall estimated achievement of 72 percent of all area
targeted which is a satisfactory achievement for such type of project.

As can be seen in Table A-19, the main explanation for a result below 100 percent lies
with treatment of non-arable land which is, overall, around 20 percent of expected area of
combined common revenue and forest reserve lands being treated. These under-
achievements in non-private land versus PAD/MTR targets reflect an unrealistic target
for treatments expected in forest reserves, which was not rectified during implementation.
However in both forest reserve and common revenue lands important reasons for not
reaching overall target area effectively (i.e. with sustained productive growth) is the
difficulty in setting up appropriate management agreements for benefit sharing. In the
case of common property, the underestimation of encroachment at the time of project
design also contributed to the lower performance relative to PAD targets. The small
Forest Reserve areas and encroached common lands were identified in the Regional
Environmental and Social Assessment (RESA), which was finished just before project
approval. Clarification of these important issues was only achieved at the start of
implementation, but didn't translate into changes in targets.

Notes:

a/   The PAD/MTR terminology for categories/targets is highly confusing, as it mixes both land ownership
     and land use classifications. Based on the text of the PAD/MTR the categories/targets were re-
     organized according to conventional categorization by land use and land ownership. The categories in
     italics indicate the original PAD/MTR categories. Additional explanations:
     (i) Arable fallow land ­ according to the PAD text this is arable land that is "fallow land (seasonal or
     otherwise)". This is confusing as non-seasonal fallow land would be non-arable land. Ultimately in this
     classification it was considered to be just seasonal fallow.
     (ii) Cultivable waste land ­ in the PAD table this category is handled in a confusing way as in the
     initial table it is only listed as "non-arable land" with no mention of ownership type. However, in the
     text it is said that "clear endorsement has to be obtained from the farmers owning the cultivable waste
     land for the proposed treatments". It was therefore considered to be private land.
     (iii) Forest land ­ in the PAD this category's ownership is not specified in the initial table. However,
     the text explains that "in forest area, the treatment will be consistent with the Forest Department's
     Working Plan, and will have to be encompassed into a MOU". It was therefore considered, Forest Dept
     managed land (non-private).
     (iv) Pasture/shrub land ­ in the PAD this category's ownership status is not specified in the initial
     table. However, the annex on project area and scope indicates that this is "assumed to equate to C&D
     and Gomal Lands", i.e. it is non-private.

b/ - There were inconsistencies with the targets between the main text of the PAD and Annex 4. The
      targets were clarified at the MTR.
    - The targets also include treatment of natural drainage lines of a total of INR 7.15 million per SWS of
      about 5,000 ha.
      Given that this cannot easily be converted to an area based indicator, it has been left out of this
      analysis.
      The PAD appraisal investment on watershed treatment represented 92% of the total of Component 1
      and 82% of total project costs incl. contingencies. Subsequent changes have reduced the share of




                                                     63
                   watershed treatment investments to 56.5% of total project costs. The actual expenditures as of ICR
                   time is estimated at US$59 million or 55% of total project costs (84% of revised target achieved).
                 - The area based activities per land category in PAD/MTR include both physical and vegetative
                   treatments for each land category. In fact, in most cases more than one treatment is often undertaken
                   on one particular plot or land.

c/               To calculate the net area treated, the departure point used was the physical numbers of infrastructure,
                 as well as planted areas with horticulture and forest species (border planting) then assumptions were
                 made based on M&E data and studies, discussions with project staff and direct field observations.
                 In particular, assumptions were made to the degree of overlap with SWC in reported data for
                 horticulture and forestry. The summarized results can be found in tables C. SWC Assumptions and D.
                 Net Area Treated.

d/               The interpretation of horticultural land used by the ICR team is that of land that already had
                 horticulture at baseline.
                 The PAD is not totally clear on this as in the economic analysis it is mentioned that horticulture would
                 be normally resulting from conversion of arable fallow land. Therefore unlike the other categories, it
                 seems it is an objective rather than the status of the land (in terms of land use) at appraisal. For the sake
                 of consistency the ICR team interpreted horticultural land as the land use status at baseline and
                 therefore the achievement is rather low (as most horticulture achievements will be accounted for under
                 cultivable arable land, arable fallow land and cultivable waste land (see table D. Net Area Treated for
                 details).

Targets at Appraisal

Poverty Focus
Although not well explained in the initial PDO section of the PAD, this development
objective is nevertheless referred to elsewhere18. In particular, the first key performance
indicator states the objective of an increase in the "overall income of various stakeholder
groups at the village level". Moreover, the original project description summary states
that at end of project the evaluation "would focus on the project's overarching objectives,
i.e. a reduction in poverty of the small and marginal farmers, landless, women, and
indigenous people". In the PAD beneficiary description it is estimated that 95 percent of
landholders small and marginal, and a further 25,000 landless should benefit for a total of
350,000 households.

The project has achieved a considerable inclusion in terms of the numbers of
beneficiaries reached, though this is quite a bit less than expected in the PAD. The PAD
estimates of 350,000 household benefiting from the project are probably not in line with
actual landholding or ownership patterns in the project areas, as implied both by the
RESA, M&E surveys and Karnataka 2005-06 Agricultural census, which indicate small
and marginal farmers forming closer to 73 percent of households (using district data).
Again the project did not clarify indicators and targets accordingly. Also, as the RESA
data seems to be based on 1991 census, with increasing population, overall potential
beneficiary numbers will have been higher by the time project started.

Distribution of Income Benefits
Table A-23 summarizes assumptions and estimates of beneficiary numbers and benefits.
The project has achieved a considerable inclusion in terms of the numbers of
beneficiaries reached, though this is quite a bit less than expected in the PAD (which as
noted may have been unrealistic). All classes of beneficiaries had incremental increases
in income as reported in the project impact studies. Nevertheless, most of the benefits
overall are also likely to have accumulated with big farmers because of the nature of
watershed treatments (being land-based).

Project impact studies based on survey data for Phases I and II indicate that household
income increased for all land ownership classes of farmers. On Phase II, increases
registered around 40 percent for small and marginal farmers, more than 50 percent for




18
  The original premise in the PDO is that poverty focus arises from one of the criteria for watershed
selection is poverty incidence.



                                                    67
landless and close to 80 percent for big farmers, compared to controls19. While the ICRR
has used the impact assessment reports for the basic conclusions on project results, on a
note of caution, a more detailed analysis conducted by the ICRR team using the Phase II
dataset raised some questions about the level of statistical significance in the household
income increases reported. This may be the result of different approaches taken in data
collection, survey instruments, small sample size for household income control groups, or
some data issues. On the other hand, field visits and case studies certainly confirm
income increases.

While benefits to the landless in the initial Phase I watersheds treated was lower, the data
analysis on equity issues during the project led to measures on reducing use of
mechanization for construction works, and proportionally less investment for larger
landholdings ­ very positive equity measures. There were also improvements to
transparency through wall paintings indicating wages paid to construction laborers, which
also contributed to the good outcome. Temporary labor opportunities provided by the
project's physical works activities provided employment for a large number of landless
and small and marginal farmers. However, the timing of the last survey probably reflects
peak labor demand from land treatment rather than sustained income for the landless.

Beneficiary Numbers
While the project assessed inclusion and equity issues (through data available in SWAPs),
beneficiary numbers have not been regularly reported. Estimated families covered are
400,000 (based on project website information) ­ though this more likely to be those
living in project area, roughly in line with population increase. There is no exact figure
for total effectively addressed households in project area, though from various estimates
and community observations it is considerable.

With available data, the structure of landholdings is the best guide to assess poverty
distribution. The project did not seem to select strongly for sub-watersheds within
District with higher proportion of smaller landholders, compared to big farmers. Also in
Phase II implementation there was a slight bias towards big farmer beneficiaries (37
percent of land holders in among beneficiaries, compared to 23 percent in baseline data)20.
For Phase III sample of six SWAPs, the proportion of big farmers stayed the same but
with a very large variation: 10 percent to 65 percent of land beneficiaries were big
farmers.




19
  These growth rates are based on the project averages reported in the Impact Study - Phase II Report and
calculated using a linear growth assumption for the treatment group based on the income growth of the
control group as a counterfactual. The same calculations for Phase I show around 60 percent growth for
landless and big farmers and 40 percent growth for small and marginal farmers relative to the control group.

20
  As these are based on different samples, and land-classes instead of direct poverty data, they are
indicative.



                                                     68
Based on estimates using proportion of beneficiaries in Phase II impact assessment
samples, landholding beneficiaries were around 190,000, over a third of whom were big
farmers. Together with the landless there were around 230,000 beneficiaries, which also
tallies roughly with estimated number of Project CBO members, though there may be
some overlaps in membership within households. Alternatively, based on actual
effectively treated area (where many farmers have several treatments in one plot, or
treatments covering only parts of their land), and based on average landholding sizes,
number of farmer beneficiary households would be between 100,000 to 150,000. In
addition to this, between 12 to 25 million workdays were created21, estimated from labor
costs, which if distributed at 2 months work per household would cover a large majority
of all households in the areas. Often paid labor workdays were also used by farmer
households with own family labor.

The continued focus on SHGs encompassing landless households, and their continued
operation and growth, and involvement with IGAs indicate a strong inclusion of the poor.
With a 78 percent survival rate of 6,648 and estimated 60 percent22 belonging to the
landless (and with an average of 15 members each) the project may have reached out to
over 45,000 landless households in this component.

Concluding Points
The development and scaling up of the IGA component will have played a major role in
reducing poverty of marginal farmers and landless households. Moreover, it contributed
significantly to improvements in the condition of women, as detailed through case studies
and also witnessed during field observations and interviews with women groups. A
majority of livestock IGAs were managed by women. The SHGs have also built up
around US$4 million own savings, and generating capital several times that through
revolving funds and bank loans, channeled into poorer sections of watershed
communities.

With the bias towards big farmers of both actual and proportionately larger incremental
income increases (if one uses the data from the project Impact Studies), the majority of
the project benefits is likely to have been accumulated by this group, even with rules on
higher contributions expected on big farms, etc. The inequity in benefits is deeply
inherent in land management projects. In this sense the project has done very well in
design and implementation to ensure livelihood opportunities for landless and poorer
small-holders in the project. It should be noted also that a large share of big farmers in the
project area are not much above the poverty line.

Using estimates of numbers benefiting in each land-class, and the increase in incomes for
the landless, marginal and small farmers, there will definitively have been a large number

of households rising above the poverty threshold. The estimates indicate perhaps in the
order of 50,000 or more, at least on a temporary basis. This proportion is slightly lower
than that shown rising above the poverty line in successful project villages, noted in
project M&E case studies.

While grappling with the inherent bias in land management projects, the KWDP showed
considerable foresight in design as well as during implementation in ensuring inclusion of
the whole community in the watershed development process, and building the livelihoods
among a wide stakeholder group, including the landless. Future efforts in watershed
development could look even more carefully at targeting and support mechanisms for
small and marginal farmers ­ perhaps through dedicated groups. It could also build
further on ensuring management and tenure of common lands results in long term
benefits for the poorest in the community.
