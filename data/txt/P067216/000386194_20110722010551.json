A handy\n            portmanteau definition of watershed development is as\n            follows: a watershed may be defined as a geographic area\n            that drains to a common point. Integrated watershed\n            development is generally understood as an approach that\n            combines soil and water conservation with social and\n            institutional development, in addition to pursuing a broad\n            range of activities that meet the felt needs of communities\n            across many sectors, such as rural access, water supply, and\n            income-generating activities.  Assessing watershed\n            development and forest interventions side-by-side is no idle\n            juxtaposition. Obviously, all forests fall within watersheds\n            so there is some merit to having a natural resources\n            management strategy that includes both.  In designing\n            watershed and forest interventions there is a common theme.\n            Both types of project are beset by problems of property\n            rights that have been incompletely specified or questionably\n            assigned or are simply missing. This report assesses two\n            watershed development projects and one forestry project. The\n            objectives of the watershed development projects in the\n            Shivalik Hills and in Karnataka were similar: both sought to\n            improve the productive potential of selected watersheds and\n            to build the institutions needed for improved management of\n            the natural resource base, including community organizations."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
