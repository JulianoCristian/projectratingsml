Karnataka\n            Watershed Development Project for India were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: a combination of watershed and livelihoods\n            interventions can create strong multiplication effects. A\n            balance is needed between community desires for soil and\n            water conservation investments, and technically effective\n            and rational treatments. This was demonstrated under the\n            project's experience through the participatory planning\n            system, supported by training and intensive process\n            monitoring, quality controls, cost ceilings, and beneficiary\n            contribution rates that promoted equity. The equity and\n            poverty reduction aims and processes within watershed\n            development need clear articulation. An independent and\n            credible partner monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            institution can complement M&E functions in the\n            implementing agency and provide major contributions to\n            project success. The project showed a strong need to ensure\n            that Income Generating Activity (IGAs) and Self-Help Group\n            (SHGs) get adequate follow-up advice and linkage building to\n            achieve longer term sustainability."}, "docdt": "2009-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
