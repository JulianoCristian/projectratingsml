      Project will rehabilitate the electrical generating stations\n            and the transmission and distribution system of the Shaba\n            region to minimize the risk of failure of the supply of\n            energy to the mining industry and particularly to Gecamines.\n            Subsequent maintenance will be supported under the project\n            by provision of vehicles, small equipment and spare parts,\n            and a reserve for unforeseen repairs. SNEL's financial\n            management and its planning, operating, and maintenance\n            capabilities will be strengthened by the services of\n            long-term technical experts. The Shaba Power System\n            Rehabilitation Project will also include the services of\n            consultants for project implementation; energy policy\n            formulation; and studies of training needs and the\n            electricity tariff structure."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
