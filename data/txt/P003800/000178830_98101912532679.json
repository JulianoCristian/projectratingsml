establishing 53,000\n            ha of tree crops (rubber, oil palm, coconuts), food crops\n            and house gardens in West Java, West Kalimantan and Bengkulu\n            provinces with the public sector estates PTP XI, XIII, XXIII\n            and PNP VII as implementation agents. Th project would\n            immediately benefit some 19,800 smallholder families in the\n            first two provinces and, through estate development in the\n            other, set the stage for additional smallholder investments\n            at a later time. It also includes technical assistance to\n            the Directorate General of Estates and the participating\n            estates, a training component and provision for developing\n            and initiating implementation of future nucleus estates and\n            smallholder investments. There are no unusual technical\n            risks in this project. In order to address potential\n            weaknesses in management of the various estates the project\n            includes effective measures to speed up implementation and\n            improve project management, therefore minimizing this risk."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
