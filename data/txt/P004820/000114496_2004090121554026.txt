Re:   Credit No. 2262-VAN, (Housing Project)
      Amendment of the Development Credit Agreement
Excellency:
      I refer to the above referenced Development Credit Agreement
between the Republic of Vanuatu and the International Development
Association dated October 16, 1991, and to the discussions among you
and the Association in Washington during the Fund/Bank Annual
Meetings relating to amendments to the Agreement.
      I am pleased to advise you that the Association concurs with
your request.  Therefore, Schedule 5 to the Development Credit
Agreement is amended as follows:
      "3.   The Credit shall be channelled through the Reserve Bank
      of Vanuatu (RBV) to participating Intermediaries at a rate
      equal to the six-months weighted average cost of savings and
      time deposits in Vanuatu's financial sector, as reported to
      RBV, plus a premium of 50 basis points.  Provided, however,
      that the minimum rate shall be the International Bank for
      Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) rate to its borrowers
      during the applicable period.  The rate, including the amount
      of the premium, shall be reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted,
      every six months, starting on January 1, 1993.
      4.    Participating Intermediaries shalllend to eligible
      beneficiaries at variable market rates, including a spread
      expected to be about 400 to 500 basis points.  The
      participating Intermediaries shall bear the credit risk."
      Please confirm your acceptance by signing the attached
confirmation copy and by returning it to us.
Sincerely yours,
