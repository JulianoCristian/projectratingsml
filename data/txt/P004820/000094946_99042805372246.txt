IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF VANUATU
HOUSING PROJECT
(Credit 2262-VAN)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Housing Project in
the Republic of Vanuatu, for which Cr. 2262-VAN in the amount of SDR 2.5 million was
approved on June 11, 1991 and made effective on July 14, 1993.
The Credit was closed on September 30, 1998, compared with the original closing
date of June 30, 1995. IDA expects to cancel the undisbursed balance of SDR
1,388,092.16 following recovery from the borrower of the outstanding balance of the
Special Account. Cofinancing, in the form of a PHRD Grant of Y25,200,000, was
provided by Japan for the project.
The ICR was prepared by a team consisting of Mr. Heinrich Unger, Task Manager
(EASES), Messrs. Henry Boldrick and Eric Peterson (ECSIN), Daniel Hoomweg and Ms.
JoAnne Nickerson (EASUR). The ICR was reviewed by Mr. Klaus Rohland, Country
Director, Papua New Guinea and Pacific Islands Country Management Unit, and cleared
by Mr. Keshav Varma, Sector Manager, Urban Development Sector Unit. The borrower
did not provide comments to the draft ICR.
Preparation of the ICR was begun during IDA's final supervision/completion
mission in July 1998. It is based on material in the project file. The borrower contributed
to the preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution,
the executive summary of which is attached as Appendix B.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF VANUATU
HOUSING PROJECT
(Credit 2262-VAN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.    Following Vanuatu's independence in  1980, its urban population was
concentrated in two urban areas: Port Vila and Luganville. Urbanization was a new
phenomenon, but was increasing rapidly, and was straining urban services, especially
housing. At the time of project appraisal in 1990, over 25% of the urban population was
living in slums, tenements and squatter settlements, often lacking basic services. Rents
for these makeshift shelters sometimes approached 50% of household incomes.
ii.    Key sectoral issues identified during preparation were the serious shortage of land
for urban development; the limited availability of mortgage finance; lack of a policy
framework and appropriate development standards; and weak sector institutions. The
Government of Vanuatu (GOV) had begun to address these issues by setting out the main
objectives for the housing sector in its Second Development Plan of 1987-1991. The
Plan responded to the need for developing housing delivery systems, but lacked explicit
policy content and did not address the two major problems of finance and land for urban
development over the long term. It was under these circumstances that GOV requested
IDA assistance for a housing project in 1988.
Project Objectives
iii.   The Project's objectives were: (a) to increase provision of affordable housing to
middle and lower income groups; (b) to improve sector policies leading to the
development of a self-sustaining, market-based housing development and finance system
meeting the needs of a broad range of incomes; (c) to establish a sound institutional
framework for the sector, including a strengthened National Housing Corporation (NHC)
and active participation by the private sector; and (d) to increase long-term finance for
housing for middle and lower income groups from the private financial sector.
iv.   The project had five components: (a) housing finance through the Housing
Refinance Facility (HRF) channeled through private banks for (i) loans for purchase of
land developed by NHC, i.e. about 400 small-size plots with basic services in Port Vila
and Luganville for lower and middle income households, and (ii) house construction
loans for about 250 houses; (b) institutional strengthening of NHC; (c) off-site water
supply improvements; (d) dump relocation, landfill site development and management;
and (e) housing and urban development policy formulation. The project was restructured



iv
in 1997 to convert the HRF into a Deposit Assistance Scheme (DAS) and to carry out
additional civil works under component (c).
v.    Evaluation of Objectives. The objectives of the project were clear, but too
ambitious. The project design - with five components and a total of seven GOV agencies
involved - was overly complex and too innovative for the borrower. It was also risky as
land development and housing provision by a public sector agency tended to be
problematic.
Implementation Experience and Results
vi.   Project Outcome. Overall, the achievement of project objectives is considered
negligible. The physical objectives regarding plot development were partially achieved.
Although not specifically mentioned in the project's objectives, the physical objectives of
relocating the Port Vila dump and improving solid waste management were substantially
achieved, thereby substantially improving environmental conditions.  The project's
institutional objectives were partially achieved: the NIHC is now a stronger institution
than when implementation began. The project financial and policy objectives, however,
were not achieved, as NHC is still in poor financial condition. The technical assistance
for policy reformulation was never engaged.
vii.   As of February 18, 1999, the project, financed from a Credit of US$3,375,000
equivalent, had disbursed US$1,597,097.55 equivalent or 44.5%.   Government
contributed approximately Vatu 8 million and the Japanese Government, through its
PHRD Grant (TF25260), assisted with Yen 25,200,000 (99% disbursed). The project
became effective on July 14, 1993, two years after Board approval. It closed on
September 30, 1998, more than three years after the original closing date of June 30,
1995.
Key Factors Affecting Implementation
viii.  The key factors that were Not Subject to Government Control were: (a) a weak
human resource base that made placing qualified staff in key agencies difficult; (b)
frequent changes in government which hampered policy changes and exacerbated the
weak human resource base problem; and (c) lack of interest among the commercial banks
in lending to the target income groups (para 17).
ix.   Factors Generally Subject to Government Control were:  (a) government's
inability to manage change during the political transitions, resulting in a lack of
continuity in policy; (b) the unwillingness of the successive governments to adhere to
previously agreed to project parameters; (c) weak oversight by NHC's parent ministry
and occasional overt interference in its management; and (d) Reserve Bank of Vanuatu
took very slow actions to operationalize the Housing Refinance Facility (HRF) and,
following the 1997 restructuring, the DAS (para 18).



v
x.    Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control were: (a) weakness
of NHC's management and frequent staff turnover, which contributed to the poor
operational and financial performance of the agency and slowed plot development and
sales; and (b) technical assistance for policy reformulation was never used (paras 12 and
19).
xi.   Performance of IDA. IDA's performance is rated unsatisfactory in identification
because it went ahead with an overly ambitious project despite clearly identified risks and
an inexperienced borrower. In preparation, IDA's performance was unsatisfactory.
Although attempts were made to modify the project concept with a view to mitigating
those risks, project design was not able to overcome the existing constraints and
weaknesses. Appraisal is deemed unsatisfactory. The appraisal did not recognize that
the commercial banks had lost interest in the HRF. Restrictive land development and
housing standards should have been addressed up front. A formal social assessment
would have been useful to determine the interest of low-income groups to participate in
the project. IDA's supervision is rated unsatisfactory. Although a core team comprised
of a municipal engineer and an urban planner/architect, with intermittent participation by
a financial analyst and an environmental engineer, conducted regular supervision
missions and left comprehensive aides-memoire, IDA did not take decisive action to try
to achieve a successful outcome or close the credit on schedule. The supervision team
made several attempts to restructure the project, but succeeded only in 1997, one year
from closing (paras 27-28), and too late to have any impact.
xii.  Performance of the borrower. In preparation the borrower's perfornance is
rated marginally satisfactory. The inputs of some key agencies were provided by
expatriate staff, whose views did not necessarily reflect those of government. In
implementation, the borrower's performance is rated unsatisfactory. This assessment is
based on: very slow actions on fulfilling effectiveness conditions; interference in NHC
management; inability to settle on a housing policy; lack of timely action to restructure
the project; inadequate project coordination and poor compliance with legal covenants. A
noteworthy exception is the Public Works Department's excellent performance in
developing and implementing the relocation of the Port Vila landfill. An agency-by-
agency assessment is available in paras 30-38.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
xiii.  Sustainability of this project is unlikely. The project's main feature, the Housing
Refinance Facility, was never drawn upon, and the Deposit Assistance Scheme became
effective ten months after its introduction, leaving no time to test its utility. The
institutional capacity building was partially successful, but NHC's financial condition
remains poor. The off-site water improvement/infrastructure component yielded some
positive impacts, but only the solid waste management component may be considered
fully satisfactory. The policy formulation component failed to produce the intended
results.



vi
xiv.  Lessons Learned. The implementation of the project provides four lessons. First,
overall, direct public sector involvement in land development and housing finance is
problematic, even when efforts are made to mitigate the risks involved in that kind of
intervention. Second, insufficient attention to local socio-cultural factors and lack of
adequate client consultation can seriously impede sensitive project design; prior social
assessment is essential for a low-income housing project (para 24). Third, key actions
deemed necessary for project success must be insisted upon early on, such as changing
the overly restrictive land use/planning standards (not done and remained a problem), or
the condition of effectiveness pertaining to the identification of the new landfill site (was
done and the site developed) (para 25). Finally, if there is an unusually long delay
between project appraisal and effectiveness, the project objectives and scope need to be
reviewed early in implementation for their continued relevance and feasibility (para 26).



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF VANUATU
HOUSING PROJECT
(Credit 2262-VAN)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
INTRODUCTION
1.    At the opening of this decade, Vanuatu's urban population of about 24,000 (or
approximately 17% of the total) was concentrated in two urban areas: the capital, Port
Vila and Luganville. Urbanization was a new phenomenon, but was increasing rapidly.
This rapid urban growth was straining urban services especially housing, where
production could not keep up with demand, in particular from lower income households.
At the time of appraisal in 1990, over 25% of the urban population was living in slums,
tenements and squatter settlements often lacking basic services.  Rents for these
makeshift shelters at times approached 50% of household incomes.
2.    The main contributing factors to this housing situation were a serious shortage of
land for urban development, the limited availability of mortgage finance, lack of a policy
framework and appropriate standards, and weak sector institutions. The Government of
Vanuatu (GOV) had begun to address these issues by setting out the main objectives for
the housing sector in its Second Development Plan of 1987-1991. These objectives were:
(a) to make available acceptable housing for the urban population; (b) to reduce
overcrowded housing and squatting; (c) to pass legislation establishing appropriate
standards for housing; and (d) to increase the supply and range of housing options
available for purchase. These objectives responded to the need for developing housing
delivery systems, but lacked explicit policy content and did not address the two major
problems of finance and land for urban development over the long term. As part of the
actions GOV was taking to achieve its sector objectives, it established the National
Housing Corporation (NHC), a public agency, provided its initial capital, and through the
NHC, began to develop land, build houses and provide mortgage finance for shelter
products. These houses were of generous size and high physical standards, and NHC
realized that subsidies were needed to continue the effort.
3.   In this context, as the guidelines for the new NHC were being established, and for
the purpose of funding the shortfall between affordability and cost, in 1988 IDA was
invited to participate with a credit operation. Appraisal was carried out in 1990.

A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
4.    The objectives of the project were:
(a) to increase provision of affordable housing to middle and lower income groups;
(b) to improve sector policies leading to the development of a self-sustaining, market-
based housing development and finance system meeting the needs of a broad
range of incomes;
(c) to establish a sound institutional framework for the sector, including a
strengthened NHC and active participation by the private sector; and
(d) to increase long-tern finance for housing for middle and lower income groups
from the private financial sector.
5.    The Project's components included: (a) refinancing of long-term mortgage loans
for purchase of serviced plots and construction of houses for about 400 lower and middle
income households, using the Housing Refinance Facility (HRF) with channeling through
commercial banks; (b) institutional strengthening of the NHC; (c) off-site water supply
improvements; (d) new landfill site development and improved solid waste management
(financed through a Japanese PHRD Grant); and (e) housing and urban development
policy formulation.  Following the restructuring of the project in August 1997,
component (a) was replaced by a Deposit Assistance Scheme (DAS) and component (c)
was expanded to include water tank replacement and road sealing.
6.    Reevaluation of Objectives. The objectives of the project were clear, but too
ambitious given the borrower's weak human resource base, important socio-cultural
factors such as a lack of familiarity with formal financial sector, and, in hindsight, its
political instability. In view of these factors, the project design - with five components
and a total of seven GOV agencies involved - was overly complex and too innovative. It
was also risky, as Bank Group experience had established that land development by the
public sector tended to be problematic.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
7.    Overall Assessment. The first physical objective was partially achieved through
the NHC's development of about 570 serviced plots in Port Vila and Luganville; the
institutional objective was also partially achieved, but the project has not achieved its
policy and financial objectives. Although not included under the objectives, the project
achieved substantial improvements of solid waste management by closing the old Port
Vila dump site (this was a pre-condition for the plot development component (d)), and by
developing a new sanitary landfill site under that component which has improved
environmental conditions in Port Vila overall. Overall, only 44% of the IDA Credit of
SDR 2.5 million was disbursed. The low total disbursements are in part due to the failure
of the HRF which constituted 33% of the entire Credit (and 60% of the canceled balance).



3
Objective (a): Increased Provision of Affordable Housing
8.    The Credit did not finance land development per se, but the production of
affordable serviced plots and housing products by NHC was essential for making use of
project funds - for individual mortgage loans - which were to be channeled through the
HRF to commercial banks. The SAR estimated that some 400 plots would be developed.
After considerable delays, NHC was able to produce 570 plots' meeting the affordability
criteria; this is 30% over the SAR estimate. This activity has resulted in a substantial
addition to Vanuatu's stock of serviced urban residential land, and the first such land
affordable to low and middle income households. An economic analysis has been
conducted upon completion for a sample of comparable (to the analysis at appraisal)
housing products for which reliable cost data were available. Depending on housing
type, the IRR was calculated to range from 9.5 to 13.5%; however, only a small number
of houses had been built by the time the Credit closed. At appraisal an IRR of 17.6% was
estimated for similar housing products. The details of the IRR calculation are in Table 9.
9.    Initially plot sales were not always in accordance with the eligibility criteria,
especially income criteria, mostly due to political interference. Most of these plots were
re-allocated under the new NHC management (starting in 1995); the current management
appears to have been largely able to resist outside pressure. However, at closing NHC
did not provide the latest customer income data to give a complete profile of plot
purchasers. Since there was very limited housing construction on the sold plots, in May
1997, IDA agreed to finance the construction of several different types of houses through
the NHC. These lower cost units demonstrate - albeit rather late - that attractive,
comfortable and affordable houses can be built and are acceptable to the target
population.
10.   Also contributing to the objective of increasing the provision of affordable
housing were two other physical project components, the offsite water supply works and
development of a new landfill site. The offsite infrastructure component was expanded
considerably as part of the 1997 project restructuring to include: (a) construction of two
urgently required water reservoirs in Luganville and Malekula; and (b) about 4 km of
road sealing in the "Fresh Water" plot development area in Port Vila. These works were
completed before Credit closing.
11.   The development of a new landfill site was not specifically mentioned in the
project's stated objectives, but was necessary because the existing dump site was next to
the new land development area. The Japanese Government, through a Population and
Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant, financed all technical assistance related to
the closure and reclamation of the existing dump, preparation of the detailed design and
engineering of the new landfill site, and training for operations staff; all physical works
and equipment were financed from the Credit. The Public Works Department is now
operating the site as a sanitary landfill, thereby contributing substantially to improved
solid waste management in Port Vila, and generally better environmental conditions.
This site is considered a model for the Pacific Region.
1 207 plots developed in Fres Wota North 3 have road access but no water or electricity



4
Objective (b): Improved Sector Policies
12.   This objective was not achieved. Despite serious attempts by the National
Planning Office (NPO) and early IDA missions, the technical assistance for policy
formulation never got underway, possibly due to a loss of interest and ownership on the
part of GOV officials involved. It was only in 1996 that some proactive NPO officers
started - assisted initially by project TA funds - the Urban Growth Management
Initiative which is now proceeding well with Asia Development Bank (ADB) financing.
This initiative aims to formulate approaches and policies addressing the challenges of
rapid urban growth.
Objective (c): Institutional Strengthening, especially of NHC
13.   The underlying objective of NHC strengthening was to turn the NHC away from
its European-style public housing roots to become a more commercially oriented land
developer, albeit without a role in financing and house production, as these functions
were to be carried out by commercial banks and individuals or contractors, respectively.
This objective was only partially achieved. The NHC is now a stronger and more capable
institution than it was when implementation began. After a poor start and several
management changes, the current management team is more active and assertive, and
staff are learning on the job and improving their performance. The NHC's performance
in production and sales of serviced plots has improved markedly; however the low
incomes of the clients, and thus their difficulty in accumulating savings to purchase plots,
make sales a very slow and costly process for NHC. Management of the NH:C's small
mortgage loan portfolio (not part of the project since it existed before implementation
began) has improved, but remains problematic.
14.   Expected improvements in NHC's financial performance in support of the
institutional objectives did not occur. Loss-making operations have wiped out NHC's
capital, and as of Credit closing, it had a negative net worth equal to about one and one-
half times equity. NHC relied on net cash flow from its rental properties and, improperly,
on deposits from new plot purchasers.
Objective (d): Long-term Financing from the Private Sector
15.   This objective was not achieved. The Credit's Housing Refinance Facility (HRF),
the main instrument of the project, was expected to provide long-term mortgage financing
for serviced lots and houses. However, due to a number of factors discussed in Part C
below and the late start-up of the project, the HRF was never used.
16.   After several unsuccessful attempts to restructure the project by identifying
alternative, shelter-related activities to make use of the funds originally allocated to the
HRF (such as rental housing development, settlement upgrading, formalizing "custom"
land), in August 1997 the project was restructured to include a Deposit Assistance
Scheme (DAS). The DAS was developed in response to the difficulties target households
were having in making the initial deposit required by commercial banks for plot and/or
house construction loans. The DAS was to provide financing for part of the initial
deposits, thereby making plot purchasers eligible for mortgage loans. However, it took



5
GOV until June 1998 to make the DAS effective. With only three months before the
Credit closing date, the DAS was never activated.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
17.   Factors Generally Not Subject to Government Control.  The weak human
resource base adversely affected project preparation and implementation since very few
qualified staff were working in key agencies, especially the NHC, NPO and the Reserve
Bank. Expatriate advisors active during project preparation were phased out shortly after
project effectiveness in 1993, adversely affecting the institutional capacity needed to
commence the project implementation. The situation was exacerbated by the frequent
changes of government and the resultant lack of continuity in the key agencies; this
affected most of all the policy formulation and contributed to those objectives not being
met. Furthermore, due to a considerable easing of the Vatu liquidity crisis early on
during project implementation, the commercial banks lost interest in the BRF. The banks
were also generally rather reluctant to extend mortgage loans to lower income ni-
Vanuatu. The latter factor was partially due to the target group's lack of familiarity with
the forrnal financial system and their difficulty in accumulating savings: many famnilies
had just started to enter the cash economy.
18.   Factors Generally Subject to Government Control. GOV's inadequate capacity to
manage these frequent changes (referred to above) exacerbated the problems described
above. There was also an apparent unwillingness on the part of successive cabinets to
adhere to previously agreed to key project parameters, such as appropriate plot sizes and
houses standards. The Ministry of Home Affairs and the Lands Department, respectively,
were unwilling to support reduced physical standards to increase affordability by lower
income groups, to streamline cumbersome approval procedures, and to speed up lease
title registration. Moreover, the Port Vila Municipality also blocked efforts to develop
smaller plots and allow temporary and incremental buildings to be erected - which would
have been crucial to make plots and houses more affordable to the target lower income
groups. Weak oversight and guidance of the NHC by its board and the respective parent
ministry, and occasional overt interference in the management of NHC were other major
factors negatively affecting NHC's performance. Finally, the very slow action attempting
to operationalize first the HRF, and later the DAS, also affected the project adversely.
19.   Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control. The weakness of
NHC management and the frequent turnover of key staff, coupled with a lack of
leadership and control contributed substantially to poor operational and financial
performance, including the slow-paced plot development and sales activities. The NHC
also did not use the technical assistance allotted under the project for policy formulation,
but given the unstable political climate, any recommendations resulting from the
technical assistance probably would not have been implemented.



6
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
20.   Project sustainability is unlikely. The latest government has not agreed to the
project's proposed appropriate housing standards. NHC's financial condition is very
poor, and it will have to be recapitalized from  GOV's scarce resources.  The
sustainability of the infrastructure works and of the solid waste component is likely,
provided that charges for the latter are increased to cover the operating budget.
E. IDA's PERFORMANCE
21.  Identification.  IDA's performance in identification is rated deficient.  The
project's design, involving a public sector housing agency, was risky as Bank Group
experience had established that land development by the public sector tended to be
problematic. The project team advised IDA management against this concept, but IDA
management decided to go ahead based on GOV's insistence and IDA's strong
commitment to increase its lending to the Pacific Island countries.
22.   Preparation. IDA's performance in preparation is rated unsatisfactory. GOV
insisted that NHC play a leading role in the project, and IDA management agreed to
proceed with the project according to GOV's request. At the same time, IDA issued new
policy directives on housing sector interventions that discouraged direct public sector
involvement in shelter development. Faced with these constraints, the project team
modified the project concept so as to mitigate the risks of public sector housing
development. It was decided that the role of NHC would be limited to land development.
Rather than directly financing land development, IDA funds were to be channeled
through the HRF to refinance commercial bank mortgage loans to project beneficiaries
for the purchase of NHC-developed plots and construction of their houses. While
involving risk, this appeared feasible with effective TA support and a stable policy
development environment (which had been the case in the 1980s).
23.  Ideally, it would have been preferable to undertake the project using private
developers instead of NHC, but the developers contacted by staff during preparation were
uninterested, citing land ownership complexities and difficulties in land acquisition by
private parties. GOV also disliked this approach due to suspicions of private sector
motives. Under the circumstances, it may have been possible, and more effective, to limit
NHC's role further and entrust the marketing and sales of the developed plots, as well as
guidance to plot buyers on securing mortgage loans, to private real estate agents.
24.  IDA may have overestimated the potential for change in Vanuatu, by expecting
government and beneficiaries to quickly adopt the latest approaches in housing sector
policies and financing mechanisms. More careful attention to the local socio-cultural
environment might have led IDA to employ a more sensitive approach that would have
served better than the HRF, as a slower transition to a more formal stage of the housing
development and finance sectors.
25.   Appraisal. IDA's appraisal is rated unsatisfactory. For the appraisal mission,
IDA management appointed a new task manager with expertise in municipal engineering



7
rather than finance or housing as had been the case during project preparation. The
appraisal did not recognize that the commercial banks had lost interest in the HRF, and
their need for long-term funds matching was overestimated. The HRF pricing formula -
while satisfying Bank Group policy - made the HRF unattractive right from the start.
Also, the necessary changes in restrictive land development and housing standards should
have been addressed up front by the IDA appraisal team. A formal, more robust social
assessment should have been conducted to determine the interest of low-income groups to
participate in the project. On the positive side, the condition of effectiveness pertaining to
the development of the new landfill site was key to identifying the most suitable site in a
timely manner. This contributed to the success of this component, but unfortunately this
was not a stated project objective.
26.   Supervision. In supervision IDA's performance was unsatisfactory. Given the
long delay between appraisal and effectiveness, the project objectives and scope
(especially the HRF) should have been reviewed to ensure their continued relevance and
feasibility. Some of the core team members from identification, preparation and
appraisal, were involved in supervision right up to completion thus ensuring continuity.
The project was supervised regularly by a municipal engineer and an architect/planner.
Other occasional mission members included a financial analyst for the NHC component
and an environmental engineer to evaluate the landfill site development. Visits by an
institutional specialist and more frequent visits by a financial analyst might have had a
greater impact on the institutional strengthening and financial position of the NHC. The
mission's aides-memoire were comprehensive and always provided a clear work program
containing specific recommendations for improvement, but different supervision staff
may have tried new approaches to overcome the increasing hurdles to successful
implementation.
27.  IDA supervision missions made many attempts to restructure the project when it
was recognized that the HRF concept had failed. Alternative shelter-related activities
such as a rental housing development, settlement upgrading, and formalizing "custom"
land were identified and discussed during the missions, but to no avail. Finally in August
1997 GOV agreed to the DAS, and the Development Credit Agreement was formally
amended. However, by that time, little time remained before Credit closing to fulfill the
conditions to activate and implement the DAS.
28.  IDA actively supervised the project and made serious efforts to achieve the
project objectives, but the Bank Group staff and management may have been reluctant to
recognize the low likelihood of a successful outcome for this project. They also may
have failed to apply strict standards of good implementation performance when
considering requests for closing date extensions, but rather made allowances for the
borrower's weaknesses.



8
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
29.   Preparation. Although the project concept as proposed by GOV was weak as
described above, the borrower's performance during identification, preparation and
appraisal is judged to have been marginally satisfactory. NPO and Reserve Bank of
Vanuatu were actively involved during this period although their inputs were largely
provided by expatriate staff; these stakeholders did not necessarily represent government
commitment to the project.
30.  Implementation. The borrower's performance in implementation (except for the
Public Works Department) is rated deficient, as outlined in the following paragraphs.
31.   MOF. This ministry failed to ratify the Development Credit Agreement within a
reasonable amount of time after Board approval. It failed to provide timely policy advice,
and its changing views on housing policy as it affected the project caused significant
delays in effectiveness and implementation. Oversight and guidance for NHC activities
were minimal, and MOF was not pro-active in seeking timely restructuring of the project.
32.   Department of Finance (DOF). DOF was partially effective, but the timeliness of
disbursements, use of the Special Account, categorization of project expenditures,
monitoring of disbursements to actual expenditures, and compliance with audit
requirements could have been much better.
33.   National Planning Office (NPO). NPO was not fully effective in its role as
project coordinator, although their staff maintained an active interest and made at times
great efforts to support implementation activities. NPO was reluctant to perform
coordination responsibilities but eventually accepted the tasks which were clearly
outlined in a 1994 IDA mission aide memoire (monitoring progress, identifying and
resolving problems, overseeing financial records and timely audits; monitoring
compliance with covenants, progress reports, etc). In the later stages, especially during
the restructuring, NPO took the initiative to salvage the project.
34.   NHC. Despite performance improvements late in project implementation, NHC's
overall performance is considered to have been deficient.  Installation of NHC's
management information system (MIS) was seriously delayed, and once installed, was
not maintained. NHC's management, especially of staff and finances, was weak and
contributed to its poor performance; for example, accounts and audit reports were
prepared up to two years late. Advice and assistance to plot purchasers was not effective,
in particular with respect to bank financing and house construction.
35.   However, since 1995 when the general manager and several key staff were
dismissed, NHC has improved its overall performance. The new management has
contracted out project management to local professional engineering firms which are
more efficient than the NHC's forner in-house staff. NHC had learned to articulate the
need for appropriate standards and by-laws, and had advocated them successfully before
the last government; however those standards are already being reconsidered by the latest
government. NHC has also shown considerable improvement in land development
management, sales and arrears collection.



9
36.   Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV). Although very active in the early stages of
implementation, RBV's performance was not effective. Their failure to undertake a
timely review of the need for the HRF led to funds under this component not being used.
In addition, RBV's failure to finalize the DAS participation agreement with the
participating intermediaries in a timely manner, left insufficient time to draw on Credit
funds before the closing date.
37.   Public Works Department (PWD). PWD did an excellent job of developing the
new landfill site, and their implementation performance was highly satisfactory.
Throughout the project there was professional adherence to good design and operation
practices. Technical assistance was well received and provided demonstrated benefits.
The right equipment was procured and is in use. PWD was also responsible for
overseeing the procurement and installation of the replacement water tanks in Luganville
and Malekula (Norsup). This work was completed in a timely manner and construction
quality was very good.
38.   Compliance with legal covenants was unsatisfactory. Progress reports were not
done, and project accounts and audit reports were always late. IDA's Project Agreement
with the NHC specified performance targets in relation to its operations, in particular with
regard to plot sales. These targets addressed advance deposits, the average margin on
plot sales, early conversion of any plot leases to mortgage loans, and keeping arrears on
leases below 5 %. The financial performance objectives of NHC were set out in the
Policy Statement contained in Annex 1 of the SAR. NHC was unable to meet any these
performance targets consistently.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
39.   Overall project outcome is rated unsatisfactory. The project's main feature, the
HRF, was never drawn upon. The DAS only became effective ten months after its
introduction, leaving no time to test its utility. The institutional capacity building was
partially successful, but NHC's financial condition remains poor. The off-site water
supply improvement component, which was restructured to become a basic infrastructure
component, yielded some positive impacts in the final 12 months of implementation
through the road sealing work on the housing site and replacement of a collapsed water
tank. The solid waste management component may be considered fully satisfactory, but
unfortunately there were no project objectives specifically linked to it. The policy
formulation component failed to produce results although it helped to start the Urban
Growth Management Initiative.



10
H. FUTURE OPERATION
40.   There is no future operational plan for the NHC, but GOV plans for it to continue.
Although there is also no operational plan for the landfill site, effective operation of the
site and of solid waste management in general is likely because of ongoing institutional
strengthening support being provided to the Municipality of Port Vila, the operating
agency, through an ADB-financed urban infrastructure lending operation.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
41.   The implementation of the project provides a number of important lessons.:
(a) Direct public sector involvement in land development and housing finance is
problematic, even when efforts are made to mitigate the risks involved in that
kind of intervention;
(b) Insufficient attention to local socio-cultural factors and lack of adequate client
consultation can seriously impede sensitive project design; prior social assessment
is essential for a low-income housing project (para 24);
(c) Key actions deemed necessary for project success must be insisted upon early on,
such as changing the overly restrictive land use/planning standards (which was
not done and caused serious problems), or the condition of effectiveness
pertaining to the identification of the new landfill site (which was met and the site
was successfully developed) (para 25); and
(d) If there is an unusually long delay between project appraisal and effectiveness, the
project objectives and scope need to be reviewed for their continued relevance and
feasibility (para 26).

APPENDIX A
VANUATU HOUSING PROJECT
(Credit 2262-VA)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION MISSION - JULY 1998
AIDE MEMOIRE
I.    Introduction
42.   A World Bank implementation completion mission comprising Heinz Unger
(Team Leader), Henry Boldrick (Financial Analyst), Eric Peterson (Architect/Planner)
and Daniel Hoomweg (Environmental Engineer) visited Vanuatu from July 13 to 20,
1998 to carry out the implementation completion mission for the project. The mission
met with the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the main project
agencies and other Government of Vanuatu (GOV) officials concerned, and with
consultants and representatives of two commercial banks. A wrap-meeting was held on
July 17, and although a larger group of stakeholders was invited, only the key agencies
attended the meeting.
43.   The mission wishes to thank all Government and private sector managers and
staff, especially the staff of NPO and of the National Housing Corporation (NHC), for
their cooperation and assistance. The main findings, observations and conclusions of the
mission are summarized in this aide memoire which was left with Government; the aide
memoire is still subject to confirmation by World Bank management in Washington.
44.   GOV, through NPO, had engaged a consultant who between April 30 and June 17,
1998, prepared an Implementation Completion Report for GOV, including a ten-page
executive summary. The consultant's report evaluating the performance of the project for
Government is comprehensive and largely well done. Up-to-date cost and detailed
project expenditure information has been compiled in GOV's ICR; it is therefore not
repeated in the Bank's aide memoire. However, several assertions in the report,
especially concerning NHC finances, are incorrect (see below). The report also fails to
present updated information on the levels and distribution of urban household incomes (a
key criterion for eligibility), and the beneficiary survey was much too limited to be of any
relevance. GOV may wish to still work on these two items to allow a more informed
evaluation of the project's impact and achievements.
45.   Since the Credit closing date had been extended for three more months to
September 30, 1998 to allow completion of several ongoing contracts, the mission also
carried out supervision activities.  Their main findings and recommendations are
summarized in a separate supervision section at the end of this aide memoire.



21
II.   Project Background and Description
46.   Preparation. After GOV approached the Bank in 1988 for assistance in the
housing, UNDP/UNCHS fimded a feasibility study focusing on appropriate development
standards and affordability, with smaller plot sizes being one of the key items of the
study. This study was the basis for further project preparation by the Bank.
47.   Project Objectives.  The project was appraised in 1990 and the following
objectives were agreed with GOV: (i) increased provision of affordable housing to lower
and middle income groups; (ii) improved sector policies leading to self-sustaining,
market-based housing and finance systems meeting the needs of broad range of incomes;
(iii) sound institutional framework for the sector, including a strengthened NHC and
active participation by the private sector; and (iv) increased long-term finance for housing
for middle and lower income groups from the private financial sector.
48.   Description of Project Components:  (a) housing finance through Housing
Refinance Facility (HRF) channeled through private banks for (i) land development of
about 400 small-size plots with basic services in Port Vila and Luganville for lower and
middle income households, and (ii) house construction loans for about 250 houses; (b)
institutional strengthening of NHC; (c) off-site water supply improvements; (d) dump
relocation and management; and (e) housing and urban development policy formulation.
NOTE: Since the solid waste component -- item (d) above for dump relocation -- was
totally separate from the housing project (it's not even in the project objectives), it is
treated separately in the completion evaluation below.
A.   LAND DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING FINANCE COMPONENT
HII.  Project Status
49.   Land Development was not financed by the Credit, but the availability of
affordable plot and house products was seen as essential in order for the Credit's central
activity--the Housing Refinancing Facility (HRF) -- to be drawn upon. Thus considerable
attention has been focused on ensuring the production by NHC of plots that the intended
beneficiaries could afford and for which they would be able to obtain financing. While
external factors eventually obviated the need for the HRF, NHC continued to develop
land, which was agreed to be its core business, while other approaches to increase
housing finance through the Credit were pursued.
50.   After considerable delays -- due mainly to changing govermnents and the
consequent failure to establish consistent enabling policies for the housing sector (notably
appropriate standards such as affordable plot sizes) -- NHC will have succeeded in
producing 569 plots meeting affordability criteria by the project closing date (see table
below).

51.   This production exceeds the SAR-projected total of about 400 plots. Not financed
directly by the Credit, this activity has resulted in a substantial addition to Vanuatu's
stock of serviced urban residential land, and the first such land affordable to low- to
middle-income citizens.  The distribution of plots sizes was designed to match the
distribution of urban incomes in the 10th to 70th percentiles of urban incomes among Ni-
Vanuatu.
52.   Plot Allocations and the Target Group. Initially plot allocation was not always
done with due regard to meeting eligibility, especially income, criteria. It was found that
political pressure was applied on previous NHC management to allocate plots (and
multiple, joining plots) to people whose incomes were clearly above the agreed target
range. However, most of these were re-allocated under new NHC management, and
current management appears to have been largely able to resist such pressure. NHC's
latest customer income data will be provided for the Bank's ICR, since it is still not
completely clear to what extent the agreed eligibility criteria are being met.
53.   Site Development Standards (Plot Size). After several changes of view on the
part of Government since the Credit was first developed for negotiation, it had been
assumed that Government accepted the concept of plot sizes that could be afforded by
low- to middle-income Ni-Vanuatu families without subsidy. Experience during project
implementation showed that after nearly every change of Government, this discussion
was re-opened, and always resulted in considerable delays in land development. A few
months before the ICR mission, a new government again raised this issue, resulting in the
Port Vila Municipal Council declaring the FWN site illegal. Through the timely
intervention at the Ministerial level, however, this immediate crisis was averted, but
probably only temporarily. The new government sworn in March 1998 must now be
informed as to the connection between plot size, cost, and hence affordability to lower
income citizens. (See the supervision section of this aide-memoire). The mission
observes that unaffordable minimum standards were developed under colonial
administrations and have resulted in large numbers of Ni-Vanuatu living in sub-standard
and much smaller tenements at a monthly rent far higher than the monthly mortgage loan
re-payment for a family-owned small plot and house at FWN.



23
54.   Site Consolidation. After a few years of very slow activity, consolidation of the
FWN site is beginning to happen. Under normal circumstances, this will have a
compounding effect, and quick increases in house building will take place. NHC's
demonstration houses are believed to contribute to encouraging more families to move
onto the site and start house construction. Having a sufficiently large down payment for a
house construction loan -- the commercial banks require 30% -- remains an obstacle
which the Deposit Assistance Scheme (DAS) is intended to address.
55.  Implementation Arrangements. The approach to land development taken by
NHC's current management is a departure from earlier attempts. In the past, NHC
attempted to manage site development with its own internal technical staff, mostly in the
form of volunteers and donor-financed consultants. Under its new management, local
professional engineering firms were used as project managers, which has proven to be
more efficient.
56.  Institutional Strengthening. NHC has learned to articulate the need for
appropriate standards and by-laws, and has successfully advocated them before the new
government after initially encountering obstacles. NHC has also shown considerable
improvement in land development management, sales and arrears collection. NHC
therefore is in a better position to advocate on behalf of lower income Ni-Vanuatu than
any other institution in Vanuatu.
57.   Financial Status. NHC is a stronger and more capable institution than it was
when project implementation started.  This is due to stronger and more active
management and staff learning on the job and improving their performance. Performance
in sales of NHC-developed plots has significantly improved but the low incomes of the
clientele and their difficulty in saving to accumulated the plot purchase price makes sales
a very slow and costly process for NHC. Management of the mortgage loan portfolio
(which is not part of the project and existed before project implementation began) has
improved somewhat but remains problematic. Oversight by NHC's Government
appointed board of directors remains very weak and some board decisions have even
damaged NHC's continued development and financial health.
58.   NHC's financial position and performance is very poor. Years of loss-making
operations have wiped out NHC's capital and it now has a negative net worth about one
and one-half times equity. This is due primarily to the almost six years required to
develop the first phases of the Fres Wota North site compared to the project expectation
of two years. NHC operating and site development costs during this period accumulated
while it was unable to generate offsetting income through sales. Since the completion of
the initial FWN sites in 199X, the income from sales has been much less than expected
due to the several year it takes for plot purchasers to complete payment. Thus NHC
continued (and continues) to operate at a loss as expenses continued to exceed income.
NHC has been able to limp along by relying on net cash flow from its rental properties
(Tassiriki) and, more importantly, on deposits from new plot purchasers. This is a highly
unsatisfactory and dangerous situation. If a number of depositors simultaneously decide
to ask for the return of their money, NHC will be unable to comply (deposits held are



24
more than 10 times cash on hand and in bank) and a crisis will ensue resulting in the
collapse of NHC (the VNPF experience demonstrates how this can happen). NHC's
financial situation needs urgent attention by Government.
4. Implementation
Views of Borrower and Local Participants
59.   NPO had difficulty doing project good project management and coordination,
because every new government -- through the supervisory ministry and the Board -- tried
to interfere with the project implementation, often because they lacked the background
and understanding of the project objectives. The new administration system with
Director-Generals, introduced through the CRP in 1998, is expected to professionalize the
service and provide more continuity.
60.   Project coordination may have been handled better by PWD than NPO because it
would have been more consistent and less political.
61.   Although no progress had been made with the housing and urban policy
formulation until 1996, Credit financing was then used to fund a workshop to kick off the
Urban Growth Management Initiative which is now proceeding well with ADB funding.
62.   RBV regrets that only a short time will be available for testing the demand and
viability of the Deposit Assistance Scheme (DAS).
Views of the Mission
63.   Land development. This activity went through growing pains as the NHC moved
away from  in-house technical management to external expertise.  It should be
remembered, however, that land development was seriously delayed by the plot-size
debate, and as a result demand for the HRF never materialized at the time expected, when
commercial banks might have found a need for it.
64.   House construction. House construction was not provided for in the Credit except
in the form of financing. However, it proved necessary to build demonstration houses to
encourage people to move onto Fres Wota North and to demonstrate the feasibility and
acceptability of the smaller plots. This "demo" house activity has been efficiently
handled by two outside local consultants and the NHC General Manager, and should have
been started earlier during project implementation.
65.   NHC's Financial Performance during project implementation has been
inadequate. Performance over the last two years is much improved but remains
unsatisfactory as NHC continued to operate at a loss. However, it must be said that
management has been hampered by extremely weak oversight by the NHC board and by
the financial weakness of its clients. NHC could focus on selling plots to buyers already
having the full purchase price but such buyers would be unlikely to be among the target
group. Efforts to speed up the plot purchase process (e.g. installment payment contract)
have helped but have not made a significant difference. The recently agreed Deposit



25
Assistance Scheme (DAS), to be operated by the participating commercial banks and the
Reserve Bank (RBV), should facilitate the construction of houses by at least some NHC
clients but will be of little if any direct financial benefit to NHC. NHC will not be able to
continue in business without resolution of its current financial position. NHC badly
needs recapitalization but Governent's ability to provide such help is very limited. The
Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP) may provide an opportunity to address NHC's
financial needs through restructuring.
66.   Plot Pricing. The Government's consultant's report criticizes NHC for its large
plot sales price margin, citing a 25% limit on margin in the Bank loan documents. The
references to NHC sales margin indicate that the margin should be "at least 25%". The
report's discussion of the sales price margin ignores NHC's need to cover its operating
costs as well as direct development costs in the sales price.
67.   Housing Refinancing Facility. The HRF was established in the early stages of the
project to facilitate lending by the commercial banks to the project's lower and middle
income target group. World Bank loan funds were to be made available through a special
window (the HRF) in RBV to refinance up to 70% of mortgage loans made to eligible
borrowers. The BRF was expected to be necessary because the commercial banks were
experiencing a Vatu liquidity problem. As it turned out, NHC was unable to produce
plots for the first several years of the project so demand for commercial bank lending did
not materialize and the Vatu liquidity shortage eased to the extent that the banks were
able to develop their own lending products aimed at the project target group. Thus, the
HRF was never utilized and must be judged unsuccessful. The IDA Credit was finally
restructured in 1997 to eliminate the HRF and reallocate the funds in that category to
other uses, including the recently agreed DAS.
68.   Sector policy development.  Although an important element of the project and
despite serious attempts by NP(S)O staff and earlier Bank supervision missions, the TA
for policy formulation never got underway, possibly due to a lack of interest and
ownership on the part of the GOV officials involved. Only when some pro-active NPO
officers took the initiative in 1996, the Urban Growth Management Initiative was started
and is now proceeding well with ADB funding.
5. Project Impact
69.   The main impact of the project that is apparent at the time of the Bank's
completion mission is the availability of a large number of serviced urban building plots
affordable to a range of Ni-Vanuatu citizens who heretofore had little choice in the
housing market except sub-standard tenements.  The project has also provided
demonstration houses catering to the same broad range of incomes at the middle to low
end of the urban income spectrum. These houses show that lower standards of finish are
affordable while still being acceptable to customers and to banks and insurers alike. The
lower cost units demonstrate that comrmon materials and methods can be made into
attractive and comfortable housing that can be improved and expanded as a family's
income improves and savings are mobilized. While the replication of this approach will
rely on Government's acceptance of the lower -- appropriate -- standards introduced, the



26
demonstration effect of both the plots and the houses is expected to be significant, and
will enable both customers and Government to see their value.
6. Future Operations and Sustainability
70.   The sustainability of the planning standard -- whether the smaller plots standard
will be made available to any customer who wants it for cost reasons, even in other,
wholly private developments -- will depend on Government's willingness to abandon
once and for all the unaffordable restrictive standards that were developed in a different
era, and to adopt an enabling approach to housing policy. Future operations of the NHC
will depend on its ability to cater to effective demand by working under such a policy, in
order to meet its financial obligations. The DAS could be a key element for many low
income families, and hence the financial health of NHC, and if successful could be
continued after the Credit closes, subject to the availability of funding therefor.
71.   The immediate future of the NHC and the approach introduced by the project will
be secured only when it is clear that NHC can sell plots and collect the price in a timely
fashion. In the longer run, NHC, government agencies and other stakeholders should aim
to settle the plot size issue definitively and revise any hold-over legislation that is unduly
restrictive for low-income families seeking decent housing. This should include the
clearing of titling constraints for groups who wish to build community housing schemes.
7. Lessons Learned
Borrower's Perspective
72.   GOV's ICR Consultant extracted a number of lessons from  the project
implementation experience, but it will be important for all GOV agencies to review the
report and its conclusions to make sure they agree, and also to add any recommendations
of their own.
Bank's Perspective
73.   Direct public sector involvement in land development and housing construction
and finance is problematic. Bank staff initially advised Bank Management against
assisting the project because of the poor performance of housing projects involving state
housing development enterprises, and because state enterprises set up for these purposes
often fail because of poor management, political interference and lack of accountability.
However, Bank management overruled the staff and project preparation proceeded. This
project demonstrates very well the risks involved in this kind of Government
intervention.
74.   Efforts were made to design the project to mitigate these risks (channeling Bank
funds through the HRF to private banks for mortgage lending, institutional strengthening
for NHC) but these efforts were insufficient, and NHC's weakness and inability to deliver
developed plots for the first several years of the project have severely limited the



27
expected benefits of the project and have also resulted in NHC's financial difficulties. It
would have been more effective to undertake the project using private developers and/or
contractors instead of NHC, although there appeared to be few if any such developers
present in Vanuatu when preparation began.
75.  Insist on changing overly restrictive land use/planning standards, titling
impediments and construction bylaws early in project preparation or implementation,
perhaps as covenants or conditions of Credit effectiveness;
76.   A more concerted public information and consultation campaign than the efforts
made by NHC during the early stages of the project, would have helped to move the
debate on standards along more quickly, and helped to uncover cultural needs that might
have been missed in the project.
77.   The project concept was probably too ambitious and not sufficiently grounded in
the Vanuatu political and cultural environment. It also seems to have overestimated the
potential for change, by expecting a quick adoption of the latest approaches in housing
sector policies, and their essentially Western underpinnings. Thus the project expected
to move the local culture to middle class home-ownership, including formal mortgage
lending, and the Bank project tried to force this change too quickly.
78.   More careful attention to local custom might have led the Bank to an approach to
finance that would have served better than the proposed HRF, as a transition to a more
formal stage of the housing finance and shelter design. In any case, the Bank should
review the situation and performance of instruments for channeling funds, such as the
HRF, more frequently and make any necessary adjustments earlier in the project.
79.   During implementation, Bank supervision might have been more helpful if it had
tried harder early on to curb NHC ambitions, for example by strongly discouraging the
attempts to establish full in-house accounting and engineering capabilities. This would
have also required the Bank supervision to persuade NHC to turn down volunteer
positions; these "free" resources resulted in few benefits to NHC and probably caused
considerable problems.
8. Completion of Evaluation of Project Implementation
80.   As suggested above, GOV may want to review the Consultant's ICR in detail and
revise, add, delete to make it truly the Government's report. The mission strongly
recommends that additional work -- which could be financed by the TA category of the
Credit if completed before September 30, 1998 -- be undertaken by GOV to (i) update the
urban household income levels and distribution, and (ii) carry out a representative survey
of the plot purchasers (=beneficiaries). The later work could be combined with NHC's
promise to provide more comprehensive and detailed information on household incomes
of NHC plot purchasers to check how well the lower and middle income target group has
been served.
81.   The Bank will start preparation of its ICR during the next few months and still
expects to receive comments and contributions from GOV. The report will be finalized



28
once the Credit account has been closed and all expenditure data are available. The
Bank's draft ICR will be circulated to GOV for information and comments prior to its
finalization.
B.  SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT COMPONENT
Background
82.   During project design agreement was reached that, as part of housing
development at Fres Wota North in Port Vila, the existing garbage dump needed to be
closed and a new sanitary landfill developed. The Fres Wota site was poor because of
local geology (an abandoned limestone quarry with virtually no chance to limit off-site
leachate migration) and the proximity to residential areas (within 100 meters of proposed
housing sites). A new sanitary landfill was to be developed. This site was to meet all
internationally recognized landfill standards and serve the town of Port Vila for at least
20 years (acquisition of an acceptable site was a condition of project effectiveness). In
addition to the landfill site, the project also included funds for the purchase of two waste
collection trucks and all related technical assistance and training. PWD was eventually
agreed to be the implementing agency with on-going operations transferred to Port Vila
Municipality upon site completion.
Progress and Achievements
83.   A good landfill site (i.e. model for the Pacific region) has been constructed and is
now being operated by the Port Vila Municipality. Many individuals and agencies have
gained from the experience; following are the main achievements.
84.   Site Identification and Acquisition: Throughout the world this is usually the
most intractable solid waste problem. Development of the Port Vila site was no different.
Personal intervention from the Prime Minister was needed, but definitely the best site,
from a technical and financial perspective, was developed. The Bouffa site is overlain by
at least 25 meters of clay, is sufficiently close to the town center, has expansion capacity,
and is not within the recharge area of any water supplies. Site development progressed
well and most contracts were carried out on-time and within budget. PWD lead these
activities and monitored all contracts.
85.   Equipment Purchase: One Komatsu bulldozer (1994), two tipping collection
vehicles (1996), and a green waste chipper (1997), were bought with project funds. All
of the equipment is well suited for local conditions and is now operating. Operations and
maintenance requirements appear to be met and there are sufficient trained operators (the
chipper is not yet fully operational, but is expected to be in operation shortly).
86.   Technical Assistance and Training: Funded with assistance from a Japanese
(PHRD) Grant of Yen 25.2 million, the solid waste component benefited from a relatively
large amount of technical assistance and training. A thorough site selection study was
carried out (using various trust funds and assistance from other agencies such as WHO



29
and ESCAP). Design and construction supervision was funded by the PHRD grant, and
key staff received relevant local and overseas training, and experienced landfill
practitioners were brought in to help oversee site development.
Implementation Performance
Borrower's Views
87.   As outlined in the GOV's consultant's report, and based on discussions with
various government staff, it is felt that this component was completed successfully
(generally considered very successfully) and is yielding a positive impact. PWD did an
excellent job of developing the site -- although they would have wanted more cooperation
by the Port Vila Municipality -- and the later has now the responsibility of operating the
facility. Port Vila municipal staff are proud of the Bouffa site and the overall
improvement of solid waste services. There is a concern with some municipal staff that
recurrent operating budgets may be insufficient for good site operations.
Mission's Views
88.   General. The Bouffa landfill was well located and designed, the right equipment
was purchased, and there is enough local expertise to ensure good site operations. Some
deficiencies still exist, but overall this project component was completed satisfactorily
(site development was very satisfactory).  The two main areas that threaten this
component's sustainability identified by the mission are: ongoing Bouffa landfill site
operations; and the financial sustainability of the overall Port Vila Municipality's waste
management program (this aspect was not in fact a project objective but could be an
important future constraint). As part of ongoing supervision activities, Annex 1 to this
aide memoire outlines specific waste management observations and recommendations
made by the mission. These include: (i) Improved Bouffa landfill site operations; (ii) a
review of the financial viability of Port Vila's waste management collection and disposal
program (including evaluation of the potential to have greater involvement of the private
sector in carrying out this service e.g. Unelco); (iii) begin a green waste diversion
program; (iv) ensure adequate preparation for possible emergencies such as cyclones;
and (v) hazardous waste management program.
89.   Bouffa Landfill Site  is a good sanitary landfill site with adequate systems in
place to mitigate the site's environmental impact. During the project the GOV was able
to overcome opposition to locating the site at Bouffa, and throughout site development
there was a professional adherence to good design and operation practices; PWD deserves
considerable credit for its project management. Technical assistance was well received
and provided demonstrated benefits. The site has been operating for over three years and
should have an additional capacity in excess of twenty more years. The leachate
collection system still needs to be fully installed and maintained. With respect to site
development the mission rates this component as highly satisfactory, however with
regards to site operations at this time, the mission can only rate this aspect as (marginally)
satisfactory. Section 2 outlines some simple steps that could be taken to ensure site
operations are as successful as the previous site development.  These suggested



30
improvements are not onerous, and the mission is confident that Port Vila Municipality,
or their designate, could quickly carry them out.
Port Vila's Overall Waste Management Program
90.   This was not specifically a component of the project but the mission considered it
important to provide a broad initial review. Two solid waste collection vehicles were
acquired through loan funds and these are being used for areas in addition to the new
housing areas developed under the project. Also during the project two additional waste
collection trucks funded by OECF were put into operation.
91.   The mission was very pleased to see that during the project, PVM instituted waste
collection and disposal fees. Fees are now charged to cruise ships and to individuals and
businesses that deliver waste to the Bouffa landfill.  This is good and shows a
commitment by PVM to make the sustainability of these services more likely. However
there is no doubt that the fees currently charged could not support the overall costs of
solid waste management. The Municipal Council is aware of this and has begun to
review overall charges and the possible involvement of the private sector.
92.   The mission agrees with this approach and has suggested that both the Asian
Development Bank supported Port Vila Urban Sanitation Master Plan and the World
Bank's review of Vanuatu Private Sector Utilities, be expanded to review the potential for
increasing private sector involvement in the provision of solid waste services. The
mission met with representatives of Unelco who had already submitted a preliminary
proposal to Port Vila Municipality some years ago.
93.   Any increased private sector involvement in solid waste services in Port Vila will
require a specific directive on how services will be provided to poorer areas.
94.   The overall waste management program of Port Vila should also be improved
with the passage of the Environmental Sustainable Development Bill (now in draft). This
legislation should make it clear who is responsible and in the area of hazardous waste
management place the onerous for proper disposal with the generator. There is still a
significant amount of "buck passing", where one agency claims responsibility rests with
another. Similarly the mission was told that businesses will not pay to have hazardous
waste properly disposed of before the waste disposal act is passed.
95.   Two other important benefits were provided through this component of the
project. The Fres Wota dump is now closed and should only have minimal (if any)
impact on the environment. The site is now overgrown by vegetation and should be left
undisturbed. Monitoring wells have been installed but a regular water quality testing
regime needs to be carried out.
96.   A green waste chipper was purchased in 1997. This equipment should help to
divert over 30% of waste disposed at Bouffa landfill and should also produce a useful soil
conditioner (already two farmers have expressed interest in the chippings). Similarly, if
materials are chipped closer to Port Vila town center there will be transportation cost
savings. The equipment quickly needs to be fully functional (delayed for 6 months while



31
waiting for oil and full commissioning) since diversion of green waste is an important
component to the overall sustainability of Port Vila's waste management program.
Lessons Learned
97.   The Vanuatu Housing project provides a number of important lessons:
(a) It is unlikely that the preferred site would have been developed if its identification
had not been a project covenant, i.e. obtaining title for the site was a condition of
effectiveness. It proves that sometimes serious measures need to be applied to
overcome local opposition and political difficulties.
(b) As difficult as landfill site selection and development may be, day to day
operations are often more challenging. Interest wanes, recurrent budgets are
insufficient, and competing staff demands increase -- all of these threaten good
site operations.
(c) Port Vila Municipality is a competent and committed agency, however they can
not be expected to operate the Bouffa landfill site without considerable assistance
from other government agencies and a sufficient recurrent budget.
(d) Overseas operator training and local programs are beneficial and have
demonstrated benefits, however a proper environment is needed (e.g. adequate
budget and political commitment) to ensure good site operations.
(e) For solid waste activities as much, or more, attention is needed for operations
rather than just studies or capital investments.
(f) The Bouffa Landfill could be used as a model for other Pacific Island countries;
especially once operations are more sustainable.
(g) Diversion of green waste is an important component for any good waste
management strategy in the Pacific Region.
(h) Existing solid waste collection fees are inadequate to ensure sustainability; a more
thorough analysis of financing arrangements may have been warranted.

1. INTRODUCTION
This final evaluation report has been prepared by Terry Heap, the consultant appointed to
undertake this short-term consultancy assignment. All work and analysis was completed
during his assignment trip to Vanuatu during 30 April to 17 June1998.
During this assignment all project files, including archived files, were examined at NPO,
DOF, PWD, NHC and NAO. The files reviewed were generally in disarray and
incomplete. It was difficult to track progress of the project since regular monthly or
quarterly reporting was not evident from any of these files. The only documents
providing any form of project progress tracking were the Aide Memoires of the World
Bank missions. A complete set of these Aide Memoires was not available on any file and
aggregating those available in all files revealed missing documents, which were obtained
from the World Bank.
In general, the file search provided sufficient background information on the project. Due
to the time over which this project has occurred (1988 to 1998) there have been numerous
changes in personnel handling the various project components and there is no one
individual in Vanuatu able to provide first hand knowledge of the project over the period
since conception and implementation.
A list of the principal documents discovered in the files and other sources are included in
Annex 1.
Meetings and consultation was undertaken with stakeholders2 in the project, which
provided useful perspectives on the project, the implementation process and possible
lessons. A list of the persons consulted is included in Annex 2.
Inspections were undertaken of all stages of the NHC Fresh Water estate developments
and the PVM Bouffa landfill site. Equipment provided under the Credit was inspected,
usually in their operating environment.
Due to manpower constraints, a full time counterpart was not available during this
assignment. Counterpart assistance was provided by several individuals within the
following agencies; NPO (Johnson Naviti); NHC (Davina Tosusu, principal accounting
officer and Jimmy Tey, sales officer); and DOF (Lucy Simon, project officer).

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The main objectives of the Government's evaluation of this project are to: (i) provide
feedback from implementation experience in order to improve the design of future
operations; (ii) help to ensure greater development impact and sustainability during the
operational phase of the project; and (iii) reinforce self-evaluation by government and
implementing agencies and by the World Bank. This evaluation covers the project's
execution and initial operation, costs and benefits, the WB's and GOV's performance and
the extent to which the purposes of the Credit were achieved.
In judging the project's overall effectiveness it is important to view performance in the
light of the project's objectives. These were: (i) increased provision of affordable housing
to middle and lower income groups; (ii) improved sector policies leading to the
development of a market-based housing development and finance system; (iii) a sound
institutional framework for the sector, including a strengthened NHC and active
participation by the private sector; and (iv) increased long term finance for housing for
middle and low income groups from the private finance sector.
Achievement of these objectives involved the following benefits: (i) launch of a scheme
whereby low to middle income urban families would, for the first time, have access to
affordable home-ownership and commercial credit for housing; (ii) affordable serviced
plots and houses provided for up to 400 middle and lower income households (20% of
estimated demand in Port Vila and Luganville); (iii) support the development of policies
and standards leading to an improved supply response and enhanced private sector
involvement; and (iv) mobilization of private sources of funding for housing.
The project has clearly not achieved any of these objectives in the broad sense.
Over the effective life of this project, 1993 to 1998, NHC has developed and offered for
sale 247 serviced plots on the first two stages of Fresh Water North estate and 50 partially
serviced (no electricity) plots in Luganville. Of these, 114 plots have been sold and 183
plots remain under allocation with partial deposits. Only 23 houses (15 permanent and 8
temporary) have been erected on the FWN estate and 6 houses in Luganville. Three
permanent houses are currently under construction on FWN. Whether these plots and
houses have all gone to the target low to middle income families is difficult to ascertain
from NHC records, though anecdotal evidence suggests many plots may have been
purchased by families above the target range.
The project has not yet led to the development of a market based housing development
and finance system, as evidenced by the small number of houses erected on these plots.



38
Similarly, increased long-term finance for housing for middle and low income groups
from the private finance sector has not evolved, in large part because the original Home
Refinance Facility (HRF) was not utilized. Independent of this project, the commercial
banks have been able to develop a more attractive home mortgage package for families in
the upper range of the target families for this project.
The project has not facilitated the development of a sound institutional framework for the
housing sector, as there has been no directly induced increase in private sector
participation and the financial position of NHC has deteriorated significantly. Over the
period 1993 to 1997 NHC has continued to operate at a loss, accumulating losses of V t
140.9 million. By the end of 1997 NHC had a negative equity base or net worth of Vt
127.8 million.
The project consists of five components: (i) (a) serviced plot development executed and
financed by NHC, and (b) plot purchase and house construction loans refinanced by the
Housing Refinance Facility (HRF); (ii) institutional strengthening of NHC including
training and the provision of equipment; (iii) off-site water systems improvements in Port
Vila and Luganville; (iv) Port Vila solid waste management and landfill site
improvements; and (v) urban policy formulation through studies and TA.
Of these components, the Port Vila solid waste management and landfill site
improvements can be considered successful. However, further training and the
development and implementation of a sound solid waste management and operational
plan is required to ensure future operational effectiveness and maximize the expected life
of the site.
The serviced plot development and the institutional strengthening of NHC can be
considered partially successful. The serviced plots have been developed for sale, though
complete success has been negated owing to the failure to target the middle and lower
income households, as well as the high pricing of the plots. Plots were priced using a Vt
1 ,375/m2 rate compared with direct development costs of Vt 362-463/m2. The NHC
pricing of plots involved margins of 180-250% on direct development costs compared
with a project target of at least 25%. Had plots been priced with a 25% margin on
development costs, the selling prices would have been less than half the NHC designated
price. Such pricing would have been more affordable for the target families and more
plots would have been sold.
The institutional strengthening of NHC during the project period has resulted in
noticeable improvements in staff and management performance, financial accounting
records have improved and a plot sales information system has been installed. The
success of this component has only been partial because management, staff, systems and
processes development still have considerable room for improved performance before the
organization reaches a stage of self sustainability. Financial management and
performance has been particularly deficient and NHC has not complied with any of the
financial key performance indicators outlined in the WB Staff Appraisal Report on this
project.



39
The HRF, off-site water systems improvements and urban policy formulation components
of this project have been judged unsuccessful. The first two components were
unsuccessful, as the allocated funds were not used for the purpose intended under the
project. The urban policy formulation component is considered unsuccessful because no
such policy has been formulated or implemented as a result of activities funded under this
component.
Implementation of the project has involved a succession of delays. What was to have
been a four-year project has extended over seven years, and even then, the project has not
been fully implemented. These delays resulted in GOV applying for and receiving three
12-month extensions, which extended the Credit closing date to 30 June 1998.
The Development Credit Agreement was signed by the GOV on 16 October 1991, but did
not become effective until the Agreement was ratified by Parliament (involving delays
through Council of Ministers deliberations) in July 1993.
While the landfill component progressed after Credit effectiveness, some delays were
encountered with the commencement of implementation of the other project components.
The HRF component, modified to a Deposit Assistance Scheme approach in August
1997, was not implemented until mid June 1998. The serviced plot development and
N-HC institutional strengthening components did not commence implementation until
March 1994, due to delays in the GOV acceptance of housing policy issues incorporated
in the project conditions. GOV favored 600 m2 plots with completed houses. The off-site
water systems improvements were also not implemented in the form proposed, though
water tank installations in Malekula and Luganville are currently being implemented. The
urban policy formulation component did not commence implementation until June 1996,
when a preliminary workshop on Urban Growth Management was held.
All project components experienced implementation delays, once started. The reasons for
these delays varied and are outlined in the relevant sections of the following report.
The project was financed through four funding sources. The primary source was the IDA
Credit facility loan of SDR 2.5 million (about US$3.5 million), which was supplemented
by a Japan Government grant allocation up to JPY25.2 million.
The IDA credit facility was essentially to be expended on the NHC low income housing
project, financing the purchase of equipment for the Bouffa landfill operations and the
civil works cost for the closure of the old Fresh Water dump, the new Bouffa landfill and
access road to this site.
As a consequence of the various implementation delays the Credit utilization currently
stands at 59%, as shown below.

The expected level of further claims by the time of Credit closure3 (Vt 117 million) is
likely to raise the total disbursement level to around SDR 1.8 million, leaving around
30% of the Credit undisbursed.
The Japan Government grant was for operational support and training for the Bouffa
landfill site. This grant closed on 31 December 1996, with most of the grant expended.

Funding for the NHC FWN1 and FWN2 development costs was arranged through a Vt
24-million loan facility provided by the GOV. The balance of this loan currently stands
at Vtl9.5 million, against a total development cost for FWN1, FWN2 and Luganville
around Vt 43.7 million.
GOV provided direct funding for the 10% contribution towards capital works and other
expenses not covered by the above funding sources. The total contribution is currently
estimated around Vt 8.0 million.

Total estimated project expenditure is around 66% of the estimates in the WB Staff
Appraisal report. The local expenditure level was considerably lower than expected, by
Vt 148 million, while foreign expenditure financed through the IDA Credit and Japan
Government Grant was VT55 million lower than expected.
The main agencies involved during project implementation were: (i) NHC for serviced
plot development and NHC institutional strengthening; (ii) RBV and commercial banks
for plot purchase and house construction loans; (iii) PWD for off-site water systems
improvements and the Port Vila solid waste management improvements; (iv) Port Vila
Municipality to take over operation of the landfill site; (v) NPO for urban policy
formulation and for overall project coordination; (vi) DOF for reimbursement and project
accounts; and (vii) MOF for general policy guidance and oversight.
Of these agencies, only the PWD and PVM have performed effectively. DOF's
performance has been partially effective, as improvements in the timeliness of
disbursements, use of the Special Account facility, classification of expenditure
payments, monitoring of disbursements to actual expenditure and compliance with audit
requirements could have been improved.
The primary task of the NPO was project coordination, and their performance in this role
was not effective. Project implementation delays could have been minimized through
more effective coordination, implementation of a quarterly reporting system and use of a

completed which have contracts awarded



42
Project Coordination Committee mechanism involving regular meetings. NPO should
have adopted a more proactive approach to project coordination.
NHC was a lead agency and despite some evidence of successful institutional
strengthening, their lack of performance effectiveness is evidenced in the failure of the
project to achieve it's objectives, NHC's failure to develop as a sound and influential
organization in the housing sector, and their current financial position of substantial
negative equity. Substantial contributing factors to this performance failure were the
nature of the National Housing Corporation legislation that gives substantial power of
intervention to the responsible minister, political interference and influence of day-to-day
NHC operational decisions and the financial mismanagement and irregular (perhaps
fraudulent) practices of NHC personnel dismissed during 1995.
MOF, through its association with the political arm of GOV also exhibited ineffective
performance, in that their failure to provide timely policy advice, failure to ratify the
Development Credit Agreement within a reasonable period and their shifting views on
housing policy parameters effecting the project (e.g. lot size), was a significant cause of
delays in Credit effectiveness and initiation of implementation.
The RBV's performance has also not been effective, in that their failure to undertake a
timely review of the need for the HRF facility has led to the lack of use of this Credit
component. In addition, RBV failure to finalize the DAS legal agreement in a timely
manner with Participating Intermediaries, has meant that insufficient time has been
provided to test the demand and usefulness of this facility.
World Bank performance during project preparation, evaluation and implementation has
been very satisfactory. The project, as formulated and outlined in their Staff Appraisal
report, was a sound one. The Bank supervised project implementation at least two times
each year through missions of approximately one week's duration, usually involving an
engineer, an architect/planner and financial analyst (less frequently). Between missions,
significant written communication occurred to follow-up and monitor progress of critical
issues effecting project progress. In addition, the May 1995 WB mission held two round
table seminars in Port Vila and Luganville with groups of key stakeholder agencies.
In reality, WB missions acted as de facto project coordinators, providing the only regular
project reporting mechanism and fulfilling some of the tasks that were the responsibility
of the NPO Project Coordinator and Project Coordination Committee.
WB could have improved their performance effectiveness if missions had included on a
more regular basis, institutional and financial specialists. In addition, these specialists
may have required longer time periods in Vanuatu to enable them to undertake more
detailed evaluation.
The operational sustainability issues arising out of this project mainly relate to the
ongoing operation of the NHC and Bouffa landfill site by PVM. It remains to be seen
whether operational sustainability is required for the DAS by RBV. Other project



43
components either have no ongoing operation or such operation has been taken up in
other programs (e.g. urban growth management).
NHC sustainability depend upon some major institutional change (reform of National
Housing Corporation legislation) which will presumable come within the scope of
Vanuatu's CRP. NHC is also in need of a fairly substantial capital equity injection of Vt
360 million to achieve a 50:50 debt:equity ratio, or a lower Vt 310 million with
conversion of government loans (Vt 50 million) to equity. Continued staff and
management training and institutional strengthening will be required in NHC. A priority
initiative will be a review of the existing plot sales information system to bring it up to
date and in line with financial records of known depositors. When this task has been
completed, the plot database needs to be integrated with NHC financial records, so as to
provide up to date financial and management reporting.
Operational sustainability of the Bouffa landfill site by PVM will require continuing
training for the Health and Sanitation Officer and other site operators and the
development and management of a sound solid waste management operational plan, to
ensure maximum extension of the life of this site.
The lessons to be learned from this project are many, and these have been outlined
throughout the report. Despite the failure of the project to achieve its objectives, there is
sufficient evidence to suggest continuation of activities in this sector area could
eventually achieve results, if the lessons of this project are heeded.
The four most important lessons relate to the essential need for: (i) effective project
coordination; (ii) establishment and maintenance of effective institutional frameworks
within executing agencies; (iii) consistency in policy guidelines from the political arm of
government once a project has been agreed and the loan/grant agreement is signed; and
(iv) elimination of political pressure and influence on executing agencies.
For multi component projects such as this, it is essential that an effective project
coordinator is appointed and that person proactively undertakes the required coordination
tasks5. Regular quarterly reporting and the operation of an effective Project Coordination
Committee that meets regularly are essential elements of this project coordination role6.
This coordination mechanism should conduct regular (annual) reviews of project
implementation and initiate corrective action where project implementation is faltering.
In the current project, the unsuitability of the HRF initiative was beginning to be apparent
at the time of Credit effectiveness (July 1993) and despite being repeatedly mentioned in
successive WB mission Aide Memoires, was not refined to a DAS initiative until July
1997 (a delay of four years).

A precondition of projects such as this should be the establishment and maintenance of a
sound and effective institutional framework within all implementing agencies so that
these agencies can effectively perform the tasks expect of them. Government public
sector enterprises, such as the NHC, need to be well staffed and managed as well as being
free of political influence and interference in respect of day-to-day operational
experience. This would require a change in the legislation establishing the National
Housing Corporation (Chapter 188, Laws of the Republic of Vanuatu), eliminating most
of the ministerial powers to intervene in all aspects of NHC operations. Ministerial
powers should only be retained to provide broad policy directives, matters relating to
regulation and approval of permanent fixed term board members selected through a
transparent process to appoint persons with knowledge and experience relevant to the
activities of NHC. The elimination of board director remuneration payments for other
than nominal board attendance expenses would remove the attraction of board
membership to unqualified persons. Boards of public sector enterprise corporations
should also be accountable for their performance through an annual evaluation of the
enterprise's achievements and financial situation.
Similarly, senior management of implementing agencies should be accountable for their
performance relative to achievement of annual strategic plan targets and financial budgets
for the project and/or the organization. Conditions attached to projects should include: (i)
preparation of annual budgets and three-year project/organization financing plans; (ii)
preparation of project or three-year organization strategic plans; (iii) establishment of a
project/organization monitoring mechanism, including the identification of key
performance indicators; and (iv) establishment of a formal review and reporting process
for performance measurement against budgets and plans.
Consistency in policy guidelines from the political arm of government and elimination of
political influences may be difficult to manage during changes in government.
Nonetheless, a proactive and committed project coordination framework and process can
ensure consistent promotion of project purpose and benefits, as well as providing a
mechanism to provide timely response to these political pressures and influences.
Other lessons from this project which may be less applicable to projects in general are: (i)
when there is a delay between loan effectiveness and/or commencement of
implementation of a project (or any component) of more than two years after the
appraisal report, a review of the appraisal report should be conducted to confirm project
objectives, benefits, risks and other pertinent aspects of the project still apply; (ii) when
there is a delay in project disbursement drawdowns of more than 12 months for a
significant portion of project funding, a review should be conducted by the project
coordinator and an action plan initiated; (iii) the project review mechanism (e.g.
loan/grant missions and PCC) should include review and evaluation of the effectiveness
of the institutional framework of main implementing agencies; (iv) expenditure and
disbursement funds management should be established in accounts structured to reflect
project components (and where relevant, sub-components) and all disbursement funds
should be validated back to original expenditure items throughout the project's duration
to allow easier and accurate total project cost summaries to be compiled; and (v) key



45
performance indicators to measure the performance of project implementation should be
established, measured, reviewed, circulated widely to all implementing agencies and used
in a proactive manner to improve project implementation and effectiveness.
