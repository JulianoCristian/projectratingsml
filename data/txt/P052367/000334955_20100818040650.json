FSP-LESOTHO :\n            MALOTI-DRAKENSBERG TRANSFRONTIER CONSERVATION AND DE", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Maloti-Drakensberg\n            Transfrontier Conservation and Development Project for\n            Lesotho were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some key lessons learned from the project\n            include: transfrontier cooperation in biodiversity\n            conservation can be achieved through parallel implementation\n            that takes into account the uniqueness of the countries\n            involved, while maintaining synergies for cross-learning and\n            collaboration. Such a design allows sovereign decision\n            making and gives sufficient freedom to choose specific\n            implementation speed and processes, while generating the\n            necessary level of national ownership. While the\n            transfrontier cooperation was fully accomplished with\n            significant transfer of knowledge from the advanced\n            conservation and tourism experiences in South Africa,\n            Lesotho was able to deliver on its own achievements. This\n            appears a particularly suitable model in the context of\n            countries that differ in size and development status. Good\n            project design and detailed preparation is necessary\n            especially when local implementation capacity is low. The\n            design should be simple and should take into account local\n            institutional and human capacity. It is not advisable to\n            expect major tasks to be completed between appraisal and\n            effectiveness (e.g. condition of effectiveness). Moreover,\n            such gaps indicate lack of readiness of the project. A well\n            prepared logical framework should be the backbone of the\n            project design and should be fully agreed prior to project\n            implementation. Such framework needs to clearly show the\n            linkages between components and their outcomes with the\n            overall development objective. Frequent changes in task\n            management during project design and implementation can\n            cause serious disruption, when task managers are leaving\n            without finishing important milestone tasks."}, "docdt": "2010-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
