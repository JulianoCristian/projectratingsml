1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
The background of the project was a long-term collaborative initiative between the Republic of
South Africa (RSA) and the Kingdom of Lesotho (Lesotho) to protect the exceptional
biodiversity of the Drakensberg and Maloti mountains through conservation, sustainable resource
use, and land-use and development planning. The project focused on the Maloti-Drakensberg
Mountains, which are situated along the 300 km eastern boundary of the Kingdom of Lesotho
with the RSA. This area encompasses distinct landscape and biological diversity. It is rich in
species and high in endemism. However, excessive livestock grazing, crop cultivation on steep
slopes, uncontrolled burning, alien invading species and human encroachment threatened this
asset.

The project was consistent with the GEF Operational Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation and
specifically with O.P.4 (Mountain Ecosystems). The area is located within one of the 200 Global
Ecoregions proposed by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF); it has been designated as an
Afromontane Regional Center of Endemism. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park has been listed
as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention, and a substantial part of
the project area was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Peace Park.

The project was consistent with `Conference of Parties' (COP) guidance to encourage
conservation and sustainable use of threatened habitats and endemic species within a vulnerable
montane ecosystem. It responded to COP3 and COP4 guidance through capacity building for
sustainable rangeland management. It fostered the ecosystem approach by promoting improved
management and sustainable use across national boundaries and an altitudinal gradient of
montane habitats under different management regimes, from protected areas to community
rangelands. The project further responded to COP4 guidance by promoting incentive measures
and community involvement in biodiversity management specifically to attain conservation
objectives. It was expected that conservation co-management initiatives developed for the project
area will prove relevant to other protected areas and community lands elsewhere. The project was
designed to support new and innovative institutional measures to promote regional cooperation
and exchange of expertise and to encourage sustainable livelihoods consistent with both
biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation with a particular emphasis on sustainable
tourism. By building capacity for community conservation programs and alternative livelihoods
based on nature-related tourism the project promoted more equitable sharing of benefits derived
from biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.

While the ecosystem showed similarities on both sides of the border, there were considerable
legal, social, institutional and economic differences between the two countries, which the project
design recognized. Hence, a decision was made to design two separate projects following a
common objective rather than implementing one project jointly by both countries.

For Lesotho the primary rationale of the Bank's assistance was to support Government's strategy
of poverty reduction and its efforts to sustain macroeconomic performance through greater
integration into the sub-regional economy. In this context, the Bank supported "a comprehensive
approach to the natural resource environment". The project was expected to contribute to the
overarching objective on furthering sub-regional integration thanks to its transfrontier nature.
Collaboration with South Africa was expected to offer Lesotho access to a great deal of
experience in protected areas management. With better access to the Maloti mountains from the


                                               -1-
South African side, enhanced management and joint marketing, it was expected that Lesotho
would tap into the considerable tourism flows already available on the other side of the frontier.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators
The primary GEF objective was to conserve this globally significant biodiversity of the Maloti-
Drakensberg Mountains. The secondary objective of the project was to contribute to community
development through income generation from nature-based tourism.
The five key outcomes were:
    a) Globally significant biodiversity maintained and enhanced through protection for key
       habitats and indicator species.
    b) Expanded protected areas system in place with adequate buffer zones and community
       involvement.
    c) Sehlabathebe National Park in Lesotho formally established and conservation
       management and development plan agreed and under implementation;
    d) Community initiatives in nature-based conservation financially viable and benefit
       transfers working; and
    e) Joint declaration by the Government of Lesotho and South Africa of a transfrontier
       conservation area incorporating Sehlabathebe National Park, the uKhahlamba-
       Drakensberg Park, and additional areas as appropriate.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification.
The original objectives and indicators remained valid throughout the project and were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The project was designed to target local communities as major beneficiaries (primary
beneficiaries). Benefit transfer schemes were designed, so that a part of the increased tourism
revenue would flow to surrounding communities. Nature-based tourism development was
intended to benefit those directly employed in a diverse service industry as guides, hotel and
restaurant employees, drivers, tourism agents, makers and vendors of crafts and so on, and those
indirectly engaged in supplying the tourism industry with its goods and equipment. The
conservation of globally significant biodiversity was expected to benefit everyone concerned with
the preservation of the natural heritage, in line with GEF objectives (secondary beneficiaries).
These would include international and national visitors coming to the conserved areas to enjoy
recreational and aesthetic use-values, while non-users would derive option and existence value
from their conservation. It was also expected that the project would generate insights into
successful models of community-based biodiversity conservation, which could be replicated in
other NRM projects, and hence benefit other target communities. In addition, land use in the
project intervention areas was to be enhanced through an adapted Range Management Area
(RMA) approach that was expected to increase local productivity on rangelands in defined areas
of high biodiversity value.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1 ­ Project Management and Transfrontier Cooperation: The component's objective
was to establish strong bilateral coordination mechanisms to support the ecosystem management
approach in the Maloti-Drakensberg area. A bilateral Steering Committee had been established
for this purpose. A bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was intended to define the
parameters of cooperation. The project planned to provide funding for: (i) a bilateral collaboration
forum; (ii) national Project Coordination Committees (PCCs); (iii) coordination offices in the
Republic of South Africa (RSA) and Lesotho with full-time coordination, financial management


                                                -2-
and procurement staff (PCUs); (iv) Financial Management Committees (FMCs) attached to these
Units; (v) joint technical working groups to develop and implement action plans to focus on
topics and issues of common interest; (vi) joint workshops to present results and achieve
consensus work plans; (vii) communication linkages, including a GIS-based Knowledge
Management system served by trained staff; and (viii) joint management activities related to fire
protection, rescue service, staff training and nature-based tourism such as marketing, booking and
visitor planning.

Component 2 ­ Conservation Planning: The component's objective was to build capacity for
transfrontier conservation and development and allow for adequate planning, zoning, protection
and management. A vision and strategy were to be prepared following stakeholder consultation
and with the involvement of the relevant authorities on both sides of the border. Conceptual
proposals for compatible land-use zoning derived in the preparatory phase needed to be
negotiated and action plans needed to be prepared for implementation. This implied conservation
planning at the landscape level, and was designed to be facilitated by appropriate professionals,
and with the full involvement of the staff of the respective ministries and departments in both
countries. It was intended to harmonize the approaches and activities of the major nature
conservation management agencies and to establish a professional support team for biodiversity
conservation maintaining effectiveness beyond the project lifetime, including the continuation of
employment of specialist staff.

Component 3 ­ Protected Area Planning: The component's objective was to prepare detailed
plans for existing protected areas and proposed conservation areas. Planning was to be carried out
in phases, beginning with the overall development and zoning plans for each area, then preparing
detailed management programs and finally addressing business planning and sustainability.

Component 4 ­ Conservation Management in existing Protected Areas:
The component's objective was to develop strategies to intervene and address continuing threats
and residual impacts to protected areas (alien plant infestation, soil erosion, inappropriate fire
management regimes, inadequate security, over-grazing, poor waste management and poor
management of cultural resources). The component focused on the Sehlabathebe National Park
(SNP) and included the construction of a new office building, a new nature interpretation facility,
a dormitory for school groups, upgrading of skills among its staff, the employment of a resident
ecologist, improvement of administrative, communication and power facilities, implementation of
a fire management program, upgrading of fencing, rehabilitation and maintenance of management
roads, paths and tracks and acquiring necessary vehicles for park management.

Component 5 ­ Conservation Management outside of Protected Areas: The component's
objective was to improve conservation of natural resources on communal lands and promote
sustainable use for range management areas. The project aimed to facilitate the establishment of
Managed Resource Areas (MRAs) building on an earlier governmental program on range
management.

Component 6 ­ Community Involvement: The component's objective was to enhance community
involvement in the other components of the project by promoting stakeholder collaboration,
ownership and responsibility for decisions and activities related to the project. The component
was to build on the experience with community conservation programs in KwaZulu-Natal.

Component 7 ­ Nature-based Tourism: The component's objective was to promote local
economic development through ecotourism to assure increased commitment to conservation. This



                                               -3-
was to be achieved through empowerment, development of tourism attractions and products, and
marketing and investment strategies.

Component 8 ­ Institutional Development: The component's objective was to assure
sustainability of other results by providing for an adequate institutional structure to inherit and
maintain them.

1.6 Revised Components
Project components remained unchanged during implementation. However, as a result of
experiences with the implementation of component 3 and 4 the implementing agency merged
both components into a joint Protected Area Planning and Management component. The large
number of eight components made implementation of this Project very complex to implement,
however, a simplification was never formalized.

1.7 Other significant changes
The design, scope, and implementation arrangements remained largely unchanged. The Project
was affected by delays and cost changes. The Project was approved by the Bank Board in
September 2001 and became effective only in February 26, 2003 mainly due to a number of
effectiveness conditions, which could not be met in time. Weaknesses in managing procurement
activities added delays during implementation and the project's closing date needed to be
extended twice from December 31, 2007 to Dec. 31, 2008 and finally to Dec. 31, 2009. Unclear
design and inappropriate cost estimates resulted in significant reallocation of project funds
between components. The construction of the SNP environment centre was delayed and more
costly than expected. The Government bridged the financing gap.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The project identification coincided with an intensive phase of collaborative efforts between
Lesotho and the RSA in the highlands water sector, and the designers captured this unique
window of opportunity to extend this cooperation into the joint nature and biodiversity
conservation efforts for the globally important Maloti-Drakensberg transfrontier region. This
project was complementary and supportive to this on-going political environment. At the same
time the Bank's rural portfolio was increasingly being driven by interests in community
participation, and so this interest significantly contributed to the concepts underlying participatory
protected area management planning and involvement of local communities. The strategy was to
achieve conservation through the recognition that biodiversity has a direct value and its
conservation can only be achieved, when local communities participate and benefit from some of
the generated value (e.g. thorough eco-tourism). The designers successfully captured these
developments in an innovative project concept.

At the preparation stage the project had been planned and designed as one single project to be
jointly implemented by Lesotho and the RSA. A realistic assessment of policy and institutional
aspects resulted in a decision to separate the implementation into two individual projects to be
implemented in parallel. In hindsight this turned out to be an important decision with far-reaching
positive implications for national ownership. The differences in size and level of development
would have otherwise posed major implementation challenges. Continuing with one project
would likely have resulted in Lesotho feeling dominated by its stronger neighbor. However, when
the decision was made, the designers failed to adjust the project documentation accordingly
resulting in significant inconsistencies in the design documents and confusion during


                                                 -4-
implementation. For example the project costs and list of activities presented in the appraisal
document combine both projects and the log-frame shows the combined figures rather than by
country. The grant agreement was similarly affected by some false assumptions, since it was
based on the same combined log-fame for both countries.

The large number of components created significant complexity. Many project activities could
not be logically assigned to specific components. Cost tables with clearly specified and costed
activities under each component were not made available to the implementers. The preparation of
a practical Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was delayed and the PIP finally produced was of
limited help to the implementers.

Lessons from other projects were referenced in the PAD, but were not always fully integrated in
the design. For example, the ICR for the Lesotho Land Management and Conservation Project,
which was closed ahead of schedule due to implementation problems, called for a `need for
careful and detailed preparation', `a long-term time horizon' and encouraged early restructuring if
implementation problems occur. The above mentioned shortcomings in the design for this Project
and overly high expectations related to some of the project outcomes indicate that these lessons
were not fully integrated.

Due to these design shortcomings the quality at entry is rated as moderately unsatisfactory despite
the appropriate judgment of the favorable political environment at identification stage and the
conceptual innovation, which helped to overcome some design shortfalls.

2.2 Implementation
Several important project preparation and design tasks were made effectiveness conditions or
were pushed into the early implementation stage including the preparation of a detailed PIP, a
final agreement on a log-frame, the preparation of an M&E framework, and the establishment of
a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). While leaving some design tasks unfinished is not uncommon
in Bank lending, this project was clearly not ready for implementation, which proved risky due to
the limited local capacity and lack of funding available to finish preparation activities. With no
PCU in place at the time of project appraisal, the responsible parties to carry out these tasks were
not identified. A delay of 1.5 years between Board approval and project effectiveness was
therefore not surprising. During early implementation, significant efforts were made to revise
project indicators and targets and the log-frame. However, no final agreement was reached. A
mid-term review carried out in 2005 largely ignored these discussions and restructuring which
would have benefited the project was not carried out.

Some of these shortcomings were compensated by the flexibility and determination of the PCU
team, which tried to find its own way to set priorities and respond to the perceived needs of the
project. A positive political environment, strong local ownership and conviction to do the right
thing at the right time were success factors during this stage of project implementation. At the
later stage however the PCU capacity was significantly reduced with key staff leaving due to the
growing uncertainty about transitional arrangements. This severely affected staff moral and
motivation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The Project was approved prior to the Bank's introduction of the Results Framework format. The
log-frame of the Project failed to provide a concise design tool with clearly defined outcomes,
indicators and measurable targets, which could have, in combination with an effective monitoring
and evaluation system, supported management decisions. The project design did not include a
M&E plan. The PAD stated that Component 1 (Project Management and Transfrontier


                                                -5-
Cooperation) would address M&E through a six-monthly review of results. A short section on
M&E in the PIP referred to five key development impact indicators pointing out that "a major
task of the initiation phase will be the formalization of the logical framework of the project,
including all activities and the measurable indicators of performance". Following the mid-term
review (MTR) a revised Results Framework was produced, showing revised targets. These
revisions were never formally translated into a formal restructuring process.

The Key Indicators outlined at appraisal were in many respects highly ambitious (not atypical for
GEF operations at the time). No baselines were identified at appraisal, and indeed, the capacity to
prepare these baselines was largely non-existent and eventually became part of the protected area
management plans. Several of the Key Indicators were extremely difficult to measure in the first
place, and required systematic data collection. For example, it was highly unlikely that changes in
maintaining endemic species or viable populations of threatened species (meaning changes in
species endemism and size of populations of species) were to be evident over the relatively short
life of the project, and the suggestion that these should be Key Indicators was entirely unrealistic.
A significant innovation in performance monitoring was introduced during implementation. The
so-called Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) was originally
designed by the Bank to meet GEF's own concerns about performance monitoring. The METT
was designed to assess performance at the site-level against six criteria for protected area
management effectiveness identified by the World Commission on Protected Areas. The results
from the METT at three reference sites are summarized in Annex 9. It continues to be used as a
self-assessment tool. Baselines have been established at all the replication sites.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
The project designers took a cautious approach by triggering a wide range of safeguard policies,
and the project was classified as Category B. However, as the nature of the Project was to
enhance environmental quality and protect natural habitats and cultural heritage in the project
area, the entire project was expected to have supportive and significant positive effect in all of
these areas. In addition the full participation of local communities and specific benefit transfer
mechanisms was a crucial design element and was based on community consultations and a social
assessment. OP 4.36 (Forestry) and OP 4.09 (Pest Management) were triggered due to the
project's activities related to the clearing of invasive species in some areas. No herbicides but
manual weeding/clearing techniques were used in the project and the invasive species clearance
did not involve logging of forests.

Overall fiduciary compliance was appropriate and no fraudulent or corruption cases have been
reported. Procurement under the project was compliant with relevant World Bank procurement
procedures. Financial management was affected by delays in the consolidation of accounts. The
required financial reports were not produced. This has affected management decisions and fund
management throughout project implementation up to the closing the project accounts.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Through a bilateral MoU, the Governments of Lesotho and South Africa are committed to
continue conservation and development operations in the Maloti-Drakensberg region through
implementation of a 20-year transfrontier conservation and development strategy developed
under Component 2 of the MDTP. The Lesotho Government committed to the establishment of a
permanent Secretariat. Unfortunately the process of transferring the responsibility for post-
completion operations to a permanent Secretariat has not been fully achieved at the time of this
ICR. The Parks Division of the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Culture (MTEC) is
proposed to take over this responsibility, but the appropriate staffing and funding is not yet in
place. This puts the sustainability of MDTP achievements and implementation of the 20-year


                                                -6-
strategy in jeopardy. However, the South African agencies are ready to play an active role and
expressed their commitment to ensure that the coordination mechanisms in Lesotho are
maintained at appropriate levels at all times.

There are no satisfactory operation arrangements in place for the facilities constructed by the
project in the SNP. The visitors' arrival centre, constructed in 2007, remains unused. There is no
clear decision on how the new Environmental Centre, which was ready for hand over to
Government on February 10, 2010, will be operated. Attempts to find a private concessionaire
were not yet successful, partially due to the financial crisis causing a significant downturn in
tourism in the region. At the time of the ICR the Government was looking for an interim
arrangement taking responsibility for the operation of the Centre. MTEC has named a number of
people to guard the environmental centre but failed to prepare adequate plans, staffing and a
budget to operate the Centre. However, support is provided by the World Bank-funded Private
Sector Competitiveness Project, which supports a Concessions Task Team that is committed to
expediting a new round of advertisements and negotiations aimed at contracting an operator to
manage the Centre on behalf of Government.

The project has provided support to a number of nature-based tourism enterprises that it has
helped rural people to establish. The prospects of further meaningful support following project
termination are poor. Major reasons for the under-performance of nature-based tourism in the
project area are: (i) poor planning and selection of the locations, which were not always
strategically placed close to tourist routes, but according to political preferences; (ii) a lack of
integration of these activities with other project components; and (iii) poor marketing of these
tourist products. This is a long-standing national problem. There is no evidence that tourist
products in the MDTP area or elsewhere in Lesotho will be adequately marketed in the near
future.

Successful longer-term implementation of the approaches promoted by the project depends on an
appropriate legal framework. The new Environment Act is a significant improvement in this
regard and was produced with support from the project. Preparation of the Nature Conservation
Bill was another important project contribution, although this legislation is yet to be enacted.

There are stronger prospects of sustainability for the community-based natural resource
management approaches that the project has helped to develop. The Government remains
committed to the management of rangelands and other natural resources by user groups, and the
Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation (MFLR) can be expected to continue promoting
Grazing Associations and supporting those that operate in MDTP areas. However, the more
ambitious concept of Managed Resource Committees (MRCs) as umbrella user bodies managing
resources on behalf of Community Councils and/or Principal Chiefs has not been wholeheartedly
adopted, and the process of enshrining such arrangements in Community Council by-laws is yet
incomplete. Without further external support, the MRC concept and its intended legal framework
are likely to lapse at national policy level, although the three MRCs that the project helped to
establish may continue to operate, with an emphasis on the range management function that
Government will continue to support through Grazing Associations. Some external support will
be provided by the four-year GEF-funded Sustainable Land Management Project that was
recently approved and is likely to start operations in early 2010. Partly with the assistance of this
new project, the MFLR can be expected to continue developing policy and legal arrangements for
enhanced range management by resource users and their local government authorities.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project has made a substantial contribution to biodiversity protection in Lesotho and has
helped to raise public awareness and understanding of the importance of biodiversity
conservation as well as improved national and bilateral institutional capacity and cooperation in
Lesotho and the RSA. The project's global objectives, design components and implementation
activities remain fully consistent with Lesotho's national conservation and management priorities
and reflect strategic objectives and activities identified in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) at the time of preparation. They remain highly relevant to the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) priorities currently under preparation in relation to environment and natural resource
management, and to increasing the quality and effectiveness of public services.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
To understand the significant outcomes and contribution of this project it is important to keep in
mind that Lesotho ranks among 30 of the world's poorest countries and, when this project started,
biodiversity and natural resources conservation were not of particular concern to local people and
their awareness of the significance and value including the economic value of their natural
resources was negligible. The project has made a major contribution in changing this situation.
Natural resources and biodiversity conservation have become important items on the country's
development agenda. Through this project the value of conservation and its potential for tourism
and local livelihoods is well recognized both for formally protected areas as well as for outside
areas through improved management of grassland areas. These areas form the basis for local
livestock raising and the country's wealth in terms of water resources constituting two of the
country's major sources of national income with tourism potentially becoming a third pillar.

The cooperation between Lesotho and RSA is well established and when the project completed
implementation, bilateral cooperation between both countries was in place as evidenced through
signing of the revised bilateral MoU and regular meetings by the Bilateral Steering Committee,
the Security Working Group and the Joint Management Committee of the joint uKhahlamba
Drakensberg and Sehlabathebe National Park. A bilateral security strategy was implemented to
address cross border crimes. The strategy will continue to be implemented by a security working
group consisting of members of security forces and conservation agencies from both countries.

Implementation of an overarching 20-year conservation and development strategy linked to
national and SADC policies developed during the lifetime of the project has started (2008 ­
2028). The strategy will be implemented through 5-year action plans. Following a biodiversity
based sensitivity analysis completed in 2006, the project area has been increased to cover 24,306
km2 (planning domain) with zoning into eight biodiversity implementation areas and a
biodiversity and cultural heritage conservation guiding mechanism put in place. Biodiversity and
cultural heritage assessments, with development of the accompanying conservation strategies
provide important guidance in securing the natural and cultural heritage of the Maloti
Drakensberg area.

When the project began implementation in 2003, there were three IUCN category II protected
areas in Lesotho; Sehlabathebe National Park (SNP), Tsehlanyane National Park (TNP), and
Bokong Nature Reserve (BNR). Of the three protected areas, only SNP was already gazetted. By
now a system of protected areas covering 134,815 hectares, of which 14,299 hectares fall under
the IUCN category II, is in place. All of these areas have appropriate management plans with
implementation of priority actions initiated. However, a decreasing budget and human resource



                                                -8-
allocation has put serious constraints on the management of all PAs in the country leading to a
reduction in management effectiveness and overshadowing the project success. For SNP, which is
the main PA under the project, this trend could be largely avoided, while other PAs clearly suffer
from this situation. The results from the PA METT carried out in 2005 and repeated in 2009
reflect this situation with scores for TNP and BNR decreasing by about 12%, while SNP
remained at about the same level as in 2005.

The preparation of a joint management plan and declaration of a transfrontier park between
uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site (UDP-WS) and Sehlabathebe National Park
(SNP) is a major achievement under the Project. The transfrontier park is run by a Joint
Management Committee (JMC) that meets quarterly with membership from the Lesotho Ministry
of Tourism Environment and Culture and the South African Ezemvelo Kwazulu Natal Wild Life
(EKZNW).

MDTP has facilitated ratification of the UNESCO 1972 Convention on World Cultural Heritage,
which has led to the preparation of a nomination dossier for SNP to be on the World Heritage list
as part of the UDP-WS. A draft nomination file was being finalized for submission to the
UNESCO World Heritage Office in January 2010.

Conservation management has significantly benefited by the development and implementation of
best practice guidelines for fire and grazing management. A joint vulture management plan is in
place with an ongoing monitoring program undertaken by a task force for vulture conservation
chaired by EKZNW. This group monitors threats to bearded and Cape vultures in the MDTP area.

Improved collaboration to market the bioregion as a viable tourism destination has been set in
motion though the development of a bilateral tourism strategy, publication of the Maloti
Drakensberg Route and Experience book, and completion of a SADC transfrontier conservation
areas expedition highlighting salient features of the Maloti Drakensberg Transfrontier
Conservation Area. Local groups have been equipped and trained to provide tourism services.
While it is difficult to fully assess the impact of this project on tourism development with no data
collected in this regard, it must be assumed at the time of the ICR preparation the Project has not
yet met its high appraisal expectations in terms of direct income transfers to local communities.

3.3 Efficiency
Not applicable. The Project was a stand-alone GEF project with a GEF grant and counterpart
funding from Government of Lesotho. At the time the Project was designed neither financial nor
economic analyses were prepared. No standard cost benefit or cost effectiveness parameters were
calculated, and would be extremely difficult to calculate ex-post. However, while the project
accounting provides only limited information on the actual investment under each component, it
seems clear that the management costs have been significant, likely absorbing more than 20% of
the investment costs. This high proportion of management costs is not uncommon for such
projects in the region where staff salaries are high, and the two extensions have contributed to the
significant management overhead costs of the project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Project has largely achieved its development objectives and succeeded to put in place a
system of protection and management of the globally significant biodiversity of the Maloti-
Drakensberg Mountains. At project completion, however, one of the five expected outcomes has
not yet been attained as the Project has not yet achieved significant income generation for local
communities. In addition problems remain with sustainability of the outcomes and the future


                                                -9-
operation and management of the parks and some of the facilities put in place under the Project.
Considering the low starting point the overall project implementation is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The Project was not designed as a targeted poverty alleviation project. However, one of the
design elements of the Project was to enable local communities to benefit from income generation
activities around nature protection through the development of eco-tourism and through
engagement in protection and conservation activities. The Project has prepared the ground for
such income generation. However, except from direct employment in the implementation of
project activities very little long-term income generation is yet to materialize. The tourism and
conservation activities are at an early stage, but the concepts, plans, processes and institutions that
the Project has built would be well suited to achieving significant poverty alleviation in the
future, provided that continued efforts and funding stay in place, which is uncertain at this
moment.

From a gender perspective, project operations have mirrored national conditions in Lesotho,
which is currently ranked tenth in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index of
economic participation and opportunity. Women have been prominent in community resource
management and income-generating institutions and activities supported by the Project, and have
a significant voice in local decision-making ­ although range management remains a largely male
preserve.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The Project has had a significant impact on transfrontier institutional development for
biodiversity conservation, strengthening linkages and cooperation between environmental and
security agencies in Lesotho and South Africa. Although modes of collaboration are likely to
evolve and may be less intensive following project termination, these benefits are likely to be
sustained. This is one of the Project's most important achievements.

At local level, project operations have mirrored established Lesotho traditions of community-
based organizational development and resource governance. Within this framework, the Project's
introduction of the MRC concept was a significant institutional innovation. User groups in the
form of Grazing Associations, which are working with the local authorities having formal
responsibility for natural resource management, have been Government policy since the early
1980s. The MRC concept expands on this by uniting a broader range of user groups (such as
handicraft makers and traditional doctors who use medicinal plants) in an umbrella body that was
intended to manage all natural resources on behalf of the legally empowered local authorities ­
Principal Chiefs in the high mountain grazing areas, and Community Councils elsewhere. With
project support, three such MRCs were established and made promising progress, which has been
continued since project field staff was withdrawn from all but one area. However, the MRC
concept has not been fully accepted at national policy level, where the emphasis remains on
forming Grazing Associations in Range Management Areas. While the existing MRCs may
continue to operate in their local areas, the concept may not be replicated by Government
elsewhere.

Although the Project did not achieve major institutional innovation at the national policy level
with regard to community-based natural resource management, there were positive local
outcomes in the development and operation of various resource management and income
generation groups. Good progress was also made with the concept of Community Conservation


                                                - 10 -
Forums, which predates the Project but which it helped to develop further. The further operation
of these forums will depend on MTEC's commitment and ability to work with them in their
respective protected areas. However, the Project certainly succeeded in raising the awareness and
commitment of local institutions and resource users with regard to biodiversity conservation. Its
strong and competent presence in the field in its three main districts of operation was an
inspiration to government staff and to rural people, who genuinely felt that the Project was there
to work with them and help them.

The sustainability of all these local level outcomes is not assured without ongoing social
facilitation and technical support, which Government is not fully equipped to provide. Lesotho's
experience over the last three decades has been that, although these community-based natural
resource management concepts and institutions are viable, they are often challenged by local
disputes that require external mediation and advisory support. The Range Management Division
of MFLR is aware of this need and has created additional posts to help meet its vision of national
coverage by Range Management Areas and Grazing Associations (although it has not yet been
able to fill them all). The Project has helped strengthen these institutional concepts and
developments, but further external support will be needed to extend their coverage and assure
their sustainability.

In collaboration with GTZ, the Project supported the preparation by the Ministry of Local
Government and Chieftainship (MOLGC) of a system of integrated community and district
planning for Lesotho. The direct outcomes of that effort, undertaken in 2005, are hard to discern.
Four further years of analysis, pilot programs and debate in MOLGC have not yet achieved a
broadly understood, effectively operated or adequately resourced system of decentralized
development planning. MOLGC is now understood to have retreated from the whole concept of a
stronger planning and capital budgeting system for local authorities. The more direct opportunity
in future will be to work sectorally with Community Councils, linking their plans and priorities
directly to line Ministries' and related donors' capital budgets. The Project continued efforts to
link the emerging MRA/MRC concepts into Community Council structures and procedures, but
the erratic and uncertain development of the latter have precluded clearly sustainable results.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
A number of initiatives have been taken by the project implementers, which were supportive to
the Project but not fully anticipated in the project design. Most importantly the MDTP has
facilitated ratification of the UNESCO 1972 Convention on World Cultural Heritage, which has
led to the preparation of a nomination dossier for SNP to be on World Heritage list. A draft
nomination file was being finalized for submission to UNESCO World Heritage Office in
January 2010. In general the project implementers have given additional emphasis to the
protection of cultural heritage with the recognition that nature and biodiversity conservation in
Lesotho has close linkages with the nation's cultural heritage. Thus these initiatives have not only
generated additional positive outcomes for cultural heritage protection, but have also been
mutually supportive to the environmental objective of the Project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No formal workshops were convened in conjunction with the preparation of this ICR. During the
course of the Project, many stakeholder workshops were supported on a wide range of topics
from discussions on resource management, legislation to zoning of particular conservation areas.
A wide range of stakeholders, from national and local government staff to tourism based
businesses and local communities benefitted from the project. Meetings with stakeholder groups
during the ICR assessment work revealed a high level of community awareness with very active
local groups and associations confirming the importance of the Project for these groups.


                                               - 11 -
However, it also became clear that much of the expected income generation has yet to
materialize.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: substantial.
For this GEF project, the Risk to Development Outcome is assessed in terms of the global
objectives, which comprise biodiversity, institutional and income benefits. The assessment is
based on the following standard criteria:

   ·   Technical: negligible to low. Proven technical conservation and natural resource
       management interventions have been designed under the project.
   ·   Financial: high. The financial viability of nature-based tourism enterprises that the
       Project has promoted remains highly uncertain, due in part to inadequate marketing to
       date (and poor prospects of improvement in this regard). Financial flows through
       Government to the nature conservation and nature-based tourism sectors are not robust.
   ·   Economic: low. The economic benefits from conservation are well documented and
       particularly high for the project areas providing significant downstream environmental
       benefits.
   ·   Social: moderate. Community-based resource management institutions and income
       generating organizations have an established history in Lesotho, but that history is
       punctuated by social strife and consequent institutional dysfunction. Ongoing facilitation
       and support are necessary, but not adequately available. Support from the GEF-funded
       Sustainable Land Management (SLM) project over the next four years will help to build
       capacity and procedures for this purpose.
   ·   Government ownership/commitment: substantial. Recent Government actions with
       regard to the Project's exit strategy and implementation of the 20-year strategy were
       significantly delayed and not strong enough indicating a dilution of the commitment that
       was earlier expressed. Government currently faces severe budgetary constraints, but
       should give priority to earlier commitments to the South African government and the
       World Bank.
   ·   Other stakeholder ownership: moderate. The Project has not achieved any significant
       ownership by the private sector. There is real commitment by some elements at
       community level, but its sustainability is not guaranteed in the absence of ongoing
       facilitation and support.
   ·   Institutional support: substantial. The viability and sustainability of institutional
       arrangements to promote nature conservation and effective natural resource management
       through national and local government structures remain uncertain.
   ·   Governance: substantial. Current deterioration in governance at national and local levels
       in Lesotho is translated into weakening performance of state and community-based
       natural resource conservation and management institutions. The Project has had only
       local success in reversing these trends, and the durability of these improvements is not
       assured.
   ·   Natural disasters exposure: negligible to low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory



                                             - 12 -
While the relevance and political environment for the Project was well recognized and the
concept of the Project was innovative, there were shortcomings in the preparation, design and
appraisal of the Project as described in Section 2.1. These relate to the deficiency of the logical
framework, a complex component structure without clear linkages between component outcomes
and overall project objectives, a lack of appropriate project cost estimates, and inconsistencies in
the design documents; -- all of this made project implementation challenging and caused delays
throughout the Project. No quality at entry evaluation is recorded.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory
Bank staff provided regular (generally twice per year) supervision inputs during project
implementation. Findings and recommendations are documented in detailed aide memoires
available for all years, with the exception of 2007, where there seemed to have been a gap in
supervision. The supervision support appears mixed reflecting several changes in task team
leadership over time. Project implementation shortcomings were identified during the supervision
process; however, many recommendations remained general and were not followed-up
consistently enough to resolve issues in a timely manner. The missions were relatively short
(ranging from a few days to a week). This allowed only limited field work and problems
identified during missions were often not fully solved. Particularly at the beginning and main
implementation phase of the project a more intensive supervision process could have helped keep
the Project focused and moving. At the critical investment phase restructuring was dragged on
unnecessarily and finally not done and a quicker responsiveness might have avoided some of the
delays related to key investments such as the environmental centre at SNP. The Bank recognized
these issues and significantly improved supervision support during the project extension phases
providing timely responses and practical solutions not only through formal supervision missions,
but also through regular communication with the PCU in between missions.

Fiduciary aspects of the Project were supervised partly in conjunction with routine supervision
missions and partly by regional procurement and financial management staff conducting separate
visits to the country. Fiduciary issues were identified, but not followed up satisfactorily, e.g. the
lack of regular FM reports or annual procurement plans. More hands on procurement and
financial management training particularly at the early phase of the project could have avoided
implementation delays. Social and environmental safeguarding aspects were handled by the task
team leaders with recommendations reflected in various aide memoires. There are no indications
of social safeguard issues under the project, but the task teams have taken a lightweight approach
and little documentation is available on the monitoring of social safeguarding issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory
Overall Bank performance overall is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory due to the described
weaknesses in project design and supervision. However, these shortcomings did not significantly
affect implementation to the extent that the project objective could not be achieved, but likely
opportunities were missed to work more proactively on evolving conservation strategies and to
more timely implement project activities with a higher likelihood of sustainability. During the
extension phase the Bank team worked more proactively with the Government and the PCU to
focus the Project on completing a number of key activities and on the consolidation of key
outcomes. At that stage a strong and responsive relationship with the PCU was re-established,
which strengthened project implementation. Unfortunately implementation of some key
investments finished too late to provide adequate time for further project guidance on operative
procedures (e.g. the SNP environmental center or the income generating activities of
communities).


                                               - 13 -
5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory
By launching this project the Government of Lesotho has given high attention to the bilateral
biodiversity conservation agenda between South Africa and Lesotho resulting in a first and
subsequently renewed MoU between both countries and the agreement on a 20-year conservation
and development strategy. MTEC provided the support for the PCU to adequately manage the
Project and it provided the political environment for the national and bilateral conservation
agenda. The Government was ready to grant additional funding bridging the financing gap caused
by cost increases for the construction of the SNP environmental centre. However, considering the
apparent difficulties to provide an operational budget for the center, a smaller construction, as
recommended in the business plan, might have been a better choice. Unfortunately and despite
repeated emphasis from the Bank side, the Government felt short in taking timely action with
respect to the transitional arrangements setting up a functioning secretariat during the last year of
project implementation as was agreed in conjunction with the project extension. The abrupt
dissolving of the PCU disrupted a smooth transition and the failure to timely put an appropriate
operational arrangement for the environmental centre in place threatens the value of the project's
flagship investment. These late stage difficulties and the failure to secure adequate budgets and
human resources for the management of the SNP and the implementation of the 20-year
conservation and development strategy are putting severe implications on the sustainability of the
project achievements with Government performance to be rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: satisfactory
Overall the performance of the implementing agency was very commendable. Selecting a core
team of local staff backed up by international expertise the PCU developed the necessary
technical skills to successfully implement this complex Project. In fact, the PCU has compensated
for many shortcomings in the design by taking initiatives and working extremely hard to make
the Project's interventions relevant and timely, recognizing the need to bring Lesotho's
conservation agenda and protected area management standards up to international level. The PCU
was staffed with technically competent and dedicated professionals, who have established
excellent relationships with their South African partners and a broader community of
conservation practitioners, including international organizations.

Mainly lack of experience has caused some delays in procurement processes and problems in
financial management and project reporting. Solving financial management and accounting issues
was delayed, which led to an accumulation of issues towards the end of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory
The performance of the borrower is rated Moderately Satisfactory accounting for the
shortcomings in putting adequate and timely transitional and operational mechanisms and budgets
in place to provide more sustainability for the Project outcomes.

6. Lessons Learned
Some key lessons learned from the Project include:




                                               - 14 -
Transfrontier cooperation in biodiversity conservation can be achieved through parallel
implementation that takes into account the uniqueness of the countries involved, while
maintaining synergies for cross-learning and collaboration. Such a design allows sovereign
decision making and gives sufficient freedom to choose specific implementation speed and
processes, while generating the necessary level of national ownership. While the transfrontier
cooperation was fully accomplished with significant transfer of knowledge from the advanced
conservation and tourism experiences in South Africa, Lesotho was able to deliver on its own
achievements. This appears a particularly suitable model in the context of countries that differ in
size and development status.

Using the synergies in the overall development portfolio allows exploiting the full development
opportunities of a project. This project has benefited from the transfrontier collaboration agenda
between Lesotho and South Africa in the water transfer sector and extended this agenda to nature
conservation. Similarly the Project would mutually benefit from other projects and programs. It
has built the ground for private sector tourism development and in that area a linkage is desirable
and emerging with the World Bank-funded Private Sector Competitiveness Project. Further
mutual support could be envisaged in the area of resource management by the recently approved
GEF-funded Sustainable Land Management Project and the new World Bank IFAD agricultural
development project, which is currently under preparation.

Good project design and detailed preparation is necessary especially when local implementation
capacity is low. The design should be simple and should take into account local institutional and
human capacity. It is not advisable to expect major tasks to be completed between appraisal and
effectiveness (e.g. condition of effectiveness). Moreover, such gaps indicate lack of readiness of
the project.

A well prepared logical framework [results based monitoring framework] should be the backbone
of the project design and should be fully agreed prior to project implementation. Such framework
needs to clearly show the linkages between components and their outcomes with the overall
development objective.

Objectives, indicators and targets need to be realistic, helpful for management and take into
account the time-frame of project implementation. A baseline not only helps to measure success,
but also disciplines the designers to pay attention to realistic and measurable indicators.

Long-term operational arrangements of investments should be carefully assessed before prior to
entering into investments for buildings or infrastructure.

Restructuring of the project should be done as soon as a need arises.

Frequent changes in task management during project design and implementation can cause
serious disruption, when task managers are leaving without finishing important milestone tasks.
Examples under this project were the finalization and agreement on the logical framework at the
design stage, the completion of the restructuring of the Project at mid-term or finishing the
complex and time consuming design and procurement process of the environmental centre at the
later stage of the Project.

Changes in task management require particular management oversight.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The report highlights some issues that were faced during the early stage of the ICR preparation.
Subsequently, the Lesotho Government through the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and
Culture addressed the key concerns raised for the post completion phase of the project as follows:
(i) the Government is committed to the establishment of a permanent secretariat for the MDTP
and has assigned the Division of Nature Conservation to be the key counterpart and implementer
of the 20 year transfrontier strategy; (ii) the Government has committed M 16 million for 2010/11
for the management and operation of SNP and has strengthened the Parks Division by engaging
temporary staff to be located in SNP. In addition, the Government concurs that the community
income generation has not been achieved yet, however, is confident that a good foundation has
been laid that will assure that benefits be realized in the near future.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 ­ Project Management and Transfrontier Cooperation

The component's objective was to establish strong bilateral coordination mechanisms to support
the ecosystem management approach in the Maloti-Drakensberg area. Key outputs under this
component have been:
   ·   Signing of a Bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
   ·   Establishment of National Project Coordination Committees (PCCs).
   ·   Bilateral Steering Committee (BSC).
   ·   Joint security task force.
   ·   Joint bearded vulture protection group.
   ·   A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) with supporting units for financial management and
       procurement.

Rating: satisfactory.

In many regards the outcome of this component has exceeded appraisal expectations and has put
a well functioning transfrontier cooperative mechanism in place. A Bilateral Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) was signed on the 11th June 2001 and renewed and revised on December 1,
2008 to enhance cooperation between Lesotho and the Republic of South Africa. The MoU
committed an area of 15,000 km2 of which 6,000 km2 was in Lesotho and 9,000 km2 in RSA.
Following biodiversity assessments in 2006, the MDTP planning area was increased to cover
24,305.6km2 in Lesotho while 27,694.4km2 is in South Africa.
Subsequent to establishment of national Project Coordination Committees (PCCs) in 2003, a
Bilateral Steering Committee (BSC) was constituted. The former meets quarterly and when need
arises, while the latter follows a six monthly schedule of meetings. At closure, the BSC has had
14 meetings while the PCC has had 48. The transfrontier collaboration with South Africa took
place around the following issues: (i) development of a transfrontier conservation and
development strategy; (ii) development of the Sehlabathebe-uKhahlamba Drakensberg
Transfrontier Park as the prime transfrontier spatial initiative; (iii) development and
implementation of a transfrontier tourism strategy; (iv) development and implementation of a
joint security strategy; (v) addressing key threats to biodiversity and conservation such as fire and
safety in the project area; and (vi) supporting key species conservation programs such as the
bearded vulture program.
The joint security task force has become an important mechanism to address cross-border security
issues such as smuggling, cattle thefts or tourist protection. This task force consisting of members
of security forces and conservation agencies from both countries meets regularly or on special
demand and is a valuable mechanism for both sides to address security issues.
A Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) located in the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Culture
(MTEC) was established with high level project management and institutional arrangements in
place. Considerable emphasis was placed on establishing governance structures at district level
with 3 district offices put in place to support ground level implementation. Unfortunately, at the
later stage of the project the PCU apparently lost support from the ministry with several qualified
staff leaving the office. The district offices were then used by District Environmental Officers
(DEOs) from MTEC. These officers continued to serve as MDTP focal points and coordinated
program activities at district level. Key members of the PCU were retained to assist DEOs and
other program partners to implement outstanding Project activities. These included a Biodiversity

Planner, District and Community Councils Planner, Range Management Specialist, Protected
Areas Management Specialist and Community Participation Specialist.
A GIS unit was run by a GIS Specialist from 2003 to September 2007. The functions of this unit
were preparation of maps on request by other project sections, maintenance of the project website
and general information management for the project data. When the specialist left, the GIS
functions were managed with help from the Department of Environment Information Division
accept website maintenance for which the services of a private company were employed.
A MDTP Exit strategy for Phase I has been prepared and is outlined in the bilateral MoU. The
key elements of the strategy are: new institutional arrangements and coordination mechanism for
subsequent phases of the Project; and a 20 year conservation and development strategy out of
which 5 year action plans will be derived to facilitate the implementation of the strategy by
implementing partners. The bilateral MoU commits both countries to maintain a secretariat to
oversee implementation of the strategy. A shortcoming of this component however is that at the
time of the ICR no clear institutional mechanism such as a national secretariat had been
established with appropriate staff and funding to continue the transfrontier cooperative
mechanism. During project implementation this function had been carried out by the PCU, which
was not retained after project closure.

Component 2 ­ Conservation Planning

The component's objective was to build capacity for transfrontier conservation and development
and allow for adequate planning, zoning, protection and management. Key outputs have been:
   · Completion of a biodiversity survey (2006).
   · Identification of two new protected areas: one at Senqu Sources and one at Liqobong. The
     Senqu Sources Protected Area (SSPA) was delineated; the Liqobong Protected Area (LPA)
     was not. Due to resistance and disputes at Liqobong, it was decided not to proceed with
     development of that protected area during the current project period.
   · Production of a 20-year transfrontier conservation and development strategy (agreed by the
     two governments in 2006), supporting technical studies and a summary publication.
   · Development and agreement of a transfrontier security strategy for the project area.
   · Development of a cultural heritage strategy for Lesotho.
   · Production of a conservation plan for the Lesotho part of the Maloti-Drakensberg
     bioregion, including identification of eight Priority Biodiversity Areas and preparation of
     detailed conservation plans for five of these.
   · Partial preparation of a bioregional zoning plan for the Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier
     Conservation Area (MDTFCA).

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

The outputs specified for this component by the PAD were largely achieved in Lesotho. The PAD
envisaged that the Project "will supplement the resources of the nature conservation agencies to
eliminate the backlog of conservation planning, and ensure a sound foundation for further
planning and action". This has been achieved. A series of high quality plans were produced for
the bioregion. The development of cultural heritage strategy was an important step forward for
Lesotho. Negotiation and agreement of the international security strategy was a further significant
achievement.

A key outcome of the planning process was the expansion of the Project's thematic and spatial
coverage in Lesotho. As the MTR noted, the Project was "positioned to support a far wider
national sector reform of the protected area and natural resource management function in


                                               - 19 -
Lesotho". Spatially, the bioregional planning studies revealed, as the MTR stated, that "the
Lesotho part of the broader Maloti-Drakensberg bioregion extends much further from the South
African border than was recognized during project preparation. The bioregion within Lesotho has
been expanded substantially and now covers the entire highlands grassland area, which is about
two-thirds of the country." The MTR indicated that it had no objection to this expansion, which
was appropriate from a technical point of view but inevitably posed new challenges of
prioritization, coordination and implementation to the PCU.

Despite substantial achievements, there were moderate shortcomings in implementation of the
component.

Most of the planning work was done by consultants under contracts that lacked a strong capacity-
building element. This had two consequences. First, capacity to do such planning is not
significantly stronger in MTEC or other Lesotho institutions at the end of the Project than it was
at the beginning. Secondly, as was pointed out in section 6 above, the technical sophistication of
the planning processes and products renders them largely inaccessible to resource users and may
impede clear acceptance and action by government authorities. Resource user participation was
promoted during many of the planning processes, but the participatory biodiversity monitoring
system that the PAD anticipated has not been developed. Discussion of biodiversity status
assessment to support ICR preparation has again revolved around the availability of consultants.
The PAD (Annex 2) intended that the Project would support the ongoing process of establishing
and filling "posts for specialized [planning] functions". MTEC efforts to establish such posts have
been largely unsuccessful. The PAD envisaged "in some cases the continuation of employment of
specialist staff, for which provision is being made in future planning". It appears unlikely that
specialist staff employed by the PCU will continue in employment with MTEC.

There was good progress in the participatory identification and formalization of the SSPA, but a
parallel process at the LPA encountered problems that were largely beyond the Project's control.
There have been disputes over resource rights and management in the LPA area for many years,
and it is not surprising that lack of local consensus made it impossible for development of that
protected area to proceed.

It was unrealistic to expect, as the PAD logical framework appears to, that implementation of the
biodiversity conservation program could be accomplished in full during the Project's lifetime,
partly because of the number of months available and partly because to implement such a
program is infinitely more difficult than to design one. Local elements of the plans that were
developed have been implemented, but the overall implementation of the 20-year strategy for the
bioregion lies in the future. Capacity concerns in MTEC compromise confidence about this
implementation. The strongest current area of implementation is the security strategy. The two
governments are active in this regard, with good progress reported on the ground.

Component 3 & 4­ Protected Area Planning and Management

It was decided early in project implementation to merge these two components, as it seemed
artificial to separate them. Their objectives were (i) to prepare detailed plans for existing
protected areas and proposed conservation areas and (ii) to develop strategies to intervene and
address continuing threats and residual impacts to protected areas (alien plant infestation, soil
erosion, inappropriate fire management regimes, inadequate security, over-grazing, poor waste
management and poor management of cultural resources) with a particular focus on the SNP. Key
outputs have been:



                                              - 20 -
   · Strategic environmental assessment, zoning plan, official approval and management plan
     for the SSPA. However, Government currently lacks funds to staff or manage the area.
   · Preparation of a management plan for the SNP (an unwieldy 480 page version produced in
     2005 was revised into a more useable format).
   · Preparation and agreement of a joint management plan for the SNP and the uKhahlamba
     Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site.
   · Preparation of management plans for the Menkhoaneng and Botha-Bothe Plateau cultural
     heritage sites.
   · Initial preparation of a general business planning framework for protected areas in Lesotho.
   · Preparation of a business plan for the SNP.
   · Limited reintroduction of indigenous plant species into the SNP.
   · Initiation of some rehabilitation and development works proposed by the SNP management
     plan, including clearance of 10 ha of invasive plant species in and around the park and
     implementation of fire prevention measures. No fence rehabilitation has been achieved.
     Eight kilometers of road were rehabilitated in the park, along with 1 km of hiking trail.
     Five hiking trail bridges were built.
   · Implementation of priority conservation actions, notably fire prevention measures and
     invasive species removal, in the Bokong Nature Reserve, the Tsehlanyane National Park
     and the Menkhoaneng and Botha-Bothe Plateau cultural heritage sites.
   · Implementation of the transfrontier security strategy (see Component 2).
   · An ecological study of the Maloti minnow and other fish in the Tsoelikane river (SNP).
   · Construction of an arrival/visitor information centre and an Environmental Centre in the
     SNP.

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

The combined Components 3 and 4 focused on Lesotho's existing protected area (SNP) and on
the new ones that the Project helped to develop. They involved more detailed development,
management and business planning for these protected areas and the implementation of some of
the actions set out in those plans. This implementation involved a number of physical
interventions, such as fire control and the removal of alien vegetation; institutional actions, such
as efforts through community structures to prevent illegal grazing; and infrastructural
development. The latter included one of the Project's flagship activities: construction of a visitor
arrival/information centre in the SNP (in 2007) and of a 72-bed Environmental Centre in the park.
The Centre has been completed and was ready for handover to Government in December 2009,
but the operational arrangements remain unclear at the time of the ICR.

There were moderate shortcomings in achievement of the results intended for this component.
Much of the protected area planning was satisfactorily completed, although the initial
management plan for the SNP was an extreme example of excess technical detail and had to be
revised to a more useable format and length. The intended business planning for protected areas
could only be accomplished for the SNP. Implementation of that business plan has so far not
achieved the intention of the PAD (Annex 2) that "it will be necessary to fulfill promises that the
protected area will generate greater benefits than the former use of the rangeland for cattle
production".

Infrastructure development has been compromised by delays on the side of both the government
and the World Bank (whose issue of `no objection' statements for procurement took months
longer than necessary). The SNP Environmental Centre has been completed about two years
behind schedule and therefore could not deliver benefits during the project period and lacked


                                               - 21 -
further technical support and supervision by the project. As was noted in section 2.5 above, a
more serious concern is the ability of Government to operate the infrastructure that the Project
has (belatedly) delivered. The visitor arrival and information centre has stood unused for two
years and has begun to deteriorate, necessitating roofing repairs in October 2009. Original
intentions to attract a concessionaire who would operate the Environmental Centre as a
commercial venture have been unsuccessful. The business plan for the SNP did indicate that the
Centre would be unlikely to prove commercially viable. New arrangements are now being made
through the Concessions Task Team supported by the World Bank-funded Private Sector
Competitiveness project (which also arranged the earlier invitations to express interest) for a
revised approach to companies who could manage and operate the Centre on behalf of
Government. Any such contract would require a budgetary commitment that MTEC appears
unable to make at present. The Ministry has confirmed that it will put a skeleton team in place to
care for the Centre after it has been handed over by the contractor, but there is likely to be some
delay before the facility and the related visitor arrival/information buildings can begin to perform
their intended roles.

Auxiliary smaller infrastructural development is absent. There are no signs on roads in Qacha's
Nek district to show visitors where the SNP or other nature-based tourism facilities are, how long
it would take to reach them, or what attractions are available in these areas. This shortcoming is
symptomatic of a broader failing in implementation of nature-based tourism strategies for the
protected areas that the Project has supported. The various facilities and attractions are not being
marketed. It is therefore not surprising that they generate hardly any income for the intended
beneficiaries or the broader economy.

Implementation of Components 3 and 4 is therefore rated as moderately satisfactory. Although
the intended planning was largely accomplished to an appropriate standard, its value has been
compromised by incomplete and delayed implementation and sustainability cannot yet be
assured.

Component 5 ­ Conservation Management outside of Protected Areas

The component's objective was to improve conservation of natural resources on communal lands
and promote sustainable use for range management areas. The Project aimed to facilitate the
establishment of Managed Resource Areas (MRAs) building on existing Government range
management concepts and programs. Key outputs have been:
   · Establishment of three Managed Resource Areas, at Khomo-Phatsoa (Qacha's Nek
     district), Mokhotlong-Sanqebethu (Mokhotlong) and 'Moteng (Botha-Bothe).
   · Development of a management plan for each MRA.
   · Development of MRA by-laws, which were submitted to the Minister of Local
     Government and Chieftainship but not approved. A process to integrate the Project's draft
     by-laws with generic MOLGC by-laws for natural resource management by Community
     Councils has been started (for Khomo-Phatsoa only) and will not be completed before
     project termination.
   · Wetland management initiatives, including inventory, classification, erection of notice
     boards and collaboration with the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Ministry of
     Natural Resources on preparation of a comprehensive wetland restoration program.

Rating: moderately satisfactory.




                                               - 22 -
The Project's support for conservation management outside protected areas focused on the
Khomo-Phatsoa, Mokhotlong-Sanqebethu and 'Moteng MRAs in Qacha's Nek, Mokhotlong and
Botha-Bothe districts respectively. The activities actually included a major element of planning as
well as management. The institutional dimensions of MRA management are discussed in section
3.5(b) above and under Component 8 below.

As such, the component developed in a rather different direction than the PAD had envisaged.
The PAD (Annex 2) implied that conservation management outside protected areas would focus
on Community Conservation Forums' activities in the vicinity of parks and reserves, including
alien species control, enhanced operation of paths and tracks through conserved areas, sustainable
livestock management and cultural heritage activities. The Lesotho project's response was that a
broader effort would be needed to promote sustainable resource use across the highland region
overall, with three MRAs as the model of how this could be done ­ building on the existing RMA
approach of MFLR.

There were moderate shortcomings in the achievement of the intended results for this
component. Preparation of the MRA plans developed into an excessively technocratic exercise,
despite the Project's commendable emphasis on participatory planning with the affected resource
users and various Government agencies. The Project also engaged well with the MFLR Range
Management Division (RMD), whose technicians carried out much of the field survey of range
condition and assessment of appropriate grazing strategies. The MRA plan documents that were
ultimately produced consist mainly of technical background, including the range assessment
survey findings and a lengthy `operational framework' that unrealistically assigns tasks to a wide
range of government agencies. Only about 5% of the document is actually a resource
management plan, and that part focuses on rotational pasture management. (There is little direct
reference to enhanced animal productivity, although better pastures should normally be conducive
to it.) This kind of range management planning is familiar to local resource users and likely to be
adopted and implemented sustainably by them. A relatively simple core of the MRA plans is
therefore appropriate, helpful to resource users, and sustainable. The rest of the MRA planning
effort is not likely to have lasting value, as the many agencies assigned responsibilities by the
`operational framework' are not likely to pursue them systematically and overall MRA
implementation ­ beyond the core range management element ­ is not likely to be coordinated or
monitored. The RMD, meanwhile, will continue to promote the development, planning and
sustainable management of RMAs. This is an appropriate strategy that will be supported over the
coming four years by the recently approved, GEF-funded SLM project and could be further
developed in the medium term by the rural development and resource management
intervention(s) that the World Bank and IFAD have recently begun to formulate.

The Project worked commendably to develop the formal role of MRCs as natural resource
management agents of Community Councils, the local authorities with legal responsibility for this
function outside the high mountain grazing areas that are still controlled by Principal Chiefs. It
envisaged that, as provided by the Local Government Act, Community Councils with jurisdiction
over (parts of) MRAs could develop natural resource management by-laws in consultation with
MRCs. The by-laws would formally establish MRCs as Community Councils' agents in this
regard. Intensive participatory efforts produced draft by-laws in all three MRAs, and these were
submitted to the Minister of Local Government for approval as required by the Act. However,
they have not been approved. MOLGC has meanwhile been developing generic by-laws for
various local authority functions, including natural resource management. It will now be
necessary to reconcile the bottom-up MRA by-laws that the Project helped to develop with the
generic version. Over the last six months the Project has sponsored two workshops for this



                                               - 23 -
purpose, but a final integration by the end of 2009 is only likely for the Khomo-Phatsoa MRA
version.

It is of course premature to attempt an objective assessment of whether the preparation and
implementation of conservation management plans outside protected areas have enhanced natural
resource conditions or biodiversity status. Sustained effort would be needed over at least a decade
before any claims of biodiversity impact could be empirically demonstrated. However,
implementation of Component 5 is rated as moderately satisfactory. Key achievements were
further reinforcement of resource user institutions and roles in sustainable range management and
the broader understanding (but not formal policy or legal acceptance) that user groups should
manage natural resources on behalf of the legally mandated local authorities. Shortcomings were
the Project's ultimate inability to consolidate a sustainable, broader institutional approach to the
integrated management of all natural resources rather than grazing only; the excessively technical
and detailed approach to resource management plans; and the inability to give resource users'
management role formal legal status. However, the latter issue may not necessarily be a problem
for resource users and local authorities in the field. Local consensus and alliances may be a
perfectly adequate basis for resource users and local authorities to work together sustainably,
regardless of the official status of their arrangements.

Component 6 ­ Community Involvement

The component's objective was to enhance community involvement in the other components of
the Project by promoting stakeholder collaboration, ownership and responsibility for decisions
and activities related to the Project. Key outputs under this component have been:
   · Generation of environmental conservation and biodiversity awareness in communities and
     schools.
   · Three Community Conservation Nurseries.
   · The Mokhotlong Community Conservation and Development Trust (named Seinoli)

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

Extensive community awareness has been generated through the Project. All communities visited
by the ICR mission showed an in-depth understanding of the importance of the value of the
natural heritage in the project areas and a strong commitment to protect these assets. Audio visual
materials on key bio-diversity threats, natural heritage and tourism have been prepared for
schools. However the use of these materials leaves scope for improvement as it has not regularly
found its way into the curricula and is not being used in most schools.

Three community nurseries have been established under the Project - Matsatsaneng (Botha
Bothe), Mateanong (Mokhotlong) and Makhoareng (Qacha's Nek). A `starter pack' was provided
by the Project to assist the nursery operation in its beginning. Since the operation of the nurseries
started late, a short assessment on the operational situation was done and the findings were that
only Makhoareng nursery was operational while the other two are still struggling to get started.

A Community Conservation and Development Trust (named Seinoli) was created in Mokhotlong
with the objective to promote regeneration of the area through sustainable resource use and
conservation as well as support for eco-tourism. The trust with fourteen members from various
interest groups received training from the Project and has now been registered. To make this trust
fully operational additional follow-up and resources would be useful. Attempts were made by the
Project to link the trust with the UNDP GEF small grant scheme and help them to get trained in


                                               - 24 -
preparing proposals due to delays in release of fund by Lesotho government. However this has
not yet materialized.

While the direct outputs under this component remain moderate, it needs to be noted that
community involvement was crosscutting throughout all project components and the approaches
taken have been commendably and successfully practiced with community participation
throughout many project activities. The Project has spent significant efforts to successfully
involve communities in conservation planning, management and implementation. The indirect
impact of this approach is certainly far more valuable than its direct outputs.

Component 7 ­ Nature-based Tourism

The component's objective was to promote local economic development through ecotourism to
assure increased commitment to conservation. This was to be achieved through empowerment,
development of tourism attractions and products, and marketing and investment strategies. Key
outputs under this component have been:
   ·   An Assessment of Adventure Tourism Possibilities.
   ·   Development of Tourism Strategies.
   ·   Tourism plans for Sani Pass, Liphofung Cultural Heritage Site and SNP.
   ·   Guidelines for Tourism related concessions involving Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)
   ·   Community and private sector capacity building and training.
   ·   Assessment of Tourism Birding Routes.

Rating: moderately unsatisfactory.

A large number of activities have been carried out under this component and initiatives have been
taken most importantly in the following areas:
Adventure Tourism Possibilities: Under the Project an assessment of adventure tourism
possibilities in the three development nodes (Sani Top, Moteng and Sehlabathebe areas) was
carried out. This assessment was followed up by training on adventure tourism for key actors who
embarked on a trial run to promote adventure product and route they had developed during the
training. Participants in the training included representatives of nature tour guides, B&B owners,
a pony trekking committee, chiefs, community council and district tourism association. The
training involved lectures, visits to the attractions, and planning sessions. In addition a scoping
exercise for SNP resulted in the development of a hiking trail concept and provided the designs
for the community-based construction work of the trails.

Tourism Strategies: A National Strategic Framework for Tourism was finalized with MTEC
management and involvement of key stakeholders. The strategy addresses four major aspects for
improving tourism industry in the MDTFCA: (i) product development, infrastructure, human
resources and policies; (ii) investment; (iii) marketing; and (iv) management.

Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) Tourism Guidelines and Concessions: A National
Framework for Issuing Concessions in the Tourism Sector was developed and approved by
stakeholders. This is meant to promote private sector involvement and investment in the tourism
industry. The LTDC is piloting implementation of the framework. The PPPs guidelines were
developed to be used with the concessions framework to promote community, private and public
sector partnerships.

Community and private sector capacity building and training: Tour Guides and Tour Operators
involving 19 community members were trained in nature tour guiding and ecotourism; ten of
which also received birding guide training. The former were involved in a four weeks intensive
course by the Southern Africa Wildlife College; while the latter participated in a ten days of
training by Birdlife South Africa. The National University of Lesotho through its different
departments also provided nature based tour guiding training to all the guides equipping them
with knowledge on Lesotho flora and fauna, cultural and living heritage, history and religion,
Geology and Geomorphology, atmosphere, weather and climate, hydrology and wetlands, rock
art and paleontology. The University of Free State (Qwa Qwa RSA) trained 11 tour operators for
two weeks on areas of tour operation, organization of tours, business principles and marketing
products. Some 81 handicrafts producers were trained in handicrafts production by local
community experts in different areas such as pottery, weaving, and production of ornaments
using locally found materials. Subsequent to the training producers formed associations and
continue to produce regularly and display their produce at nature reserves like Liphofung while
others sell products to tourists and in the villages. Some people running accommodation
establishments were provided with skills in hospitality services. The training involved trainers
from the Tourism School in South Africa and included; food management, housekeeping,
customer care and cleanliness. A training evaluation report was produced following an evaluation
of the training provided. Additionally, five homesteads were trained in Thamathu in the SNP
tourism node. The homesteads are not yet realizing tangible benefits, but the LTDC has embarked
on their marketing through production of a brochure and website. A total number of 33 Police and
Immigration Officers from the ten districts were trained in tourism customer care and out of the
33, fourteen were further trained as trainers in order to provide similar training to their
counterparts. District Tourism Associations (DTAs) were established in the three districts and 17
members undertook a study tour in the RSA.

Tourism Birding Routes: Birdlife South Africa consultants were appointed to develop a birding
tourism feasibility study and development plan to facilitate birding tourism route in the project
area. The scope of services involved the feasibility study, development plan and the training of
birding guides. The report has been completed and 10 guides were involved in ten day training in
birding guiding and also provided with equipment for effective operation. The MDTP Birding
route marketing brochure was developed and a website link established to promote birding
tourism in the project area. Subsequent to this, meetings with LTDC and MTEC Department of
Tourism were held to discuss the implementation of the plan.

Tourism plans for Sani Pass, Liphofung Cultural Heritage Site and SNP: The Maloti adventure
triangle route concept plan to link Lesotho and South Africa which includes the above tourism
development nodes has been developed. This concept was approved by the BSC to serve as a
product for 2010 and its implementation is in progress. Development of the route from Underberg
to Mokhotlong has started on the South African side, and to help address the development of the
first section of the route from the Lesotho side, bilateral cooperation was used to apply for
funding to the value of M40 million from the African Renaissance Fund in South Africa. The
M40 million has been granted and preparations are underway to start working on the road.

While the outputs and initiatives taken under this component are impressive an assessment of the
extent to which these outputs have generated additional growth in the countries eco-tourism
business is difficult. No corresponding data have been collected. Random interviews with some
of the stakeholders revealed that the actual income, which has materialized from tourism
activities remained behind appraisal expectations. Most of the local communities are ready to
provide services; however they are not always well linked through a systematic promotion and
advertisement program.

Component 8 ­ Institutional Development
The objective of this component was to assure sustainability of other results by providing for an
adequate institutional structure to inherit and maintain them. Key outputs have been:
   · Establishment of Community Conservation Forums at the SSPA, the SNP, Menkhoaneng
     and the Botha-Bothe Plateau.
   · Work on legislation for the sector, resulting in a new Environment Act and a Nature
     Conservation Bill.
   · Managed Resource Committees for each of the three MRAs developed under Component
     5.
   · Early planning efforts to achieve a system of integrated community and district planning
     for Lesotho, largely submerged by subsequent years of uncertainty in MOLGC about
     decentralized planning systems.
   · Review in 2008 of the system of Environmental Units in line ministries that is meant to
     support the work of MTEC. Recommendations of the study have not yet been
     implemented.
   · Funding of degree programs for three Government staff, as well as short courses for seven
     Government staff and 12 project personnel.

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

The Project's substantial institutional development achievements are reflected not only in the list
above but also in its work under Components 1 and 5. There were three fields of institutional
effort. The first concerned the development of bilateral structures and procedures for enhanced
cooperation between Lesotho and South Africa in joint biodiversity conservation efforts for the
Maloti-Drakensberg bioregion. Achievements in this regard constituted one of the strongest
aspects of project performance (see Component 1 above). However, earlier commitments to
maintain a secretariat in MTEC that would coordinate ongoing bilateral work with South Africa
may not now be adequately fulfilled. Government intends that the Parks Division within the
Ministry's Department of Environment should perform this function. This means that the
Project's achievements are being invested in an agency whose institutional capacity remains
wholly inadequate for such a role.

Work at national level comprised institutional capacity building, policy work and legislative
development. The Project contributed a number of short- and long-term training programs for
Government personnel as well as its own staff. But, at project termination, the capacity of MTEC
to manage protected areas and the facilities within them remains inadequate. The PAD (Annex 2)
envisaged that "Lesotho would upgrade its conservation management capacity to adequately
manage not only the SNP, but also several areas that will be handed over to government from the
Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) during 2001". The Parks Division has still
not absorbed the staff and functions associated with the northern protected areas (Tsehlanyane
National Park and Bokong Nature Reserve) that were established with support from the LHDA.
Although more personnel have been recruited, it still lacks a full complement of officers for
management of the SNP. Proposals for an additional six technical staff and a similar number of
unskilled personnel have been submitted to the Ministry of Public Service for approval, which
has not yet been received due to budgetary constraints. Unless extraordinary measures are taken,
these posts are unlikely to be filled before the 2011-12 financial year.

In a broader measure of support to the functioning of MTEC, the Project supported a 2008 study
to investigate the resuscitation of the Environmental Units in line ministries. These units are


                                               - 27 -
meant to assist the National Environment Secretariat in fulfilling its environmental assessment
and monitoring functions in terms of the Environment Act. Enhanced performance in this regard
should have various, mostly indirect benefits for biodiversity conservation in the country. The
recommendations of the study have not yet been implemented, as MTEC was waiting for the
Environment Act to be passed.

The preparation and enactment of the Environment Act was a significant achievement that builds
a stronger legislative framework for biodiversity conservation in Lesotho. This should be
complemented by enactment of the Nature Conservation Bill, a second law whose preparation
was supported by the Project.

The Project also engaged with the decentralization and local government reform processes that
have been under way in Lesotho for the last decade. The intention of its 2005 efforts to help
MOLGC in building a system of integrated community and district planning was to clarify and
strengthen the local institutional framework for natural resource management, which became the
responsibility of Community and District Councils under the 1997 Local Government Act.
Through this stronger framework, community commitment to biodiversity conservation should
become more effective, and planning and capital finance arrangements for local conservation
initiatives should be streamlined. In the event, however, the country's decentralization and local
authority planning reforms have made slow and difficult progress, diluting the Project's early
inputs. At project termination, and partly through project efforts, there is stronger awareness that
natural resource management is the statutory responsibility of local government authorities; but
there is no clearer way to resource the capital development aspects of that function. For the short
to medium term it will be more effective to work sectorally, building cooperation and channeling
development funds directly between line ministries (and their development partners) and local
authorities.

The Project achieved a substantial amount of institutional development at community level. The
four Community Conservation Forums (CCFs) proved to be a significant achievement, and
represent an important and probably sustainable enhancement of awareness and commitment
among rural people about the importance of conserving biodiversity. The future level of CCF
activity will depend on the extent to which MTEC facilitates it. As noted in section 3.5(b) above,
the three Managed Resource Committees that the Project helped communities to establish at
Khomo-Phatsoa, 'Moteng and Mokhotlong-Sanqebethu were also important institutional
achievements. They are valuable models of multi-sector user representative bodies that combine
narrower interest groups such as grazing associations and handicrafts associations into a potential
interface with the local government authorities that have statutory responsibilities for natural
resource management. One MRC continues to receive advice and facilitation from the Project in
late 2009. MDTP support to the other two was withdrawn when project staff left Botha-Bothe and
Mokhotlong districts at the end of 2007. They continue to operate, although their strongest
emphasis is on range management and their broader roles are now less evident. As was pointed
out above, their sustainability will depend on Government's ongoing ability to provide advice and
facilitation.

Despite strong performance at bilateral and community levels, constraints persist at national level.
MTEC still lacks the capacity to fulfill its intended functions with regard to biodiversity
conservation, especially the management of protected areas. While the Project helped to foster
widespread community level awareness of biodiversity concerns and commitment to
conservation, the sustainability of the institutional development achieved at this level will depend
on ongoing support and facilitation from MTEC and MFLR, with the latter likely to continue
support for grazing associations rather than the broader MRC concept. MFLR will be supported

in the latter role by the new GEF-funded SLM project. A potential range management element in
the proposed joint World Bank-IFAD rural program could provide complementary support but
might also continue advocacy for the broader integration of resource user groups into MRC-type
institutions.

Not applicable. The Project was a stand-alone GEF project with a GEF grant and counterpart
funding from Government of Lesotho. At the time the Project was designed neither financial nor
economic analyses were prepared. No standard cost benefit or cost effectiveness parameters were
calculated, and would be extremely difficult to calculate ex-post.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A draft Borrower's ICR (50 page document) is available on file. The following sections are
extracted from the borrower's ICR un-shortened and unedited:

Quality at Entry
`The project quality at entry is rated unsatisfactory due to design issues which must have been
recognized before commencement. The design assumed that the stakeholders would be ready for
implementation while there was a need for extensive sensitization and awareness to level ground
for collaborative implementation. Hence, these resulted in need for more resources towards
operations.
The designed wrongly assumed that the outcomes would be achieved by the end of the five (5)
year period. However, for reasonable change/improvement to be recognized in biodiversity
conservation, a longer period is required. To further compound the challenge, baseline
assessments for biodiversity were done within the five years of implementation.'

Outcome/Achievement of Objectives
`When the project completed implementation on December 31st 2009, bilateral cooperation
between the two countries evidenced through signing of the revised bilateral memorandum of
understating on 1st December 2008 and close collaboration between the Project Coordination
Units (PCUs) was in place. A bilateral security strategy was implemented to address cross border
crimes that may result in frustrating conservation and tourism efforts within the project area. The
strategy will continue to be implemented by a security working group consisting of members of
security forces and conservation agencies from both countries. The Maloti Drakensberg
Transfrontier Conservation and Development Project MDTP) had also become a standing agenda
item on the Lesotho/South Africa Joint Bilateral Commission on Cooperation (JBCC) meetings.
The two countries were also publishing a joint newsletter dispatched every six months supported
by a joint website for information dissemination.
Implementation of an overarching 20-year conservation and development strategy linked to
national and SADC policies developed during the lifetime of the project has initiated. The
strategy will be implemented through 5-year action plans until the year 2028 of which the first
has commenced. Following a biodiversity based sensitivity analysis completed in 2006, in
Lesotho the project area has been increased to cover 24305.6 km2 (planning domain) with zoning
into eight biodiversity implementation areas. It is important to note that, there was no biodiversity
and cultural heritage conservation guiding mechanism before in this area ­ especially for Lesotho.
However, the biodiversity and cultural heritage assessments, with development of the
accompanying conservation strategies will from now onwards provide important guidance in
securing the natural and cultural heritage of the Maloti Drakensberg Area.
When the project began implementation in 2003, there were three IUCN category II protected
areas; Sehlabathebe National Park (SNP), Tsehlanyane National Park (SNP), and Bokong Nature
Reserve (BNR). Of the three protected areas, only SNP was already gazetted. In terms of
management, the PAs were using old management plans which were long overdue for revision. A
WWF/World Bank protected areas management effectiveness toolkit was employed as a baseline
tool on all three PAs in 2005. The result showed poor management ­ especially for SNP.
When the project phased out in December 2009, a system of protected areas covering 134815
hectares of which 14299 falls under the IUCN category II was in place. Old management plans
for the protected areas had been reviewed and new management plans prepared for newly
established PAs with implementation of priority actions initiated. Preparation of a joint
management plan and declaration of a transfrontier park between uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park
World Heritage Site (UDP-WS) and Sehlabathebe National Park (SNP) is one of the major
achievements. The transfrontier park is run by a Joint Management Committee (JMC) that sits

quarterly with membership from the Lesotho Ministry of Tourism Environment and Culture
(MTEC) and the South African Ezemvelo Kwazulu Natal Wild Life (EKZNW).
Not only has conservation management improved in SNP, but the MDTP has facilitated
ratification of the UNESCO 1972 Convention on World Cultural Heritage, which has let to
preparation of a nomination dossier for SNP to be on World Heritage list. A draft nomination file
was being finalized for submission to UNESCO World Heritage Office in January 2010.
Conservation management has been enhanced through development and implementation of best
practice guidelines for fire and grazing. A joint vulture management plan is in place with an
ongoing monitoring program followed by a vultures task force chaired by EKZNW. This group
monitors threats to bearded and cape vultures in the MDTP area.
Extensive awareness and capacity building on conservation and tourism have been created
throughout the stakeholders in the project area with production of awareness materials and
training of community members and officials. Improved collaboration to market the bioregion as
a viable tourism destination has been set in motion though development of a bilateral tourism
strategy, publication of the Maloti Drakensberg Route and Experience book, and completion of a
SADC transfrontier conservation areas expedition highlighting salient features of the Maloti
Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area (MDTFCA).'

Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
Staff turnover
`Although project performance remained satisfactory over its whole lifetime, it experienced a
high official turnover. Initially the loss of the project Ecotourism Specialist rendered
implementation of the tourism functions of the project difficult adding more work load on the
Social Ecologist. Then the change in Principal Secretaries also saw a serious turbulence in
achievement of agreed project milestones. Towards the end, most project staff filling key
positions left due to unclear government position towards implementation of the project exit
strategy. The GIS Specialist, Protected Areas Management Specialist, Procurement Manager,
Project Coordinator, Project Ecologist (and Acting Project Coordinator), Project Accountant,
Social Ecologist and Range Management Specialist all left for other posts in other organisations.
The result was that the District Conservation from Qacha's Nek, the District Conservation Officer
from Botha Bothe, and the Field Technician from Qacha's Nek remained the only technical
officers of the project.'

Project Area Terrain and Inclement Weather
`The terrain in the project area is not easy to travel. Hence, it takes amble time to reach some
areas, and this can also be dependent on prevailing weather with snow and rain resulting in
considerable time loss.'

Stakeholder Cooperation and Community Participation
`During project preparation and initiation, it was assumed that stakeholder participation would be
easy since awareness would have already been created. However, this was not the case since
intensive awareness had to be created by the project. There was establishment of three district
offices to facilitate community awareness and participation on the ground. This awareness
process took amble time as some serious implementation could not take place without community
buying in.'

Delays in Issuing of Bank No-Objections
`Delays in Bank responses with subsequent delays in issuing `no objections' resulted with some
of the activities seriously running behind schedule ­ especially the works contacts related to
construction activities at SNP.'
Delays in Government Budget Release


                                              - 36 -
`Although the government budget is approved in April each year, the quickest time to have funds
in the project account would be three (3) months. This delay was later augmented by the adoption
of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) which caused a lot of
havoc.'

Lessons Learned
`The MDTP project was very complex and broad. This is the reason why the implementers
resorted to using pilot areas to try and achieve something. This was compounded by the fact that
conservation is not an easy subject to deal with across multiple stakeholders. Extensive
stakeholder awareness had to be undertaken which resulted in consuming a lot of time. Hence, in
planning projects of this nature, two (2) years should be allowed for awareness creation and
stakeholder buying in since one cannot just go ahead and implement without concurrence by the
various stakeholders.
Since the MDTP is a bilateral initiative, this contributed to the complexity of project
implementation. The two countries involved in the undertaking are not at the same economic
level. South Africa is well ahead of Lesotho in terms of resources, conservation, and tourism
development. The land tenure systems for the two state parties are different. However, in time the
countries were able to work through these differences and achieve remarkable cooperation and
build a worm relationship that ended up with good things happening.
Challenges arose internally regarding implementation of the exit strategy. May be in future,
before signing the agreement, exit strategies should be well spelled out, and by signing the
agreement, the borrower should be committing to implementation of the exit strategy. This in-
turn may help in reducing misunderstandings that threaten sustainability at the end of the projects
and in reduction of high staff attrition due to uncertain fate. Likewise, the four (4) months grace
period given at the end of the projects to allow for proper closure of accounts and other technical
matters should be agreed before project start.'

of their management and the threats that they face need to be evaluated. The World Commission
on Protected Areas provides an overarching framework for assessing management effectiveness
of both protected areas, to give guidance to managers and others and to help harmonize
assessment around the world.
Table 1 contains a summary of the elements of the WCPA Framework and the criteria that can be
assessed1.

Framework and its criteria. The assessment exercises were undertaken between 2004 and 2009 in
collaboration with the different conservation authorities responsible for each of the eight
protected areas. The PAs for assessment were:

Evaluation Results: The assessment clearly reflects a downward trend between 2005 and
2009 in management effectiveness for the T ehlanyane National Park (12.5%) and Bokong
Nature Reserve (11.5%), which can serve as comparison areas, while for Sehlabathebe National
Park (SNP) this negative trend could at least be largely avoided with only marginally decreased
management effectiveness by 1% (Table 2)3. However, it should be noted that the overall score of
40.6 for SNP is still low, if compared with the Northern Parks scoring over 55. Generally, most
comments associated with lack of current effectiveness were associated with a serious lack of
financial and human resources. It is abundantly clear that little progress can be made in improving
PA effectiveness without a long term secure budget.

In addition to the comparison of the total scores, the ICR team created a series of radar diagrams
to illustrate the performance of each of the three PAs against each of the 6 WCPA criteria over
time. The results are summarized below in diagram 1-3.

  It should be noted that the initial assessment carried out in 2005 took place at a relatively late stage in the project and
cannot considered a baseline. Important project activities, such as the preparation of a detailed management plan for
SNP have already been accounted for in 2005. In addition it seems that the first assessment was done with a relatively
positive approach overstating some of the management performance criteria, which makes comparison somewhat
difficult.
