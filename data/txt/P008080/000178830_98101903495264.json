education system by (i) gradually replacing the present\n            unsatisfactory post-primary school system by junior\n            secondary schools with adequate academic standards and (ii)\n            re-orienting the present academic program of senior\n            secondary education to a comprehensive type with options in\n            agriculture, commercial subjects, home economics and\n            technological courses. The project includes the construction\n            and equipment for: (a) 16 new junior secondary schools; (b)\n            3 new senior comprehensive schools; (c) extensions to 3\n            existing secondary schools for conversion into senior\n            comprehensive schools; and (d) 1 new teacher training college."}, "docdt": "1968-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
