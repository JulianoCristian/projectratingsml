Some lessons learned included:\n            project design should be kept simple even if the issues are\n            complex. Continuance of key staff in linked and programmatic\n            operations facilitates effective implementation. More\n            structured co-ordination between the various multilateral\n            and bilateral agencies enhances effectiveness. Long-term\n            partnership between the World Bank and Industrial\n            Development Bank of India Limited (IDBI) in ozone depleting\n            substance (ODS) phase-out served a big advantage. Relating\n            to the use of a financial intermediary, IDBI's role was\n            strategic in facilitating a seamless financial and\n            disbursement and technical link between beneficiaries and\n            the ozone cell (OC) thereby enabling the OC to focus on the\n            broader policy reform, donor collaboration, overall\n            monitoring and reporting to the Bank, and the multilateral\n            fund for the implementation of the Montreal protocol (MP)\n            (MLF). Regarding the project design, the performance-based\n            disbursement where funds are released on annual basis based\n            on pre-determined phase-out schedules and verified targets\n            did provide an excellent implementation structure which\n            served as a motivation and incentive to stakeholders and\n            beneficiaries to find cost effective ways of phasing out\n            production and use of CTC. The programmatic approach of\n            using a CTC sector plan framed within a national ODS-phase\n            out framework lent itself to effective planning and\n            supervision which helped in generating higher level\n            sustainable results."}, "docdt": "2014-09-30T00:43:01Z"}
