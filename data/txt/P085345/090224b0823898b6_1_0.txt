                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global environmental objective of this Montreal Protocol operation is to support international efforts to restore the stratospheric ozone layer to its original level in
                         order to provide the earth's living organisms with the full benefit of the ozone layer's protection from solar radiation. India's effort on the carbon tetrachloride (CTC) front
                         is part of India's national program for the phaseout of ozone depleting substances controlled under the MOntreal Protocol. The project will therefore support the India's
                         objective to reduce its Protocol-controlled CTC production and consumption level to zero by 2010. While it is impossible to directly link India's efforts with specific
                         achievements/development outcomes related to the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer, it is worth noting that India was the second largest consumer of ozone-
                         depleting substances among developing countries and that its efforts are essential for the long term recovery of the ozone layer.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The India CTC Sector Plan Implementation project is closing 31 March 2014, having disbursed over 97% of the funds allocated to it to phase out carbon tetrachloride (CTC) by the
                         Multilateral Fund for the Montreal Protocol. The project has met its Global Environmental Objective of supporting the Government of India and stakeholders using or producing CTC in
                         fully phasing out Montreal Protocol-controlled production and consumption of CTC. Production and use of CTC for "emissive" applications have been managed downwards and, by

                         January 1, 2010, it was down to zero in line with the control measures of the Montreal Protocol and in fulfillment of the Agreement between India and the Executive Committee of the
                         Multilateral Fund. A management system is in place with the Ozone Cell at the Ministry of Environment and Forests that ensures that, after the project closes, the only production of
                         CTC is for use that is allowed under the Montreal Protocol, as a "feedstock" - where CTC serves as input for the further production of other chemicals.
