                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global environmental objective of this Montreal Protocol operation is to support international efforts to restore the stratospheric ozone layer to its original level in
                         order to provide the earth's living organisms with the full benefit of the ozone layer's protection from solar radiation. India's effort on the carbon tetrachloride (CTC) front
                         is part of India's national program for the phaseout of ozone depleting substances controlled under the MOntreal Protocol. The project will therefore support the India's
                         objective to reduce its Protocol-controlled CTC production and consumption level to zero by 2010. While it is impossible to directly link India's efforts with specific
                         achievements/development outcomes related to the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer, it is worth noting that India was the second largest consumer of ozone-
                         depleting substances among developing countries and that its efforts are essential for the long term recovery of the ozone layer.

                         The ODS IV project has met its Development Objective of supporting the Government of India's objective of reducing its Protocol-controlled Carbon tetrachloride (CTC) production
                         and consumption to 15% of its baseline levels in 2005 and completing the adjustment by January 1, 2010. Sales and use of CTC for emissive applications has been controlled. In
                         2011, 17,000 metric tons of CTC was produced in 2011 as a by-product of chloromethane production, which was used in feedstock (non-emissive) applications. As part of the
                         Technical Assistance (TA) component, the Government of India has developed a framework of activities which will ensure long-term management of CTC production and

                         consumption. The Ozone Cell of the Ministry of Environment and Forests has indicated that implementation of the TA activities will require a one-year extension to the project, which
                         is currently scheduled to close in December 2012. An official request for project extension and reallocation of budget will be sent by the Ozone Cell to the Bank, with endorsement by
                         the Department of Economic Affairs.
