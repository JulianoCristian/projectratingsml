                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global environmental objective of this Montreal Protocol operation is to support international efforts to restore the stratospheric ozone layer to its original
                         level in order to provide the earth's living organisms with the full benefit of the ozone layer's protection from solar radiation. India's effort on the carbon
                         tetrachloride (CTC) front is part of India's national program for the phaseout of ozone depleting substances controlled under the MOntreal Protocol. The project
                         will therefore support the India's objective to reduce its Protocol-controlled CTC production and consumption level to zero by 2010. While it is impossible to
                         directly link India's efforts with specific achievements/development outcomes related to the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer, it is worth noting that
                         India was the second largest consumer of ozone-depleting substances among developing countries and that its efforts are essential for the long term recovery
                         of the ozone layer.
