                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global environmental objective of this Montreal Protocol operation is to support international efforts to restore the stratospheric ozone layer to its original level in
                         order to provide the earth's living organisms with the full benefit of the ozone layer's protection from solar radiation. India's effort on the carbon tetrachloride (CTC) front
                         is part of India's national program for the phaseout of ozone depleting substances controlled under the MOntreal Protocol. The project will therefore support the India's
                         objective to reduce its Protocol-controlled CTC production and consumption level to zero by 2010. While it is impossible to directly link India's efforts with specific
                         achievements/development outcomes related to the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer, it is worth noting that India was the second largest consumer of ozone-
                         depleting substances among developing countries and that its efforts are essential for the long term recovery of the ozone layer.

                         The ODS IV project has met its Development Objective of supporting the Government of India in fully phasing out its Montreal Protocol-controlled production and consumption of
                         carbon tetrachloride (CTC). Sales and use of CTC for "emissive" applications has been managed downwards and, by January 1, 2010, it was down to zero in line with the control
                         measures of the Montreal Protocol. A management system is in place that ensures that the only production of CTC is for use that is allowed under the Montreal Protocol, as a
                         "feedstock" - where CTC serves as input for the further production of other chemicals. As part of the Technical Assistance component, the Government of India has developed a
