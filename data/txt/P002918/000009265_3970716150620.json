It will also: (b) introduce a pilot scheme for\n            latrine construction, combined with a health education\n            program.  Finally, the project seeks to: (c) strengthen the\n            two water sector agencies, NWSC and WDD, through provision\n            of technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1984-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
