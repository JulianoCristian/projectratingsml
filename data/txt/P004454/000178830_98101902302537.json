    construction of new irrigation facilities on about 8500 ha\n            of currently rainfed land and rehabilitation of two existing\n            communal irrigation systems serving 900 ha; (b) construction\n            of about 1,150 ha of new barangay (village) roads and\n            improvement of about 240 km of existing barangay roads; (c)\n            rehabilitation and improvement of three ports; (d)\n            construction of about 60 barangay health stations; and (e)\n            construction of about 300 wells serving villages of 300 to\n            400 inhabitants. The project would increase yields and farm\n            incomes on about 9,400 ha dispersed in Northern Luzon and in\n            Western and Central Visayas. At full development, this would\n            result in additional annual paddy production of about 29,000\n            tons. Some 8,500 families, most of whom are below the\n            poverty line, would benefit directly from the increased\n            production and subsequent employment. The road component is\n            tentatively expected to improve access for some 78,000\n            families by linking relatively isolated villages to the\n            mainstream of economic life of the provinces. About 47,000\n            poverty level families would benefit from the health\n            facilities to be provided under the project, while the 300\n            village wells would improve the availability and quality of\n            water for some 100,000 families."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
