Resources (MANR).  This will support\n            the substantial investments Cyprus has made in irrigation,\n            along with rural and water resource development thereby\n            increasing production of food and expansion of exports of\n            fresh fruits and vegetables.  The project will provide for\n            the establishment of an Agricultural Research and Extension\n            Council to formulate national policies and priorities for\n            research and extension as well as appropriate committee(s)\n            to develop and supervise resultant programs.  To ensure the\n            effectiveness of this organizational framework, the project\n            will provide assistance to modernize equipment, increase\n            professional and technical staff numbers, establish an\n            agricultural training institute and create opportunities for\n            the professional staff to obtain post-graduate specialized\n            training abroad.  Research facilities will be expanded, four\n            additional research/demonstration farms will be established,\n            and extension services will be provided with well-equipped accommodation."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
