DescrKtilons      The proposed Credit as well as the above mentioned co-
fnancing, would support the Government's Social Safety Net
Sector Adjustment Program. The main areas covered by the
Program are: (a) key social sector programs which deal with
primary education, primary health care, disease control, and
nutrition; and (b) the National Renewal Fund (NRF) which has
been established as a temporary social safety net to cover
(i) the costs of compensation and/or severance pay,
retraining and redeployment of workers who will be affected
by the restructuring of sick Public Sector Enterprises
(PS1s), and (ii) area employment regeneration schemes in
cities and States vhich will be impacted by the industrial
and PSI reform program.
senefites         The proposed Credit would complement other Bank efforts in
assisting India to undertake its macroeconomic stabilization
and structural reform program. It would assist India in a
period of fiscal austerity to improve the allocation of
public sector resources so that the level of effort to main-
tain the current social safety net and enhance it where
required, is not jeopardized. The Credit would also support
Center and State activities which would substantially
Increase the returns to inve-tments already made in the



- i1i -
social sectors through the emphasis on targeting to cover
the very poor, and the Introduction of new policies and
cost-effective changes In program design. The policy agenda
to be supported under this Credit would complement and en-
courage further reforms in the administration of social
safety net programs In the States. The expenditure plan for
the social safety net supported by this operation, would set
a basis for medium and long-term sustainable human resource
development. It would also ensure that the provision of
basic social services is not interrupted in the fiscal
restructuring, and that as the economy is liberalized and
resources are being redeployed for increased efficiency in
response to improved market signals, the poor are better
protected in the adjustment process.
Risks*            The main risk would be the Inability of the 001 to take some
of the actions necessary to implement the agreed reforms.
Social policy is an area where the States play a central
role. The States vith the highest Incidence of poverty such
as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Msdhya Pradesh, Rajastban and
Orissa, and where actions to streamline, reform, and expand
the existing social safety net are most critical, are
characterized by very weak institutions. Some opposition
from middle and upper class urban groups could be expected
as the proposed reforms will reduce benefits presently
accruing free of charge to them, and correctly redirect
these to the rural and urban poor. The need for macroeco-
nomic stabilization and the improvement of social services
to cover the most vulnerable groups is nonetheless accepted
by all parties and this may well provide the momentum for
undertaking the necessary steps to strengthen and broaden
the programs which constitute India's Social Safety Net.
Institutional strengthening is a key input to the Social
Safety Net Sector Adjustment Program and the enhancements
proposed will be sustained and relnforced by specific
investment projects which will complement this operation.
Disbursementes    The proposed credit would be disbursed in two equal tranches
of SDR 177,350,000 (US$250.0 million equivalent). The first
tranche would be available upon credit effectiveness. The
release of the second tranche, planned for June/July 1993,
would be contingent upon satisfactory overall progress in
program implemeatation and the completion of specific agreed
actions.

PART I* INTRODUCTIOV
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Sector Adjustment Credit to the Government of India. The proposed operation
would be for SDR 354,700,000 (the equivalent of US$500 million) and would be
on standard IDA terms with thirty-five years maturity. The proposed credit
would support the initial phase of the Government's Social Safety Net Sector
Adjustment Program.
PM? IlT COUNTRY POLICIES AND BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Recent Econamic Performance
2.          Background. From independence until very recently, India pursued
a centrally planned approach to development combining prudent macroeconomic
management; an active role for the State in key sectors such as banking, basic
industries, utilities, and infrastructure; and extensive regulation of the
economy. This regulation went beyond the usual inward-looking
industrialization policies that most developing countries pursued after world
War II. For all firms above a certain size, the Government regulated the most
basic business decisionst borrowing, investment, capacity utilization, pricing
and distribution. However, although highly regulated, the private sector has
continued to be Important, is present in most sectors of the economy, and now
generates about two-thirds of the country's GDP. Thus, while using them to
serve the goals of a centrally planned growth process, India has developed all
the basic institutions of a modern capitalist society, including a strong
entrepreneurial class.
3.          This past development strategy produced mixed results.  It has
been successful at transforming a secularly stagnant economy into one growing
at persistently positive rates (on average, GDP per capita grew at 1.4 percent
per year through the 1970s), eradicating famlnes, reducing the incidence of
poverty from over 50 per ent in the 1960C to less than 30 percent in the late
1980s, and developing a diversified industrial base and a relatively large and
sophisticated financial sector--Bombay's stock exchange is the developing
world's third largest after Korea's and Malaysia's. In addition, with
conservative macroeconomic management, inflation remained low and fiscal and
balance of payments imbalances seldom persisted. As a result, India has never
defaulted on its external debt.  These successes have been achieved in a very
complex society divided along ethnic, linguistic and religious lines, and one
always with democratically elected governments:  over the four decades since
Independence, India has established and operated democratic systems and
processes which hare ensured a remarkable degree of political freedom and
stability. But this strategy also has had serious shortcomings. India's
growth rates have been much lower than could have been expected in a country
saving and investing over one-fifth of its GDP. At over two percent annually,
population growth has remained high and health and education indicators, while
showing some progress, have remained among the world's lowest--particularly
for women. Thus, India continues to have one of the highest incidences of
poverty in the developing world and accounts for about a third of the world's
absolute poor.



- 2*-
Recent Policy and Economic Developents
4.          In the past decade, there has been a growing recognition among
India's policy makers that the development policies pursued since independence
have reduced economic growth below the country's potential, and that a more
market-oriented approach to economic management would generate higher growth
and greater resources for social programs, and reduce the incidence of
poverty. Throughout the 1980s, important policy changes started to liberalize
trade, industrial and financial policies, while subsidies, tax concessions and
the depreciation of the currency improved export incentives. Although these
measures helped GDP growth to accelerate to over 5 percent per year during the
1980., and reduced poverty more rapidly (para. 20), India's most fundamental
structural problems were addressed only very partially. Tariffs continued to
be extremely high and quantitative restrictions remained pervasive. While
controls on capacity utilization and borrowing were lifted, the investment
licensing regime continued to make firms' investment decisions conditional on
cumbersome government approvals and resulted in foreign investment levels well
below those achieved in other large developing economies--a mere USS200-400
million per year in the recent past, as opposed to US$700-1,000 million in
Indonesia, US$1-2 billion in Thailand and Brazil, and US$2-3 billion in China.
State-owned banks continued to dominate the banking system and to serve mainly
as instruments for financing economic activities selected by the Government--
until less than a year ago, regulations required 63.5 percent of deposits to
be invested in the Reserve Bank of India or in government debt instruments;
directed credit to priority sectors still accounts for 40 percent of
commercial bank credit. With few exceptions, the inefficiency of public
enterprises (which generate 17 percent of GDP) continued to be a serious
issue.
5.          In the late 1980s, these problems were compounded by political
uncertainty (there were two general elections and four changes of government
between end-1989 and July 1991) which slowed the pace of reform and prevented
the Government from addressing serious macroeconomic imbalances. Already a
problem in the early 19809 when an Extended Fund Pacility (1FF) was negotiated
-with the IHF, and also a problem throughout the second half of the 1980s,
macroeconomic imbalances grew out of control. The Central Government fiscal
deficit reached 9 percent of GDP in 1990/91, and, from single digits
throughout the 1980s, inflation rose to 10.2 percent on a point-to-point basis
in November 1990, and remained in double digits for almost two years (para.
7). On the external front, the current account deficit of the balance of
payments rose to 3 percent of GDP, the country's external debt grew to US$70
billion, and the debt service ratio increased to 29 percent. External
commercial borrowing relied heavily on volatile funding from the Indian
comumuity living abroad. At US$13 billion, deposits from Non-Resident Indians
(NRIs) accounted for almost one-fifth of India's total external debt. Because
they can be withdrawn on demand, these deposits render the country extremely
vulnerable to a liquidity crisis. Combined with political uncertainty and the
consequent lack of an effective adjustment strategy, the August 1990
developments in the Gulf put additional pressure on the balance of payments,
and eroded the confidence of foreign lenderss they triggered accelerated
capital outflows from NIl deposits and led commercial banks to reduce their
exposure In India. The Indian Government responded by compressing imports
drastically, and mobilizing part of India's gold stock. Multilaterals and
bilaterals, particularly Japan- provided significant assistance in the first
half of 1991. These efforts notwithstanding, foreign exchange reserves
declined to about US$1 billion (two weeks of Imports) in June 1991, putting
the country on the verge of defaulting on its external debt.

Changing Course
6.          The Government that came to power on June 21, 1991 has not only
overcome the balance of payments crisis but has also initiated a forceful
stabilization of the economy coupled with a major transformation of India's
development strategy. Several major policy papers, including the Eighth Five-
Year Plan (for 1992-97), have articulated the new Government's main
objectivess reducing macroeconomLc imbalances, transforming India into an
internationally competitive economy open to trade and foreign investment,
encouraging the development of the private sector, and re-focusing government
activities on the development of the country's infrastructure and human
resources and the alleviation of poverty.
7.          Progress in stabilizing the economy and reforming policies has
been significant. On the macroeconomic front, of note are the rapid
resolution of the crisis that the new Government inherited, the reduction of
fiscal and balance of payments imbalances, the recovery of reserves to over
US$6 billion (three months of imports) since August 1992, and.the decline of
inflation to below 10 percent since August 1992. The fiscal deficit has been
reduced from 9 percent of GDP in 1990/91 to 6.5 percent of GDP in 1991/92 and
an expected 5 percent of GDP in 1992/93. As a result, the consolidated fiscal
deficit (including the State governments and public enterprises) declined from
12 percent of GDP in 1990/91 to 10 percent in 1991/92, and is expected to
decline to 8.5 percent of GDP in 1992193. The 4 percent of GDP reduction in
the Central Government fiscal deficit is based on a marginal increase in
revenue (0.4 percent of GDP), and declines in current (1.6 percent of GDP) and
capital expenditure (2 percent of GDP). Most of the decline in current
expenditure results from reductions in subsidies (for exports, fertilizer and
sugar), defense (from 3.1 percent of GDP in 1990191 to 2.5 percent in
1992/93), and grants to the States, but social programs have also been
affected (reversal of the latter is an important objective of this operations
see para. 71). Reductions in subsidies triggered significant price increases--
fertilizer, agricultural comaodities, petroleum products (para. 63). Helped
by a 22 percent devaluation (in terms of Re per US$) in July 1991, the sharp
Import compression, and these stringent fiscal policies, the current account
deficit of the balance of payments declined from US$9 billion (3 percent of
GDP) in 1990/91 to US$3 billion in 1991/92 (1.4 percent of GDP). This
reduction in macroeconomic imbalances was achieved without major disruptions
in growth--from 5.6 percent in 1990/91 growth declined to about 2 percent in
1991/92, while 3-4 percent is expected for 1992-95 and higher rates for
subsequent years.
8.          On the structural front, of note are the trade and payments
reforms that since April 1992 have lifted all the import compression measures
introduced in the aftermath of the Gulf crisis, removed virtually all
quantitative restrictions on imports of capital and intermediate goods, and
have made progress towards making the rupee convertible. Sixty percent of
receipts from exports of goods, services, and remittances, and 100 percent of
all capital account receipts, except disbursement from official sources, are
now sold to authorized dealers at the market rate. With the exception of
official imports (mostly crude oil, petroleum products, and fertilizer), all
other current and capital account payments are made at the market rate. Major
progress was made in liberalizing the industrial sector in July 19919 when
investment licensing requirements were abolished for most industrial sectors,
and in strengthening the financial sector through the introduction, in April
1992, of new guidelines for income recognition, a new banking supervision
agency, the Basel Committee norms for capital adequacy, and the enactment of
legislation enabling foreign institutional investors to operate in India.



-4-
Steps are also being taken gradually to improve the performance of public
enterprises (paras. 97-99).  However, progress in reforming the tax system and
the country's social sector policies has been more modest. A high level tax
committee has already made important recommendations, and a considerable
simplification of the personal income tax regime was consequently introduced
in the February 1992 budget. But many of the changes necessary for meeting
the government's tax-policy objectives are yet to be implemented. Likewise,
changing the country's social sector policies will be a complex and time-
consuming process--and one which the operation proposed in this Memorandum
aims to accelerate (para. 69).
B. India and the External Environmeat
9.          Achieving a better integration to the world economy is an
important objective of India's new development policies and one with
potentially significant benefits. The country's exports to OECD countries
account for less than 3 percent of total OECD imports from developing
countries and, protectionism notwithstanding, the scope for finding new market
niches and increase exports is consequently large. India has also been
successful at finding new niches in exports of services, such as software,
which have been growing rapidly. A number of large firms from industrialized
countries have been relocating to India some of their administrative services,
such as accounting, to take advantage of the availability of domestic skills
at a relatively low cost. In addition, the Indian community living abroad is
large, and well diversified on a geographical basis. Recorded Indian citizens
alone amount to 1.8 million in OECD countries, and 1.2 million in the Middle
East. This community has been the source of a steady flow of remittances, of
between US$2 to US$2.5 billion in recent years disrupted only temporarily
during the Gulf crisis. On the capital account side, as indicated earlier,
foreign investment in India is extremely low. Given an appropriate incentive
regime, foreign investment could play an important role in providing non-debt
exterial financial resources, opening foreign markets to India's exports, and
updating domestic technologies. In addition, industrialized countries
portfolio investment in developing countries has been increasing at high
rates, and India could become a primary recipient of such funds now that the
Government has opened India's stock markets to foreign institutional
investors. Finally, developing countries' recourse to international financial
markets through new financial instruments has been also increasingly rapidly,
and offers new vehicles to manage the capital account that the Government is
now exploring.
10. Over the last eighteen months, progress towards developing a policy
framework enabling India to seize these opportunities has been significant.
The virtual elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports of
intermediates and capital goods, the reduction of tariffs, better incentives
to exporters, and a more inviting environment for foreign investors, should
all help India increase the role of exports in the economy, improve its access
to foreign technology and external capital, and establish patterns of trade
more in line with the country's comparative advantage. However, the delicate
balance of payments will create some vulnerability in the years to come, and
there are several risks that will have to be dealt with as India makes the
transition to a more open economy.
11.         The first is that of contlnued slow growth in the OECD. Continued
low growth in the OECD economies which, before the economic collapse of trade
with Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, absorbed over one half of
India's exports, would not only reduce imports from India, but would also
reduce their prices in international commodity markets. Primary commodities



-5-
(fish, tea, coffee. rice, iron ore and other minerals), which account for
about one fifth of India's exports, would be the most directly affected, but
other exports would suffer as well, particularly those highly dependent on
Income growth In OEOD countries. Gems and jewelry for example, account for
about 20 percent of merchandise exports, and have suffered in the last two
years from slow growth In the USA, their main market. Slow growth in the OECD
economies would, in general, make it more difficult achieving the export
targets underlying the projections in para. 111, which already have to
compensate for lost exports to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
These exports, which were one-fifth of India's exports in the 19808, have
declined by 40 percent in 1991192 and are expected to decline by a further 50
percent in 1992/93. In an International environment with sluggish growth,
firms can also be expected to protect their cash flow and reduce direct
investment in developing countries--both foreign direct and portfolio
investment are expected to play an increasingly important role in financing
the balance of payments in the Bank's current projections (para. 112).
Likewise, reductions in OECD aid budgets, together with the new demands
emerging from the centrally planned economies, would further complicate the
task of managing the capital account.
12.         The second risk, which is relevant for the more medium-term, is
the failure to bring to a successful conclusion the current round of GATT
negotiations and to bring to an early end OOD restrictions on imports of
textiles and garments from developing countries. In recent years, exports of
textiles and garments, have accounted for about me-fifth of India's exports,
and have been limited in the USA and the EEC--markets In which India has fully
utilized its quotas. The cutrent GATT proposal envisages phasing out the
Multilateral Fiber Agreement over a ten-year period, and 50 percent of the
restrictions could still be in place in the tenth year--a scenario that would
mean only limited gains to India.   The effects on India of integrating
agriculture into GATT, would be positive, particularly if developing countries
are exempt from liberalizing their agricultural trade. In this case, the
iuternational price of comuodities such as rice and sugar, of which India is a
net exporter, would increase, implying net terms of trade gains for the
country.
C. lank"s Assistaee Strategy
Country Policies and Ken Medium Term Obiectives
13.         As indicated earlier (para. 6), India has initiated a significant
transformation of its development strategy. The new Government's development
policy objectives have been translated into specific macroeconomic and
structural reform targets in several policy papers, budget documents, and the
Eighth Plan. These targets, and progress In achieving them, have been
extensively discussed in the most recent Country Economic Memorandum, India:
'Stabilizing and Reforming the Economy" (Report No. 10489-IN) distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 26, 1992 and are summarixed below.
Stabilization

o     Social sectorss  accelerate the developyent of India's human
resources, reduce gender, income and regional inequalities,
strengthen anti-poverty program, particularly those providing a
safety net for the poor affected by the adjustment program.
Universal primary education by the year 2000 is an important goal
of the Eighth Plan.
Main Objectives of the Bank's Assistance Program
14.         Background.  Since the first IBID loan in 1949, India's lending
program grew to become the Bank's largest. As of June 30, 1992, IBRD
disbursed and outstanding loans to India reached US$9 billion (out of a US$101
billion IBID total) while IDA's reached US$15 billion (out of a US$52 billion
IDA total). These large amounts are Indicative of the historically Important
role the Bank has had in financing India's development--of India's US$73
billion external debt outstanding and disbursed, excluding the former Soviet
Union, 12.5.percent is owed to IBID and 21 percent to IDA. In the late 1980s,
consolidated net IBID and IDA disbursements annual amouted to US$1.5-1.9
billion and finuanced between 20 and 30 percent of the current account deficit
of the balance of payments.



-7-
15.         Until the late 1980., IBRD lending was concentrated in
infrastructure (railways, power, telecommunication), basic industries (coal,
oil and gas, fertilizer, chemicals, capital goods) and financial
ntermediaries, while IDA's lending was concentrated in irrigated agriculture
and some infrastructure. Both lending programs supported India's main
development priorities of that time--building the country's infrastructure and
industrial base and achieving food self sufficiency. Until the late 19808,
except for three IDA projects for family planning and one for nutrition, there
was no social sector lending. As regards economic and sector work (ESW), the
annual country economic memoranda provided a framework for the annual India
Consortium meetings, as well as the analytical underpinnings of the Bank's
lending program. This overall lending strategy continued in the 19809 when,
propelled by large investments, India's public enterprises grew rapidly and
IBRD lending doubled to support this growth (Table 1).
16.         This strategy shifted in the late 19808.  Reflecting the Bank's
growing recognition of the liportance of the overall policy framework and of
human resources in development, the ISW on India increasingly dwelt on policy
and human resources issues. A 1988 economic report provided the first
comprehensive Bank assessment of gender issues in India.  The 1989 CEH made
the first Bank evaluation of India's social policies in the context of poverty
alleviation.    Reports on trade, industrial and financial sector policies
provided comprehensive reviews of existing policies, made important
recoumendations for change, and provided analytical background for the
Government's own preparation of the reforms implemented in these areas in the
last year and a half. In the last three fiscal years, in addition to
stabilization, the ISW has dwelt almost exclusively on policy reform issues in
Industry, agriculture, public enterprises, the financial sector, family
planning, nutrition and poverty. Reflecting the sector policy issues
identified in this ESV, the Bank's lending has become increasingly linked to
improvements in sectoral policies. This has led investment lending to decline
from a high annual US$3 billion in FY87-89, to US$2 billion in FY90 and FY91,
and US$1.7 billion in FY92. At the same time, the share of human resource
development projects increased from a negligible level during the 19808 to
over 15 percent of total lending in the last three fiscal years (Table 1).

17.         Thus, lending to sectors that traditionally accounted for a large
share of Bank lending has declined significantly. Reduced lending to the
power sector reflects the Government's inability to raise tariffs to levels
reflecting economic and financial costs, to eliminate large implicit subsidies
for power supplied to agriculture, to improve chronically poor bill collection
rates, and to bring about institutional changes which would allow the sector
to operate on a commercial basis. Since tariffs and collections are the
responsibility of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs), over which the central
government has limited influence, lending to the power sector has been
restricted to the better monaged SEBs and central governmnt power companies--
although even these companies are now seriously affected by mounting arrears
from the SEBs. Reduced lending to oil and gas reflects concerns over
inadequate pricing policies (numerous cross-subsidies), poor management of
India's oil fields, and barriers to private sector entry. Recent lending in
this sector has been made in support of improved pricing policies,
deregulation, increased private sector participation, and better management.
18.         Conventional lending to public manufacturing enterprises has been
discontinued, reflecting greater awareness, both in the Government of India
and the Bank, of the costs of restrictions on private sector entry and
competition, problems that be8an to be seriously addressed only in July 1991.
Likewise, conventional-style lending to financial intermediaries has been
discontinued, reflecting the Bank's new policies regarding lending to
financial intermediaries. Lending to infrastructure has suffered from
inadequate cost recovery and lack of agreement on needed institutional
changes. Lending for highways development is severely constrained by the lack
of implementation capacity at the national and central level. Finally,
lending to agriculture has suffered from weak institutions, poor cost recovery
(particularly in irrigation) and State governments' inadequate attention to
resettlement issues.

19.         Key Bank Obiectives. While the reform agenda ahead remains
formidable and many difficult policy changes are yet to be implemented,
progress in stabilizing and reforming India's economy over the last year and a
half has been impressive. If this pace of reform is maintained over the next
few years, India could become one of the world's more dynamic economies during
the second half of the 19909 and beyond. In a country that accounts for one-
third of the world's poor, this would change the face of the developing world.
The Bank's first priority for the next few years therefore is to support this
process. The main vehicles for its support are: (a) continuation of economic
and sector work centered on stabilixation and structural reform issues, and
policies which would improve the performance of key sectors (agriculture,
infrastructure, energy and social sectors); (b) adjustment lending supporting
key structural reform measures; and (c) investment lending for projects in
agriculture, Infrastructure, and social sectors, including anti-poverty
projects, in response to and in support of major improvements in sectoral
policies and capacity-building.
20.         The Bank's support for the Government's development policies
should have a strong impact on poverty which remains one of India's most
serious problems. About 230 million of India's 850 million inhabitants live
below the poverty line. Their life expectancy, and low infant survival,
literacy and school enrollment rates, particularly among women, are well below
India's average. Improving the living standards of India's poor cannot rely
on transfers or other social programs alone but also requires a prolonged
period of rapid and sustained growth. The decline in the incidence of poverty
to below 30 percent in the 1980s was more rapid than what had been achieved in
the previous three decades mostly because of the more rapid growth witnessed
in the 19808. Thus, the Bank's support for the Government's new development
strategy should be seen as the most important avenue whereby the Bank can help
India rapidly reduce the incidence of poverty. In addition to more
sustainable and rapid growth, these new policies should also help bring about
a more labor-intensive pattern of growth with a more-than proportionate
Increase in the demand for labor--generally the poor's only resource.
21.         In recent years, besides sector reviews in agriculture and gender
issues, an important focus of the Bank's economic and sector work (ESW) has
been on analyzing policy and institutional issues, particularly in industry,
trade and finance--identifying alternative policy regimes and institutional
arrangements that could lead to more efficient resource allocation and more
rapid growth, and tracing the effects of such changes. Such analysis enabled
the Bank to establish a dialogue with the Government on policy reform issues
and to process rapidly a first structural adjustment operation.
22.         As India's reform process unfolds, there will be new demands on
the ESW program. The 1993 CE1 will have two broad objectives. First, it will
assess recent progress in stabilizing and reforming the economy, and examine
the evolving policy agenda for successful management of the transition. The
analysis will seek to identify and sharpen the understanding of trade-offs and
other issues relating to the pace and sequencing of different adjustment
measures in India. Second, the report will develop an agenda for public
policy to accelerate the development of India's human capital and physical
infrastructure--two key areas which bear  importantly on the pace and
sustainability of the adjustment process and on progress in poverty
alleviation, and where the public sector will continue to dominate. This
agenda will stress the need for major improvements in the effectiveness and
efficiency of public expenditure at all levels of government. An analysis of
India's linkages to the world economy is expected to provide insights on the
dynamics of India's export growth as well as how trade restrictions In OECD



- 10 -
countries affect India's export patterns. Also underway are a trade policy
study, a private sector assessment (in collaboration with IPC and FIAS), and
sector strategy papers for the accelerated development of infrastructure
(including transport), agriculture, and human resources.
23.         Mmny policy reforms, particularly sector policy reforms, under the
Constitution, lie Increasingly in the domain of State governments, for
example: agricultural policies, electricity pricing, social services,
management of most Infrastructure (exceptions are ports, civil aviation and
railways), State-level public enterprises and local taxation. Sector reviews
now underway on Infrastructure, education and health are expected to provide
some of the elements of an approach integrating this aspect of the reform
process, but additional ISW is planned to deepen it. The management of health
and education systems at the State-level is the focus of a study to start in
the next fiscal year, as is the management of State Rlectricity Boards (SIBs).
Adjustment Lending Program
24.         Adjustment lending plans envisage up to three operations per year
for the next three-to-four fiscal years. It could reach up to 25-30 percent
of the total IBRDIIDA lending plan of about US$3 billion a year. Adjustment
lending operations will rely mostly on IBRD resources, although IDA will also
play a role in supporting structural reforms. These resources would support
structural and sectoral policy reforms, provide critically needed financing
for the balance of payments and help moderate inflation and other social costs
of the program. In the cortext of the external fin2ancing plan for India's
ongoing adjustment efforts, these fast-disbursing resources are needed to
underpin the transition to medium-term viability of India's balance of
payments and the country's access to external financial markets.
25.         Adjustment operations will be linked to continued progress in
stabilizing and reforming the economy. They are planned to support the
Government's medium-term structural reform objectives summarized in para. 13
In the areas of trade and financial sector policies, social sectors, and, if
the pace at which they are being reformed accelerates, public enterprises. As
the process of reform broadens to include sectoral policies, the focus of
adjustment lending will be broadened to support policy and institutional
changes in the energy, agriculture and infrastructure sectors. A first US$500
million structural adjustment operation approved by the Board in December 1991
has met its objectives and has been fully disbursed. For the remainder of
this fiscal year, in addition to the operation discussed in this report,
policy-based operations are expected to support trade and, possibly, financial
sector reforms.
Investment Lending
26.         Inwestment lending for agriculture, Infrastructure, energy and
social sectors at the rate of 10-12 projects a year, will continue to support
improvements in sector policies and Institutions (sumamarized in Table 2).
A riculture will continue to be a major recipient of IDA resources and an
increasingly important focus of the Bank's policy dialogue. Agriculture
generates 35 percent of the country's GDP, employs 70 percent of the labor
force; and 80 percent of India's poor live and work in rural areas. At about
3 percent per year, agricultural growth in the 19808 was the highest since
independence as a result of the expanded irrigation infrastructure, and the
dissemination of modern technologies and high-yielding grain varieties,
However, continued rural poverty, population growth, and low-productivity
farmaing are leading to the degradation of land, water and forest resources*



- 11 -
With no major technological leaps on the horizon, few surface water systems
remaining for exploitation and severe limits on funding for new public
programs, future agricultural growth will depend critically on increases in
efficiency and higher investment. There is great urgency for the authorities
to fLnalize a comprehensive strategy for sustaining the considerable
accomplishments achieved since Independence, such as self-sufficiency in basic
foodgrains and elimination of famines, and dealing with the problems now
confronting the sector.
27.         Factors inhibiting Increased agricultural efficiency and growth in
India have been analyzed in two recent Bank reports (Report No. 9412-IN,
"India: 1991 Country Economic Nemorandum", August 1991, and Report No. 9518-
IN, OIndias Irrigation Sector Review', December 1991). There are essentially
four problem areas. The first problem arises from the widespread Central and
State government interventions that have distorted incentives and restricted
trade. The second is the decline in investment. Over the last decade, public
investment declined by 2 percent per year, crowded out by escalating
expenditure on input subsidies on fertilizer, recurrent irrigation costs and
electricity. For example, in 1989190, explicit and implicit subsidies
totalled Re 110 billion while public investment in the sector was only Rs 102
billion. Private investment has stagnated due to the inherent
complementarities between public and private investment and the poor
performance of the rural credit system. The third problem area is a research
and extension system in need of revitalization and greater responsiveness to
farmers' needs and ecological conditions--particularly in the rainfed areas.
The fourth is the disappointing performance of the irrigation infrastructure.
As a consequence of poor systems' management, inadequate O&M and very limited
cost recovery, weak institutions and poor construction quality, the existing
infrastructure is not generating its full potential benefits.
28.         Addressing these problems will be difficult.  Under India's
Constitution, agriculture is a State matter and different States have pursued
different agricultural policies. Improving the incentive regime thus requires
coordin^ted action among India's States. Arresting the decline of capital
formation in agriculture also depends on decentralized actions it requires
reducing subsidies mostly provided by the States and a major reform and
rehabilitation of the rural credit system. These difficulties
notwithstanding, any sustainable development strategy will need to address the
four problem areas mentioned above. IDA investment credits will be used to
revamp agricultural, irrigation and forestry programs at the State level in
Tamil Nadu (1991), Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan (1992), Karnataka,
Andhra Pradesh and Haryana (1993) and Orissa and Madhya Pradesh (1994). Other
priorities in leading to agriculture will be to reform and rehabilitate the
rural credit institutions, to redress the previous neglect of rainfed areas,
to improve rural infrastructure (marketing, irrigation systems management,
roads), and to strengthen the programs which generate and disseiainate
appropriate tecbnologies.
29.         In infrastructure, the emphasis will be on projects aimed at
capacity expansion and efficiency improvements in transportation (ports,
airports, railways, highways), urban areas (municipal transportation, water
supply and sanitation systems), rural areas (water supply and sanitation),
and, if the Government deregulates the sector, in telecommunications. Sector
policy adjustments and Institutional capacity building will be an objective of
all these operations. Energ projects will help to develop India's gas and
oil reserves and power generation, transmission and distribution--with a
particular emphasis on improvitg power systems' efficiency, comercializing
the sector, and increasing the environmental sustainability of poaer projects.

The recent increased emphasis on social sectors will continue with the
lendingprogram focused on increasing the coverage, quality and cost-
effectiveness of nutrition, health, family planning, education services and
anti-poverty programs. The reduction of endemic and communicable diseases
(tuberculosis, leprosy, blindness, AIDS, malaria), to which the poor are
particularly vulnerable, and the reduction of fertility will be important
objectives of health projects. The economically weaker social groups,
particularly girls and women, will be a special focus of all social sector
projects. In addition to improvements in policies and institutions, all
projects in agriculture, infrastructure, energy and social sectors, will
continue to seek progress in the Bank's areas of special operational emphasis
(paras. 36-45).
Portfolio Management
30.         Hore than 100 projects valued at US$20 billion net of
cancellations (about US$11 billion undisbursed as of September 30, 1992) are
now under implementation. About three-quarters of these projects are being
implemented by State governments of varying administrative capacity. This
leads to a marked variation in performance among both sectors and States. In
terms of supervision ratings, the status of the portfolio has remained stable
for the last three years with 16 percent rated as 'problem' projects.
Performance has significantly improved in agriculture and the social sectors
over the past year while deteriorating somewhat in the other sectors. As a
share of the funds committed and undisbursed, IBRD disbursements (net of
policy-based lending) declined from an average of about 23 percent in the
early 1980w to around 7 percent in FY85 and FY86, recovered gradually to about
20 percent in FY89, but then declined steadily to only 11 percent in FY92.
For IDA, disbursements as a share of committed and undisbursed balances
remained more stable, averaging 'out 222 throughout most of the 19808, but
declining to around 152 per yeaz- over the last four years.  These trends
reflect a combination of factors largely outside the control of the Indian
Government or individual project agencies as well as serious project
implementation issues. With respect to the largely external factors, a major
cause of the mid-80s decline in the IBRD disbursement ratio was the major
portfolio shift that took place as lending for relatively fast disbursing
financial intermediary operations (in agriculture and industry) was sharply
reduced in the early 80's and lending for slower-disbursing projects in power
and transport was dramatically increased. The undisbursed balance for
operations in the power and transport sectors increased from US$1.7 billion in
1981 (113 of the total - IBRD and IDA - portfolio) to US$4.2 billion in 1986
(almost 1/2 of the total portfolio) - largely the result of new IBRD
commitments to these sectors during FY82-85 which totalled US$3.3 billion.
The declining IBRD disbursement rate over the last few years reflects, in
part, a further shift in the portfolio away from faster disbursing financial
intermediation projects in industry, agriculture and housing after some
resumption of this type of lending in the mid- to late-1980s. Both IBRD and
IDA disbursements have been adversely after some resumption of this type of
lending affected by the ongoing fiscal adjustment which is reducing the
availability of budgetary funds, particularly at the state level, and by the
considerable real depreciation of the Indian rupee from the second half of the
19809 which has reduced the dollar equivalent of rupee disbursements in
projects with a high proportion of local expenditures. The impact of the
foregoing factors has been compounded by project start-up delays associated
with slow and cumbersome decision-making processes for procurement (at both
State and Central levels), together with complex budgetary processes for
chaneling funds to State-implemented projects. Efforts to build up the



- 14 -
Bank's portfolio in the soc!ai sectors and in the poorest States have
exacerbated this problem--because those sectors and States are also the ones
with the weakest administrative capacities, gradually creating slack in
project financing and reduced disbursements. Strengthening institutious has
been a major focus in many projects. This strengthening takes time and while
it is happening projects often move more slowly than planned.
31.         The Government and the Bank have been working closely to address
India's project Implementation and disbursement problems, including a major
portfolio review completed in late 1991, which focused on nonperforming
projects and projects with large currency depreciation-related savings.
Drawing on this review and earlier implementation experience, the following
remedial steps have been taken: (a) new projects strive to remain simple and
avoid organizational complexity which has been found to cause implementation
and disbursement delays; (b) up-front actions in the key areas of
procurement, land acquisition, and clearances is now required prior to project
approval; (c) fn State-operated projects, the Ministry of Finance has now
agreed to advance Central funding to Bank-asiisted projects to accelerate
project start-up; (d) private engineering consultants are increasingly being
used for supervision of construction works; (e) the Bank has adopted a less
accommodating posture regarding extension of closing dates; and (f) existing
projects have been restructured (revision of scope, increased disbursement
percentages and extensions when appropriate to achieve the project objectives)
and problem projects or project components with little scope for improvement
have been closed. These actions have already resulted in improved start-up
rates for newer projects, and successful restructurings and cancellations to
draw down undisbursed balances more rapidly, especially for older projects.
During FY92, more than US$800 million was canceled from the IBRD portfolio and
US$650 million from the IDA portfolio and the IDA cancellations have been
redeployed to support the adjustment program, including the operation
discussed in this report. A further US$375 million of IBRD has been canceled
during FY93 to date. As a result of these actions, undisbursed balances for
projects that hsve been under implementation for eight or more years (i.e.,
approved in FY84 or earlier) were reduced from US$1.2 billion as of September
30, 1991 to less than US$400 million a year later.
32.         Improvements relating to procurement and civil works construction
require fundamental institutional changes at all levels of government
including prevailing relationships between contractors and public officials.
Progress will be slow partly because litigation on contractual disputes is
often hard to avoid. However, greater use of standard bidding documents and
private consulting engineers for works supervision, together with more
rigorous prequalification procedures for contractors and suppliers, should
permit progress to be made.
33.         The Bank's current agenda for portfolio management comprises:
9     periodic reviews of problem projects, which would include the
projects with the most serious resettlement and rehabilitation
(R&R) problems, projects 'hich are candidates for cancellation,
and all remaining projects identified by supervision as problem
projects'; action plans for each will be prepared;
o     preparation of project-specific supervision plans based on
realistic implementation and disbursement schedules for all
remaining projects, identifying priority areas for special effort
for the following year; this will facilitate the dual objective of



- 15 _
ensuring efficient and focused expenditure of supervision efforts,
and establish a clear baois for an improved reward system as an
Incentive to quality supervision from staff;
0     fostering best-practice supervision, including mid-term reviews
for all projects, stricter application of the Bank's policies on
closing dates, preparation of action-oriented supervision reports,
including one-page summaries of agreed actions and schedules left
with each implementing agency at the conclusion of supervision
missions;
0     seeking strongtr support from the Ministry of Finance in carrying
out its overall project management responsibilities, especially
better comunication with States and implementing agencies, and
greater recognition of the importance of their role in fostering
accelerated project execution in order to increase disbursements;
*     continuing to press for improved pre-financing of projects and a
steadier flow of project funding; for appropriate centrally-funded
projects; and the earmarking of project resources in the
Government's planning and budgeting process; and
34.         Improving the resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected
people is another important concern in project implementation and design.  The
recent discussion of the Sardar Sarovar (Narmada) project, has highlighted the
need to strengthen the lank's approach in this important area. There are 19
projects (6 in agriculture, 1 in water supply, 3 in coal, 9 in power) under
Implementation which in total require resettlement and rehabilitation of about
600,000 people. In the past, Government generally addressed compensation of
project-affected people under the legislation governing land acquisition based
on the Government's right of eminent domain. Over the course of the last
decade the social and economic obligations of Government towards project-
affected people have increasingly taken the form of meaningful counitments by
the respective States to explicit, monitorable resettlement and rehabilitation
programs. However, pursuit of the stated rehabilitation objectives through
orderly implementation of R&R programs in the frequently remote, backward
areas of incidence has frequently suffered from all of the social,
organizational, institutional and financial problems typically associated with
under-development.
35.         Project experience has identified absence of national standards or
guidelines for the resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected people
as an important impediment to a more effective approach to R&R in India. Like
agriculture, R&R is a State responsibility under India's constitution. At
present, tost States' guidelines for R&R do not provide for land-for-land
compensation, nor do they envisage compensation for landless laborers who lose
their employment base. Since there is no 'free' land in India, alienation of
degraded forest land or market purchases of land are generally the only ways
for project authorities to acquire land for I&R purposes. The financial and
administrative ability to do so varies considerably from State to State.
While the use of degraded reserved forest land for R&R in return for
compensatory afforestation elsewhere is an option that is preferable to
reliance on cash compensation which the affected families frequently have
found difficult to apply to the purchase of productive assets, the Central
Government has been understandably reluctant to release degraded forests for
organized resettlement because these lands are often already under some form
of cultivation by encroachers. Government and the Bank are using the issues



- 16 -
identified in the implementation of R&R in the Sardar Sarovar (Narmada)
Projects to develop improved general approaches to the implementation of R&R
in all Bank-financed projects as well as in India's national investment
programs.
Areas of Special Operational Emphasis
36.         Reducing poverty, developing the Private sector, improving
environmental protectlon, strengthening institutions, increasing the role of
beneficiaries and NGOs in project design and implementation, and enabling
women to participate more fully in the development process, are all important
interrelated objectives of the Bank's assistance program in India.  They will
continue to be pursued through lending, to provide important themes to the
Bank's ESW, and to influence the focus and design of projects (see Table 3).
37.         In addition to support for a policy framework conducive to
significant and rapid reductions in the incidence of poverty (para. 20), the
Bank is supporting India's poverty alleviation efforts in several other ways.
First, the balance of payments financing being provided by the Bank and other
external lenders enables India to reduce macroeconomic imbalances at a pace
which avoids excessive deflation. Without such lending, the modest increases
in per capita consumption that underlie the macroeconomic framework discussed
in para. 50 could not be achieved. Second, experiences elsewhere have shown
that, together with growth, improved provision of basic social services has
been the most effective approach for alleviating poverty. Through projects in
the social sectors, the Bank is supporting India's initiatives to increase
cost-effectiveness and ensure that basic social services adequately reach
vulnerable segments of the population such as wvomen, the poor, and special
regional groups. The operation described in this report makes a special
effort to ensure the provision of social services in geographic areas known to
have high concentrations of vulnerable groups. Third, concern with direct
poverty alleviation is reflected in the design of some Bank-financed
investment projects outside the social sector. Projects in agriculture, for
example, often focus on the poorest regions of India and on activities on
which mostly the poor, especially women, depend (sericulture, fisheries,
forestry). Projects in urban infrastructure and rural water supply and
sanitation seek to improve service delivery in the poorest areas and have a
strong impact on the living standards of children and women--who are often
those engaged in time-consuming tasks such as water transport and waste
disposal.
38.         Since Independence, India's private sector has grown at rates
significantly below its potential. This has been the result of the country's
past development policies thatt (a) diverted savings away from the private
sector; (b) erected extensive barriers to entry in important sectors of the
economy; and (c) created a policy and institutional environment that reduced
productivity increases in the private sector. The country's new development
strategy should increase the availability of resources for the private sector,
has already significantly reduced barriers to entry in important sectors of
the economy, and is improving the overall enabling environment. This should
help increase the efficiency of the private sector as well as the scope of its
activities. The Bank is supporting this process mostly through its policy
dialogue, while IZC is supporting it through several types of interventions
(see paras. 39-40). The recent Bank SAL has supported measures enabling a
larger role for the private sector in capital markets, significant
deregulation of the industrial sector, and divestiture of public enterprises.
An PSAL under preparation would include measures to increase the participation



- 17 -
of the private sector in the banking system while policy-based lending for the
hydrocarbon sector, also under preparation, would support measures to end the
public sector monopoly in oil exploration and extraction in India. Finally,
the private sector assessment (PSA) underway in collaboration with IPC and
FIAS aims at identifying ways to improve the business environment, increase
the participation of the private sector in areas traditionally dominated by
the public sector, and improve incentives for foreign private investment.
39.         IPC and MIGA Activities.  After Mexico, India is IFC's second
largest client with ten percent of IFC's total portfolio. Since 1959, IFC has
approved US$1.3 billion of investments in 67 Indian companies, including
US$125 million in equity. In the past two years, IPC's investment approvals
have increased significantly to about US$130 million in nine transactions in
FY91, when syndications of about US$80 million were also approved, and to
about US$150 million in thirteen transactions in FY92, when syndications were
some additional US$70 million. Held portfolio at June 30, 1992 amounted to
US$640 million. The past performance of IPC's Indian portfolio has been
generally excellent, with prompt servicing of both loan and equity
investments.
40.         In response to the recent policy changes, IFC has made a strong
commitment to expand its mission in New Delhi to be more responsive to the
needs of an expanded client base, and a mission has also been opened up in
Bombay. IPC plans to: (a) give priority to large projects with a large
foreign exchange content, particularly in the power and hydrocarbons sectors
where IPC hopes to help attract private sector investments; (b) expand
external funds mobilization through loan syndications, international
securities issues and country funds; (c) focus more sharply on equity
investments in both iarge and small company start-ups and expansions where
there is a clear role for IFC; (d) enter into wholesaling arrangements with
financial institutions, such as agency credit lines, to reach small- and
medium-scale enterprises in a cost efficient manner; and (e) promote foreign
joint ventures. In the financial sector, IFC is positioning itself to help
develop a variety of institutions including private commercial banking,
investment banking, consumer finance, stock brokerage and portfolio
management, and IFC is also undertaking a study to identify constraints on the
development of Indian capital markets and the internationalization of these
markets. That report is due in January 1993. Finally, IFC has been
discussing with several public enterprises possible assistance in
restructuring and privatizing their activities. IFC and the Bank have made
special efforts to coordinate their respective operations and have worked
closely in developing the Bank's policy dialogue on industry, finance and the
private sector. As part of its efforts to increase foreign investment flows,
India is now joining MIGA, and the Parliament is expected to ratify the
country's membership before the end of 1992.  FIAS is carrying out a review of
India's policies on foreign investment.
41.         India's environment has been degraded by population pressures and
poverty, an incentive regime that has encouraged an unnecessarily intensive
use of relatively high-polluting energy (per unit of GDP, the world's third
largest after Bulgaria and Poland), wasteful use of surface and ground water
resources (particularly for irrigated agriculture) and inadequate protection
of soils and forests. Addressing these problems requires initiatives on
several frontsz reducing fertility rates (by addressing its main determinantst
women's literacy levels, poverty and availability of socially acceptable
contraception methods); correcting the incentive regime; and improving
environmental regulations and institutions. These issues have been addressed



- 18 -
In the ongoing dialogue with Government on its Environmental Action Plan
supported by recently completed USW (on forestry, health, irrigation and
power). Recent projects have supported industrial pollution control, gas
flaring reduction, State-level forestry development, health, rainfed
agriculture and water supply and sanitation. Increased attention is also
being paid to enviromental issues In all energy and infrastructure projects.
Besides this, the Bank is vorking with the Government in developing a strong
pipeline for the GER focusfing on: (a) alternative energy sources (wind farms
and solar photovoltaic energy); (b) biodiversity in selected areasg and (c)
environmental education. The systematic application of the Environmental
Assessment process to new and ongoing lending operations in reinforcement of
the Government's own environmental clearance processes is also an important
Bank objective. Workshops are being organized through the Ministry of
Environment and Forests to discuss the enviromeantal consequences of projects
In key sectors such as Infrastructure, irrigation, and energy with a view to
identifying the substantial congruences of India's and the Bank's
environmental assessment standards and procedures.
42.         Concern with sustainable development has already had a strong
influence in the Bank's approach to forestry lending in India. In the past,
Bank-supported forestry projects in India focused on social forestry and
watershed activities with emphasis on village-level development and generation
and dissemination of appropriate technology without major attempts to address
the systemic issues affecting forest development and conservation. However,
the pressures on the resource are so strong, that apart from a limited number
of areas of biodiversity, it will be impossible to protect forest areas unless
the benefits of this conservation are understood by the public, especially
those living near and in the forests. Yet, forests benefit the environment in
a number of Important ways (protection of watersheds, plant and animal
biodiversity, stabilization of fragile soils). The Government recognizes in
its Notional Forestry Policy that it is necessary to enlist the cooperation of
local populations and the private sector in forest protection, management and
development and encourage forest users and farmers to take greater interest
in forest development. In support of this national policy and to contribute
to its implementation, a broader approach integrating these elements in
projects combining sector-wide policy reforms and investments at the State
level has been adopted recently through two new-style forestry projects
(approved last spring) for Maharasthra and Vest Bengal and is presently being
replicated in the preparation of two upcoming projects in Andhra Pradesh and
Madhya Pradesh.

/ Includes M Components
43.         The competence and professionalism of India's civil service are
well known, and the country has already developed the basic institutions of a
market economy. Yet, there is an urgent need to improve administrative
capacity in some sectors (highways and irrigation in particular), in some
States (generally the poorest), and in selected areas of the economy. Thus,
while the Bank has not felt the need to formulate a comprehensive strategy to
accelerate the development of India's Institutions, improvements In
administrative capacity and institutional reforms have been an important focus
of Bank activities. They have been addressed on a case by case basis as they
are identified in projects or ISV. For example, in the proposed Uttar Pradesh
Basic Education Project which is under preparation, the Government is making
special efforts to stregthen the State's capacity to design and Implement the
project by establishing formal links between the Central and State
governments; the project will assist these efforts by finacing consultants.
infrastructure projects under preparation are seeking major institutional
changess  establishment of a National Iighway Authority, more autonomy and



- 20 -
private sector participation in the management of ports, and financial self-
sufficiency for the agencies involved in water supply and sanitation.
Institutional reforms have also been an important component of recent projects
for the State-level forestry projects, have been an important theme of
recently completed ESW (on irrigation, forestry, power, financial sector,
industrial policies). A Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) under
preparation is expected to dwell on institutional issues related to the
development and regulation of financial markets. The planned Private Sector
Assessment (PSA) will, likewise, aim to address institutional development
issues (labor laws, functioning of the commercial courts) insofar as they
affect transaction costs in the markets for land, labor, and other productive
assets.
44.         The Bank will continue to make a deliberate effort to increase the
role of NGOs and community participation in the design and implementation of
projects iN agriculture, social sectors, and infrastructure (rural water
supply and urban). While difficult to organize, community participation has
proven highly productive when successfully integrated in the projects. It has
contributed to the success of the first Tamil Nadu nutrition project as well
as to that of ongoing forestry and water and sanitation projects. NGOs have
been important in mobilizing community participation--by forming and
motivating groups of villagers to protect surrounding forest in forestry
projects or encouraging community participation in the design, management, and
cost recovery of water distribution systems in rural water supply projects.
In a Karnataka Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, NGOs are being used
to form village development committees which will decide the level of
improvements desired, commitments of financial commitments for financial
participation, and village involvement in water system operations.
Population and health projects make provisions for support to NGOs activities,
for example, for training of government workers or management of government
facilities. Also in the social sectors, considerable efforts are underway to
elicit community participation in project design and implementation. An AIDS
project approved in March 1992 allocates 10 percent of the pr-ject funds to
NGOs involved in raising public awareness in higher-risk groups; a project now
under preparation to reduce blindness in India (mainly through treatment of
cataracts) is based on extensive use of voluntary organizations for
identifying where blindness problems are localized, and in counselling the
blind about available treatment.
45.         There has been a growing recognition in India that not only more
equitable, but also faster growth would result from addressing gender issue--
integrating women in the development process more fully, and reducing the
currently large disparities between men and women in terms of literacy rates,
nutrition and economic status. This is fully reflected in the Bank's ESW and
lending program.   In addition to the already completed comprehensive study of
gender issues in India (noted in para. 16), gender issues are an important
theme of a recently completed health sector report and will be a theme in most
ESW on the social sectors. Attempts to improve women's economic status have
also been made through project lending. In agriculture, several projects have
supported female-dominated activities (sericulture, shrimp and fish culture)
as well as initiatives aimed at removing gender biases in the delivery of
public services. For example, recent agricultural and social sector projects
have been conditional on an incroase in the number of women in extension
services (watershed development projects and ICDS). In addition, several
ongoing or planned social sector projects for family welfare, primary
education, child survival and safe motherhood, and nutrition, have had as a
central objective improving the health and nutritional status of mothers and



- 21 -
young girls. Taken together, these projects reach a large number of India's
poorest women, and the Indirect benefits are considerable in terms of changing
perceptions about the role of women in the development process.
Cooperation with Multilaterals and Bilaterals
46.         The IMF is providing strong support to India's stabilization and
reform efforts. Since early 1991, the IMP has provided US$3.7 billion through
drawings under the CCP and the US$2.3 billion eighteen months stand-by
approved in October 1991. Recent reviews by the IMF concluded that the stand-
by targets were being satisfactorily met, and the Government and the IMF have
begun discussions on an EFF to follow the stand-by. The Government has
requested that the EFF be accompanied by an Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (E.SAF) component, which would require the preparation of a Policy
Framework Paper (PFP), and is expected to be finalized following the
Governamut's presentation of the 1993/94 budget to the Parliament in February
1993. The Bank has collaborated closely with the IMP in this process, with
the IKM seeking the Bank's views on structural reform issues, including public
expenditure restructuring, trade and industrial reform, public enterprise
restructuring and privatization, and the IKV taking the lead in macroeconomic
policies, as well as tax reform. The collaboration has been fruitful,
technical discussions are frequent, and so are joint missions. Preparation of
a PFP will strengthen these collaborative arrangements further.
47.         The AsDB and other bilateral donors, particularly Japan, have also
provided significant balance of payments support over the last eighteen months
and the Bank has had frequent exchanges of views with these institutions.
With AsDB's commitments now surpassing US$1 billion per year, it is
particularly Important to strengthen cooperation in project identification and
preparation to avoid duplication of borrowers' efforts. The AsDB has recently
appraised a fast-disbursing loan in support of financial sector reform. The
Bank will continue to work closely with the AsDB and other donors in
coordinating and strengthening the dialogue and lending strategy in key areas
of sectoral policy reform. Coordination with other donors is also extensive
in project-related work, particularly infrastructure and social sector
projects. On the latter, the Bank has had extensive collaboration with
UNICEF, WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control, and the US National
Institutes of Health in the preparation of several projects to reduce
commuicable diseases.
48.         As Chair of the Indian Aid Consortium, the Bank will continue to
play a leadership role In mobilizing resources to meet India's external
financing needs over the next several years. The Bank will step up its
efforts in aid coordination and cofinancina and continue to offer cofinancing
opportunities to the bilateral and multilateral members of the India
Consortium. The most recent experiences (SAL, Social Safety Net Sector
Adjustment Program presented herewith) suggest an interest among the
Consortium members for coordinated efforts in support of India's adjustment
process. The Bank will also continue to assist India in raising parallel
export credit cofinancing associated with Bank-supported investment projects
In energy and infrastructure projects. Furthermore, it expects to play a
catalytic role, together with IIC in helping restore India's access to private
markets, which is currently constrained mostly to short-term operations. As
International market perceptions of India's creditworthiness improve, we are
exploring the possibilities of helping India mobilize longer-term market
borrowing with the support of the NCO program; the forthcoming power sector
projects are likely to be good candidates for this. In addition, the Bank is



- 22 -
also actively exploring non-recourse financing for several private sector
(foreign and local projects in the power sector where the Indian Government
wishes to encourage BOT or BOO operations.
Suammary
49.         The Bank assistance program for the next few years, alms at
helping India's adjustment efforts and accelerating the country's economic and
social development. Accordingly, a large share of the Bank's lending plans is
for adjustment operations and for investment lending addressing policy and
institutional issues at the sector level. Tie volume of IBRD lending will be
based on progress in stabilizing and reforming the economy and will depend on
the availability of quality operations. IDA lending levels will also be
guided by such progress and the extent to which India meets the performance
criteria set by the IDA donors, making full allowance for the fact that it has
been agreed with the Government to dedicate the IDA funds to high-quality
poverty-related projects in agriculture and social sectors. Continued
progress in stabilizing and reforming the economy along the lines indicated in
para. 13 could translate into an annual lending program of up to about US$3
billion, with 25 to 30 percent of Bank lending aw4lable for adjustment.
Improved portfolio management, better aid utilization and success in
Increasing disbursement rates through the measures discussed in paras 31-33,
and 35 will be necessary to translate these lending plans into actual
commitments. In short, both the volume and composition of the Bank's
assistance will be determined by India's progress in stabilizing the economy
and deepening structural and sector policy reforms.
50.         With respect to macroeconomic Dolicies, the Bank will pay
particular attention to progress made towards achieving the Government's
stabilization targets outlined in para. 13. The Government's fiscal deficit
target of 6.5 percent of GDP in 1991/92 has already been achieved, and a
further reduction to 5 percent of GDP is planned for this fiscal year. Thus,
considerable progress has been made towards the Government's fiscal and other
macroeconomic objectives underlying the country assistance strategy discussed
in December 1991 when a SAL/SAC was approved by the Board. However, the
fiscal adjustment underway will increasingly need to pay attention to the
quality of this adjustment and include measures to ensure that it does not
erode India's long term growth prospect--by reducing spending for the social
sectors and infrastructure. With respect to structural reforms, substantial
progress has already been made in line with the objectives outlined in the
SAL/SAC. Further progress will be expected in liberalizing the trade reRime
at a pace sufficient to reach the government target of a trade regime free of
quantitative restrictions with an average tariff of 25 percent within about
three years; and establishing full convertibility of the rupee for current
account transactions within the next two to three years. Tax reforms wilT be
expected to broaden the tax base, reduce the role of taxes on international
trade, reduce the number of excise tax rates and exemptions and take further
steps toward development of a full-fledged VAT. Further progress in reforming
industrial policies will be measured by continued reductions in the number of
sectors still reserved for public investment or requiring government approval;
improved incentives for foreign investment; and passing of legislation to
provide firms greater flexibility in employment decisions. Progress in
reforming financial sector policies has already exceeded the objectives
outlined in the December 1991 SAL/SAC, but further progress has been delayed
by the securities market scandal in which both domestic and foreign banks were
involved. However, the pace of financial sector reforms is expected to
accelerate in the next few months and will be indicated by continued



- 23 -
reductions in reserve requirements with a view to reaching the government 10
percent target in the next two-to-three years; continued reductions in the
Implicit subsidies for lending to the priority sectors; measures to increase
competition and the role of the private sector in the banking system; and
Improved banking supervision and prudential regulations. Progress in
reforming public enterprises will be measured by the extent to which the
Government further reduces the number of sectors reserved for public sector
investment; resolves the problems of chronically loss-making public
enterprises; reduces its holdings in public enterprises; further reduces
budgetary support to public enterprises; and introduces an institutional
framework increasing managerial autonomy and enabling public enterprises to be
run as profit-oriented concerns.
51.         India's progress in achieving high rates of growth and in poverty
alleviation will depend not only on successful implementation of its
macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform program, but also on the extent
to which key sectoral reforms are carried out. In agriculture, progress needs
to be achieved on several frontss phased introduction of market-based pricing
of agricultural inputs and outputs (including credit) along with the gradual
opening of agriculture to International trade; improved operation and
maintenance of the existing irrigation infrastructure assisted by increased
cost recovery from the project beneficiaries; revisions in irrigation
investment planning so as to accord highest priority to the earliest
completion of ongoing, high-pay-off irrigation works; and implementation of a
forestry management plan which judiciously balances growth and conservation.
In the next year or so, the Government is expected to have formulated an
agricultural strategy to accelerate growth in rainfed areas, improve the
policy framework, and gradually open igriculture to international trade.
Besides this, and progress in the medium-term targets in Table 2, the Bank
will also pay particular attention to cost recovery and, regarding the rural
credit system, reductions in overdue loans to farmers.
52.         Regarding oil and gas, progress in reforming the sector will be
indicated bys opening of trade in crude oil and oil products; increased role
of the private sector in exploration, production, refining and distribution;
and substantial divestiture of public enterprises in the sector. Progress in
improving the power sector's performance will be measured by: the extent to
which the Government commercializes the central and State utilities; Increases
tariffs and collection rates to bring revenue in line with long-term marginal
costs and thus increases internal resource contribution to investments; and
provides an adequate framework for private investment in power generation,
transmission and distribution. With respect to infrastructure, the Bank will
pay particular attention to: the formulation of a comprehensive strategy to
accelerate the development of India's Infrastructure with emphasis on
highways, ports, and telecommunications; improvements in compliance with
fitnancial covenants in ongoing projects; sector-wide improvement in cost
recovery; increased internally generated revenues of municipal governments to
create the fiscal basis for the urgently needed upgrading of urban
infrastructure; institutional restructuring to provide to the agencies in the
sector more administrative and financial autonomy; and increased participation
of the private sector.
53.         Risk Management.  At 8.5 percent, India accounts for a large share
of IBRD's portfolio. If adjustment lending proceeds as expected, this share
would marginally exceed the 10 percent guideline in the middle of the 1990s,
before gradually returning to about 9.7 percent toward the end of the 1990s.
During the next several years, along vith the IDF, the Bank would cover a



- 24 -
major part of India's external financing needs. There is little margin to
acconmodate unexpected financing gaps that could emerge, for example, from a
continued recession in OECD countries or sharply reduced OECD aid budgets.
Thus, the Bank should manage its risk and exposure carefully.
54.         Accordingly, IBRD lending will reflect progress in stabilizing and
reforming the economy. Failure to make significant progress in stabilizing
and reforming the economy (along the lines outlined in paras. 50-52) would
affect India's creditworthiness negatively and this should trigger reductions
in adjustment lending and investment lending requiring for its viability
significant prior sector policy adjustments. In the event of broad-based
policy slippage, IBRD lending would be reduced to one or two operations a year
to conserve headroom to support stabilization and structural reform efforts in
the future, while IDA funds would be used exclusively for poverty-related
projects in agriculture and the social sectors.
5S.         There are downside risks to the Bank's assistance strategy.
Failure to sustain the pace of stabilization and reform because of social
reaction to the adverse consequences of the adjustmept program (e.g., labor
retrenchment, subsidy reductions, and higher user fees) is the most important
one. It could slow the pace of reform and jeopardize its sustainability.
Through consultation and debate, the Government's management of the politics
of reform has focussed on forging a consensus to sustain the process. It has
clearly articulated the need for continuing adjustment, and sought actively
the cooperation of political parties and various interest groups, including
organized labor. Inadequate transitional balance of payments support is a
second key risk. Failure to obtain timely and sufficient official assistance
would undermine domestic political support for reforms, and technically
complicate the implementation of the adjustment program. However, donors have
responded positively thus far to India's requests for balance of payments
support. Overall pledges during the September 1991 and July 1992 Aid
Consortium meetings totalled each about US$7 billion from multilateral and
bilateral sources. Finally, adverse developments in the external environment,
particularly developments that would effect negatively non-debt and
concessional flows to India, would complicate the management of the balance of
payments and cause delay in the implementation of reforms or an increase in
their cost. The Bank will continue to monitor Intdia's external payments
situation closely paying particular attention to export performance, foreign
investment, and to the effects of the external environment on the trade and
capital account.
PART III. TIM SOCIAL SAPETY NET
A. The Social Sectors
56.         Key Social Programs:  India has established an extensive array of
social programs (Annex 1). Among the most important ares (a) the programs in
primary education, non-formal education, and adult education; (b) the primary
health care program which covers maternal and child health and family
planning; (c) endemic and communicable disease control programss (d) the
Public Distribution System (PDS) as a source of family food security; (e) the
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Program which provides pre-school
education and supplementary nutrition for young children and pregnant and
lactating women (PLW); and (f) a number of employment and income-generation
programs including the rural-based Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY) and urban-based



- 25 -
Nehru Rozgar Yojana (NRY). Over the last twenty years, India has developed an
extensive infrastructure to support all of these programs.
57.         The Minimum Needs Program or Social Safety Net.  Since the start
of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1980), the Government has recognized that for its
poorest populations, a core of essential social services must be provided. It
has therefore given priority to 12 special programs selected from the range of
social sector schemes and has referred to them as the Minimum Needs Program
(NNP) or Social Safety Net. These programs cover primary and adult education,
rural health, rural water supply and sanitation, rural roads, rural electri-
fication and housing, domestic cooking energy, urban slum improvement, nutri-
tion and food security for poor families through the Public Distribution
System (PDS). The employment and income-generation programs are also
considered a part of the Social Safety Net.
58.         Social Expenditures.  India (both Center and States) currently
spends about 8.4 percent of GDP to support its social programs, including the
Minimum Needs Program or Social Safety Net. Public expenditure outlays for
the social sectors rose from about 16 percent under the First Five-Year Plan
to about 18 percent under the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992-97). This level of
effort, or social allocation ratio, is low when compared with Indonesia, China
and other countries at similar levels of development as India. The MNP or
social safety net, is funded both by the Center and the States. Some
programs, such as rural roads and rural housing, are fully financed by the
States. Others, like rural water supply, sanitation and energy, are shared by
the Center and the States. The Center carefully monitors the programs which
form the MNP or social safety nct and it is a key component of the Annual Plan
discussions which are held with the States. Since the Center funds a signifi-
cant portion of State Annual Plans, it has considerable leverage in influ-
encing the MNP. The MNP claimed around 48 percent of total (Center and
States) public social sector outlays under the Fifth Plan, but declined to 42
percent under the Sixth Plan, 39 percent under the Seventh Plan and is
estimated to be around 38 percent under the Eighth Five-Year Plan. A reversal
of this trend is a critical part of the fiscal restructuring which is being
undertaken by the Government as a part of its broader macroeconomic stabili-
zation and structural reform program (para 6). Targets, Expenditures, Plan
Outlays and the methods of funding and monitoring the implementation of the
MNP or social safety net are shown in Annez 2.
59.         The Status of Human Capital in India.  Despite this investment in
social programs, the status of human capital in India remains severely under-
developed. According to the UNDP's Human Development Index (HDI), India ranks
121 among 160 countries. About 230 million people continue to live below the
poverty line and the average life expectancy is only 59.1 years. Infant mor-
tality is about 90 per 1,000 live births. More than half the children under
five years of age are underweight and about 80 percent of all pregnant and
lactating women are anemic. Maternal mortality at 40 per 10,000 live births
is about 300 times greater than in the better-off developed countries. The
mean years of schooling of persons over 25 years of age is only 2.4 years.
Only 48 percent of the adults in India are literate. In addition, there
remain wide disparities in the level of human capital attainment in India. In
the northern states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh
there are many districts in which the key social indicators are considerably
worse than all-India averages and in which, for example, infant mortality
rates are about 180 per 1,000 live births, maternal mortality rates close to
200 per 10,000 live births, more than 75 percent of the children suffer at
least second degree malnutrition, and the rate of female literacy is below 10



- 26 -
percent. Similar disparities exist between urban and rural areasg males and
females; and between the geaeral population compared to the scheduled tribes
and scheduled castes. Indis, thus, has an exceptional problem of human
capital development in a very large region of the country and more broadly
among the more disadvantaged segments of the population wherever they exist.
60.         Critical Social Sector and Safety Net Issues.  India's social
services and programs including the social safety net have consistently suf-
fered from similar problems. These are generally most severe in rural areas,
in the northern and eastern States, and for programs which are targeted at
women, scheduled tribes and scheduled castes. Among the most critical issues
facing the social sectors in general and the safety net specifically are thats
(a) insufficient attention has been given to primary education and primary
health care; (b) social programs have been consistently underfunded at the
expense of non-salary inputs and operation and maintenance; (c) the quality of
most social services has been unacceptably low; (d) social programs operate at
very low levels of efficiency; (e) the effectiveness of several key social
programs has been limited, with improvements being relative to the admini-
strative capacity of the States; (f) there has been a serious mismatch between
the needs of the disadvantaged and the allocation of resources for social
programs; (g) the lack of coordination has led to duplication of efforts in
social sector programs; and (h) relatively little attention has been paid
until recently to the possible impact of adjustment and economic reform on the
weaker sections of society.
3. The Social Cost of Stabilization and Reform
61.         In many of the adjustment experiences of the 19809, the burden of
stabilization and reform has fallen disproportionately on the lowest income
groups. Fiscal retrenchment has frequently affected social programs
negatively and has reduced the delivery of social services such as nutrition,
which improve the living standards of the poor and retard a countries' efforts
at building its human resource base. Inflation has also eroded the incomes of
the poorest groups, while a slow and sometimes elusive recovery, has reduced
their employment opportunities.
62.         Two features of India's development and adjustment experience
could make the country's stabilization and reform process more equitable. The
first is India's good management of its adjustment process. Unlike many other
adjusting economies that postponed fiscal adjustment, the reduction of India's
fiscal imbalances has been pronounced and took place early in the adjustment
process, the devaluation of the exchange rate was sufficiently large, and the
structural reforms are generally proceeding at a rapid pace. Experiences
elsewhere suggest that this holds the promise of a rapid reduction of infla-
tion and recovery of growth. In addition, the correction of India's macro-
economic imbalances and the reform of its policies began before the growth
process was entirely disrupted. Growth was as high as 5.6 percent in 1990/91,
fell only to about 2 percent in 1991/92 and is expected to recover to 3.0-3.5
percent in 1992/93. The second feature which is noteworthy, is that since
Independence, the country has put into place a wide range of social programs
that benefit the poor. ihile some of these programs are in urgent need of
reassessment and improvement, the fact that they exist Is a considerable
advantage.
63.         However, in the next few years, unless specific measures are
taken, the poor may suffer from the stabilization and reform measures now
being Implemented. Fiscal restralnt has led to cutbacks in public programs



- 27 -
benefiting the poorg primary education, primary health care, ICDS, and the
Nehru Rozgar Yojana (NRY) employment program have all had lower budgetary
allocations in real terms between 1991192 and 1992/93. The structural reforms
that have been Implemented or are underway, e.g., exchange rate adjustment and
reductions in subsidies and associated increases in administered prices, have
led to an increase in the price of many Important goods and services. A 30
percent increase in the price of fertilizer has been followed by the decontrol
of most fertilizer prices in September 1992, and will trigger increases in the
range of 80 percent to 200 percent. In addition, in the last two years, the
price of cereals has increased by a cumulative 50 percent, and the price of
oil products by 30 percent. In the last year, the subsidized price of wheat
sold through the Public Distribution System (PDS) has increased by 20 percent,
and increases of 30 percent are expected for rice and sugar. Therefore, while
providing the foundation for more rapid, sustainable and labor-intensive
growth, the cha.:jes in the incentive structure which are underway should bene-
fit the poor in the medium-term, but are also likely to have a negative short-
term effect on their living standards. Finally, restructuring of public
enterprises will require a program of accelerated training and redeployment of
workers as well as wider application of the Voluntary Retirement Scheme tVRS)
for redundant workers. Vhile public enterprise workers are generally well
off, and they will be offered compen-sation, such retrenchment is likely to
have negative local employment effects and would require an extension of
employment programs in urban areas.
C. The Challen e of djueitmat in the Social Sectors
64.         Despite the potential negative impact of adjustment on the poor,
the adjustment program provides an opportunity, as well as a challenge, for
strengthening the social safety net in India. As part of its overall
adjustment process, the Government of India is reconsidering its involvement
in a range of economic activities. In addition, it is also moving
increasingly toward allowing a greater role for the market in a wide array of
economic activities. As India moves in these directions, the Government is
intent onu
*     directing greater government attention and commitment to raising
the level of human capital In India, through both the creation of
improved enabling environmeAts and through its own efforts;
e     directing greater resources to key social programs;
o     seeing that social programs are operated at a level of quality
that attracts appropriate clients and produces an acceptable
minimum level of output;
*     focusing greater attention on the efficiency of social programs,
trying to improve the level of output compared to the expenditure
made;
a     targeting programs increasingly on those most in need; this will
require a special effort at allocating resources
disproportionately toward the north, rural areas, urban slums,
women, and scheduled tribes and scheduled castes; and
e     improving the financing patterns for programs to ensure that%
resources are available when needed; there is a sufficient level
of expenditure on operation and maintenance to make programs



- 28 -
effective and efficient; public subsidies are targeted on those
most in need of them; and, that costs are recovered from those
able to pay for programs where it is appropriate, such as tertiary
education and higher level health care.
65.         The GOI intends to make progress in all of the above areas.  In
terms of program development, this means actions to:
o     increase enrollments in primary education, especially in
disadvantaged areas and especially for girls, and make modest
improvements in the quality of education;
e     expand the coverage of primary health care to areas not now served
and improve the quality of basic care;
a     expand the most important communicable disease programs with
improved technologies being increasingly used;
o     expand the coverage of the ICDS program to poor and especially to
tribal areas, and strengthen at least the program of food
supplementation that is part of the ICDS;
o     expand the PDS into disadvantaged areas not now covered and make
consistent progress in reducing the share of PDS subsidies that go
those who do not need them;
O     improve the effectiveness and efficiency of key employment
programs and expand them into areas effected by economic reform;
and
e     establish enhanced mechanisms for dealing with the implications of
the reform for retrenched workers.
By moving in these directions, it will be possible to make substantial
progress in enhancing the social safety net in the medium-term of seven to ten
years (Anex 3).
D. 2he Social Safety Net Sector Adlustmant Program
66.         Overview.  The GOI has recognized that it must take steps to miti-
gate the transitional costs of adjustment and set a better basis for the medi-
um term development of key social programs. It has constituted a Social
Safety Net Sector Adjustment Program (the Program) which covers primary educa-
tion, primary health care, disease control programs, ICDS and food security,
and the retraining and redeployment of retrenched workers from PSEs. The
details are outlined in the Letter of Development Policy in Annex 4 and in
paragraphs 71-101.
67.         Over the last 45 years, the Center and State Governments have
invested in a range of programs in order to improve the social indicators of
the country. While the policy approach of the Government in this area in-
cluded several specialized initiatives, the strategy has been to assist the
population as a whole working on a Statewide basis. This strategy has not
been successful with the result that the social indicators of India remain
unimpressive. Following adoption of the Eighth Five-Year Plan by the National
Development Council (NDC), the Center and State governments have established a
new policy of targeting intensive assistance on a district-wide basis for dis-



- 29 -
advantaged population groups selected separately and according to agreed cri-
teria for each social sectors primary education, primary health, disease
control and nutrition. The goal of this policy is to rapidly raise the social
indicators of the most disadvantaged groups in each sector at least up to the
national average. This new policy of intensive targeting of social sector
assistance to the least disadvantaged groups represents a major departure from
previous policies in social sector development.
68.         The Program will seek to ensure that the level of effort in the
social sectors in general and for the MNP or social safety net in particular,
is at least maintained in the current difficult fiscal situation, that this
effort is ernhanced in key areas where India has not performed well, and that a
new but temporary social safety net is created to meet fast emerging human
resource needs in the industrial sector. In addition, the Program would
support a new policy initiative for district-based planning and implementation
so as to enhance local participation in the development and implementation of
social sector programs. The proposed Constitutional amendment to establish
district and village-level administration (Panachayati Raj bill) is now being
considered and would, if adopted, be complementary to this new policy.
69.         The main actions taken by the GOI (Annex 5), and the policy
changes which are supported by the proposed credit ares
(a)   Sector Policies
0     changes in the National Policy on Education to give emphasis to
primary education, quality improvement and expansion, and decen-
tralized planning;
0     adjustments in the National Health Policy to give emphasis to a
new medical and dental manpower training strategy, and revised
targets and strategies for major disease control programs;
e     the formulation of a new national Nutrition Policy;
o     implementation of the National Development Council (NDC) approved
Action Plan for the Revamping of the Family Welfare Program.
(b)   Targeting of Resources to Disadvantaged Regions and Groups
o     implementing a new national district-based Primary Education De-
velopment Program which gives priority to educationally backward
districts and districts where the demand for primary education has
increased, as well as the increased enrollment of girls;
a     the enhanced provision of primary health care and safe motherhood
inputs in 90 districts where maternal mortality rates are above
the national average;
*     concentratU   if the disease control programs in districts which
have been identified and classified as highly endemic;
e     focusing the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) on 180
focal districts where the infant mortality rate and poverty ratio
is higher than the national average;



a 30 -
O     the operation of the National Renewal Fund to among other activi-
ties, pay compensation/severance pay and cover the costs of re-
training and redeployment of industrial sector workers who are
affected by the PS refonm program.
(c)   Reorienting Financial Resources in the Social Sector
o     substantial increases by the Center and States of Eighth Five-Year
Plan allocations for primary education;
o     holding constant in nominal terms, the Center's Eighth Five-Year
Plan for higher educationg
o     increasing the financial norm allowances for supplementary feeding
under the ICDS program;
0     increasing tuition fees at institutions of higher and technical
education;
o     increasing selected fees at tertiary level hospitals;
e     agreeing to mobilize additional non-budgetary resources and pro-
gressively increasing the proportion of non-budgetary support for
higher and technical education and tertiary health care.
(d)   Key Program Chaes to Enhance Efficiency and Effectiveness
o     establishing Minimum Levels of Learning (ULL) to streamline cur-
riculum and focus on basic competencies in primary education;
a     revamping Operation Blackboard to provide additional class-
rooms and teachers in each primary school;
*     introducing the birth-based approach to determining the work rou-
tines and training of para-medical staff in the primary health
system;
0     enhancing the provision of drugs and medicines for primary health
care and disease control programs;
a     introducing the synchronized delivery of services at the Anganwadi
level in the ICDS program;
o     Instituting new and improved management information systems for
primary education, health and ICDS to improve program monitoring
and supervision;
e     utilizing micro-level district planning and disaggregated target
setting in the development and implementatioui of targeted social
safety net programs.
70.         The proposed Credit would therefore assist the Government ins
(a)   supporting existing Social Safety Net programs during the process
of severe fiscal adjustment;



- 31 -
(b)   promoting measures to achieve greater cost-effectiveness and ex-
panding the coverage of the social safety net in the most disad-
vantaged areas in India; and
(c)   developing a new social safety net program, the National Renewal
Fund (NRP), to facilitate Industrial restructuring.
SuMortLna the Existint Social Safety Net
71.         To maintain the quality of the fiscal adjustment, the
stabilization and adjustment program should not have a negative impact on the
social safety net. Therefore, while the original FY92193 budget for the key
Social Safety Net programs anounced in April 1992 reflected a cut in real
terms, in October 1992, the GOI provided additional resources to ensure that
the budgets for these programs were maintained in real terms at the 1991/92
levels. An additional US$92.0 million was provided through a special alloca-
tion to the FY92193 budgets for the primary education, primary health, disease
control and ICDS programs. The Government has now given the commitment that
at a minimum, the funding of these key social safety net programs would be
maintained in real terms until the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period in
1997. It has also agreed that external assistance to the Social Safety Net
would be a net addition to Plan outlays. This is a fundamental change from
previous policy.
Achievina Greater Cost-Effectiveness and  E LinU   the Cowerage  of the Social
safety net
72.         Planning and Management.  GO'  Program of Strengthening the
Social Safety Net (the Program) includes activities to increase the efficiency
and effectiveness of the various key programs. This would be accomplished
largely through the establishment of a new and revised policy environment.
New and revised national health, education and nutrition policies have been
formulated and will be promulgated. More systematic targeting and the
enhancement and expansion of program to focus on the neediest groups and
regions and improve the quality of service delivery has been decided upon.
The actions already taken by GOl in each policy area and on each program are
discussed below and further outlined in the Policy Reform Matrix in Amex 5.
The GOl has affirmed that targeting and enhancing the social safety net will
require a serious effort at strengthening coordination, planning and manage-
ment of those programs to deal with weaknesses cited earlier (para. 60). It
has therefore established a Standing Social Sector Coordinating Committee
which includes Secretaries of the Go0 and the Chief Secretaries of selected
States to coordinate the development of the Program. This Comnittee will
develop a coordination strategy for the implementation of the Program, espe-
cially in those targeted districts where key programs would be focused.
During negotiations, the 001 reconfiuied that in lmplemnting the improved
targeting, it would give additional emphasis to its current policy of
community participation, beneficiary assessment and involvement in the design
and implementation of the enhanced social programs especially where scheduled
castes, scheduled tribes and other disadvantaged groups would be the main
beneficiaries. In addition, 00I has started a number of high-level reviews of
the coordination of selected social programs such as ICDS, primary health
care, rural water and sanitation and primary education, to enhance the
linkages among these programs which are operated by different agencies and are
essential to meeting the objectives of the Program. GO has also taken steps
to improve the management information systems (MIS) for the key programs of
the Social Safety Net. New and improved MIS for primary education, health



- 32 -
(primary health care and disease control) and ICDS have been developed and are
being expanded nationwide based on experience in the pilot States. The en-
hanced information base will provide for a more empirical basis for planning,
creating and/or strengthening institutional capacities which are now weak and
introduce cost-effectiveness criteria into the planning and funding process.
Primary Education
73.         Background and Major Issues.  Under the Program, the Center and
State governments have made a substantially improved policy and resource com-
mitment to the development of primary education (Anex 6). Progress toward
universal literacy in India has been slow and uncertain. The overall literacy
rate in 1991 was 52 percent; for women, the rate was just 40 percent. The
root of the problem is an exceptionally weak primary education system. In
1987, 70 percent of rural females and 43 percent of rural males above six
years of age had never enrolled in any educational institution. On a national
basis, 47 percent of all children fail to complete five years of primary edu-
cation; the dropout rates for girls and minority students are much higher.
These averages mask considerable differences among the States, and within
States, among districts. In 200 of the nation's 450 districts, female
literacy rates are less then 25 percent. Of these districts, 185 are located
in six Statess Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh and Orissa. The lack of basic education is directly associated with
poverty: 59 percent of rural primary school-age children who were not
enrolled in 1987 came from families whose income fell in the lowest 40 percent
but only 19 percent came from families whose income was in the top 40 percent.
74.         The principal issues in primary education are (a) to reduce the
very high rate of 47 percent of dropouts and the even higher rate of 63
percent at the upper primary level, and (b) to improve student learning. The
,OI estimates that 95 percent of children are within walking distance of a
primary school, but 42 percent of rural children leave school because of a
lack of interest and academic failure.   For girls, this figure is 50 percent.
Equally important, student learning achievement is very low. For example, in
Tamil Nadu an *educationally advanced" State, students completing grade five
have mastered less than half of the language and aritbmetic curricula.
75.         Reform Agenda and Recent Initiatives.  Inadequate financing by the
States and the Center, weak targeting of resources, and inefficient curricula
have contributed substantially to the above outcomes. For the Eighth Five-
Year Plan period (1992-1997), the GOI and the States have agreed to policy
changes that wills (a) target national resources on educationally backward
districts and expand the provision of services; (b) simplify the range of pro-
grams and curricula; and (c) give emphasis to investments in the quality of
education to reduce student dropout. These policy changes recognize that a
sustained, targeted and much better financed program is required if signifi-
cant progress towards the goal it to be achieved. In the Eighth Plan period,
central assistance to primary education would be increased fourfold to Rs.
28,800 million; State Plan investments for primary education have been
increased by a factor of three to Rs. 63,210 million.
76.         The National Policy on Education of 1986 has been revised in 1992
to introduce changes which emphasize the priority to universalizing primary
education through disaggregated target setting and decentralized planning,
better targeting of females and scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students;
improved quality; and the provision of adequate budgetary resources. The GOI
has ranked all districts in the country on the basis of literacy rates, total



- 33 -
enrollments, female enrollments, and the demand for primary education.  The
COX has also developed and Introduced a strategy for the intensified devel-
aomnt of primry education, giving priority to the districts which are ranked
as educationally backward as well as districts where total literacy campaigns
hove been successful resulting In Increased demnd for primary education.
Further, GOI has developed prototype District Action Plans to be used in the
implementation strategy for the new initiative of a national district-based
Primary Education Development Program.   GOI has also changed key aspects of
the Operation Blackboard Program and is implementing an enhanced program which
calls for the provision of additional classrooms and teachers per school as
well as flexible program delivery to meet specific local needs. As a central
feature of all of these initiatives, the Department of Education has developed
Management Information Systems to monitor progress of primary education
programs especially as regards total new enrollments and the additional
enrollments of girls.
77.         The centerpiece policy change and instrument is the new national
Primary Education Development Program which will channel Center and State
assistance to support primary education improvement efforts, primarily in low-
literacy districts, and also for a limited number of districts where success-
ful total literacy campaigns have generated significant increases in demand
for primary schooling. This program augments less well-targeted grant-in-aid
programs with the sustained and targeted development efforts which are
required to substantially improve the capacity of communities and schools to
motivate children to stay in school and to master the curriculum.
78.         Decentralization of educational planning and management to the
district will enable programs to be tailored to specific local conditions.
Plans will be developed at the district level, with assistance from State and
national education authorities. These will be appraised by the GOI and the
States, with criteria that emphasize stronger community governance of schools;
better teacher training and improved availability of textbooks and learning
materials; more female teachers, special scholarships to improve retention of
girl students; and improved facilities, including sanitation and water supply.
The initial Action Plan for the program is phased over the balance of the
Eighth and the Ninth Five-Year Plans, with a target of initiating programs in
300 of the nation's 450 districts. GOI has developed and piloted the use of
new funding mechanisms to ensure that the additional resources required for
the national district-based Primary Education Development Program are success-
fully passed on to the targeted priority districts.
79.         Further, GOI has taken steps to encourage additional resource
mobilization. Initial action has already been taken at the elite specialized
institutions. The Indian institutes of Management (IlMs) raised tuition fees
for post-graduate programs from Rs. 5001600 per year in 1991/92 to Rs. 6000 in
1992/93. The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have increased tuition
fees for post-graduate programs from Rs. 100-150 per term in 1991/92 to Rs.
750-1500 per term. Other miscellaneous fees have been raised as well. Other
options for resource mobilization by the Polytechnicr and Engineering Colleges
are under consideration. In the interim, private Polytechnics regulated by
the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) have begun to increase
tuition charges with the approval of the States.
Primary Health
.80.        Backaroun%. and MLUor Issues.  The development and strengthening of
the rural health infrastructure through the three-tier system of health sub-



- 34 -
centers, Primary Health Centers (PHCs) and Community Health Centers (CHCs) for
the delivery of health and family welfare services to rural communities will
continue to be G0I's strategy during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. However, the
lack of buildings, shortages of staff and inadequate provision of pharma-
ceuticals, medical supplies and materials and equipment still constitute major
impediments to the full operation of these units.
81.         Reform ARenda and Recent Initiatives.  To increase performance,
the GOI has decided to give priority to consolldation rather than a major
expansion of the primary health network. This would be achieved through:
(a) strengthening physical facilities, including the completion of construc-
tion of centers and staff quarters, as well as the repair and maintenance of
existing facilities; (b) providing essential equipment; (c) encouraging States
to fill all vacant posts within a defined time frame and train the staff; and
ld) increasing the budgetary provision for other operation and maintenance
costs to ensure the enhanced supply of pharmaceuticals, dressings and other
materials where necessary.
82.         The GOl has started to supplement the existing provision of
pharmaceuticals to sub-centers by providing additional quantities of
pharmaceuticals to the extent of about Rs. 4,000 per sub-center per year under
the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Program in identified districts. The
National Development Council (NDC) has approved an Action Plan and Policy for
Revamping the National Family Welfare Program 'hich includes (a) improving the
quality and outreach of family velfare services in rural areas; (b) adopting
a differential strategy for districts in the implementation of the revamped
program; (c) focusing attention on the backward districts of the country;
and (d) enhancing the provision for safe motherhood interventions, especially
in districts where maternal mortality rates are above the national average.
0OI has started the implementation of its new policy for the operationali-
zation of the rural health system which includes health sub-centers and
Primary Health Centers (PHCs). GOO has selected, oan the basis of higher-than-
average Infant, yong child and materal mortality, 90 districts for Inten-
sified implenetatios of the revised and enhanced primary health care program.
It has also developed an implementation strategy for the provision of the
enhanced primary health and safe motherhood interventions in these 90 targeted
districts, including the provision of special MCI facilities, pharmaceuticals,
equipment and the training of staff (Annex 6).
Disease Control Programs
83.         Background and Maior Issues  Communicable diseases such as
leprosy, malaria and tuberculosis continue to pose serious challenges to
national development efforts. In addition to high mortality, these diseases
cause tremendous pain and suffering ranging from Internal organ damage and
brain injury to disabling anemia and gross deformities of face and limbs.
Beyond their toll on individual illness and death, they have insidious effects
on the society and impede national and individual development. At present,
India has 2.2 million cases of leprosy-with 0.45 million new cases are
detected annually. About 25 percent of untreated leprosy patients suffer from
deformities due to nerve damage. Suffering due to social stigma-is
significant and leprosy patients face social discrimination and the risk of
loss of employment and rejection from their families and communities.
84.         Malaria is resurging as one of the leading causes of illness in
India. About 2 million cases are recorded every year. Its impact is severe
on infants, young children and pregnant mothers with fetal death and premature



- 35 -
delivery. It is a serious impediment to development and its socio-economic
impact affects various sectors including agriculture. The direct costs of
incapacitating malaria Include lost wages, cost of treatment, and the expense
of traveling to seek care. It reduces productivity, augments pressure on
health services, increases school absenteeism and results in lost investments
in child health. The burden of tuberculosis is also staggering in India.
About 1.5 million cases are identified every year, the annual risk of infec-
tion and case fatality rate are high with more than 300,000 deaths every year.
Tuberculosis deaths cluster in the segment of the population that is economi-
cally most productive. Hence, further consequences of adult deaths on
children and other dependents are significant. These diseases remain, there-
fore, among the top priorities for action in India.
85.         The major issues facing leprosy control include inadequacies in
coverage, disability and ulcer care, detection of female patients, public
awareness and social stigma. Overriding constraints facing the tuberculosis
control program include weak management, inadequate utilization of health
workers and sectoral resources, reliance on and abuse of radiology for diag-
nosis which is not cost-effective, and the use of conventional and lengthy
chemotherapy regimens which contribute to low treatment completion and cure
rates. Constraints facing malaria control include inadequacies in logistical
support for residual insecticide spraying, transport and accessibility in
difficult terrain, non-acceptability of the spraying operation by populations
at risk, vector susceptibility to insecticides, plasmodium falciparum resis-
tance to chloroquine, organizational deficiencies including weak technical
leadership, and vacancies and frequent changes at key posts. Extra-sectoral
issues include floods, periodic migration and population movement, aggregation
of labor connected with development projects, ecological changes connected
with deforestation and extension of irrigation.
86.         Reform AMenda and Recent Initiatives.  The government's reform
agenda includes several initiatives including intensified targeting and policy
and strategy adjustments of the major disease control programs. These include
the use of appropriate technology; appropriate control procedures and
standards; organizational arrangements to enhance sustainability; quality
enhancement of service delivery through increased emphasis on training,
retraining, and non-salary Inputs; appropriate resource allocations;
mobilizing EGOs and the private sector; and strengthening the role of States
and districts in program planning and implementation capabilities. In leprosy
control, multidrug therapy will be used to enhance patients compliance and to
reduce drug resistance; one to two-year curative regimen courses will be used
for paucibacillary and multibacillary leprosy respectively, instead of the
inadequate life-long dapsone monotherapy. Districts responsibilities for
local implementation will be strengthened through District Leprosy Societies
(Annex 6). For tuberculosis control, changes in program strategy and policy
include the promotion of more cost-effective use of short-course chemotherapy
of 6-8 months; bacteriological diagnosis; focus on treatment completion
through staff retraining and use of registry system measuring progress toward
cure; and strengthening program management and logistical network. Similar
adjustments will be adopted for malaria control including the adoption of the
Modified Plan of Operation which includes malariogenic stratification and
prioritization of areas and population groups. For malaria, leprosy and
tuberculosis, the districts with high levels of eademicity have been seleCted
for priority iMplGmutation of the revised and enahnced disease control
programs. For HIV/AIDS control, the government is promulgating new standards
for condom quality and has initiated, with IDA assistance, a control program
with a balanced multi-pronged strategy focusing on key actions for promoting



- 36 -
public awareness, blood safety, surveillance, clinical skills and sexually-
transmitted disease control.
87.         Additional initiatives in the health sector are also being under-
taken. A review of the National Health Policy of 1982 has started with the
objective of (a) establishing more appropriate goals and targets re: Health
for All by 2000; (b) examining the role of Center and States in the provision
of health services; and (c) identifying those areas of the health sector where
the Center will remain active. The National Development Council has estab-
lished a Committee including the Chief Ministers of five States and the Minis-
ters of Finance, Human Resources Development, Health and Family Welfare to
assess all aspects of medical and dental education including the present and
future availability of medical manpower, and to make recommendations for
starting new medical schools in the private sector and/or expanding existing
intake capacity. The planning and analysis capacity of the Department of
Health is being strengthened through the nationwide expansion of the Health
Management Information System (HMIS) which has been piloted in one State, will
be expanded soon to ten States and introduced in a phased manner in the
remainder of the States. The Bureau of Planning is being strengthened to have
a health planning and economics capability. Further, the GOI has increased
fees by 100 percent in the pay wards of centrally-funded tertiary level hos-
pitals.
Nutrition
88.         Background and Maior Issues:  The Integrated Child Development
Services (ICDS) program is the country's principal program to combat child and
maternal malnutrition. It now serves 139 million beneficiaries primarily
children under the age of six, and pregnant and nursing mothers who reside in
some of the poorest blocks in India. The program is fianmced as a centrally-
sponsored scheme but is implemented by the States with the expenses being
shared by the Center and the States. Six services including nutrition supple-
mentation, health check-ups and referrals, immunization, and non-formal pre-
school education are offered in rural, tribal and urban (slum) blocks. There
are two major issues with the program. First, targeting of beneficiaries is
important since many blocks with critically malnourished groups, such as
scheduled caste and tribal populations, are not fully covered. Second, the
quality of implementation is weak, so there are clearly efficiency gains which
can be realized by better implementation strategies. These issues were
thoroughly investigated in a recent comprehensive evaluation of the program
undertaken by the National Institute for Public Cooperation and Child Develop-
ment (NIPCCD), India's premier research institution on child welfare. This
evaluation, while noting progress in the reduced incidence of malnutrition in
ICDS blocks, pointed out several major shortcomings of the program, including
the absence of a synchronized supply of services in many blocks, inadequate
training and supervision of staff, and shortfalls in number of days of supple-
mentary feeding, which should be 300 days per year.
89.         Reform Agenda and Recent Initiatives.  During the Eighth Plan
(Annex 6), the Government has started to address the issue of targeting by
expanding the progra to 200 blocks located In the targeted 180 focal
districts vith the greatest amber of the extremly vulnerable population.
The selection of blocks and districts for the expanded ICDS was based on
objective criteria including the poverty ratio, proportion of scheduled caste
and scheduled tribe population, and crude birth rate. Blocks of extreme
vulnerability are selected first. In an effort to reach areas inhabited by
particularly vulnerable groups but not covered by the existing Arganwadi



- 37 -
(ICDS) centers, the GOI provided an average of 5 percent additional anganwadi
centers in the existing blocks, thereby "in filling" places wherever needed.
These actions ensure better targeting and sustainability of the program.
90.         To improve the quality of ICDS, the Government has accepted and
has begun Implementation of the key recommendations of NIPCCD evaluation. It
has issued operational guidelines and strategies focussing especially on
ensuring the convergence of services (health, nutrition, and pre-school educa-
tion) at the Anganmadi level; expert committees have been appointed in each
State to identify State-specific causes for feeding shortfalls and to design
methods to overcome these bottlenecks; expanded training targets have been
agreed and added Importance given to training. Failure to adhere to agreed
programs by States will result in budgetary cuts by the Center. The GO? has
also taken steps to ensure that supervision is improved and that no more than
20 anganwadis are supervised by one supervisor, and that the supervisors'
mobility is improved by encouraging them to buy small motorcycles against
commercial loans. The timing of operation of Anganwadi Centers has been
adjusted to facilitate younger girls attending school. To better monitor
progress in both the quantity and quality of ICDS provision, a computerized
management Information system has been instituted. The first round of results
is already proving useful in monitoring and evaluating ICDS quality across the
country. Lastly, GOI has indicated its resolve to Improve the nutritional
status of the country's vulnerable population by formulating a National
Nutritional Policy for the first time. This policy statement is awaiting
final Cabinet approval.
Public Distribution System
91.         Background and Major Issues.  India's Public Distribution System
(PDS) goes back to 1942 as an attempt to deal with wartime scarcities. It has
three core goals which are to: provide quantity rationing of scare commodities
to the population; stabilize consumer prices; and mitigate poverty and
Increase food consumption of the poor. In 1990, the Bureau of Industrial
Costs and Prices (BICP) concluded a comprehensive study of the PDS. The iden-
tified principal shortcomings of the PDS were: inadequate coverage of low-
income households, inadequate or inappropriate supplies, untargeted
distribution to higher income groups and high operational costs.
92.         Reform Agenda and Recent Initiatives.  As part of the Social
Safety Net Sector Adjustment Program, the GOI in early 1992, announced a Plan
to add 11,000 new Fair Price Shops under the PDS in 1,700 targeted priority
blocks primrily In tribal and drought prone areas, desert development blocks
and certain desigated bill areas. By October 1992, 9,000 new shops had been
opened and 1.9 million new ration cards issued to poor beneficiaries. An
additional 2 million tons of wheat and rice will be moved through the PDS to
these areas. In July 1992, the Advisory Council on PDS started the process of
evolving a national policy on "entitlements, under the PDS. The consensus of
the States is that the PDS should be limited to " the most needy and deserv-
ing." In pursuit of this objective, individual States are lowering the price
of grains to the poorest, and eliminating distribution to better off groups.
Targeting on the basis of geography (the 1,700 priority blocks), income,
registered employment category, land holding, and self-reported income is
being pursued by Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala and Rajasthan.

Employment and Income Generation
93.         Background and Major Issues.  With a labor force of 319 million
persons increasing by 6 to 7 million new entrants each year, open unemployment
of 17 million, and employment growing less rapidly than the labor force, the
Government intends to use existing rural and urban employment creation pro-
grams to provide a safety net for the poor. The Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY)
is a rural-based program and provides funds to panchayst institutions to
finance construction of minor public works with locally hired labor. In
1990-91, 875 million person-days of work were generated with approximately 55
million persons gaining some employment under the program. A recent evalua-
tion of the program undertaken by the Planning Commission suggests that the
welfae benefits of JRY are reasonably well-targeted to the poor, with more
than 70 percent of the person-days used by persons below the poverty line,
more than half utilied by echeddeod castes and scheduled tribes. and more
than 40 percent by the landless. Women did not fare well, receiving only
about 25 percent of employmeat person-days. Asset construction has been rela-
tively unsuccessful. Problems have been encountered in the selection, design
and completion of projects, and maintenance is inadequate. Recent efforts to
decentralize program administration to the panchayat have been hampered by the
uneven development of these institutions. Court rulings which have required
JRY to pay official minimum wages, which are usually above market rates, has
increased the likelihood that many non-poor may access the scheme. The Nehru
Rozgar Yojana (MRY) is the urban version of JRY. The NEY has three programs:
a public works component, a component to encourage micro-enterprise develop-
ment, and an employment through hou ing and shelter upgradation component.
The program has been In operation  eLly three years and no comprehensive evalu-
ations have been conducted.
94.         Reform Agenda and Recent Initiatives.  The GOI has recognized
these problems in the Program and will further concentrate JRY resources in
the most backward districts and introduce more flexibility in program
administration.   NG0s will be asked to take a more important role in monitor-
ing service delivery. Given the importance of the program as a safety net for
the poorest among the rural population, the GOI has earmarked an additional
Rs. 5,000 million in the NRP Employment Generation Fund (para. 100) to augment
JRY resources. As an additional measure to improve targeting, the Government
is considering experimenting with offering only half-day units of employment
and pay in selected districts. This should bring effective earnings below
market rates, and would have the additional benefit of increasing the number
of days of paid employment offered. It could be particularly effective in in-
creasing the number of female beneficiaries, allowing them to earn while main-
taining child care responsibilities. fte COX bas also issued revised guide-
lines to suitably alter the MY, with an emphasis oa better targeting to the
urban areas uhich will be ipacted by the public enterprise reform and indus-
trial restreturing progrm.
95.         In recognition of the fact that much more needs to be done for
women over and above the JRY, ERY and other special schemes aimed at women,
the 0OI has acknowledged that access to credit for women is critical. The GOI
will therefore establish on a pilot and experimental basis, a National Credit
Fund for Women (NCFV) to provide credit to poor and illfterzte rural and urban
women in the informal sector. This Fund would be managed mainly by selected
voluntary organizations and be based on the successful women's Bank created by
the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEfA) in Abmedabad, Gujarat. An
outline of the broad features of the Fund is given in Annex 7.

The National Renewal Fund
96.         Background and Major Issues.  Government investment in central
Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) grew at an average rate of 16 percent p.a in
real terms between 1951 and 1989190, and total cumulative investments stood at
Rs 1,000 billion as of 1989/90. This large investment has yielded an
inadequate return, and moreover has contributed to the fiscal deficit. While
98 of 244 PSEs made losses amounting to Rs 20 billion in 1989/90, only 36 PSEs
could be said to be profitable at a level that would be considered adequate in
the private sector.
97.         Reform Agenda for PSEs.  To improve public enterprise performance,
the Government has adopted a range of measures: (a) the number of sectors
reserved for the public sector has been reduced to eight, and of these, only
one involves manufacturing in defense production; (b) loss-making PSEs are
being referred to the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR)
although some direct closures have also been permitted; (c) budget support is
being withdraw from PiE3 in non-infrastructure sectors; (d) Government
holdings in selected 'SE9, particularly those in competitive-market areas are
to be reduced either through a gradual process of disinvestment of Government
shareholding or where feasible, through outright sale; and (e) competitive
pressures on PSEs are being enhanced through removal of purchase preference
for PSEs, delicensing, and trade liberalization.
98.         While the reform direction is clear, progress has unavoidably been
difficult. With respect to closure of loss-making enterprises, because of the
large number of workers that would be affected, PSEs may be closed only after
due-process requirements have been fulfilled as required under the Sick
Industrial Companies Act (SICA). Additionally, the Government feels
constrained to proceed cautiously in this area. Taking the time to consult
with all affected parties, particularly labor and their representatives so as
to build consensus, is seen as a prerequisite to success. The Government has
also required time to put in place the safety net arrangements without which
progress would quickly grind to a halt. Nevertheless, in a clear signal of
its resolve, the GOI has maintained its timetable for referral of loss-making
PSEs to the BIFR. From 13 loss-making PSE referrals in July 1992, the number
has increased to 33 as of October 1992. It is anticipated that about half of
these cases would be resolved by the end of next year. Resolution would cover
either issuing wind-up orders, or revival strategies which would be negotiated
among the parties concerned. The reform approach avoids revival strategies
that would call for continued Government involvement. However, turn-around
strategies which call for private takeover, e.g., by the workers themselves,
would be favorably considered. To facilitate such plans, the GOI is well
disposed toward write-off of Government loans and other financial
restructuring measures. Moreover, it is envisaged that a number of small
PSEs, e.g. textile units, will be put up for outright sale. Procedures and
other organizational arrangements needed to effect such sales are being
developed.
99.         In PY1991/92, the Government was able to divest Rs 30 billion
worth of shareholding in selected profitable PSEs. In FY1992/93, a further Rs
35 billion are to be divested. A restructuring plan for the National Textile
Corporation (NTC) has been approved by the Cabinet, and calls for a range of
actions including the closure of uneconomic units, the retrenchment of about
70,000 workers with appropriate provisions for compensation, retraining and



- 40 -
redeployment where appropriate; the privatization of some units, and a
modernization program for the remaining units. As of October 1992 under the
NRP's overall operations, 10,000 workers have accepted payments under the
Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS). Vith assistance provided by the Government
of Japan, the GOI has developed restructuring plans for three major PSEs in
the engineering sector. These plans call for product-mix, financial and
organizational restructuring, selective plant closure and associated labor
retrenchment, redeployment and retraining. The plans also call for
modernization investments to be financed from private sources, i.e., joint
venture partners and/or equity issues, and the banking system. With respect
to the reduction of budgetary support to PSEs, the Government has: (a) in the
FY1992/93 budget, reduced by 10X Plan investments in PSEs other than in the
transport and energy sectors; (b) reduced the non-Plan budget support for sick
PSEs to a negligible amount; and (c) stated that Plan and non-Plan support
would be progressively reduced and eliminated by the end of PY1994/95
excluding those for the transport and energy sectors.
100.        Recent Initiative.  The GOI recognized that the setting up of an
effective safety net to provide compensation and transitional support to labor
displaced in the PSE reform process is essential. To that effect, the NRP was
established as a non-statutory instrument within the Ministry of Industry
(-OI) in February 1992. The main objectives of the NRP are to provide (a)
funds for the compensation of employees affected by restructuring or closure
of enterprises in both the public and private sectors; (b) assistance for the
costs of retraining and redeployment of employees as a result of
modernization, technology upgradation and industrial restructuring; and (c)
funds for employment generation schemes in both the organized and unorganized
sectors. The NRF has two constituent windows: the National Renewal Grant
Fund (NGRP) which would act as the social safety net for industrial labor and
deal with payments under the Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS) for PSEs,
compensation to workers in both the public and private sectors affected by
closure, or labor rationalization due to rehabilitation schemes as recomended
by the BIPR, and compensation to workers affected by closure of private sector
units already under liquidation, under schemes as recommended by State
Governments; and the Employment Generation Fund (EGF), which would provide
grant funds for services such as counselling, retraining or redeployment of
affected workers and for approved employment generation schemes. Most EGF
activities would be coordinated by State-Level Steering Committees, which
would receive proposals from city-level bodies known as Area Regeneration
Councils, which in turn would oversee proposals from Employee Resource Centers
at the enterprise level.
101.        Detailed operational guidelines for the NRF operations have been
approved by the Cabinet. The administration of thc NRF would be done through
the Empowered Authority (EA) which would include the Secretaries of Industrial
Development, Public Enterprises, Company Affairs, Labor, Education;
representatives from Labor and Employers; and two eminent persons from outside
GoVernment with experience in the fields of management, industrial or labor
relations (Annex 8, para. 12). The EA would be supported by an independent
secretariat headed by an Executive Director of Additional Secretary rank. One
of the EA's principal functions would be to scrutinize and approve proposals
for NRF assistance from designated authorities such as the Cabinet,
Ministries, BIFR and State Governments. The NRF would operate as an account
within the Government budgetary set-up and thus would not by itself hold or
disburse funds. Payments authorized by EA would be routed to the recipient
beneficiaries through the normal expenditure channels, e.g. through the
budgets of the Ministries concerned for payments to labor retrenched from



_ 41 -
PSEs. The NRF was provided with a Government budgetary allocation of US$66.0
million for FY92, of which most was used for VRS payments to selected PSEs.
The NRF's FY93 Business and Financial Plan shows anticipated receipts of Rs.
US$600.0 million with contributions from 001 budget Including counterpart
furds derived from USATD and German assistance, and the sale proceeds of PSE
shares. Of these receipts, US$288.0 million would be used for NROF payments
and US$229.0 million for KG?. The bulk of the NRGF payments would be for VRS
which covers large entities such as the Rational Textile Corporation whose re-
structuring plans, involving retrenchment of some 80,000 workers over three
years, have already been approved by the Cabinet, and several other PSEs.
Under the IRF's FY1993 Business and Financial Plan, a total of 80,000 workers
are expected to be compensated in FY93. Of the EGF allocation, US$167.0
million would be allocated to the ongoing JRY program and US$12.0 million to
NRY. The balance of US$50.0 would be used for the different employment gener-
ation, redeployment and training schemes which are currently under formula-
tion. IDA is administering technical assistance financed under a Japan Grant
Agreement, to support the tRE in the areas of counselling, training and the
development of employment generation strategies. A detailed write-up of the
NRP is given in Aane 8.
B.  SusteaoIi  the Social Safety Net Sector dlustment Proram and the Fiscal
dlusbtunt
102.        Arrangements have been made to ensure that the Social Safety Net
Sector Adjustmeat Program is sustainable. The 001's commitment to provide
adequate resources for the key social safety net components is shown in
Anmex 9.  The GOI has committed to maintaining in real terms to the end of the
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1997), the level of resources provided to Social Safety
Net programs, even as the growth of the Center's Annual Plan is contracted.
Compared to 1992193, G00's allocations for the core social safety net programs
would be increased by between 16 to 20 percent in 1993/94 and is projected to
increase by a similar percentage in 1994/95; by about 26 percent in 1995/96
and about 24 percent in 1996/97. This would mean that key social sector
programs would increase from about 4.6 percent of the Center's Annual Plan in
1992/93 to about 10.3 percent in 1996/97. It also means that the programs
which constitute the social safety net would increase their share of Center's
Annual Plan from about 11 percent in 1992/93 to 19 percent in 1996/97. Such
allocations represent a marked reversal of the trend experienced in 1992/93
where certain programs within the safety net program were substantially
reduced. The GOI has also given assurances that external assistance in
support of the social safety net program would be treated as a net addi-
tionality to its own Plan allocations. IDA's anticipated complementary
specific investment projects in health, education and nutrition would rein-
force the Social Safety Set Program and its sustainability over the longer-
term period. The sustainability analysis indicates that while the incremental
resources to the Safety Net Program are substantial, they would be in keeping
with GOI's stated objective under the Eighth Five-Year Plan to give increased
emphasis to human resources development and poverty alleviation (para. 6).
103.        A large part of the fiscal adjustment and consolidation program
has already been put in place. The reordering of government expenditure
priorities is well underway; for example, subsidies of all types such as to
PSEs, PDS, and fertilizers, are being cut back or their rate of growth cur-
tailed. These measures, along with the evolving tax reform program, are
expected to strengthen the fiscal base thereby enabling GOI to meet its new
budgetary priorities. Finally, the full partnership of the States in the
design and implementation of new targeting and efficiency strategies for the



- 42 -
social programs la the safety net, and their commitment to take over the
recurrent liabilities of these enhanced and expanded programs at the end of
the investment phase, also reinforce the suetainability of the Program.
P.  Social SafetZ Net lefozm and the Role of States in Loram Inlementstiom
104.        Under the Constitution of India, legislative power Is distributed
between the Central Parliament and State Legislatures In accordance with three
lists set out in the VIlth Schedule to the Constitution. Subjects over which
the Union has exclusive power are In a Union list and subjects over which
States have exclusive power, with some very limited exceptions, are In a State
list. Subjects over which the Union as well as the States may exercise power
are in a 'concurrent list'. Of the sectors covered by the Program, public
health is in the State list and hence exclusively within ths domain of the
States. All the remaining sectors are in the concurrent list.
105.        The main elements and objectives of the Program have been approved
by the States in the National Development Council, In which all Chief
Ministers of the States are represented. In addition, all activities to be
undertaken under the Program fall within the category of Plan expenditures
which are part of State-level Plans. These State-level Plans are approved by
the Central Planning Commission. All activities under the Program are either
financed entirely, or predominantly co-financed, by the Central Government.
All health, nutrition and disease control investments under the Program are
centrally-assisted schemes, which are entirely funded by central grants. The
enhanced education sector program will also be funded on a grant basis through
centrally-assisted schemes.
106.        Funds for activities approved for central assistance are disbursed
on a quarterly basis against satisfactory implementation by States in accor-
dance with design and implementation parameters stipulated by the Central
Government. In the event implementation is unsatisfactory, the Central
Government through the release of funds. has the leverage to affect
satisfactory implementation. in view of the above, although activities under.
the Program are implemented by States, the States are comnitted to the Program
and are playing a significant role in their preparation and development. The
Center has adequate financial leverage to ensure that programs are carried out
in accordance with agreed design and implementation parameters.
PART IV. TER PROPOSED SECTOXR ADUS f CREDIT
A. Credit Objectives
107.        The proposed Credit is for the equivalent of US$500 million.  It
is proposed that the first and second trazche would each be for US$250.0
million. The Credit would support the Initial phase of the Government's
Social Safety Net Sector Adjustment Program. The main areas covered by the
Program ares (a) primary education; (b) prlmary health care; (c) disease
control; td) nutrition; and (e) coempesation, redeployment and retraining of
surplus workers from Public Sector Enterprises (PS1) throc h the National
Renewal Fund (YU?).
D. Justificatioa of the Operation
108.        The proposed sector adjustment credit is part of the official aid
community's evolving plan to meet  ndial's exceptional financing needs ower a



- 43 -
three-to-four years adjustment period (see para. 112 and Table 4), and thus
support the country's ongoinS stabilization and reform program. The Ds and
the Bank are expected to meet the bulk of India's exceptional financing
requirements, while other multilaterals and bilaterals have played and vill
continue to play an lmportant role In filling the remaining gap. This
operation may help mobilize US$400 million from multilaterals and bilaterals
(see para. 112). Ezceptional external financing will complement India's
ongoing resource mobilization and fiscal consolidation efforts discussed
earlier (paras. 7 and 13). Without It, the transitional costs of adjustment
would be highers domestic resource mobilization efforts would need to
increase, or the country would have to reduce investment. Either one of these
alternatives would have negative repercussions on the poor, the ones most
vulnerable to reductions in growth of per-capita consumption or total output.
Increased domestic resource mobilization beyond the levels envisaged in the
current macroeconomic scenario would reduce the expected modest increases in
per capita consumption in the next three years to a negligible or negative
amount and would erode the political support for the Government's program.
Reduced Investment levels would compromise the supply response that should
accompany the adjustment program and also erode political support for
stabilization and reform measures. Second, on the structural front, the
operation supports reforms that are important for achieving the major goals of
India's new development policy. By mitigating the social costs of adjustment
and thereby enhancing its political acceptability, the financing of the
National Renewal Fund facilitates the process of public enterprise
restructuring. Protecting and strengthening priority social programs during
the ongoing fiscal adjustment will help the 00I to accelerate the development
of India's human resources. The Improved targeting of these programs on the
most vulnerable groups of the population will protect the poor during
adjustment and Improve their long-term economlc prospects.
109.        The reforms supported by this operation will increase the volume
of fiscal resources allocated to social programs on a recurrent basis.
Accommodating this increased recurrent expenditure in the context of sustained
reductions of the Central Government fiscal deficit is part of the fiscal
consolidation effort now underway in which the Government intends to increase
fiscal resources for social sectors and infrastructure, and reduce those for
other programs. It is also part of the important fiscal restructuring
measures expected for the next few yeats during which: (a) tax reform would
broaden the tax base, thus reducing its currently excessive dependence on
taxes on International trade, and also make the tax base more revenue elastic;
(b) public enterprise reform would reduce public enterprises' dependence on
the budget as the problems of chronically loss-making enterprises are
addressed and others' financial needs are met through market funding; and (c)
improved cost recovery is expected to increase the resources available for
operations and maintenance and public investment.

110.        External Financing Re4uirements.  The large annual repayments
associated with India's external debt (estimted 8t US$71 billion at the end
of March 1992), and the continuing need to rebuild foreign exchange reserves
indicate that exceptional balance of payments support would be needed in both
the near and medium term. table 4 shows that despite the large projected
current account adjustments that have already taken place since 1990191, the
exceptional financing requirement in 1992193, over and above likely inflows of
project aid, commercial borrowing, and non-resident Indian (RRI) deposits, is
projected to be about US$2.5 billion. This operation, together with the
cofinancing associated with it, and exceptional financing which has already
taken place, including fast-disbursing loans from bilaterals, the ADB,
IBRDIIDA and DHF, vill secure the financing of this US$2.5 billion.
ill.         In the absence of any major external shock or disruption to
domestic production, India's exceptional financing requirements should decline
gradually, beginning in the next few years. Rowever, the need to rebuild
reserves and the bunching of repayment obligations indicate that Tndia vould
require contlnued substantial exceptional financing through 1995196.
Specifically, in each of the next three years, India would require exceptional



- 45 -
financing from official donors of an average of about US$2.4 billion per
annum.
C. Co-f iancAiR
112.        During the June 1992 meeting of the India Aid Consortium, several
members indicated their willingness to support the proposed operation in close
coordination with IDA. With the full support of the GOI, IDA invited the
interested Consortium members to coordinate their respective activities with
IDA's preparation and appraisal of the operation. As a result, several pro-
spective co-financing arrangements have been identified as followst Germany
DM 50 million (US$31.25 million); Netherlands DF1 100 million (US$55.56
million; USA US$35.0 million; EEC ECU 150 million (US$184.5 million) and ADB
US$ 100.0 million; for a total of US$406.31 million. The details of these
arrangements are outlined in Annex 10.
D. Tranche Releases
113.        The first tranche would be available upon credit effectiveness and
would be based on the significant up-front actions which the GOI has already
taken to implement the Program and which are outlined in the Policy Matrix
(Annex 5).
114.        The second tranche release is planned for June/July 1993 and would
be released after the Goverrnent has provided IDA with satisfactory evidence
that it hass
*     completed all approvals to make adequate funds available to meet
the additional costs in FY93-94, of the revamped and expanded
programs in primary education, primary health, disease control and
ICDS.
*     completed the review of the financing of the social sectors; and
started implementation of the recommendations with particular
respect to ensuring the timely availability of funds for the
Program and the enhanced mobilization of non budgetary resources
for tertiary education and tertiary health care.
O     for each component of the Program (primary education, primary
health, disease control and ICDS), selected districts for priority
implementation of the Program, on the basis of relevant indicators
such as educational backwardness, maternal mortality rates, infant
mortality rates and the incidence of poverty and endemic diseases;
operationalized mechanisms for district-level coordination of Pro-
gram irplementation in the selected districts including defining
the responsibility of the district administration and issuing
instructions for linking implementation of the Program to district
development plans.
O     completed detailed action plans for intensified implementation of
the primary education component of the Program in the selected
districts; transferred to each of the selected districts, the
first installment of funds required for the implementation of the
action plans; and caused the appointment by the concerned
authorities, of the key management staff for the intensified
primary education program in the selected districts and States.



- 46 -
O     completed the assessment of pharmaceutical requirements in all of
the districts targeted for the implementation of the revised and
expanded primary health care program; and delivered the initial
batch of pharmaceuticals in kits developed under the Child
Survival and Safe Motherhood Program to the selected districts.
*     completed detailed facility surveys and detailed action plans
based on the surveys, for implementing the revised and expanded
primary health care program in the selected districts; transferred
to each of the selected districts, the first installment of funds
required for the implementation of the action plans; and obtained
from each of the States in which the selected districts are
located, i.e., Gihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh,
Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, an assurance
that it shall provide, within a stipulated time frame, the
services of at least one female doctor at each primary health
center which has been identified for enhanced .afe motherhood
facilities in the selected districts.
0     completed detailed reviews of the effectiveness and coverage of
its programs for the control of blindness, malaria and
tuberculosis; adopted a national action plan for the control of
tuberculosis; and adopted action plans for the control of

*     completed state-wide reviews of shqrtfalls in required feeding
days under the ICDS program in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa,
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal; conmenced construction
of godowns in the States where logistics has been identified as
the problem in the timely and adequate supply of food; and
achieved the feeding norm under the ICDS program in at least 50S
of the anganwadis under the ICDS program in each of the following
Statest Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Rajasthan.
o     made satisfactory progress in the implementation of the FY 1992 -
93 Business and Financial Plan of the NRF: approved the FY93 -94
Business and Financial Plan for the NU; and allocated the
necessary funds to the NRP account consistent with the projected
requirements of the FY93-94 Business and Financial Plan.
B. Credit Adminstration
115.        Procurement.  The proposed credit totalling SDR 354,700,000
(US$500 million) would finance 100 percent of the c.i.f. costs of general
imports, excluding luxury goods, military equipment, and environmentally
hazardous and tobacco products. Imports valued at US$5 million and above by
both public and private sector entities, would be procured in accordance with
simplified ICB procedures, except for certain commodities which are traded in
International markets. For a list of these conmodities agreed with the
Association, other procedures acceptable to the Association may be used.
imports valued at below US$5 million by public sector entities would be
procured using their own procurement procedures. The specific import
procedures followed by many pub.Xic sector organizations have been reviewed in
connection with recent Bank/IDA operations and determined to be satisfactory.
The procedures used by others would be reviewed before their imports would
become eligible under the loan. Imports valued at below US$5 million by
private sector firms would follow established commercial practice. The



- 47 -
Association has reviewed the procedures used by a sample of potential private
sector importers and found them satisfactory. Contracts for Imports valued at
less than US$25,000 or shipped more than three years before loan signing,
would be ineligible for IDA financing. Procurement will be coordinated by the
Ministry of Finance under arrangements acceptable to IDA.
116.        Disbursement.  The proceeds of the proposed credit would be dis-
bursed against the foreign costs of general imports based on a standard nega-
tive list which includes, Inter alla. luxury goods, military equipment and
environmentally hazardous and tobacco products. Both private and public
sector imports would be eligible for financing. Retroactive financing up to
SDR 70,940,000 (US$100 million equivalent) would be provided to reimburse
expenditures for eligible Imports incurred after August 31, 1992.
Disbursements would be administered by the Ministry of Finance in coordination
with the Reserve Bank of India. Withdrawal applications for reimbursement of
expenditures under each contract valued less than US$5 million equivalent
would be submitted under Statement of Expenditures (S01) procedures.
Withdrawal applications for all other expenditures would be fully documented.
Documentation in support of SOIs would be retained by the Ministry of Finance.
The proposed credit is expected to be disbursed over a period of one year.
The closing date would be December 31, 1993.
117.        Accounts and Audits.  RBI would maintain accounts and supporting
documentation in respect of the operation. Audits would be carried out by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association within six months of the
closing of the GOI fiscal year (March 31) in which disbursements under the
credit are made and would include a separate opinion oan withdrawals made under
SORs. However, because disbursements under the second tranche could possibly
start prior to IDA's receipt of this audit and separate opinion on withdrawals
under S01, during negotiations, the GOI agreed that it shall submit to the
Association by May 25, 1993, audit reports with form and content satisfactory
to the Association, in respect of all withdrawals from the Credit Account up
to April 30, 1993 on the basis of statements of expenditure, in addition to
the normal audits which are required.
P. Mxmitorina
118.        The Program for Strengthening the Social Safety Net is being coor-
dinated by a Committee of Social Sector Secretaries under the overall admini-
stration of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The pro-
posed operation requires monitoring of the key indicators of social sector
programs as outlined in the Letter of Development Policy, and the implemanta-
tion of specific actions detailed In paragraph 114. The Association will also
monitor the implementation and progrees of reform actions through a maid-term
consultation to be held In March 1993. A Supervision Plan is outlined in
Amnex 1I. In addition to serving as a catalyst to promote greater coordi-
nation among the various line ministries to which the Social Safety Net Sector
Adjustment Program relates, the review would provide a forum to discuss with
the authorities, the recomendations of several high-level committees
established by the Goverrment such as the High-Powered Committee of the
University Grants Comaission; the Advisory Council on PDS, the Standing Social
Sector Coordination Committee; and the Committee of the National Development
Council on medical and dental manpower (Annex 4, paras. 11, 28, and 34).



- 48 -
C. Benefits and Risks
119.        Benefits.   The proposed Credit would complement other Bank ef-
forts in assisting India to undertake its macroeconomic stabilization and
structural reform program. It would assist India in a period of fiscal aus-
terity to improve the allocation of public sector resources so that the level
of effort to maintain the current social safety net and enhance it where
required, is not jeopardized. The Credit wduld also support Center and State
activities which vould substantially increase the returns to investments al-
ready made in the social sectors through the emphasis on targeting to cover
the very poor, and the introduction of new policies and cost-effective changes
in program design. The policy agenda to be supported under this Credit would
complement and encourage further reforms in the administration of social safe-
ty net programs in the States. The expenditure plan for the social safety net
supported by this operation, would set a basis for medium and long-term
sustainable human resource development. It would also ensure that the
provision of basic social services is not interrupted in the fiscal
restructuring, and that as the economy is liberalized and resources are being
redeployed for increased efficiency in response to improved market signals,
the poor are better protected in the adjustment process.
120.        Risks.  The main risk would be the inability of the 001 to take
some of the actions necessary to implement the agreed reforms. Social policy
is an area where the States play a central role. The States with the highest
incidence of poverty such as Bihar,Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan
and Orissa, and where actions to streamline, reform, and expand the existing
social safety net are most critical, are characterized by very weak institu-
tions. Some opposition from middle and upper class urban groups could be
expected as the proposed reforms will reduce benefits presently accruing free
of charge to them and correctly redirect these to the rural and urban poor.
The need for macroeconomic stabilization and the improvement of social
services to cover the most vulnerable groups is nonetheless accepted by all
parties and this may well provide the momentum for undertaking the necessary
steps to strengthen and broaden the programs which constitute India's Social
Safety Net. Institutional strengthening is a key input to the Social Safety
Net Sector Adjustment Program and the enhancements proposed will be sustained
and reinforced by specific investment projects which will complement this
operation.
PART V. ___________
121.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.

A. Natermal and Child Health PorAM  (3M)
1.    The Government of India accords high priority to the care of mothers and
children. Over the years. it has established an extensive primary health care
infrastructure across the country which provides aute and post natal-care,
immization, and prophylactic services to children and pregnant/lactating
mothers against micro-nutrient deficiencies. The major MCI programs are
listed below.
2.    Prophylaxis Asainst Nutritional AnaemLa. Anaemia is one of the
important causes of morbidity and mortality among mothers and children. Under
the scheme of prophylaxis against nutritional anaemia, pregnant and lactating
mothers, acceptors of family planning services, and children between one to
five years of age are given a daily dose of iron and folic acid for a period
of 100 days as a prophylactic measure.
3.    Prophylazis Against Blindness Due to Vitamin A Deficiency Among
Children.  In India, severe Vitamin A deficiency associated with malnutrition
and infection causes increasing blindness among children. Surveys have found
that in many parts of the country, children between 1-5 years show signs of
Vitamin A deficiency to varying degrees. Under the program, 20,000
international units of Vitamin A is given to children of between 1-5 every 6
months as a preventive measure. The Department of Family Welfare procures and
supplies iron and folic tablets and Vitamin A solution to the State
Governments and Union Territories.
4.    Acute Respiratory Infection (ARl) Control Program.  ARI is an important
cause of mortality and morbidity among children. During 1990-91, 14 districts
in 13 States were covered under the ARI Control Program with international
assistance. Training of medical and para-medical workers in these districts is
near completion. The drug which is used, Cotrimoxazole, is procured by the
Central Government and supplied to the districts. Ten more districts were
covered during 1991-92 and training of medical workers is underway.
5.    The National Ivmunization Program (UIP) was launched in 1985 as part of
the overall national strategy to bring down infant and maternal mortality rate
in India through providing immunization of all infants against six vaccine-
preventable diseases and to pregnant women against tetanus. When this program
was launched, the infant mortality rate for the country as a whole was 97 for
every 1,000 live births. It was estimated that vaccine preventable diseases
were responsible for about one fourth of the total infant deaths. Neonatal
tetanus itself accounted for 13 out of every 1,000 infant deaths, or a total
of 300,000 deaths every year. At that tme, vaccine coverage among children
ranged between 29? for BCG and 411 for DPT. By the end of March 1991,
coverage levels have Iproved significantly and now range between 992 for OPV



- 51 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2
982 for DPT, 97? for BCG, 892 for MSL, to 78? for TT(PW). Progress achieved
in universal immunization has helped to reduce the infant and maternal
mortality in the country.
6.    Management and Control of Diarrhoeal Diseases.  Diarrhoeal diseases are
a major baby killer in India. It is estimated that diarrhoeal diseases are
responsible for approximately 25? of mortality of children under five years of
age. In spite of the seriousness of the problem, however, only 13X of children
suffering from these diseases have access to Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT).
The program for the Management and Control of Diarrhoeal Diseases aims at
educating mothers and communities to enable them to recognize early signs of
dehydration of children suffering from diarrhoeal diseases, and to take care
of these children at home by using home-made fluids; improving the case-
management of diarrhoeal diseases at all health facilities through training
primary health care workers; and establishing diarrhoeal training/treatment
units. One major feature of the program is to increase the use of ORT. Since
1989, the ORT scheme has been in operation in all the districts of the
country. The scheme has received financial support from the international
donor community.
B. Rural Health Services
7.    The Government of India is making a coordinated effort under various
rural health programs to provide effective and efficient services to the
people in the rural areas. Numerous programs and schemes are being
implemented under the Minimum Needs Program to provide primary health care
relevant to the actual needs of the community in the rural areas. At present,
a fairly comprehensive health-care infrastructure consisting mainly of health
sub-centers, primary health centers (PHC) and community health centers (CHCs)
has been put into place to deliver primary health care to the rural population
of the country.
8.    Sub-Centers are established on the basis of one center for every 5,000
population in general, and for every 3,000 population in hilly, tribal and
backward areas. The total number of sub-centers established to date is
130,000 covering over 500 million population. Each sub-center is staffed by
one female and one male health worker. In order to supply these health
workers as required, 467 Training Schools were established across the country
with an annual admission capacity of over 21,000. For every six sub-centers,
one female health assistant is appointed to provide technical guidance and
supervise the work of the health workers. Senior female workers with over 5
years of experience are eligible for these positions. Since most of the
deliveries in the rural areas are conducted by Dais (traditional birth
attendants), there are various schemes for the training of dais to improve
their delivery skills. Starting from 1982, a centrally-sponsored scheme was
initiated to train male health workers vho are posted in sub-centers along
with female health workers to become multi-purpose workers (14W).
9.    Primary Health Centers (PEC) are established for every 30,000 population
in the plain areas and for 20,000 population in the hilly, tribal and backward
areas. 00I plans to convert all existing rural dispensaries which provide
only curative services to function as PHCs to deliver a package of
promotional, preventive and curative services. At present, 22,064 PHCs are
functioning across the country covering over 550 million rural population.

ANNEX 1
Page 3
10. Community Health Centers (CHC) are established as rural hospitals with
specialist facilities and hospital beds. Each CHC is supposed to cover about
100,000 population. By the end of 1991, about 1,932 CHCs have been
established in the country.
II. Lajor Disease Control Programs
11.   Since independence, the Government of India has actively supported
numerous health programs for controlling and eradicating endemic or
communicable diseases. These programs have had a positive effect on the
incidence of mortality and morbidity, and improved the quality of life in
general.
12.   National Malaria Eradication Program (WEEP).  The NNEP is a centrally
sponsored scheme funded by both the Center and State Governments on a 50:50
basis. Since its inception in 1976, the program has initiated massive
operations of DDT spray and surveillance in both urban and rural areas,
bringing down the total occurrence of malaria in the country from 6.47 million
cases at the beginning of the program to 1.59 million cases in 1990, a
reduction of 70.72. During the year 1990-91 alone, India achieved a decrease
of about 6.22 in malaria positive cases and 10.32 in p.f cases over the
previous year.
13. National Filaria Control Program. Filariasis imposes a major public
health problem in most areas across India. Present estimates indicate that
about 381 million people are living in 176 known endemic districts of which
about 101 million are found in urban areas and the rest in rural areas. The
National Filaria Control Program was launched in 1955 aimed at eliminating the
problem in unsurveyed areas and at controlling the disease in urban areas
through anti-larval and anti-parasitic measures . At present about 42.6
million people in urban areas are being protected, and about 902 of the towns
where control measures are in operation for more than five years, have shown
marked reduction in microfilaria rates.
14.   National Leprosy Control Program.  At present India has about 2.2
million leprosy patients, accounting for over 302 of the world's total. The
prevalence of leprosy exceeds 5 per 1,000 in 196 districts out of a total of
445 districts in the country. More than half of the country's total 850
million population live in these 196 endemic districts. Through the country's
existing primary health infrastructure and the active involvement of NGOs, the
National Leprosy Control Program initiated various activities including (a)
the introduction and popularization of multi-drug treatment (MDT); (b) early
detection of leprosy cases through houeeholdlschool surveys; (c) education
campaign on the facts about leprosy; (d) training of leprosy control workers;
and (e) rehabilitation of leprosy patients.
15. National Program for Control of Blindness. Blindness imposes another
significant social problem in India.  Out of the 30 million completely blind
people in the world, 12 million are found in India. In addition, another 8
million Indians are partially blind. About 81a of the blindness is due to
cataracts which is curable by surgical interventions. At present, there is a
backlog of 22 million cataract cases which is increased by another 2 million
every year. Given the magnitude of this backlog and the technical nature of
the blindness control efforts, the National Program for Control of Blindness

gives high priority to the development of (ophthalmologists and para-medical
ophthalmic assistants (PMOAs)3. The NPCB has assisted programs organized by
both the governments and NGO. to train and educate PMOAs, medical graduates,
ophthalmologists, medical officers in primary health centers and hospitals,
and eye specialists, and to improve infrastructure needed for cataract
surgeries such as operation theaters and surgical equipment.
16. National Tuberculosis Control Program. Tuberculosis (TB) is another
major public health problem in India. At present, it is estimated that nearly
1.51 of the total population or 12.75 million people suffer from
radiologically active TB disease of the lungs. The GOI has therefore given
high priority to the control of TB and the National TB Control Program. As of
September 1991, out of a total of 440 districts, 378 have been provided with
District TB Centers. These Centers are equipped with essential equipment and
managed by trained staff for undertaking district-wise TB control programs in
association with general health and medical institutions. Both the Central
and State Governments finance the supply of drugs in these centers and other
similar clinics for free treatment of TB patients. TB control activities
carried out at the local levels under the National TB Control Program have
achieved considerable results. The nation's capacity of TB control has been
greatly expanded and accordingly, the detection of new TB cases increased from
1.6 million it 1980-82 to 1.8 million in 1990-91, and sputum examinations
increased from 1.22 million to 2.5 million in the same period.
17.   National Goiter Control Program (NGCP).  The National Goiter Control
Program was launched in 1984 to combat goiter, a symptom of iodine deficiency,
which is considered a major public health problem. In addition, goiter can
affect physical growth and mental development at each stage of human life.
The task facing the NGCP is monumental. Results of different surveys
conducted in 215 districts acros3 the country revealed that among these
States, 185 districts were endemic for iodine deficiency disorders. To bring
the endemic disease under control, the NGCP initiated or supported programs of
direct medical intervention (iodine injections), universal iodinization of
salt, continued surveys and monitoring, and intensive IEC activities to raise
the public awareness of the disease.
18. National Se1ually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Control Program. The
National STD Control Program was launched during the country's Second Five
Year Plan. In recent years, the program has assumed increasing importance as
AIDS, of which STD is one of the major vehicle of transmission, poses
increasing danger to the health of both present and future generations of the
country. The main objectives of the National STD Control Program are to
minimize morbidity associated with STD, create a competent infrastructure of
trained health care workers, standardize and upgrade VDRL tests and develop
better laboratory procedures for diagnosis of STD, mobilize the community, and
understand the trends of the disease. Under the Program, many regional STD
Centers have trained medical officers and para-medical personnel, and many
medical colleges and hospitals have participated in the inter-laboratory
evaluation of VDRL tests. Camps have been organized by the Regional Survey
units in city slums, educational centers and backward areas of the States.
19. National Aids Control Program was initiated in 1986 with three major
components: surveillance, screening of blood and blood products to ensure
blood safety, and information, education & comunication (IEC). The main



- 54 -
ANN   1
Page 5
objective of the Program is to arrest the pace of infection by stepping up
surveillance activities among promiscuous individuals, prevent HIV
transmission in the country, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with
rIV infection, and minimize the social and economic impact resulting form HIV
infection. To achieve these objectives, the Program carries out activities
including IRC reaching both high-risk groups and the general public;
prevention and treatment of STDs; prevention of transmission through
Intravenous drug abusers; prevention of transmission through blood and blood
products; strengthening of clinical management capabilities; and program
management. Up to the end of 1991, about 123 million people who were
considered to belong to high-risk groups have been screened and 6,414 of them
have been found HIV positive. The total number of full-blown AIDS cases so
far reported in the country is 103.
III. PRIMARY EDUCATION
20.   The Universalization of Elementary (Primary) Education (UEE) is a
constitutional mandate stipulated in Article 45 of India's Constitution. Over
the years, both the Center and the States have made considerable investments
In promoting elementary education. The country as a whole has achieved 97?
gross primary enrollment, and facilities of elementary education have
increased from 234,000 in the 19508 to 694,000 at the present. In particular,
the elementary education facilities have been extended to 94? of the rural
population within 1 km. walking distance of their homes. In spite of these
achievements, serious problems still persist in India's elementary education
system. The quality of education remains low in general as a result of
inadequate teacher training, an absence of basic teaching/learning materials,
and a lack of decent school facilities. Girls' enrollment, especially in the
poor rural areas, is significantly lower than the national average. More than
one third of those enrolled drop out of school before reaching grade 4. These
problems have combined to result in the country having an adult literacy rate
as low as 481, despite its record of 97? gross primary enrollment. To improve
the quality of elementary education and achieve the goals of Universal
Elementary Education, the GOI has implemented a set of programs in areas of
primary education, adult literacy, and early childhood education. Major
programs in these areas are described below.
21. Operation Blackboard was launched in 1987 to increase retention rates in
primary education through improving primary school facilities. The scheme has
three components: (a) provision of a building comprising at least two
reasonably large all-weather rooms with a deep veranda and separate toilet
facilities for boys and girls; (b) provision of at least two teachers in every
school with one of them being a woman; and (c) provision of essential
teaching/learning materials including blackboards, maps, charts, toys and
equipment for students. The scheme is funded from two main sourcess funds for
construction of school buildings are provided mainly from rural development
schemes, since most of the facilities to be constructed are in the rural
areas, and the funds for the other two components are provided by the
Department of Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development. Operation
Blackboard envisages coverage of all the primary schools in the country in a
phased manner. In the period 1987/88 to 1990/91, the scheme was implemented
in 69Z of the blocks in the country comprising 64? of the total number of



- 55 -
ANNEX 1
Page 6
primary schools. The GOI intends to revise and continue Operation Blackboard
during the Eighth Plan until all the primary schools are covered.
22. Non-Formal Education was introduced in the late 1970s as an alternative
strategy to extend basic education to working children, or those living in
habitations without schools, or those who cannot attend schools for various
reasons. The content and concentration of the scheme was revised in 1988.
Originally focused on ten educationally backward States, the scheme has now
been expanded to cover urban slums, hilly, tribal or desert areas or States
with a high concentration of working children. The financing of the scheme is
shared by the Center and State Governments on a 50:50 basis for general
program activities, 90slO for Non-Formal Education Centers for Girls.
23.   Mahila Samakhya was launched in 1989 to mobilize rural women for
education through Mahila Sanghas in each of the villages. This is a Central
sector scheme and is funded entirely by the assistance from the Dutch
Government. The program revolves around Mahila Sanghas where women are
mobilized over issues such as health, education, water, environment, and most
of all, women's image and status in the society. The program aims at
encouraging women to take an active interest in issues that affect their daily
lives, and generating a demand for education. It is also intended to enable
school-dropouts or girls/women who have never attended schools, to pursue
their education in a secure environment.
24.   Early Childhood Education (ECE) is designed to improve children's
communication (language) and cognitive (social, emotional, intellectual and
personality development) skills as a preparation for entry into primary
school. The program is being implemented in nine educationally backward
States. The services provided under the program are pre-school education for
children between 3 to 6 years of age. About 4,365 Early Childhood Education
Centers were in operation in the nine States during the year 1991/92.
IV. NUTRITION
25.   Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) is the largest program of
child development in India. It provides a basic package of health, nutrition,
and pre-school education services to children under five years of age and
pregnant/lactating mothers. Nutrition-related activities constitute a
substantial part of ICDS. Started in 1975, ICDS now employs 500,000 workers
who carry out integrated interventions in 2,200 blocks. It is a centrally
sponsored program but funded by the Central Government and States with
assistance from international donors.
26. Special Nutrition Program (SNP) was launched in 1970-71 to provide
supplementary nutrition to children below six years of age and pregnant and
lactating mothers living in urban slums, tribal areas and backward rural
areas. Under this program, supplementary feeding is given for 300 days in a
year to provide about 300 calories and 10 grams of protein per child per day
and about 500 calories and 20 grams of protein per mother per day.
27. Wheat Based Supplementary Nutrition Program has two components: under
the centrally-funded component, assistance consists of supplying free wheat,



- 56 -
ANNEX 1
Page 7
and providing for support costs of other ingredients, i.e. sugar, pulses, oil,
etc. to make different kinds of recipes as well as expenditures on cooking and
transport. Assistance from the State Governments is given on a basis of 50
paise per beneficiary per day, for a total of 300 days a year. The State-
funded component conducts similar intervention activities, but is funded by
the State Governments. The Program is being implemented in 16 States and 3
Union Territories covering about 3 million beneficiaries.
28.   Balwadi Nutrition Program (BNP) is being implemented since 1970 through
the Central Social Welfare Board and four national-level Voluntary
Organizations. About 5,600 Balwadis are currently being run by these agencies
to implement the program. About 229,000 million children in the age group of
3-5 years are covered under this program. Apart from nutritional
supplementation, the Balwadis look after the social and emotional development
of attending children.
29.   World Food Program Project extends food assistance for supplementary
nutrition to preschool children and pregnant and lactating mothers in the ICDS
areas. The program currently covers 1.9 billion children and 200,000 million
mothers in 5 States.
30.   Care-Assisted Nutrition ProRram extends food aid for nutrition
supplementation to preschool children and pregnant and lactating mothers in
the ICDS areas. In addition to feeding programs, it also provides assistance
to non-food projects known as Integrated Nutrition and Development Projects
including installation of water systems, nutrition, health and sanitation
education, income generating activities, immunization facilities and training
on ORT.
31.   Midday Meals Program.  This program has been in operation in some States
such as Tamil Nadu for a long time. Others have introduced it more recently.
CARE has been supporting a Midday Heals Program for primary school children
since 1962 vith food aid commodities provided by the United States of America.
Over the past 30 years, more than three million tons of food have been
provided. A formula for ready-to-eat snacks at low cost but with high protein
content, developed at the Central Food Technolog l Research Institute in
Mysore and manufactured in Calcutta, was found t4. be effective in combating
protein malnutrition in children. CARE supplied a cereal-based blended and
fortified food mixture and State governments met the transport, storage and
distribution costs. The midday meals program was gradually expanded to enable
all the major states of India to cover a large part of their primary school
children. The policies and procedures for the inclusion of primary school
children in the program differ from State to State, but all States attempt to
cover children from poor households, scheduled castes and tribes. The
administration, logistics, selection of beneficiaries and delivery system
adopted by each State have had an important bearing on the relative efficiency
of the program. The number of primary school children receiving food aid
increased steadily from about 2.4 million in 1962 to reach over 13 million in
1991. The Midday Meals Program was launched because it was considered to
influence the decision of economically-disadvantaged households to enrol their
children in school, to keep them there until they completed primary education
and to act as an incentive for children to attend school regularly. The
program is considered an important support of the aim of achieving universal
primary education.

V. PROGRAMS POR WIXm
32.   The Department of Women and Child Development of the Ministry of Human
Resources Development is the unit in the Central Government responsible for
the welfare and development of women in India. In addition to formulating
necessary policies, enacting or amending legislation related to women, it
implements or coordinates various developmental programs to improve the lot of
women in the country. Specific programs are as follows:
33. Employment and Income Generating Production Units was initiated in 1982-
83 to train women belonging to the weaker sections of the society and to
provide them with employment on a sustained basis. It is financed by funds
from both the Central government and Norwegian Agency for International
Development (NORAD). The program provides asqsistance to cover the training
component of new projects and the expansion of the existing projects.
Training is provided to women in trades such as electronics, watch
manufacturing/assembly, computer programming, printing and binding, weaving
and spinning, and garment making, etc.
34. Rehabilitation of Women in Distress. The main objectives of the program
is to rehabilitate destitute women and their dependent children through
vocational training and residential care with a view to making these women
economically independent. The financial assistance is shared in proportion of
45450slO among the Central Government, State Governments and Voluntary
Agencies. In the case of Union Territories, the expenditure is shared between
the Central Government and the voluntary agencies in the ratio of 90:1O.
35. Hostels for Working Women. During 1991-92, the Central Government
provided Rs. 50 million for this program. By the end of 1991, about Rs. 28.0
million was released to build 8 new hostels with an intake capacity of 558
working women and day care center facilities for 80 children.
36. Support to Training and Employment Program for Women (STEP) below
poverty line was launched in 1987 with a view to strengthening and improving
the skills and employment opportunity for women in traditional sectors such as
agriculture, small animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, handicrafts, Ihadi and
village industries and sericulture. The focus is on the marginalized and
assetless women from households of wage laborers, unpaid family workers,
migrant laborers, tribal, female-headed households and other dispossessed
groups in order to integrate them into the mainstream of development. Special
components of projects under the program include "Gender Sensitization', and
"Women in Development'.
37. Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRAI. Realizing the
importance of women as equal partners in the development process, the GOI
accords special treatment under various development programs including rural
development schemes to bring them into the mainstream of development. DWCRA
is one such special scheme. It was launched in 1982 with the objective to
improve the status of women by increasing their access to employment, skills,
training, credit and other support services.

38.   The Central Social Welfare Board (CSWB) was set up by the Government of
India more than 35 years ago for the welfare and development of women,
children and the handicapped. Over the years the Board had evolved various
programs for sustaining the growth of the voluntary organizations and
providing them with finsacial assistance for taking up a variety of welfare
and development programs. It has the credit of initiating welfare services
and development programs in the remote, rural, tribal or border areas where
such services did not exist. At present, the CSQB has a contingent of over
100,000 voluntary workers and thousands of voluntary organizations spread all
over the country. Major programs sponsored under CSWB are described in the
following paragraphs.
(a) Awareness Generation Project for Rural and Poor Women started in
1986. The importance of this scheme lies in bringing together
rural and poor women to discuss and exchange their experiences and
ideas on coamon problems related to women, and to evolve
strategies to deal with these issues through collective
discussions. The number of women participants per camp is 20 to
25 and the duration of the camp is for 8 days. During 1991, 632
camps were organized benefitting 15,800 women.
(b)   Condensed Courses of Education for Adult Women and Vocational
Trainin& Courses. Under this program, voluntary organizations are
given grants to conduct courses of either two to three years
duration for matrix, secondary, or primary examinations, or of one
year duration for those who have previously failed in these
examinations. Under the Vocational Training Program, grants are
given to impart training to the needy and deserving women over 15
years of age in different locations, thus providing opportunities
for employment or self-employment. The grants for conducting
these programs are sanctioned on non-matching basis.
(c) Socic-Economic Program provides for setting up small industrial
units and handicraft units, dairy units and other animal husbandry
programs like piggery, goat-rearing, sheepbreeding or poultry
units tad also self-employment units. By the end of 1991, 339
units were assisted. A new thrust has been given to identify new
sectors of income generating projects.
Id) Hostels for Working Women. CSEB gives assistance to voluntary
organizations to operate hostels for working women. The financial
assistance is given to meet the expenditures for the salary of
matrons, recreational facilities, and meeting the differences
between the rent paid by the institutions and the rent realized
from the inmates. A grant up to Rs.10,000 is sanctioned for this
program at present, and consideration is being given to increasing
the grant to Rs.50,000.
V.  MEPLOMNT AND INCOME GEERATION
39.   Jawahar Ronzar Yoiana (JRY) is the Government's major employment program
in the rural areas. It is administered at a field level by the Gram
P&achayats which are locally elected bodies, and with a line of authority



- 59 -
ANNtX 1
Page 10
coming from the Department of Rural Employment of the Ministry of Rural
Development. The basic aim of the program is to expand employment
opportunities for the rural poor through creating jobs in the rural
infrastructure sector. The original target of the program was to provide 100
days of work for each rural poor family per year. It is estimated, however,
that it is now actually providing closer to 16 days of vork per participant
per year.
40.   JRY is funded 80X by the Central Government, with a matching
contribution of 20a from State Governments. Essentially a poverty alleviation
program, its activities are allocated among States on the basis of the
incidence of poverty. However, the inability to provide matching funds
sometimes prevents States with a high incidence of poverty from obtaining
adequate funds from the program to initiate employment program. The
distribution of funds within the State is entirely the responsibility of the
State. The monitoring is carried out through days of employment generated,
rather than by physical outputs produced.
41.  Nehru Rozpar Yojana (NRY) is the urban counterpart of JRY in the
Government's employment/poverty alleviation program. Established three years
ago, it is aimed at alleviating urban poverty through providing employment
opportunities to the urban poor in the sector of labor-intensive public works.
Being a relatively young program, NRY has a limited scope of activities and
accounts for only 20X of the Government's employment program budget, while JRY
accounts for the rest 80X. NRY has three major components: the Scheme of
Urban Micro Enterprises (SUME) which provides loans for micro enterprise
entrepreneurs; the Scheme of Urban Wage Employment (SUWEZ) which generates
labor-intensive public works in urban areas that pay the unemployed daily
wages; and the Scheme of Housing and Shelter Upgrading (SHSU) which provides
loans for the self improvement of houses. These programs are targeted at the
urban poor of different levels of income in the order of: the poorest of the
poor; slum dwellers in poor accommodation who have low incomes; and those with
incomes less than Rs.24,000 per year per family.
42.   The Integrated Rural Development Prolect (IRDP) was launched in 1980 as
a major poverty alleviation program in the field of rural development. The
objective of IRDP is to enable the identified rural poor families to cross the
poverty line through providing productive assets and inputs to the target
groups. The assets can be in primary, secondary or tertiary sectors, and are
provided through financial assistance In the form of a subsidy by the
Government and term credit advanced by financial institutions. The program is
implemented as a centrally-sponsored scheme funded on 50:50 basis by the
Center and the States. The target of the program consists of small and
marginal farmers, agricultural laborers and rural artisans. Though the
poverty line is drawn at an annual income level of Rs. 6,400, the assistance
under IRDP is targeted at the rural families having an annual income below a
cut-off line of Rs. 4,800. Families with annual income up to Rs. 3,500 are
assisted first. Among the identified target group, at least 50 of the
assisted families are from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe families. To
promote better participation of women in the development process, it is
required that at least 40? of those assisted be women.

ANNEX 1
Page 11
43.   The typical pattern of subsidy is 251 for small farmers, 30Z for
marginal farmers, agricultural laborers and rural artisans, and 50X for SC/ST
beneficiaries and physically handicapped persons. The ceiling on subsidy is
Rs. 5,000 for ST/SC families and physically handicapped, and Rs. 3,000 for
others in the normal areas and Rs. 4,000 in DPAP/DDP areas. IRDP is
implemented through District Rural Development Agencies. The Ministry of
Rural Development is responsible for the release of the Center's share of
funds, policy formulation, overall guidance, monitoring and evaluation of the
program.
44.   The Program of Urban Basic Services for the Poor (UBSP) is a centrally
sponsored program introduced in 1986 with the assistance of UNICEF. It
provides basic social services and physical amenities in urban slums. The
program originally aims at the convergence of social and physical services
provided in urban slums by different departments of Health, Education, Social
Welfare and Industry/Industrial Training. The program focuses on women/child
survival and development through immunization, nutrition supplementation,
preschool and creche facilities and training for income generation. It
provides basic physical facilities such as water supply, drainage and low cost
sanitation. The program emphasized community-based management through
neighborhood committees of the urban poor themselves. The program was revised
and enlarged 1991 and now seeks to bring about a functional integration
between the provision of social services under UBSP and the provision of
-physical amenities under the State sector Scheme of Environmental Improvement
of Urban Slums. The revised program provides the social services to the poor
including special inputs tailored for street children, the handicapped, the
aged and the destitute on one hand, and for solving socio-economic problems
characterizing slums like juvenile delinquency, gambling and alcoholism on the
other. Community participation is the foundation on which the program has
been built up.
45. Environmental Improvement of Urban Slums was formulated as a response to
the growing problem of slums. It was made an integral part of the Minimum
Needs Program in 1974 and was transferred to the State sector. The scheme
aims at ameliorating the living conditions of urban slum dwellers and
envisages provision of drinking water, drainage systems, community baths,
community latrines, widening and paving of existing lanes, street-lighting and
other community facilities. The improvements are meant to be carried out in
notified slum areas. The total outlay on this scheme during the Seventh Plan
was Rs. 269.55 crores based on a per capita expenditure of Rs. 300 per slum
dweller. The target for coverage during the Seventh Plan was 9 million slum
dwellers, and this target was reached. During 1991, 1.1 million slum dwellers
were covered with per capita expenditure of Rs.525.  This program is now being
implemented in convergence with the program of Urban Basic Services for the
Poor.
VI. INSURAN   SCUMS
46. Old-Age Pension. According to the 1981 census, the number of people
above 60 reached 43 million or 6.2? of the total population in India, and is
likely to increase to 75 million by 2000. Aware of tbe emerging social
problems caused by the increase of the population of the aged, the GOI adopted
certain socio-economic measures to provide for this welfare. One of such



- 61 -
ANNEX 1
Page 12
important measure is the Old Age Pension Program adopted by the States. Under
this scheme, all State Governments and UT Administrations are providing old-
age pensions to the poor and destitute persons of old age, covering a
population of about 5.0 million for a total of about Rs. 2,270 million. The
eligibility conditions and the rate of pension differ from place to place.
The rate of pension ranges from Rs.30 per month to Rs.100 per month, and the
eligibility of age range from 60 to 75 years.
47.   Another major scheme sponsored by the Central Government for the welfare
of the aged population is General Grant-in-Aid Scheme for Assistance to
Voluntary Organizations in the Field of Social Welfare, which provides
financial assistance to voluntary organizations in areas not yet covered by
specific schemes. Under the scheme, the Central Government provides grants to
voluntary organizations that promote the welfare of the aged through day-care
centers, construction of homes, foster care programs, and medical/social
services. During 1990-91, a total of Rs. 8.86 million was released to 93
organizations in various States.
48.   Other major insurance schemes in India include the Central Government's
Health Scheme, General Insurance Cororation, mployees State Insurance
Scheme, etc.
VII. HOlSIG
49.   Indira Awaas Yoiana for Scheduled Castes/Tribes was launched in 1985 as
a sub-scheme of the Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Program. It provides
for the construction of dwelling units free of cost for the poorest of the
poor belonging to Scheduled Castes/Tribes, and frees bonded laborers. It is
now being implemented under the Jawahar Rozhar Yojana (JRY). Houses
constructed under the program are built in clusters so that common facilities
can be provided. For 1991/92, the Central Government provided about Rs. 1,570
million for this program.
50. Other. Major housing schemes sponsored by the Central Government in
both rural and urban areas include Housing for Economically Weak Section
(EWS); Housing for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Landless Section;
and Housing for Lower Income Groups (LIG). Another major housing scheme
sponsored by the Central Government in urban areas is Environmental
Improvement of Urban Slums (See the section of Employment).

51. Urban Low-Cost Sanitation schemes seeks to completely eliminate the
practice of manual scavenging by converting dry latrines into low-cost water-
flush sanitary units. It is being operated through HUDCO by providing subsidy
from the Central Government and loans from HUDCO in a synchronized manner to
the State Governments and Union Territories.
52.  Urban Water Supply program provides a package of Central assistance to
Urban Local Bodies of towns with populations of less than 500,000 which suffer

Page 13
from the lack of adequate water supply, to the places identified to be
drought- prone, or engaged in rehabilitating of the existing systems.
53. Solid Waste Management. The Government of India gives high priority to
proper solid waste management in urban areas, a subject which is gaining
increasing importance In the Government's overall strategy of urban
development. In order to prepare an acceptable model of delivery system,
improve the collection, transportation and disposal of wastes, identify the
methods and mechanisme of couumity participation, education campaigns, NGO
involvement and institutional capacity building, and to make solid waste
management component a viable finamcial operation in its own right, the GOI
has initiated a number of pilot projects. It has provided assistance to the
States/UTs for undertaking such pilot projects of solid waste management. Due
to the newness of the program, no precise estimates are available.
D. Programs Sponsored bq the Ministry of Rural Develonent
54.   Rural Water Sugply.  The Mlnistry of Rural Development launched in 1986,
the National Drinking Water Mission to accelerate the process of providing one
of the basic needs to .he rural masses. The Mission carries out its projects
through three components: (a) Minimum Needs Program (MNP) which is implemented
at the State sector; (b) the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Program (ARWSP)
which is Centrally sanctioned; and (c) sub-missions. All of them aim at
providing safe water to the rural population through various sub-projects,
such as guinea worm eradication, fluorosis control, excess iron removal,
brackishness control, water conservation, aquifers recharging, water quality
surveillance, etc. Most of such projects are implemented and monitored by the
State Governments against the release of funds from the Central Government.
Priority is given to villages with no water source, or with contaminated
drinking water, or with per capita water supply less than 40 Ipcd. Up to
1991, about 891 of the rural population has been covered.
55.   Rural Sanitation Program.  The GOI introduced the Sanitation Program in
the health sector In 1954. In 1981, the Government launched a Decade Program
with the aim to provide 25X of the population with sanitary living
environment. The rural part of the program was put under the administration
of the Ministry of Rural Development in 1985, which was made the nodal
Ministry for coordinating programs of sanitary latrines. The Rural Sanitation
Program was also included in the State sector under the Minimum Needs Program.
Due to the lack of initiative at all levels, inadequate financial resources,
poor perception of the importance of sanitation, the lack of a felt need from
the people and the lack of popular participation, the modest objective of
covering 252 of the population envisaged by the Decade Program has so far not
been achieved. Only 32 of the targeted population has been provided with
sanitary latrines under the program.
IK.    DCTAL PROGRAMS PtF SCORD CMUS (SC) AND sCMnM TRIUS (ST)
A. Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled TrIbe (ST) In Iadia
56.   Scheduled Castes.  Scheduled Castes (SC) constitute 15.81 of India's
total population, according to the  081 census. About 84X of the SC
population reside in the rural areas, in bastis and hamlets often situated

away from the HaMin villages. In urban areas, they are mostly confined to
the congested slums. Most of the SC population still suffer from social
discrimination and economic deprivation. The stigma of untouchability
continues to occupy a central place in all their sufferings. They are
educationally, socially and economically the most backward and are victims of
extreme forms of exploitation. About 78X of the Scheduled Castes is estimated
to be living below poverty line. A large proportion of those who live in
rural areas are landless while the others who do have land, often have too
little of it. Whatever pieces of land they have are also mostly un-irrigated
and poorly developed. 28.2Z of the Scheduled Castes are cultivators, mostly
owning very small land holdings, and 48.22 are agricultural laborers. The
bulk of the bonded laborers in the country are from the Scheduled Castes.
Most of the persons engaged in the scavenging, including servicing of dry
latrines, are Scheduled Castes. The percentage of literacy among the
Scheduled Castes is 21.4X as against the all India average of 41.31. The
percentage of literacy among SC women is only 10.91 as against 24.9X among
other women (excluding the Scheduled Castes/Tribes).
57.   Scheduled Tribes.   Scheduled Tribes (ST), totalling 53.8 million people
according to the 1981 census, constitutes about 7.8X of the entire population
in India and are spread over 26 States/UTs. Like the Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes are among the most backward and the weakest sections of the
society in terms of income, education, occupation, and social status. The ST
population, particularly those living in the interior forest areas, depend
heavily for their livelihood on growing millets, oilseeds, pulses, minor or
agricultural crops, horticulture, forest produce.
D. Protective Measures for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes In India
58.   The protection of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India is
enshrined in various Articles of the country's Constitution and the
Presidential Orders specifying the definition of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes in different States and Union Territories of the country.
These Articles and Acts provide guarantees for the basic human rights of
Scheduled Castes/Tribes through abolishing the 'Untouchability' (f Scheduled
Castes, forbidding its practice in any form, stipulating punishment for any
atrocities committed against Scheduled Castes/Tribes. The Constitution also
established a Special Officer commonly known as Commissioner for Scheduled
Castes and Tribes responsible for the protection of Scheduled Castes and
Tribes. To ensure that the Constitutional provisions are effectively pursued
and implemented, the Article 338 of the Constitution was amended by the
Constitution (Sixth Fifth Amendment) Act, 1990, to replace the Special Officer
by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
59.   To further integrate the Scheduled Castes and Tribes into the country's
overall development process, the Government of India introduced in the Sixth
Five-Year Plan, a comprehensive strategy consisting of three parts:
(a) Special Component Plan for the States and the Central Ministries, which is
designed to chaunel the flow of outlays and benefits from the general sectors
in the Plans of the States and the Central Ministries; (b) Special Central
Assistance which aims at creating a multiplier effect and helping fill any
financial gaps in both the Central and the State Plans; and (c) Scheduled

Castes Development Corporations which serve as interface between the poor
Scheduled Caste entrepreneurs and the financial institutions in respect of
bankable schemes of economic development.
60. The 00I has also provided additional opportunities in education,
employment and other facilities in favor of Scheduled Castes, on account of
historical factors as a result of which they are the victims of suppression,
oppression and exploitation. There is a policy of 15? reservation in public
services for the Scheduled Castes. Besides concessions in the educational and
economic spheres such as scholarships and priorities in the distribution of
ceiling surplus land, housing and other benefits are also available to them.
61. The Department of Welfare of the Ministry of Welfare serves as a nodal
department to coordinate the various welfare measures including Constitutional
and statutory safeguards for the welfare of Scheduled Castes/Tribes. Both the
Central and the States Governments have sponsored various programs and schemes
to protect and promote the development of Scheduled Castes and Tribes.
C. Valor Central and Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Scheduled Castes/Tribes
In Education & Uealth, and Their Finncial Implications
62.   Post Matric Scholarships for Scheduled Castes/Tribes.  The Post-Matric
Scholarships Scheme is the most important 10OX centrally sponsored scheme
designed to provide financial assistance to Scheduled Castes/Tribes students
whose parents or guardians satisfy the means test and the number of children
prescribed under the scheme. It is implemented by the State Governments/Union
Territory Administration and the students get the scholarships through
States/UTs to which they belong. The scholarships are sanctioned on a year-
to-year basis. Under the scheme, the level of expenditure reached in the last
year of each Plan stands committed to the States/UTs and is borne by them from
their own funds. The Central Government commitment is to assist the
StateslUTs by sanctioning grants over and above the committed liability. The
committed liability for all the State Governments/UT Administrations at the
end of Seventh Plan was Rs. 2,073.2 million.
63. Pre-Matric Scholarships for the Children of Those EnSaged in Unclean
Occupations. This scheme started during 1977-78 and provide proper hostels
and good quality education to children whose parents/guardians are engaged in
unclean occupations like tanning, flaying, scavenging and sweeping with wages
less than Rs.1,000 per month, and who are living in unhygienic surroundings.
Under the scheme, the Central Government provides to the State Government on a
50:50 basis over and above the committed expenditures, for the disbursement of
scholarships to the children of those engaged in unclean occupations. At
present, the scheme is restricted to hostellers and to classes from VI to X.
The number of beneficiaries is presently estimated to be 15,000 per annum.
64. Book Bank Scheme for SC/ST Students Studying In Medical and Engineering
Colleges is intended to benefit the SC/ST students pursuing medical and
engineering degree courses in the country. A set of text books costing up to
Rs.5,000 is given to a group of three students. The life period of a set of
books is fixed as three years. The Central assistance is provided to the
State Government on a 50:50 basis.

65.   Girls Hostels for Scheduled Castes scheme was started during the Third
Five-Year Plan. Central assistance is provided to the State Governments on a
50:S0 basis for the construction of hostel buildings for Scheduled Castes
girls studying in middle and higher levels of education. The ceiling cost of
construction per inmate has recently been revised from Rs.12,775 per inmate in
respect of plain areas to Rs.20,220. The expenditure on maintemance is borne
by the State Govermments from their own funds.
66.   Girls' Hostels for Scheduled Tribes has been in operation since the
Third Five Year Plan. Under this scheme, central assistance is provided to
the State Governments on a 5050¢ basis for the construction of hostel
buildings for Scheduled Tribe girls. The expenditure on maintenance of these
hostels is borne by the State Governments out of their own funds. During the
1990-91, the Central Goveranmt provided a total of Rs. 40 million to the
State Governments.
67.   Boys Hostels for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes Scheme of Girls
Hostels for Scheduled Castes/Tribes has been extended to Scheduled
Caste/Scheduled Tribe boys starting from 1989-90. The financing and operation
of this scheme is similar to that of girls hostels.
68.   Liberation of Sc*aveners Scheme aims at converting dry latrines into
water-borne sanitary latrines, thereby liberating the scavengers from removing
night soil and filth physically, and providing alternative and dignified
occupations to the liberated scavengers and their wards. The number of dry
latrines In the country was estimated to be about 7.5 million in 1989. The
scheme provides different amounts of subsidies, loans, and beneficiary
contributions to families depending on whether they belong to a economically
weaker section, or a low lncome group, or a middle/higher lncome group. From
its inception in 1980-81 until the end of 1990-91, 490 towns in 19 States were
covered under the scheme and a total of Rs. 821.0 million of Central
assistance has been released to the State Governments/UT Administrations.
About 960,000 of dry latrines have been converted into water-borne latrines,
and 15,000 scavengers and their wards have been liberated and rehabilitated.

A.  The fudfing and MonitorLLng the  infimum Needs P?oaem (mP
1.        Once the Five-Year Plan is agreed, the financial and physical
achievements of the States are closely monitored and supported by the
mechanism of regular Annual Plan discussions.  To ensure efficient and
effective Annual Plan implementation, there are four stages of discussions:
(a) Financial Resources. These are held between the Financial
Resources Division of the Planning Commission and State Finance
officials generally in October/November preceding the start of the
fiscal year in April;
(b) Sectoral and Program Content. This is made final in the December -
January period in discussion between the Sectoral Head/Advisor of
the Planning Commission and Sector/Department officials of the
State. This is a critical level in the process and ensures that
the content of MNP in the sector is appropriate and that adequate
funds are provided. The discussion of sectoral Annual Plans takes
into consideration the followings (i) a review of financial,
physical and operational achievements of the previous year; (ii)
financial and program progress of the current Annual Plan; and
(iii) proposals for the next fiscal year. Officials from the
concerned Central Ministries/Departments take on active part in
these discussions, particularly in regard to the physical,
operational and financial aspects of the Centrally Sponsored
Schemes (CSS);
(c) Inter-Sectoral Plan/Program Outlays. This exercise is undertaken
between the State Plan Advisor and the Chief Secretary, Planning,
Finance and sectoral Secretaries of the State. Officers from
Central Ministries/ Departments also participate. In these
discussions, a balanced view is taken of all the proposed
development programs, the finances of the State, and the inter-
sectoral balance which is to be achieved. Financial outlays for
the State Plan as a whole and allocations to specific sectors are
tentatively agreed at this meeting; and
(d) Final Annual Plan Discussions. The final Annual Plan discussions
are held between the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission
supported by,Members of the Planning Commission, the concerned
State Plan Advisor and Sectoral Advisors and the Chief Minister of
the State assisted by his concerned Ministers/Secretaries and
staff. The final Annual Plan of the State is decided in this
meeting which also broadly reviews program progress, finances of
the past, current and next year. The implementation of Minimtn
Needs Program receives priority in this discussion.
2.        To ensure that the MNP outlays are protected and targets achieved,
the Planning Commission beginning with the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1985),
started earmarking HNP funds. This meant that States could not divert MNP
funds to other sectors. During the Seventh Plan period, the Planning
Commission took a serious view of States even transferring MNP funds from one



- 73 -
AMNEX 2
Page 4
MP program to another.  It issued a note to Stateslu's stating that any
diversion of funds from the MNP or any under-utilization vould be viewed
seriously and that Central assistance to the State (about 552 of States total
developenet plans) would be proportionately reduced. This helped In
protecting M1P funds.
S. e   IgmnnUtion Review Mechaism
3.        States have built-in mechanisme by which the respective Departments
review the progress of different programs of the MIP. This is particularly so
for programs covered under the Twenty-Point Program, 1986 (TPP-86) and thus
the HMP, which is done through high-level committees under the chairmuaship of
the Chief Minister and another under the Chief Secretary of the State. The
following additional steps are takens
(a) The TPP-86 is also reviewed by the PM Secretariat;
(b) Concerned Ministries/Departments of the Central government monitor
the Progress of HIP/TPP-86 in close consultation with the
respective Division of the Planning Commission;
(c) The Ministry of Program Implementation conducts detailed monthly,
quarterly, and annual Progress Reviews of the TPP which covers a
large part of MHP;
(d) A member of the Planning Commission with the rank of State
Minister. is responsible for the review of the Minimum Needs
Program on a quarterly basis: and
(e) Evaluations of different aspects of the HP/ITPP are conducted by
the Planning & Evaluation Organization (PlO) of the Planning
Commission. The recent evaluation of JRY is an ezample.
Independent institutions are also asked from time to tine to
evaluate specific programs of HIPI?PP.

Financial Minister

New Delhi
November 30, 1992
Dear Mr. Preston,
You will recall that in the context of the Structural Adjustment Loan
(SAL), my Letter of Development Policy to you, dated November 11, 1991, had
referred to our intention to seek IBRDIIDA support for our medium-term reform
strategy along with a fast disbursing component to meet the transitional
social costs of adjustment. The stabilisation and structural adjustment
programme is already well underway and we are committed to maintain the
mnoentum of the reform process. There are transitional costs associated with
adjustment which has a severe and disproportionate impact on the poorer
sections of our society.
The Government is deeply conscious of its special responsibility to
protect the poorer sections of our society, especially in rural areas and the
need to mitigate the costs of adjustment. The vulnerable sections of our
society will need particular attention and support to prevent disease,
malnutrition and ill-health. They would also be required to be assisted in
educational skills to increase their access to the means of production which
would eventually make their participation in growth process more meaningful.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Government of India plans to
adopt a programe of specific measures aimed at strengthening the existing
Social Safety Net. This would comprise initiatives in the areas of primary
health care and disease control, basic education, supplementary nutrition for
small children and pregnant and lactating women, and income-transfer through
rural and urban slum employment programmes aimed at the poor, as well as
establishing the National Renewal Pund to cover the costs of severance pay,
retraining and redeployment of workers, and area employment regeneration
schemes for cities which would be severely Impacted by the industrial and
public enterprise reform programmes.
I would like to mention here that in spite of severe constraints
engendered by the adjustment process, we have protected the Central Plan
outlays for education, health, family welfare and women & child welfare. We
are committed to maintain this level of expenditures and further to even
enhance the outlays by refocussing social expenditures, particularly in health
and education towards the poor. The Eighth Five-Year Plan which has been
approved by the National Development Council commits us to increase
Investments In human resources.

The effectiveness of these measures would critically depend upon the
availability of adequate external finance and, In this context, I greatly look
forward to your continued support in our endeavour to achieve these
objectives.
The Government's medium-term programme for strengthening the Social
Safety Net is described in the note attached to this letter.

THE PROGRAMNE FOR STRENGTHENING THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET
A.    Background
1.    India, both the Centre and States, spends about 8.4Z of GDP to
support a wide array of programmes which provide essential social services to
benefit the poor and alleviate poverty. Since the beginning of the Sixth
Five-Year Plan (1980), the Government has recognised that for its poorest
population, a core of essential services must be provided. It has, therefore,
given priority to 12 special programmes selected from the range of social
sector schemes and these are referred to as Minimum Needs Programme (MNP) or a
Social Safety Net. These programmes cover primary education. The other
important component of Social Safety Net is employment. In this area, India
supports employment creationlincome transfer programmes in rural areas through
the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY) and in urban areas through the Nehru Rozgar
Yojana (NRY). Food security for the population in general and for the weaker
sections of the population in particular, is a basic element in India's social
policy and this is ensured through the Public Distribution System (PDS). PDS
has three main objectivess (a) to provide quantity rationing of essential
commodities to the population; (b) to stabilise consumer prices; and (c) to
mitigate poverty and increase food consumption of the poor.
2.    The current agenda for stabilisation and structural reforms entail
significant transitional costs. To mitigate the social cost of adjustment,
the Government of India is proposing to strengthen the Social Safety Net as an
adjunct to the Structural Adjustment Programme, to ensure that the level of
effort in the social sectors in general and for the MNP in particular, is
maintained during the process of severe fiscal adjustment; that this effort is
enhanced by expanding the coverage of key social programmes in the most
c.isadvantaged areas of India; and that a new temporary safety net is created
to facilitate industrial and Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) restructuring. To
provide adequate resource support to the proposed Programme for Strengthening
the Social Safety Net (The Programme), the Government's intention is to roll
back public investment from those sectors of the economy where the private
sector can play a lead role and step up public expenditures in the social
sectors. This requires a delicate balancing of options in the formulation of
the Budget over the medium-term as the Government seeks to reduce the deficit.
3.    The stabilisation and structural adjustment programme is already well
underway and the Government is committed to maintaining the momentum of this
reform process. Nonetheless, in the last year, the transitional costs
associated with adjustment, which severely and di.sproportionately impact the
poorer sections of our society, have been observed. For example:
- in undertaking the fiscal deficit reduction programme, the Government
recoLuised that public expenditures on social sector programmes had come
under severe pressure;
-  in pursuing the industrial sector and public enterprise reform
programme, the Government recognised that concerted efforts are required
to work out appropriate compensation and rehabilitation packages for
workers who will be affected; and



- 81 -
ANNEX 4
Page 4
- with the removallrationalisation of administered prices and the increase
in inflation, the price of basic food and other primary products which
are essential to the poor have risen.
4.    It is against this background that the Programme to Strengthen the
Social Safety Net has been established by the Government and is characterised
by four overriding principless
- more effective targeting of social services to the poorer sections of
the society;
- improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the various schemes which
make up the Programme with a particular emphasis on design, software and
implementation.
- increased coordination in the delivery of targeted social services with
the active participation of State and Local Government implementation
agencies; and
- the provision of adequate resources to ensure that both new investment
and the resultant recurrent operation and maintenance expenditures are
adequately funded and sustained.
5.    The Programme covers primary education, primary health care, disease
control, nutrition and food security and employment and income generation.
The sectoral context, specific initiatives and policy reform measures are
outlined in the following paragraphs.
B.   Education
6.    Since the enunciation of the National Policy on Education (NPE) in 1986,
public policy has given high priority to expanding and improving primary
education and adult literacy programmes as a means of enhancing educational
expenditures on the poor. The process of reviewing National Policy on
Education and its Programme of Action (POA) was completed in April 1992. The
policy review had reiterated the priority accorded by the National Policy on
Education to Universalisation of Elementary Education (UBE) and Universal
Literacy; it had also broadly reaffirmed the policy frame and operational
strategies outlined by NPE and POA. The NPE states that an alternative system
will be devised to involve private and voluntary efforts in technical and
professional sectors of education in conformity with accepted norms and goals.
The RPE further states that non-Government and voluntary efforts will be
encouraged subject to proper management and provision of financial assistance.
Further, the NPE has envisaged that resources to the extent possible will be
raised by mobilising donations, raising fees at the higher levels of education
and effect savings by the efficient use of facilities. The policy also
provides for decentralisation and the creation of the spirit of autonomy for
educational institutions and also giving preeminance to association of non-
Governmental agencies and voluntary effort. The report of the Central
Advisory Board of Education (CABE) Committee on Policy, which formed the basis
for policy review, had recommended progressively making higher education and
technical and management education largely self-financing by revising the fee
structure with appropriate support to the needy students by way of student
loans.

ANNEX 4
Page 5
7.    The Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992-97) which was approved by the National
Development Council (NDC) and Parliament, fully reflects the National Policy
on Education. The Plan has stressed that the universalisation of elementary
education (UEE) and the complete eradication of illiteracy among the people in
the 15-35 year age group, is a priority objective. This priority has been
reflected in the Plan outlays. Education sector outlays (Central and States)
has increased from Re. 76,429 million (US$2,544.3 million equivalent) in the
Seventh Plan to Rs. 1,95,996 million (US$6,533.2 million equivalent) in the
Eighth Plan. There has also been a remarkable shift in the inter sector
allocations to reflect this priority. The outlays for elementary education
increased from 332 in the Sixth Plan to 37S in the Seventh Plan and now claims
472 in the Eighth Plan. Conversely, the share of higher education has
steadily declined during this period from 222 in the Sixth Plan to 16X in the
Seventh Plan, and now to only about 82 under the Eighth Plan. This trend is
evident not only in the Central Government's outlays but also in the State
sector.
Primary Education
S.    The Government recognises that achievement of universal elementary
(primary) education (UEE) requires the enrolment of about 56.1 million
additional children by the year 1997. Priority objectives include increasing
enrolment, improving quality of instruction and ensuring that children attain
specified Minimum Levels of Learning (lLL).  With this in view, the Programe
will support the new strategy for UBE which envisages the adoption of
disaggregated target setting and decentralised planning. The point of
departure from previous practice in primary education development is that
district-specific, population-specific plans for USE will be developed through
people's participation at the local level. The achievement of UEE will be
through a bottom-up rather than a top-down strategy.
9.   Micro-planning will provide the framework for universal access and
universal participation strategies, while HLU would be the approach for
universal achievement. These district plans which would be developed on
projects will include a specific package of educational activities, clearly
defined responsibilities, precise time-schedules and district-specific
targets. Each district plan will be tailored to the specific needs and
possibilities of that district. Apart from effective UE, the goals of each
district plan will include the reduction of existing disparities in
educational access especially to the poor, enrollment of girls, a substantial
improvement in the quality of school facilities, better training and
motivation of primary school teachers, improved quality and availability of
text buoks, obtaining a genuine community involvement in the operst$on of
schools, and building up local level capacity to ensure effective
decentralisation of educational planning and monitoring.
10. The overall goal would be the reconstruction of Primary Education as a
whole in selected districts instead of the piecemeal implementation of
schemes. The programmes would cover educationally backward districts vhich
have been identified on the basis of objective criteria as well as districts
where total literacy campaigns have been successful resulting In a demand for
elementary education. This new initiative would be decentralized and would
include financing mechanism to channel estimated adequate resources over the

Eighth Plan period from the Centre to the districts for primary education
district projects.
11.   In accordance with the National Policy on Education and the
recommendation of the CABE Committee on Policy, the Government has taken steps
to reduce the reliance of higher education institutions on the budget and has
simultaneously encouraged those institutions to undertake their own resource
mobilisation efforts. Initial action has already been taken by the premier
institutions such as the Indian Institute of Management (IIMs) and the Indian
Institute of Technology (IITs) to increase significantly, tuition and other
fees for post-graduate programmes. This is a major change in policy, since
most fees have remained unchanged for decades. The UGC is setting up a High
Powered Committee to consider steps for mobilisation of additional resources
for higher education, to bring about a better balance in the funding of
institutions for higher education and research, and to improve the cost
efficiency of the university system. The recommendations of this Committee
will be implemented after appropriate consideration by the Gowernment.
C.    Health
12. In recognisation of the fact that the provision of good quality health
care is an essential component of the Social Safety Net in a democratic
society, the Government has taken a number of steps to make this a reality.
First, work has started on the revision of the National Health Policy of 1982
to bring medium and long-term targets and goals more in line with current
realities. This will be an exhaustive process involving Centre, State and
local level policy makers and programme managers. The planning and analysis
capacity of the Department of Health is being strengthened as the Department
will have a lead role in the entire process of health renewal and
rehabilitation. The Government has also started to strengthen and expand the
Health Management Information System as a part of the capacity building
exercise in this sector. Further, in collaboration with IDA, a comprehensive
study of health financing was completed and a workshop undertaken on health
priorities with the all India Institute of Medical Sciences. Additional
management and efficiency studies including one on Health Personnel
Requirements have been started. It is expected that this work would provide
both the institutional framework and management capacity to successfully
implement the initiatives in primary health care and disease control, which
would be a part of the Programme.
13. Primary Health Care facilities are extended to the people through a
network of Community Health Centres (CHCs), Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and
Sub-Centres. Trained Birth Attendants (TBAs) and Village Health Guides (VHGs)
working in rural areas as voluntary workers, supplement the extension of
primary health care services to the people. This network is also used for
family welfare activities which covers family planning and maternal and child
health care including immunization of infants and children, other child
survival interventions and safe motherhood practices.
14. The delivery of primary health care services has had a varying degree of
success from State to State. While some States like Kerala, Goa and Tamil
Nadu have achieved considerable success, the large northern States of Uttar
Pradesh, Rajastham, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar which comprise 40? of the



- 84 -
ANNEX 4
Page 7
country's population, are lagging behind. Therefore, while the basic need to
improve the primary health care In the country as a whole is being attended
to, special attention will be given to low performing regions/areas. This
targeting of resources fonns an important and central feature of the 'Action
Plan for RevamPiRn the Family Welfare Prograume' which was approved by the
NDC.
15.   Ninety districts have been identified in the country as requiring
special attention. Eighty-three of these are in the above mentioned States,
and have a high birth rate of 39 and above per thousand according to the 1981
Census. Other demographic and social indicators like age at marriage of
girls, female literacy and INR, are generally below average in these
districts. Focussing on these districts represent a strategic and fundamental
shift in the policy of reducing national HMR and ZHR. Special initiatives
will be undertaken In these districts including micro-level planning,
differential provision of inputs for primary health care, better and different
forms of training, increased management and supervision, imaginative IEC
efforts and special inter-personal communication strategies.
16.   However, the lack of basic facilities, the shortage of manpower and
inadequate provision of supplies and equipment constitute major impediments to
full opertionalisation of these units. The approach and strategy for
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the primary health care in these
specially targeted 90 backward districts would bet
- provision of Operation Theatre, labour room, observation ward and staff
quarters;
- provision of essential equipment like generator, ambulance, etc. and
continuous water supply;
- filling up all vacant posts within a defined time-frame and in-service
training of staff; and
- ensure supply of essential drugs, dressings and other materials.
17.   While soft areas like IEC and training would be undertaken in the entire
district, the upgradation work mould be taken up in a phased manner, say about
four to five PECs In the first two years and about six to seven PHCs in the
next three years.
18.   The framework, evolved as above, is a result of consultations betveen
the poor performing States and Government of India. While GOI would provide
funds for upgradation of Infrastructure under the framework suggested, States
would undertake to provide a Lady Kedical Officer at each of the PECs selected
for upgradation. They would also undertake the responsibility of maintaining
the assets created.
19.   The main objective of this exercise would be to improve primary health
care delivery system which, in turn, are expected to bring about favourable
changes in the demographic indicators in these districts in the long run.



- 85 -
ANNEX 4
Page 8
20.   Adequate additional funds would be provided In the Eighth Plan to cover
the cost of this initiative for 90 districts where fertility, mortality and
morbidity indicators require special attention.
21. Disease Control. A number of national programmes for the control and
eradication of diseases have been in operation in India for a long time.
However, communicable diseases continue to pose serious challenges to the
health system. In order to ensure that the Govermnent's effort in this area
is not hampered by fiscal compression, allocations for this programme have
been maintained in real terms at 1991-92 levels, by an enhancement by Rs.840
million as a supplement to the Budget. This allocation would be further
increased in the remaining years of the Plan period to cover the costs of a
fundamental restructuring of the leprosy, malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS/HIV
and other disease control programmes. The Government has already initiated
steps to achieve greater cost effectiveness of disease control programmes.
This was started by undertaking comprehensive reviews of the major programmes
in order to determine and adopt the most suitable strategies and policies for
control, appropriate technologies, procedures and standards, and resource
requirements for sustainability. The reviews are being undertaken by high-
level groups including non-governmental experts, and when completed, would
serve as a basis for new Action Plans for the control and eradication of these
diseases. Action Plans have already been completed for Revamped Leprosy and
Blindness Schemes, and those for Malaria and Tuberculosis would be completed
by 1993. The Government will launch these revamped programmes beginning FY
1993 and is committed to sustaining them until control and eradication is
achieved. Efforts are underway to secure sustained external assistance for
revamped programmes.
D.   NUTRITION AND FOOD SECURITY
22.   The bedrock of India's effort to tackle the problem of malnutrition
amongst vulnerable sections of the population is the Integrated Child
Development Services (ICDS) Programme. It is a village-level programme which
aims at providing a package of nutrition, maternal and child health (MCH) and
pre-school education services as close to the community as possible through
centres run by part-time, local voluntary workers. Presently, this programme
has reached about 16 million children in the age group of 6 months - 6 years
and 2.9 million pregnant women and nursing mothers.
23. This prograsmme has been subjected to evaluations from time to time. A
recent national evaluation undertaken by the National Institute of Public
Cooperation and Child Development (NIPCCD) showed a decline in the incidence
of severe and moderate malnourishment among children in ICDS project areas,
and their better health and nutrition status, compared to non-ICDS areas. It
also showed an average IMH of 72 per thousand live births, compared to the
national IHZ of 80 per thousand live births.
24. However, while NIPCCD recommended further and accelerated expansion of
ICD8, certain areas which required fundamental attention were revealed. In
particular, NIPCCD recomemaded that attention be given to ensure that
supplementary feeding, which is intended to be on all working days (25 days
per month) is not interrupted; the coordination with health services with
other programes should be improved; more emphasis should be given to
nutrition and health education through basic and refresher training; and



- 86 -
ANNEX 4
Page 9
community participation should be intensified. The Government is committed to
fully implement the NIPCCD recommendations and the Women and Child Development
Department has already ilnitiated the appropriate actions on these
recommendations.
25.  The national programm  of ICDS will pursue a basic strategy for
nutrition and early childhood development, but as a part of the Programme of
Strengthening the Social Safety Net, will give a special focus to 180 "focal'
districts which are predominantly Inhabited by the tribal people, scheduled
castes, drought-prone areas and urban slums. The quality of services will be
improved by taking special care to address the weaknesses brought out by the
recent evaluation. Care will be taken to ensure that the full nutritional
norm of supplementary feeding is observed, food is provided for all the 300
days, children below three years are duly covered and pregnant nursing mothers
and malnourished children get the food according to the higher prescribed
norm.
26. Recognising that much more needs to be done for women to alleviate their
situation in the society, and in addition to improving the efficiency,
effectiveness and expanding the ICDS programs from which vulnerable women
will benefit, the Government will establish a National Credit Funtd for Women
(NCFW) to provide credit to the. poor and illiterate urban and rural women in
the informal sector. This Fund will be managed mainly through selected
voluntary organisations.
27. Food security for the population in general, and the poorer and weaker
sections of the population in particular is a basic element in our social
policy and this is ensured through the Public Distribution System (PDS). As
part of the Programme of Strengthening the social Safety Net with its emphasis
on targeting services to the truly poor, the Government of India, in early
1992, started to revamp the PDS. This included adding 11,000 new fair price
shops in about 1,70%o targeted priority blocks, primarily in tribal and
drought-prone areas, desert development blocks and certain designated hill
areas. To date, 9,000 new shops have been opened and 1.9 million new ration
cards have been issued to the poor beneficiaries who reside in these blocks.
An additional 2 mlllion tons of wheat and rice will be moved through the PDS
in these blocks.
28. The Government and States which determine eligibility and access to PDS,
also recognise that the PDS needs to focus more sharply on areas and
categories of population most affected by price fluctuations in the market and
who require some income support to maintain minimum nutrition levels.
Therefore, in addition to the revamping of the PDS by targeting 1700 priority
blocks, the GOI is cognisant that additional steps must be taken to address
the issue of entitlements to those who are not the most 'needy and deserving.9
In this context, in the Advisory Council on PDS which met in July 1992, almost
all the States expressed the view that a National Policy in this regard should
be evolved. The GOI is now investigating what can be done through special
initiatives and has urged the States to make similar efforts.
29. The States have also felt the impact of adjustment and are starting to
take steps to target PDS to the hardcore poor. For example, Gujarat has
decided to exclude from PDS, all persons earning over Rs.28,000 per annum;



- 87 -
ANNEX 4
Page 10
Rajasthan will not provide subsidised foodgrain to income-tax payers; and
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have introduced an income limit in rural areas
for State-subsidised rice.
E.    EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME-GENERATION
30.   As part of the overall structural adjustment programue, the Government
has started the process of reform of Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs). The
decision to restructure PSEs, especially the possibility of closing
chronically loss-generating companies is a radical departure from past
practices.  To ensure the continuation of this reform programme, and to
provide the estimated 400,000 workers who would be affected with adequate
protection, the GOI established in February 1992, the National Renewal Fund
(NRF). This account would cover the costs of (a) compensation under the
Voluntary Retirement Scheme of the GOI for public and private industrial
sector employees who are affected by restructuring or closure of industrial
units; (b) retraining and redeployment of employees which result from
modernisation, technology upgrades and industrial restructuring; and
(c) employment generation schemes both in the organised and unorganised sector
including the JRY and NRY. The Financial and Business Plan of the NRF for
1992-93 is estimated to cost Rs. 19,000 million.
31. The Government intends to use the existing rural and urban employment
creation programmes to provide a safety net for the poor.  The Jawahar Rozgar
Yojana (JRY) is a rural-based programme and provides funds to panchayat
institutions to finance construction of minor public works with locally hired
labour.  In 1991-92, 875 million person days of work were generated with
approximately 55 million persons gaining some employment under the programme.
A recent evaluation of the programme undertaken by the Planning Commission
suggest that the welfare benefits of JRY are reasonably well-targeted to the
poor, with more than 702 of the person days used by person below the poverty
line, more than half utilised by scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, and
more than 402 by the landless. Women did not fare well receiving only about
251 of employment person-days. Asset construction has been relatively
unsuccessful. Problems have been encountered in the selection, design and
completion of projects, and maintenance is inadequate. Recent efforts to
decentralise programme administration to the panchayat have been hampered by
the uneven development of these institutions. Court rulings which have
required JRY to pay official minimum wages, which are usually above market
rates, has increased the likelihood that many non-poor may access the scheme.
32.   The Government has recognised these problems in the Programme of
Strengthening the Social Safety Net and will further concentrate JRY resources
in the most backward districts and introduce more flexi'ility in programr.&a
administration. NGOs will be asked to take a more important role in
monitoring service delivery. Given the importance of the programme as a
safety net for the rural poor, the Government has earmarked an additional
Rs. 5,000 million in the NRF's Employment Generation Fund to augment JRY
resources.
33. The Nehru Rozgar Yojana (NRY) is the urban version of the JRY. The NRY
has three programmes, each targeted at a different segment of the urban poor.
The Scheme of Urban Micro Enterprise (SiME) is designed to encourage
unemployed and under-employed youth to take up self-employment; the Scheme of

Urban Wage Employment (SUVE) providee employment to the urS6an poor through the
creation of assets In the low income neighbourhoods in towns with populations
below 100,000, and the Scheme of Housing and Shelter Upgradation (SHASU)
provides employment for persons involved in housing and building activities
and has two components: training and subsidy-cum-loan assistance. The
pr3gramme has been in operatien for only three years. On the basis of
feedback received from States/Union Territories, the scheme has been modified.
Revised guidelines on NRY have been issued. The Government further plans to
suitably revise the programme with an emphasis on even better targeting to the
urban areas which will be impacted by the public enterprise reform and
industrial restructuring programmw and will fund additional activities through
the NRF.
34.   In undertaking the above Programme to Strengthen the Social Safety Net,
the Government has been very aware that it will require a serious effort to
strengthen the coordination of social services, as well as improve the
planning and management of the industrial schemes. The Government has,
therefore, established a Standing Social Sector Coordination Committee In the
Cabinet Secretariat to examine issues relating to the convergence of social
services, duplication and redundance in the staffing and management of
different social sector programmes so as to achieve better targeting of the
poor beneficiaries and greater cost-effective delivery of programes. The
Social Sector Coordination Committee is chaired by Secretary (Coordination)
and includes the Secretaries of Health, Family Welfare, Education, Women &
Child Development and the Chief Secretaries of the States of Kerala,
Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.  This Standing Committee with the
appropriate inputs from local-level managers will design an implementation
strategy for the Programme, especially given that there is a considerable
overlap in the districts targeted for the special initiatives in primary
education, primary health care, disease control and ICDS.
35.   This arrangement would help to adopt an appropriate medium-term poverty
alleviation programme in the present contractionary phase. By funding this
Programme, the Government will have, by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan,
increased outlays to the social sectors from its current share of ll to
closer to 192. This would be in keeping with the Governmint's commitment to
increase involvement in human capital and poverty alleviation,and the
attainment of a central feature of the structural reform programme which was
started in 1991.

I. PRIMARY EDUCATION
A. BackLround and Current Status
1.     The goal of universal primary education has been stated in successive
Five-Year Plans, but has proven elusive. Although nearly full enrollment in
the primary cycle is reported, less than half of the 11-14 age cohort is
enrolled in the three-year upper primary cycle. Dropout rates are very high.
In 1988, 47 percent of primary students failed to complete five years of
education; of those who entered upper primary education, 63 percent failed to
complete the program. These rates were only marginally better than those of
1986.  Drop-out rates for girls are higher than for boys, and those for
scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students are higher than for other
students. Studies show that nearly half of the students leaving school early,
drop out because of the poor quality of schooling.
2.    Moreover, the development of primary education has been extremely uneven
across the States and Union Territories. Kerala has achieved universal
enrollment and comparatively high levels of completion of the five-year cycle.
Near universal literacy has been attained. In other States, less than half of
the students complete five years of schooling, with girl students falling far
behind boys. Despite substantial improvement in the last decade, enrollment
of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe children continues to lag behind State
averages. Ten States, (Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar,
Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal), are termed
educationally backward, with overall literacy rates ranging from 38 to 55
percent, and female literacy rates from 20 to 40 percent. Together, these
States account for more than 60 percent of the school age population.
3.    Intra-State disparities are even greater.  In more than 200 of the 412
districts of the country, female literacy rates are below 20 percent; and are
below 10 percent in more than 75 districts. Low levels of learning are the
norm for primary education in such of India. Comprehensive learning
achievement data for primary education are not available, but smaller studies
confirm that achievement is very low, even in some of the more advanced
States. The evidence also shows that access to and completion of primary
education are direct functions of family income.   Poor students benefit less
from primary education than their better-off peers, and poor girls benefit
least. The effects of these disparities are readily seen in social
indicators. In Kerala, there are 1,016 females for every 1000 males, and the
infant mortality rate is 28 per thousand births. In Uttar Pradesh there are
943 females for every 1,000 males, and the infant mortality rate is 124 per
thousand births.

ANNEX 6
Page 2
4.    Primary education in India is the joint responsibility of the Central
and State governmets, although financing has been primarily provided by the
States. In the Seventh Five-Year Plan the States provided 63 percent of the
Plan resources invested in primary education and 96 percent of non-plan
recurrent coFts.   Central and State plan expenditures on primary education,
which support system expansion and development, rose marginally to 37 percent
of the total education allocation in the Seventh Plan from 33 percent in the
Sixth Plan. In the Eighth Plan, the share rises to 47 percent.
5.     During the Seventh Plan, 70 percent of central government assistance to
the States for primary education has been delivered through Operation
Blackboard (OB), in which grants are provided to State governments for an
additional teacher and educational materials in single-teacher rural schools.
An important provision is that one of the two teachers in OB schools should be
female. While this program has had some success, it is targeted on a State
basis, with little attention to intra-state disparities in the availability
and quality of primary education. Moreover, only providing a package of
inputs has failed to address the more systemic constraints on the development
of primary education.
6.    GOI also supports non-formal alternatives to primary education for girls
and working children and improved teacher education. By policy, a range of
out-of-school education and training programs for adolescents and both
illiterate and newly literate adults are to be put in place. A National
Literacy Mission (NLM) has been established to implement total literacy
campaigns (TLC) is selected districts; initial evaluations indicate that these
campaigns have a significant upward effect on enrollments in primary schools.
B. Policy CheoRes
7.    During preparation for the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992-97), the GOI
recognized that past policies for primary education development had been
inadequate. As a first step towards change, the Department of Education, in
consultation with the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) and the
States, completed a review of the 1986 National Policy on Education (NPE).
The revised policy, and a new National Program of Action were tabled in
Parliament in August, 1992. The revised policy and Plan of Action are thus
fully aligned with the Eighth Plan period.

8.     Significant new policies have been established for primary education.
First, targeting will be improved, target setting would be disaggregated and
comprehensive, and specified in terms of access, participation and learner's
achievement and in relation to specific areas and population groups such as
girls, scheduled caste, scheduled tribes and disadvantaged groups. Secondly,
disaggregated target setting would be dovetailed with decentralized planning
with the district as a unit. Thirdly, with a view to give an impetus to
disaggregated target setting and decentralized planning, central assistance
would be provided in large measure through a new program entitled the National
Primary Education Development Program. This Program would be taken up in
selected districts and would aim at the reconstruction of primary education as
a whole through concerted implementation of program components tailored to the
specific needs and possibilities of each selected district. Fourthly, further
external assistance will be channeled for the new district-based program.
Fifth, achieving essential levels of learning have been specifically
identified as a thrust area and a new program of Minimum Levels of Learning
(NIL) and curricular reform aimed at the acquisition by every student of basic
competencies, has been developed. Sixth, with a primary school within 1.5 kms
of 952 of school-age children, greater priority will be given to improving the
quality of instruction in order to improve completion rates. Seventh, the
recently developed Education Management Information Systems will be expanded
through the targeted district-based program.
9.     These policies have, for the first time, been matched by a significant
increase in both Center and State Plan financing for primary education.
Central assistance has been increased fourfold, from Re. 6,580 million to Rs.
28,800 million; State Plan outlays have increased by a factor of three, from
Rs. 21,900 million to Rs. 63,210 million. As a percentage of Plan outlays for
education, primary education's share increased from 37 percent in the Seventh
Plan to 47 percent in the Eighth Plan. Of the increase, Rs. 19,500 million
vill support the primary education development program. To be able to reach
full enrollment at elementary level by 2000 would however require an increase
in projected expenditures by all public and private authorities during the
Eighth Plan period from about US$ 20 billion to US$ 31 billion.
PtARorM Chamass
10.    Central assistance for primary education will be channeled through
three programs. Of primary importance is the new Primary Education
Development Program for targeted low-literacy districts and districts where
total literacy campaigns have been successful in increasing the demand for
primary education. In addition, Operation Blackboard will be expanded and
improved. Existing and planned externally-assisted development projects in 53
districts in four educationally disadvantaged States (Bibar, Uttar Pradesh and
lajasthan, Andhra Pradesh) will be completed.
11.    The National Primary Education Development Program represents a new and
radically  improved approach to Central assistance to the States.  It rests
explicitly on the need for a systemic approach to educational improvement,
decentralization of educational development, effective community
participation, and better targeting within States. Five-year district
projects will be financed for stronger local governance of schools,
improvements in facilities, including those needed to make school a more



- 108 -
ANNEX 6
Page 5
comfortable and attractive place for girls, more and better textbooks, more
female teachers, improved teacher training, and stronger supervision and
school management.
12.     Individual districts vill be selected for Central assistance.  All
districts have been listed in priority order according to levels of literacy,
with female literacy given equal weight with overall literacy. Three
categories of districts have been identified for potential assistance:
(a) Educationally backward districts with low literacy and
where literacy campaigns have not taken off;
(b) educationally backward districts where Total Literacy Campaigns
have generated increased demand for primary education; and
(c) high literacy districts.
13.    In the latter category, assistance will focus mainly on improved
management and supervision to consolidate previous progress. Priority will be
given to the first two categories through the provision of comprehensive
assistance based on district-specific plans. In category two, this would
enable the program to "cash-in3 on newly generated demand. In category one,
activities to increase demand will be included.
14.     Plans for individual districts will be based on local assessments and
planning, following a "micro-planning' methodology developed by the National
Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA), for which
guidelines have been developed and distributed to the States. Experience with
district-level planning has also been gained through externally-assisted
projects. While plans will vary to meet the needs of particular districts,
the main components will conform to national policy: strengthened Village
Education Committees, improved facilities and materials, strengthened teacher
education, improved school management and supervision, non-formal primary
education, early childhood education, and empowerment of women. The balance
of investment between primary and upper primary education will be determined
for each district by the degree of achievement in enrollment and retention in
the primary cycle. The Educational Management Information System, already
developed and pilot tested, will be an integral part of the program.
15.    It is recognized that the five-year district projects will not, in all
cases, enable the goal of 90 percent completion of primary schooling to be
reached. However, the enhanced resource commitment, combined with intensive
action at the local level, is expected to lead to significant improvement in
enrollment and completion, and to establish a much stronger foundation for
continued efforts, which will be largely financed by the States.
16.    Operation Blackboard. Based on recent evaluations, OB will be
strengthened, most notably through improved teacher training. In addition,
the program is to be expanded to provide two additional teachers to selected
schools and extended to upper primary schools. In the Seventh Five-Year Plan
Rs. 3,730 million were spent on OB. The Eighth Five-Year Plan calls for an
allocation of Rs. 9,000 million.

17.    Externally-assisted District Projects.  External assistance for primary
education was gradually expanded during the Seventh Plan. Projects are
underway or In preparation In four of the ten educationally backward statest
Andhra Pradesh (ODA), Rajasthan (SIDA), Bihar (UNICEF), Uttar Pradesh (IDA).
Tn addition, a special program for women's education in underway in four
educationally backward States with support from Holland. These projects
conform to national policies, and their resources are additional to State
budgets. When completed, the projects will have covered 53 districts in
educationally backward States. This group of projects also represents the
first installment of targeted assistance to educationally disadvantaged
States. Under the Revised Program of Action, they will serve to test a range
of strategies and innovations, with particular attention to special programs
for girls and minorities, as a source of approaches for replication in the
National Program of Primary Education Development.

18.   The Department of Education has prepared a phased action plan for the
development and implementation of the new National Primary Education
Development program as the basis for further consultations with the States.
The plan recognizes the need to build the capacity of District, State and
national institutions to plan and manage the primary education development
process. It Is envisaged that, over the balance of the Eighth Plan, the
programwould add 110 five-year district projects to the 53 where work has
been started under current program of external assistance. An additional 120
district programs would be Initiated during the Ninth Plan. Thus, by the year
2002, elementary education development programs would have been initiated in
300 of the 416 districts ranked In 1989 according to literacy criteria. Of
these, 220 would have been completed.



- 110 -
ANNEX 6
Page 7
19.    The total nominal cost of the program is initially estimated as Rs.
19,500 million during the balance of the Eighth Plan, and Rs. 64,500 million
during the Ninth Plan. These totals include the cost of developing and
implementing district plans, plus the costs of strengthening the district,
state and national institutions needed to ensure sustained progress after the
completion of district action plans.
20.    In the Eighth Plan period, Rs. 2,300 million of the program costs will
be financed from the Plan allocation of Rs. 28,800 million. The GOI will seek
external assistance for the balance. A target of Rs. 17,200 million (US$ 600
million) has been set for the Eighth Plan Period. The Finance Ministry,
Planning Commission and Department of Education have agreed in principle that
external assistance to the program will be a net additionality to the current
Plan allocation to primary education.
B Impleumetation of Keforms
21.    The Department of Education (DOE) will assist States and districts with
the development of district plans. Appraisal and monitoring of district
projects will also be carried out by the DOE, which will establish an
appropriately staffed implementation unit. Primary Education Improvement
Initiative Authorities (PEIIAs) will be set up as registered non-profit
societies at the State level, under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister and
Education Minister. These bodies will be responsible for receiving and
disbursing program funds to districts. This model has been established in the
UNICEF-assisted Bihar Education Project and in SIDA-supported projects in
Rajasthan, and will also be employed in the IDA-assisted project in Uttar
Pradesh.
22.    The GoI anticipates that the Constitution Amendment Bill now being
reviewed by a Special Codmittee of Parliament will further strengthen
decentralization of planning and management to the district level by giving
district administration a legal basis. A special sub-couaittee of the CABE
would consider the implications of the Bill, which is likely to be considered
by Parliament in the Winter Session, 1992193.
23.    Education staff at district level will have principal responsibility
for design and implementation. While some increases in staff will be required
at the State and National levels, most staff expansion and development will
take place in the districts through the PRIIAs. Training in educational
planning and management will be providGd by the DOE in cooperation with State
and national educational research and development institutions, with
appropriate assistance from international agencies.
24.    A Technical Working Group has been established under the chairmanship
of the Secretary, Education, to complete detailed proposals for program
implementation. The terms of reference for this group include criteria for
selection in cooperation with the States, of the first 20 districts,
development of mechanisms for appraisal of district plans, and design of the
staffing and organizational arrangements needed for effective implementation.
The Working Group will also make recommendations on the nature and extent of
financing for district projects to be provided by the States. The report of
the Working Group will be completed by February, 1993.

25.    Consultations with State education authorities and international donors
were initiated with workshops in Orissa and Madhya Pradesh in September, 1992.
These will be followed by regional meetings with State Education Secretaries,
the first of which is scheduled for October 29-30, 1992.
II. PRIM&RY HIALTE CARE
A. Background and Current Statues
26.    India  is  a signatory to the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978  and is
committed to attaining the goal of fHealth for All" by the year 2000 A.D.
through the primary health care approach. The Government is concentrating its
efforts on the development of a rural health infrastructure so as to provide
health care services to about 80 of the rural population which, by and large,
have been neglected.
27.    The rural primary health care delivery system has been developed and
strengthened from the inception of First Five-Year Plan based on the principle
of a Minimum Needs Approach. The establishment of rural primary health
infrastructure has been created on population norms and is founded on a three-
tier system of sub-centers,  :lmary health centers and community health
centers. For delivery of health and family welfare services to the rural
population, the operation of the three-tier syste., is based on following
standards:
(a) Sub-Centers are being established on the basis of one sub-center
for every 5,000 population in general, and for every 3,000 in
hilly, tribal and backward areas. Each sub-center is required to
be staffed by a trained Female Health Worker or auxiliary nurse
midwife (ANM) and a trained male Health Worker;
(b) Primary Health Centers (PEC) are established for an average of
every 30,000 rural population in general and every 20,000
population in hilly, tribal and backward areas. The PHC is
staffed by a Medical Officer with supportive para-medical staff;
and
(c) Community Health Centers (CUC) are established for every four
Primary Health Centers so as to serve as a referral institution,
having a minimum of 30 beds and four specialists.
28.    Shortfalls in Primary Health Care System. To facilitate medical and
paramedical staff to provide good quality health care services, facilities,
drugs, equipment, supplies and training are provided to ensure full
operationalization of the system of health care institutions. However, the
lack of buildings, shortages of trained staff and inadequate provision of
drugs, supplies and equipment still constitute major impediments in the
functional operation of the rural health care delivery system. The following
table gives the details of the current functioning of the system.

29.    Currently, a little over 50Z of the sub-centers operate from rented
buildings which lack basic facilities like sanitatioix, water supply and
electricity. This results in the non-availability of residential
accommodations for female health workers which in turn seriously affects the
quality of primary health care available to the rural population. One third
of Primary Health Centers do not have their own buildings. In the case of
Comotnity Health Centers, one out of every five operates in a rented building.
30.    Availability of Trained Manpower: A sub-center is manned by a female
health worker and male health worker. 'hile the salary cost of the female
health workers is met by the GOI, the cost of the male health worker is met by
State Governments. Against the total requirement of 130,219 male health
workers, the total posts sanctioned so far by the States is only 72,658
(55.71U). This means the rural health delivery system is presently without
almost 50? of its total requirements of male health workers. It is clear that
the shortage of this basic level of paramedical staff is excessive. Vacant
positions for staff Obstetricians and Pediatricians is also high. Basic
training is imparted in institutions such as ANH Schools, LHV Schools and they
are of adequate strength to meet the pre-service requirements of trained
manpower development in the case of paramedical staff. Facilities have not
been sufficiently developed to promote in-service training for female health
worker (ANN), male health worker and various other categories of paramedical
specialists.
31.   Budget Allocations:  In the past four years, the Family Welfare
Program, which is 1002 Centrally-sponsored, received the following Plan
allocations X
(Rs. in Millions)
1989-90                    6,530
1990-91                    6,750
1991-92                    7,490
1992-93                   10,000
32.    Due to the over-all shortage of resources, the Family Welfare Program
had not received adequate Plan allocations. The annual allocation has not
increased in real terms.

Page 10
33.    The average maintenance cost of each sub-center is about Rs. 26,000 per
annum. Just to fund the existing sub-centers (130,219) at the present rates
of assistance, a sum of Rs. 250,062 million per year is required against
vhich. a sum of Rs. 10,000 million In 1991, Rs. 1,100 million in 1991-92, Rs.
1,850 million durinn 1992-93 were allocated and provided for in the budget of
the Family Welfare bepartment.  The funds provided were inadequate even to
meet the costs of operationalization of the existing sub-centers. Therefore,
no new sub-centers were sanctioned by GCI during 90-91, 91-92 and 92-93.
34.    Quality of Service:  The demographic and health profile of India is not
uniform. The qualitative aspects of primary health care relating to emergency
and obstetric care and the promotion of spacing methods have remained weak
particularly in'the States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan which constitute 402 of the country's population. In addition,
these four states account for 84 of the 90 poor performing districts in the
country. This, explains the low coverage measured by mortality-specific
interventions, and low effective couple protection rates reflected in higher
birth and infant mortality rates.
35.    A Health Facility Survey carried out in 21 districts of the country in
connection with the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM) Program was
completed in 1992, and has revealed the functional deficiencies faced by
Primary Health Centers and the Community Health Centers. The survey shows
that Community Health Centers still remain in structure, closer to the concept
of a Primary Health Center, having 6 to 10 beds only against the sanctioned
strength of 30 beds although they have an average of 3-5 Medical Officers.
Primary Health Centers which are to provide supportive supervision to 6 sub-
centers attached to CHCs should be made to serve as referral institutions to
facilitate institutional deliveries and in turn, bring down the current MMR
and IMR levels.
. Policy and Program ChaNges
36.    The long term demographic goals as laid down by the National Health
Policy (1983) is to achieve specific targets. The targets and current levels
of achievements against them are indicated below:
Targets to be           Current level of
achieved by 2000 A.D.  achievement
(a)  Population growth rate  1.22                     2.03Z (1989)
(b)  Crude birth rate         21/thousand             30.6/thousand (1989)
(c)  Crude death rate         9/thousand              10.3/thousand (1989)
(d)  Infant mortality         60/thousand             91/thousand (1989)
(e)  Couple protection rate  60 percent               44.1 percent
(April, 91)

ANNEX 6
Page 11
37.   It is recognized that given the current level of achievement, the goals
for 2000 cannot be schieved before 2006-2011. The Family Welfare Department
has in the recent months, taken a number of initiatives with a view to
imparting new dynamism to the Family Welfare Program. The broad framework of
the revised strategy is summarized below. The following steps would be takent
(a)    the thrust during the Eighth Five-Year Plan would be to
consolidate the existing infrastructure. Special attention would
be paid to the creation and strengthening of infrastructure in the
urban slums;
(b)    integrated training modules for the training and retraining of
medical and paramedical personnel engaged in the F.W. Program
would be developed;
(c)    supervision at all levels would be improved; and
(d)    special attention would be given to the construction of Primary
Health Centers and Sub-centers through externally-funded Area
Development Projects and under the Minimum Needs Program of the
States plans.
38.   Special Strategy for 90 Districts  The four States of Bihar, Madhya
Pradesh, Rajasthan and U.P. have I.M.R. and M.M.R. levels which are distinctly
higher than the national average. These are also the States where the female
age at marriage, female literacy and the share of women in non-agricultural
employment is much lower than the national average. Unless special efforts
are made to improve performance of these States in regard to health and family
welfare, it would be impossible to accelerate the achievement of demographic
and family welfare goals at the national level. Based on the analysis of
demographic indicators at the district level, 90 particularly backward
districts where the crude birth rate is above 39 per thousand have been
identified. An Action Plan has been drawn up and the following steps are to
be taken to improve program performance in these low performing 90 districts.
The main features are:
(a)    in the identified districts, micro-level planning would be
undertaken by the States to strengthen infrastructural facilities
with priority given to sub-centers and buildings for other
institutions under the Area Development Projects;
(b)    a disaggregated approach would be launched as a part of a new
operational strategy in the four States of Bihar, Hadhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The pace of implementation of
externally-funded on-going Area Development Projects primarily
designed to strengthen infrastructure and to improve the training
of staff would be speeded up with emphasis on improving the
quality and outreach of services;
(c)    all posts at the grassroot level of.family welfare workers and
supervisory officers would be filled up;



- 115 -
ANNEX 6
Page 12
(d)    intensive training of medical and para-medical personnel would be
organized;
(e)    special efforts would be taken by State governments to have a
proper organization for the maintenance of equipment, vehicles and
buildings to ensure the proper utilization of assets created under
the program;
(f)    since may of the low performance districts have large minority
populations, minority community leaders at local levels would be
involved in launching imaginative IEC programs designed to promote
adoption of the small family norm;
(g)    in order to improve interpersonal communication efforts at the
grassroot level, a scheme of link volunteers would be tried out on
a pilot basis in some of the districts. The Department of Women
and Child Development would be requested to cover all the 90
districts with the ICDS Program and suitable linkages developed at
the delivery level with ICDS functionaries to deliver health,
nutrition and family welfare services as a package;
(h)    District Collectors would be fully involved in
coordination/supervision of family welfare program related
activities in these districts;
(i)    an Innovative package of incentives/disincentives would be
formulated with emphasis on community-based incentives and social
security measures for adopting the small family norm;
j)    spacing methods would be emphasized for adoption by younger
couples with high fertility potential. For this purpose, schemes
for social marketing of contraceptives would be strengthened;
(k)    supply of dry condoms under the Free Distribution Scheme would be
gradually phased out and only lubricated condoms made available.
The production arrangements for oral pills and oral contraceptive
pills would be gradually improved. New contraceptives such as
Norplant-6 and injectibles would be introduced initially under
controlled conditions;
(1)    with a view to improve MCI care services to the populations living
in urban areas including slums, the Urban Revamping Scheme
covering towns with 200,000 population and above, with special
focus on slum areas would be developed;
(m)    IEC inputs would be revitalized to bring about attitudinal changes
to involve the comnunity in generating family welfare services;
(n)    to supplement the efforts of the Government, the involvement of
non-governmental organizations and voluntary sectors would be
increased significantly; and



- 116 -
ANNEX 6
Page 13
(o)    a suitable institutional mechanism would be evolved at the Central
level for achieving inter-sectoral coordination, particularly
between the Ministries of Health! and Family Welfare, Human
Resources Development, Finance, Information and Broadcasting,
Environmental, Forests, Labor, Women and Child Development and
Rural Development.
39.   A National Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Program has been launched.
The basic strategy of the Program would be to utilize the regular and frequent
contacts established with pregnant women and infants under the Universal
Immunization Program tUIP) to extend other effective interventions for the
reduction of morbidity and mortality in children. With the expansion of
program from 51 districts in 1992-93 to all districts by the end of Eighth
Five-Year Plan period, the services for prevention of deaths due to pneumonia
and dehydration caused by diarrhoea among children, control of anaemia in
pregnant women and young children and Vitamin A deficiency in young children,
would be universally available and made easily assessable.  One of the
priority areas for the Program would be to strengthen referral facilities,
especially in rural areas of the six States of Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh,
Orissa, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
C. Details of Action Plan to Imlement Policy and Program Chagtes:
40.   A Health Facility Survey carried out in 21 districts of the country in
connection with the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM) Program has
brought out the functional deficiencies of Primary Health Centers and the
Community Health Centers. The data for 6 of these 21 districts, which had a
birth rate of 39 or more in 1981 is presented in paragraphs 46-49. The main
thrust area for the 90 specially targeted districts would be to upgrade the
primary health care facilities, particularly at the PHC, in a selective and
phased manner. The objective of the upgradation would be to bring about both
qualitative and quantitative improvement in primary health and family welfare
services with particular emphasis on Increasing institutional deliveries,
improving emergency obstetric care for controlling maternal mortality and
family planning services.
41.   The following additionalities are, therefore, proposed to be provided to
about 30 PHCs in each of the 90 districts over a period of 5 years:
(a)   a properly equipped "Operation Theater' where an aseptic delivery
can be performed;
(b)   a labor room;
(c)   an observation ward with 6 beds;
(d)   two living quarters:  one for the LHV and one for the ANM;
(e)   a generator to ensure continuous availability of power during
deliveries;
(f)   provision of continuous water supply wherever needed;  and



- 117 -
ANNEX 6
Page 14
(g)   provision of an ambulance for each block.
42. The above interventions are estimated to cost about Rs. 1 million per
PHC. While the above additionalities would be common to most of the PHCs
which would be upgraded, district-specific problems would also be addressed.
For instance in States like Rajasthan where primary health care delivery
systems are not working satisfactorily because of a lack of logistical support
due to large distances between habitations, funds would be provided for
procurement of vehicles and increasing the POL allocations. Similarly, it may
be necessary to construct sub-centers in some other districts. The specific
additionalities would be based on the district specific micro-plans taking
into account other areas which need concerted and concentrated effort like IEC
and training.
43. While IEC and training would be undertaken in the entire district,
upgradation of PHCs and sub-centers would be taken up in a phased manner at
about 4 to 5 PHCs per district in the first two years and about 6 to 7 PHCs in
the next 3 years. The budgetary requirement for the 90 districts would be as
followss 1992-93 Rs. 450 million, 1993-94 Rs. 550 million, 1994-95 700
million, 1995-96 Rs. 750 million, 1996-97 Rs. 750 million. The above
requirement of Rs. 3200 million would be additional to the annual plan budget
allocation for the Family Welfare Program.
D. Implemtation of Refoms
44. The framework evolved as above is a result of consultations between the
poor performing States and the GOI. While GOI would provide funds for the
upgradation of infrastructure under the framework suggested, the States would
provide a lady Medical Officer at each of the PHCs selected for upgradation.
They would also undertake the responsibility of maintaining the assets
created.
45. The main objective of this exercise would be to improve primary health
care delivery systems which in turn are expected to bring about favorable
changes in the demographic indicators in these districts in the long run.
B.  Sumary fidinas from the Health Facility Survey of 6 Districts
46. First Referral Units: The 'model plan' adopted in 1978-79 envisaged
that there would be a Community Health Center for every 100,000 population by
the end of Seventh Five-Year Plan period. Every CHC is to have a minimmm of
30 beds and 4 specialists (either qualified or specially trained to work as
Surgeon, Obstetrician, physician and Pediatrician) so that it could provide
specialized medical care to the cases referred by the Primary Health Centers
under its jurisdiction. With reference to family planning, the CHC is
required to function as a Center of excellence providing sterilization
services and hands-on skill development training to the medical and para-
medical staff at the PHCs and sub-centers under its jurisdiction.
47. The data for the 6 districts (which is true of all the 16 districts of
Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh where this survey



- 118 -
AMNEX 6
Page 15
has been completed) reveals, however, that the Infrastructure is very weak.
The survey categorizes all institutions at block headquarters, and/or those
having specialist posts (sanctioned) as a potential referral institutions.
The main aspects of the findings are sumarized below:

48.   It would be seen that most of the block level institutions still remain,
in structure, closer to the concept of a Primary Health Center, with 6 to 10
beds, though having an average of 3-5 medical officers.
49.   The Primary _ealth Centers, according to the role envisaged for them
under the model plan are to provide supportive supervision to the 6 sub-
centers attached to them and to serve as a referral institution for these sub-
centers. It was, thus, expected that once these institutions become
functional, institutional deliveries would rise significantly. This has,
however, not taken place because the facilities available with them, in most
cases, still remain closer to a dispensary in character.

III. DISUSE CONTROL
Summary: Leprosy Control Action Plan
(As a Typical Example for Disease Control Programs)
A. Background and Current Status
50.   Current Status.  There are 2.2 million cases of leprosy in the country
with about 0.45 million additional new cases detected annually. There are
high rates of deformities in untreated patients and significant suffering due
to social stigma associated with the disease as well as the risk of loss of
employment and rejection.
51.   Issues.  Inadequacies in control services delivery coverage, disability
and ulcer care, detection of female patients, public awareness and stigma are
the major problems which affect the leprosy control program.
52.   Oblectives.  The elimination of leprosy as a public health problem in
IndAa by the year 2000 AD, means reducing the prevalence to less than 1 per
10,000 population.
D. Government Initiatives in Control Policies and Program Adiustments:
53.   Appropriate Technology, Procedures and Standards.  Utilization of 1-2
years multi-drug therapy which leads to high compliance, low drug resistance
and cure rather than life-long dapsone monotherapy which is associated with
low compliance and higher drug resistance. Focus on disability care and
prevention. Enhancing detection of female patients.
54.   Program Content.  Provision of multi-drug therapy in a vertical focused
manner through contractual services in highly endemic areas. Provision of
multi-drug therapy through the existing health infrastructure in moderate
prevalence areas. Promotion of public awareness and community and NGO
participation. Improving staff skills through training.
55. Targeting of Services and Phasing. The Action Plan targets 66 high
endemic districts and 77 intermediate endemic districts. Disability care and
relief targets 2.5Z of the most affected disability patients.
56.   Pattern of Expenditure.  Annual budget provisions for the Eighth Five-
Year Plan period to be increased from Rs. 240 million in 1991/92 to Rs. 350
million in 1992/93, Rs. 380 million in 1993/94, Rs. 380 million in 1994195,
Rs. 420 million in 1995/96, and Rs. 460 million in 1996/97.
57.   Sustainability.  At the end of the decade, leprosy would cease to be a
public health problem. The expected number of new cases would be only around
50,000 per year. Control efforts are being integrated with the existing
primary health care system. For the initial intensive period, the temporary
services of additional manpower would be engaged on a contractual basis where
needed in areas of high prevalence. The elimination of leprosy as a public
health problem would allow a gradual reduction of expenditures around the end
of the decade.

Positive externalities.
C. Role of the Center and state
59.   This Includes: operational framework and standards provided by the
Centerg establishment of District Leprosy Societies for planning and
strengthening local implementation capabilities; increased availability of
local training. Strengthening national monitoring In collaboration with the
World Health Organization.
IV.             CHILD D LOPARNT SEICES (ICDS)
A. Background and Current Status
60.  Launched in 1975, ICDS is the Government of Tndia's (GOI's) most
comprehensive, country-wide program for early childhood care and development.
Through ICDS, a package of six services are delivered to children below six
years of age and to pregnant and nursing mothers. These are: supplementary
nutrition, health check-up, imaunization, referral services, non-formal pre-
school education 3-6 year olds, and nutrition and health education of mothers.
The program thus aims at both pre-natal and post-natal child development.
61.   ICDS is a centrally-sponsored scheme but administered by  State
governments. The financing responsibility is shared between the two
governments. The GOI supports the salaries of all ICDS staff, including
training costs, basic equipment costs at the Anganwadi centers including
petrol and oil expenses, Angaswadi rent and medicine and medicine kits. State
governments meet the costs of supplementary nutrition. Donors such as CARE
provide free supplementary food. The total (Center and States) spending is
estimated to be Rs. 3618 million (US $ 129 million) during 1992193.
62. ICDS is aimed at children and women among whom malnutrition is greatest.
The program currently serves an estimated 139 million beneficiaries and is
located in areas of acute malnutrition such as tribal areas and urban slums.
Of the 2694 blocks currently covered, 65.l are In rural areas, 26.42 in
tribal areas and 8.SZ are in urban slums.
63.   A recent evaluation of ICDS by the National Institute of Public
Cooperation and Child Development (NIPCCD), India's premier research
institution on child welfare, has shown that compared to the situation in
1976, the gains from ICDS are substantial. Also, the proportion of
malnourished chlldren and women in the ICDS blocks was less than In the
control blocks. The proportion of low birthweight babies was twice as high in
the non-ICDS tribal blocks as in the ICDS tribal blocks. Nonetheless, NIPCCD
evaluation pointed out significant shortcomings in the implementation of the
program especially in four areas: shortfalls in the feeding norm of 300 days
was a problem in some blocks; training and supervision of ICDS functionaries
was inadequate; the convergence of health, nutrition and pre-school services
at the Anganwadi level was weak, and commnity Involvement was poor.

ANNEX 6
Page 18
3B Policy and Program Changes
64.   Since February 1991, significant policy changes have been incorporated
to improve the quality of the program. The most important of them is the
strategy to ensure the synchronized supply of services including health,
nutrition supplementation and pre-school education, at the Anganwadi level.
As a result, significant progress in the convergence of health services is
visible. The consequential programw changes include measures to fix the timing
and day of the visits of health functionaries, coordinate visits with trained
birth attendants and provision of delivery kits to momen, liaison with the
rural development department and the use of the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY)
for constructing Anganwadi centers, liaison with the Early Childhood Education
Wing of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to
better coordinate pre-school education at the Anganwadis including flexible
hours to facilitate young girls with siblings to attend primary schools in the
villages, and coordinate with the Food Department to monitor nutrition in the
ICDS blocks.
65.   The quality of supervision varies across the States.  Steps are being
taken to ensure that no more than 20 Anganwadi workers are under the
supervision one supervisor. An interesting initiative is to improve the
mobility of the supervisor by advancing loans at commercial terms to the
supervisors for the purchase of a small motor-cycle (moped) under the *Own
Your Own Moped* scheme.
66.   To overcome the problem of feeding shortfalls, a recent policy
initiative has been for the GOI to instruct the States to constitute
Committees of Experts including the representatives from the states and the
ICDS Cells, the Department of Food and Civil Supplies, and consultants as
needed, to identify the precise the reasons for the shortfalls in feeding days
across the States. These Committees are to provide their findings to GOI
within a specified period of time. Since the reasons may vary across States,
the findings of these Expert Committees will be helpful in designing remedial
actions in different States.
67.   An important policy initiative is the institution of a new Management
Information System to effectively monitor the program. A proforma was evolved
that enables measurement of the qualitative outcomes of the program, and
appropriate software and hardware has been provided to the States. Detailed
training of functionaries has also taken place. Reports are now being
received in the new format in the Department of Women and Child Development
computerized MIS for the past six months. National Informatics Center (NIC)
is assisting the Ministry in the computerization of the information system by
providing the necessary software and hardware. This computerized monitoring
is already helping the Department of Women and Child Development to identify
location-specific weaknesses of the program. For example, the most recent
(June 1992) monitoring report showed that the proportion of anganwadis
maintaining normal feeding days varied from 742 in Andhra Pradesh to 272 in
Bihar, clearing demonstrating a problem in the latter State. Information
thrown up by the MIS covers numerous qualitative aspects and, therefore, is
invaluable to the Department in effectively monitoring the program.



- 122 -                       ANNEX 6
Page 19
68.   Another policy initiative is the decision of the GOI to establish  a
Task Force on Nutrition Surveillance during 1993/94. This Task Force will
help in the administering of a country-wide sample survey on the nutritional
status of India's population.
69.   Finally, the GOI will expand ICDS to 200 blocks each in 1992/93 and
1993/94, selecting the blocks on the basis of strict geographical targeting.
The GOI has identified 180 focal districts for expansion based on objective
criteria including the poverty ratio, proportion of scheduled castes and
tribes, crude birth rate, etc. Blocks/districts of extreme vulnerability are
selected first.
C. Action Plans to Implement Policy Chanaes
70.   The GOI already taken action covering five areass feeding shortfalls
(instructions issued to establish Expert Committees to find out principal
causes across the States and recommend solutions); training and supervision
(stern action proposed against the defaulting States); synchronization of
services (specific instructions have been issued to ensure convergence);
monitoring (a computerized data processing system is now in place that enables
monitoring quantitative and qualitative aspects of the program); and expansion
of the program to blocks of extreme vulnerability.
71.   The above Action Plans, especially the one relating to enhancement and
expansion, have tieen backed by appropriate funding. The GOI plans to spend
Rs.1300 million for the expansion of the ICDS to the targeted blocks and about
Rs. 101 million for strengthening and enhancing of the program with focal
districts. Additional provisions have also been made in the following years
till 1996-97 totalling Rs.1,929 million for expansion and enhancements of
ICDS. In an effort to reach areas inhabited by particularly vulnerable groups
not covered by existing Anganwadi centers, it is proposed to provide an
average of additional 5 percent anganwadi centers in the existing areas where
the program is established. Additional financial provision of Rs.96 million
(recurring and non-recurring) was made for this linfilling' during 1992-93.
These actions ensure targeting and sustainability of the program through the
Eighth Five-Year Plan period.
D. Implementation of Reforms and Expansion, Role of Center and the States
72.  While the Center has initiated actions as noted above, the States have
to administer them. An important aspect is the ability of the States to fund
their share of the cost of the expanded and improved ICDS. Of the total
(estimated) spending of Rs. 3,618 million during 1992-93, the States' share is
expected to be Rs.1,411 million or about 40 per.cent. Since there is already
a heavy demand from the States for expansion of ICDS to the remaining blocks,
the Center does not foresee any unwillingness (or inability) on the part of
the States to incur their share of the expenses. However, given the
experience relating to feeding shortfalls noted by the NIPCCD evaluation, and
given that nutrition supplementation is the States' financial responsibility,
the Center will take a more active role to ensure that the states do not
falter on this account.

73. Local-level participation by the beneficiaries is critical for the
success of this program and the Government recognizes this problem. A number
of workshops were held recently, will voluntary organizations working in the
field of child welfare. They were given the opportunity to express their
vimew and ideas to promote comuunity Involvement. More of these workshops are
planned to strengthen this aspect of the ICDS program.

SOCIQL SAFETY NET SECTOR ADJUST2ENT PROGRAM
NATIONAL CREDIT FMUD FOR OMEN
A. Broad Features of the Credit Fund
1.        Introduction.  The Department of Women & Child Development proposes
to establish a National Credit Fund for Women to be called the 'Rashtriya
Mahila Kosh' (RMK). The basic model of operation is to extend credit to poor
women in groups or as individuals through intermediary agencies such as NGOs
and Voluntary Association. A suitable interest spread will be provided to
such intermediary agencies to ensure viability at their level. Interest rates
for the client beneficiaries will not be subsidised. Credit will have
linkages with thrift and savings. The Kosh will not be a Bank but will be a
credit disbursing institution and will be financially self-sustaining in its
operations.
2.        Proposed Organisational set-up.  The GOI feels that:
(a)  A Registered Society may be the best option for the incorporation
of the Kosh, which could if necessary, also be registered as a
Trust. Exemption for Income Tax will be obtained for its income.
(b)  The Kosh will be an autonomous body and will have a Governing Board
of 15 members where four representatives of the Government of India
from Banking, Planning, Rural Development and Women & Child
Development Department, and the remaining 11 would be leading non-
officials in the field of micro-credit and micro-entrepreneurship
of women. All operational decisions will be taken by the Governing
Board. In all operational matters, the role of the Government will
be minimal and will be confined to major policy issues as the Kosh
is to function as a non-bureaucratic organisation with a
transparent style of working.
(c)  The first Board of Governors will be nominated by the Government,
but in subsequent years a mechanism will be developed to have some
of the non-Governmental Board Members elected by the General Body.
The designated representatives from Government of India will be ex-
officio Directors. An annual report of the fund will be given to
Government of India in the nodal Ministry, i.e. Department of Women
& Child Development. The Government of India will have the right
to carry out performance evaluation and give suggestions/directions
on broad policy issues.
(d)  The Kosh will be administered by a Chief Executive Officer, who
should have administrative/managerial/banking qualifications and
experience. le/she would be initially assisted by necessary
Accounts, technical & clerical staff. As the size/volume of
operations of the Kosh expand in the future, appropriate additions
to the staff strength of the Kosh will be made, with the consent of
the Board of Gorernors.

B. Resources
3.        Resources will be constituted mainly of the corpus funds,
borrowings, grants and donations. Grants and donations will be negotiated
from donors for undertaking various promotion and development activities of
which suitable projects will be posed to them. Funds for lending operations
will come either from the corpus, from recycled funds or from borrowings. It
is expected that the level of net resources for lending purposes, would reach
approximately Rs. 500 million by the end of the Sixth year (1997-98).
4.        Efforts will be made to secure resources for the Kosh at the lowest
possible cost. Corpus funds of about Rs. 100 million (free of cost) is
available from the Goverament of India, and will help the Kosh to develop and
stabilise this innovative approach of credit delivery to poor women and meet
the expenses on start-up operatfons, establishment, monitoring, training etc.
5.        Market borrowings will be resorted to as and when necessary either
by way of term loans, or cash credit or temporary overdrafts depending upon
the requirements of the Rosh. If necessary, the Kosh may also go in for tax-
free interest bearing bonds, or other Bonds or Bonds at market rates of
interest, with the prior approval of the Government of India.
6.        External Funds can also be tapped as loans, grants and donations
from multilateral and bilateral borrowers.
7.        Accounting and Audit.  The gosh will maintain necessary accounts,
as per the usual procedures of a registered society, of all its receipts and
payments, lending and recovery etc. and there will be a system of internal
audit and statutory audit by a Chartered Accountant once every year. A copy
of the annual accounts and audit report will be submitted to the Department of
Wmen & Child Development.
C. perational tiddelimes
8.        The institutions eligible to borrow from the Kosh will be NGOs,
VDCs, Women Co-operatives and organisations which will have to satisfy special
conditions of eligibility. Such conditions for eligibility would be:
(a) the organisation will have to have a good standing;
(b) 2-3 years experience In credit management;
(c) infrastructure for lending, recovery etc; and
(d) a proper system of accounts maintenance.
9.        A Screening Comittee will be constituted by the Governing Board
for deciding the eligibility of the organisations for borrowing from the Kosh.
10.       The disbursement of loans will be spread over a number of
organisations vith a lmit on the borrowings by the organisations. The Rosh
will provide loans by way of refinance, fresh finance or of revolving fund
etc. Consumption loans will be supported to a very limited extent. Loans



- 126 -
ANNEX 7
Page 3
could be allowed to individual beneficiaries but emphasis will be on thrift
and credit groups having a system of joint and several liability. In the case
of thrift groups, the amount of loan will be suitably linked with the thrift
of the beneficiariei.
11.       Loans will be extended through eligible intermediary agencies, to
poor women in the informal sector in groups and, if necessary, to individuals
also. Such women are usually running micro-enterprises, either producing some
goods or trading or providing services. Their credit requirements are usually
small.
12.       Loans will be both for short-term and medium-term purposes as also
composite loans. Provisions for providing small loans to women beneficiaries
repeatedly will also be made and suitable eligibility criteria/safeguards laid
down.
13.       The repayment schedules of intermediary agencies will be prescribed
In a manner which will be linked with the repayment schedules at the grass-
root level taking into account the gestation period etc. Asset/purpose
specific schedules will be laid down. Provisions will also be made for
rescheduling/extensions under certain circumstances to be decided by the
Governing Board. While full flexibility will be allowed to the intermediary
agencies in conducting their lending activities, broad guidelines will be
provided by the Kosh.
14.       Security at the grass-root level will be left to be decided by the
intermediary agencies who will be responsible for the recovery of loans and
repayments to the Kosh. So far as these agencies are concerned, legal
agreements will be executed with them, specifying the terms and conditions of
borrowings from the Kosh. Such agreements will have a provision to create a
charge, in favour of the Kosh, on the assets of the NGOs or on the assets
created out of Kosh loans by way of a reassignment of some other procedure,
the details of which will be worked out in consultation with the Law Ministry.
15.       There will be risk funds created both at the intermediary agency
level as also at the Kosh level which will be used for meeting
contingencies/defaults if there are any. As a matter of fact, no defaults are
expected in the system since it is based on mutual trust and confidence And
will have very close monitoring. There is also a proposal to have social
insurance for the beneficiaries, as in other poverty alleviation programmes,
so that in the event of death or some other unforeseen circumstances or
natural calamities, the proceeds of the insurance could be adjusted against
the Kosh loans.
16.       It is expected that the average cost of funds to the Kosh will be
around 10X, taking into account the cost free corpus funds and funds which
might be arranged for its credit operations or from borrowings from the money
market. At an average cost of resources to the Kosh at 10?, per annum,
lendings will be made to the intermediary agencies etc. at 12X. It will be
possible for these agencies to lend to the ultimate beneficiaries at rates
ranging between 15-182 which will compare well with the present rates charged
by Informal credit sources. A model worked out in this regard is given in
Attachment I and gives a broad picture of the sustainability of the Kosh. Of



- 127 -
ANNEX 7
Page 4
the 22 margin, available to the Kosh will be earmarked for the risk fund and
another 1? will be spent on education and monitoring which will be an integral
part of the operations of the Kosh. Administration and management expenses
will be kept to the minimum.
17.       Of the total interest margin available to the intermediary agencies
at 4 1/22 - 5X, one per cent will be compulsorily used for creating a risk
fund and half per cent towards education and upgradation of skills of the
beneficiaries for which the Mahila Kosh may also make a suitable contribution.
The remaining three to three and half percent should be adequate to meet the
operational costs of the agencies. The transaction costs to the lender will
be kept low. Attachment II details two alternatives to demonstrate the
viability of the interest spread allowed to intermediary agencies.
18.       Monitoring will be closely done by the gosh and also by outside
agencies located in the operation areas. Performance reviews will be
undertaken by the Government regularly and evaluation studies will also be
conducted to assess the impact of the scheme on the quality of life of the
target beneficiaries.
19.       Investments.  Surplus funds will be invested mainly in deposits
with Nationalised/Scheduled Commercial Banks, Government/Trustee Securities.
D. Promotion and Develounmet Activitles
20.       The promotional and developmental activities will be one of the
important areas for the functioning of the Mahila Kosh. The magnitude of
these activities will be decided on the basis of availability of the funds
either from the surpluses of lending operations or from external assistance by
way of donations, grants, etc. The main activities to be undertaken in this
regard will be building up capacities of intermediary agencies in credit
management, upgradation of the skills of the beneficiaries, formation and
Atablisation of thrift and credit groups and close coordination with the
formal banking system. The Kosh will be a nodal organisation in the sector of
credit for women and will have representation in various National Fora/apex
institutions, dealing with credit.
S. Anticivated Achievements nd Benefits
21.       The setting, p of the Kosh will not only provide credit facilities
to poor women but would also expose them to credit and thrift management so as
to enable them to get into the mainstream of the formal banking system at a
later stage. It will benefit poor women by raising their financial status and
thereby mainstreaming them in national development. The development of this
improved credit delivery system would result in the institutionalisation of
the positive features of the informal credit sector. It will result in better
capacity being built up in the beneficiaries to take effective charge of their
lives and develop to their full potential through effective mobilisations.

TUE NATONAL RM FMN
A. BACKGROMiD
1.    Industrial PolLcy   Despite a decade of incremental reforms, at the end
of the late 1980s India had one of the most tightly regulated manufacturing
sectors in the world. The key underlying problems that needed to be addressed
through comprehensive industrial policy reform included: (a) a lack of
international competitiveness and export orientation; (b) a pervasive high-
cost structure due to high tariffs and inefficiency in Public Sector
Enterprises (PSEs); (c) restrictions on imports of new technology; (d) slow
employment growth in the organized sector; and (e) a widespread incidence of
enterprise failure or *sickness* due to the lack of an effective exit policy.
2.    Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) currently account for about 20? of the
total output of India. Their involvement in most economic sectors has formed
a central element of India's development strategy. The Central and the State
governments have established over 1,000 PSEs of which 245 are at the Central
level, holding monopoly positions in critical basic industries such as railway
transport and telecommunications. Over the years, the public sector has
spread into diverse activities such as hotels and construction which is far
removed from the "commanding heights" which had been the original rationale
for government intervention. In 1989, PSEs accounted for the bulk of
organized-sector employment in the Indian economy; 95 percent in electricity
and other utilities, 98 percent in transport and communications, 95 percent in
mining, and 30 percent in manufacturing.
3.    Of the 245 central PSEs, ninety-eight were loss-making in 1989/90, with
aggregate losses of about Rs. 19.6 billion (US$653 million). In addition to
this poor financial performance, the other reasons for the reform of PSEs in
India are their extremely low financial returns, excess staffing, heavy
reWiance on government budgetary resources, and the high-cost structure that
their inefficiency imposes on the rest of the manufacturing sector with
consequent implications for international competitiveness.
4.    Industrial Restructur na    In July 1991, GOI announced a new industrial
policy as an integral part of its overall stabilization and reform efforts.
The policy reduced the number of sectors reserved for public investment,
abolished industrial licensing in several sectors, amended anti-trust
legislation, and opened key sectors including oil and gas to private domestic
and foreign investors.
5.    Concurrent with the implementation of this policy, the GOI has taken
several actions to facilitate adjustment by private and public sector
Industrial firms. These actions include:

Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and to bring sick
PSEs within its purview;
(b) formulation of restructuring plans for ailing PSEs in key sub-
sectors such as textiles and engineering;
(c)   completion of an inter-ministerial Working Group's report on
industrial restructuring developing specific proposals for
eliminating legislative and regulatory obstacles to industrial
restructuring;
(d)   phased reduction in Government budgetary transfers and loans to
sick central PSEs;
(e)   disinvestment of government ownership in PSEs.  In FY 92 over Rs.
30 billion (US$1,000 million) was realized from sale of equity
(about 8Z of GOI's holdings) in 30 selected PSEs; in FY93 Rs.
6,820 million (US$227 million) has been raised from sale of equity
in 8 PSEs as of October 18, 1992; and
(f)   approval of disinvestment in selected PSEs of up to 49Z of their
equity, to be implemented over a three year period.
6.      Plftoyment Polle   form   The GOI recognizes the need for employment
policy reform as a companion to its efforts of trade policy liberalization,
industrial policy liberalization, public sector reform, and industrial
restructuring. This is demonstrated by the report of the Inter Ministerial
Working Group on Industrial Restructuring (the Bajaj Commission) recommending
significant changes in the Companies Act, the Sick Industries Act, and the
Industrial Disputes Act.
7.    The Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 (amended in 1953, 1957, 1976, and
1982) is the key law dealing with employment policy and the process of
industrial restructuring. It defines changes in manning patterns, layoffs,
retrenchments and unit closures and specifies regulations governing each of
these cases. in brief, the law stipulates advanced notification in all cases,
and worker compensation and prior governmental approval in all cases but
changes in manning patterns.
8.    The Bajaj Commission recommendations seek to increase flexibility in
restructuring while guaranteeing trade union rights and protecting those
individuals who are directly affected. The Commission recommended:
(a)   reductions in advanced notification requirements in the case of
changes in manning patterns;
(b)   removal of requirements of prior government approval in cases of
layoffs, retrenchments, and closures so as to: (i) discourage
employers from overuse of lockout procedures (these being immune



- 133 -
ANNEX 8
Page 3
to prior permission rules), rather than layoffs or retrenchments;
and (ii) facilitate restructuring by promoting procedures which
compensate affected vorkers and speed the alternative utilization
of assets;
(c) establishment of independent authorities, who are not subject to
government review, to speed the rationalization of workers
affected by unit closure;
(d) the reduction of government intervention in labor-management
matters but for exceptional cases;
(e) the endorsement of union autonomy and democracy;
(f) significant increases in the amount of monetary compensation given
to workers in cases of layoffs, retrenchments, and closures; and
(g)   formation of a special tripartite comission at the national level
to promote effective consultation between the parties.
9.    Several of the recommendations in the Bajaj Commission report have been
incorporated into a proposed Industrial Relations bill now under discussion to
replace the Industrial Relations Act. Current indications are that proposed
changes in labor-management relations such as union recognition, negotiating
councils and the like, are receiving stronger endorsemeft than are proposed
changes in rules regarding government approval in cases of retrenchment and
closures. While the parties are clearly not in agreement with all aspects of
the proposed bill, the issues have reached the political agenda and are being
debated openly. The GOI has set up tripartite conuittees in industries which
are likely to be affected, through which consultations have been conducted
with interested groups including trade unions and employer associations.
Through these consultations a general awareness has emerged that industrial
restructuring is needed and that it will likely require worker displacement.
B. THE NATIONAL MENWAL FUND (F)
10.   The National Renewal Fund (NRF) is a recent addition to India's social
safety net, having received considerable attention in the context of the
debate over employment policy reform. In creating the NRP, the GOI Finance
Minister declared: *Government will fully protect the interests of labor,
enhance their welfare and equip them in all aspects to deal with the
inevitability of technological change... Intensive training, skill development
and up-gradation programs will be launched". The NRP therefore seeks to
address the human resource dimensions of industrial restructuring. It will
respond to human needs associated with the large numbers of enterprises which
have shut down operations during the past decade and facilitate the labor
rationalization inevitably associated with current governmental efforts to
liberalize the economy and increase its competitiveness.
11.   Officially established in February 1992 per Resolution No. 7 (2)192
(Cus.), the NRP currently functions as a government budgetary account

administered by the Department of Industrial Development of the Ministry of
Industry. The NRF will be administered by an Empowered Authority and a
Secretariat for Industrial Renewal within the MOI, consisting of an Executive
Director of the rank of Additional Secretary and a normal complement of staff.
The NIR operates under a set of guidelines to be approved by the Cabinet,
vhich stipulates the objectives, governing authority, uses of funds, staffing
and other aspects.
12.   Empowered Authority shall consist of the followings
Secretary (Industrial Development)              Chairman
Secretary (Expenditure)                         Member
Secretary (Public Enterprises)                  Member
Secretary (Company Affairs)                     Member
Secretary (Labour)                              Member
Secretary (Education)                           Member
Economic Adviser, Ministry of Industry          Member
Labour Representative to be nominated           Member
by the Ministry of Labour
Employers' Representative to be nominated       Member
by the Department of Industrial Development
Two eminent persons from outside Government,    Member
with professional experience or expertise
in the fields of management, industrial
or labour relations
Additional Secretary, Department of I.D.         Executive
Director
13.   The Empowered Authority would be responsible to the Minister of Industry
for its overall functioning.  It would itself approve proposals for
disbursement of funds upto a limit of Rs. 1 billion.  Other proposals would
require approval of the Minister for Industry. The Empowered Authority will
devise its own rules of procedures.
14. The Empowered Authority of the ER? will be free to make funds available
in different forms. The disbursement will be made for the benefit of labour
in schemes approved by the Empowered Authority in respect of the central
public sector, and to the State Governments for schemes sponsored by them. In
order to ensure a proper scrutiny the Authority will consider only schemes
prepared or underwritten by an accountable agency, Board for Industrial and
Financial Reconstruction (BIRn), State Goverrment or the administrative
Ministry concerned.

ANNEX 8
Page 5
15.   Two specific human resource objectives are directly addressed through
the NRF account. First, NRF funds are used, where necessary, to compensate
workers dislocated in the process of adjusting organizational staffing
patterns or in closing non-viable units in both public and private sectors.
Second, NRF funds will be used to facilitate the redeployment and retraining
of affected workers and to fund specific initiatives of employment generation
in areas affected by industrial restructuring and technology upgrading. In
all cases, funds from the NRF account will be disbursed only after the
Empowered Authority has considered and approved the restructuring schemes
submitted to NRF for funding. The NRF will channel its funds through two
windows: the National Renewal Grant Fund (NRGF) and the Employment Generation
Fund (EGF).
16.   The Natioaal Renewal Grant Fund (310?). The objective of the NRGF is to
respond to the hardship imposed on workers employed in enterprises which have
shut down operations in some units during the legal processing of formal
closure requests. Workers are severely hurt in such cases because management
is not bound to pay compensation until a unit is formally closed. Worker
hardship is even more severe in cases where closure applications are not
formally approved by Center or State Government, but management persists in
shutting down operations in units which they deem non-viable.
17.   The worker compensations schemes eligible for NRGF financing fall into
the following categories:
(a) payments under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) for the PSEs;
(b) payments of compensation to workers of both public and private
sector units which lose their jobs as a result of unit closure
orders or rehabilitation schemes recommended by the Board of
Industrial and Financial Restructuring (BIfR);
(c) payments of compensation to workers of both public and private
sector units which are affected by restructuring schemes proposed
by the enterprises directly; and
td) payments of compensation to workers of private sector units which
are already under liquidation under the various schemes
recommended by the State Governments.
18.   Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)   The Voluntary Retirement Scheme
(VRS) was established in 1988. It represents the only form of social safety
net for industrial workers in India and applies only to workers in PSEs.
Under this program, workers in PSEs may submit requests for voluntary
retirement which can be either accepted or rejected by the management.
Payments of VRS are made out of the budget allocated to the individual
Ministry by the Central Government. A more detailed discussion of VRS is
given in Attachment A. Over the period the Scheme has been under
implementation, about 4,000 workers availed of the facility in FY1988, 5,700
in FY1989, 6,900 in FY1990 and 8,003 in FY1991/92.

ANNEX 8

19. Compensation for Employment Termination in Cases of Unit Closure as
Recommended by the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR)
BIFR is a quasi-judicial body established in 1985 to review industrial
enterprises, both public and private, which have incurred substantial
accumulated financial losses, and/or are considered as sick' as per the
definition in the Sick Industrial Companies Act (SICA). After detailed
review, BIPB makes recommendations for either rehabilitation or closure. If
BIFR recommends closure, the case goes to the Bigh Court for a final decision.
If the High Court endorses the recommendation of closure, the sick unit is
formally closed and the assets of the company sold. While vaiting for the
final decision from the High Court, the units are eligible to apply for funds
from the NRD to cover both legal dues and compensation for employment
termination to which the affected workers are entitled according to the BIFR
recommendations. A more detailed discussion of BIFR is given in Attachment 2.
20.   Compensation for Employment Termination Approved by the Cabinet   Sick
PSEs can, in consultation with labor, propose their own restructuring
programs including a schedule of worker retrenchment and package of
compensation for employment termkiation. After endorsement by the Ministries
to which these PSEs belong, thest proposals are then submitted to the Cabinet
for final approval. When the C ,iiet gives its approval, the NRGF window of
the NRP account will channel fu~Lds to these units through related government
Ministries.  The restructuring plans of two companies are given in Attachment
3.
21. Compensation for Employment Termination Approved by the State
Governments   Sick public and private industrial units can also formulate
their own restructuring proposals and submit them to State Governments for
approval. Once the proposal obtains approval from the State Government, funds
from the NHP account will be channelled to the individual States which in turn
disburse these funds to the affected units according to the approved
restructuring program. Attachment 4 gives an example.
22. Contrasting the four mechanisms, all but the BIR process require
enterprise-labor accord or the voluntary action of individual workers before
compensatory action is possible. In terms of the speed at which compensation
is provided to affected workers, VRS is clearly the quickest. Direct proposals
from an enterprise and its associated labor is the next least complicated in
terms of the number of parties involved followed by proposals that emerge
through the auspices of the State Government. The BIFR process is the most
protracted of the four though the BIlP has recently committed to streamlining
its procedures and shortening the period of time taken to remove cases which
have been referred.
23. The MRloLnent Generation Fund. Funds under this window of the NRF
account will be used to finance the establishment and delivery of services of
labor counselling, retraining and redeployment to the workers who lose their
jobs as a result of restructuring or modernization, as well as schemes of
employment regeneration in areas affected by the restructuring. The EGF funds
will be used, to the extent possible, to augment existing programs addressing
worker retraining/redeployment needs. Where capable institutional structures
are not In place, new frameworks will be constructed.



- 137 -
ANNEX 8
Page 7
24.   The delivery of services of labor counselling, retraining and
redeployment to the affected workers, and the implementation of
employment/economic regeneration in the affected areas will be carried out
through three types of organizations: the Employee Resource Center; the Area
Regeneration Council; and the State-Level Steering Committee.
25.   The Employee Resource Center  At the level of the industrial unit
undergoing restructuring, an Employee Resource Center (ERC) will be
established. The ERC will be staffed by representatives of the industrial
unit's Personnel Office, supplemented by additional job counselors drawn from
community agencies where needed. The ERC will have full access to information
in individual workers' employment record. For each worker, the job counselor
will have information on work history (occupation job titles, performance
assessments), on skill inventory (educational and technical qualifications),
and on compensation (salary and total compensation payable upon dislocation).
This information will be supplemented by information on other individual and
family resources (land holdings, other commercial activities, etc.) during
initial meetings with the worker. In locations of large scale dislocations,
this information may be computerized to facilitate access. It is anticipated
that in the future these informational data bases will be compiled in advance
of actual dislocation so that workers can move from full-time employment to
full-time job search/training without downtime.
26. Job counselors in the ERC will be trained in financial and employment
counseling and will have a working knowledge of the related resources
available in the community such as private and government training facilities,
family counseling facilities, and the like. The primary responsibilities of
job counselors will be data collection, communication of available options,
referral to servicr providers, and management of caseloads. Communications
with affected workers will take place at two levelst large group presentations
on principles and possibilities, principles of financial planning, investment
options and rates of return, types of training available; and one-on-one
counseling sessions.
27. The Area Regeneration Council The efforts of the ERCs will be overseen
by a city-level body, the Area Regeneration Council (ARC). This council will
have broad-based representation from the community including key government
officials, representation from employer associations, affected trade unions,
training service providers, urban planners, and others who are thought to be
useful at the local level. It will be responsible for making sure that the
ERC8 have complete information on the range of services available in the
community and that worker access to these services is guaranteed. ARCs will
take a conmunity view and generate ideas and plans for area economic
regeneration including schemes to launch small business incubators, to attract
new industry, and to nurse existing local industry.
28. The State-Level Steering Committee Proposals for economic regeneration
and for the provision of dislocated worker services (ERC formation) will be
formulated by ARCs and sent to the State-Level Steering Ccomittee (SLSC). This
Comdttee will coordinate restructuring activities across the State. It will
review restructuring proposals complete with retraining and redeployment
components, suggest alternatives and refinements, forward accepted proposals



- 138 -
ANNEX 8
Page 8
to the Central government for funding approval, and oversee the operation of
funded proposals. The Committee will consist of representatives of the
Departments of Finance, Planning, Industry, Labor, and Technical Education.
29.   Service Delivery  Under EGF, affected workers will have access to a
variety of counseling, retraining, and redeployment options. It is anticipated
that workers of different age groups will generally require different packages
of services. For planning purposes, three different age groupings are being
used.
(a)   Workers over 50 years of age. It is anticipated that redeployment
within downsized enterprises is unlikely for most of these
individuals because the length of their remaining working life
will not typically justify enterprise investment in retraining and
redeployment. Further, in as much as there is a high incidence of
multi-generation employment in many units, there is a tendency for
older generation family members to give way to younger family
workers in times of constrained employment opportunities. Given
these factors and the size of the expected compensation payments,
it is expected that most workers in this age group will opt out of
the active work force and express interest in investment options
permitting them to live off the interest generated by their
severance payment. Services to this group will concentrate on
group presentations of alternative investment instruments and
individual specific financial planning.
(b)   Workers 25 to 49 years of age. Redeployment within the
restructured unit or within the same industry is the preferred
option, involving the least individual adjustment. Where the unit
operator is changing operations, specific workers may be
identified by the operator for retraining and redeployment in the
new operation. In such cases, the ARC will expect submission of
specific retraining requests as part of the restructuring proposal
with training delivered through existing private and public
training institutions sanctioned by the ARCs. It is anticipated
that a percentage of these workers will be interested in self
employmentlmicro-enterprise. For example, in the textile industry
it is anticipated that some skilled weavers will wish to acquire
power looms and operate independently (Attachment 4). Introduction
to micro-enterprise development will be part of ERC presentations,
with actual assistance provided to individuals through centers
established in affected areas by the Small Industries Service
Institute and the National Small Industries Corporation.
(c)   Other workers.    Other workers will generally be the least
skilled of the affected workers and will receive the lowest
average termination compensation. Many of these workers may in
fact receive no compensation at all because they are not formal
employees of restructuring organizations. They will typically have
insufficient skills or financial resources to launch their own
businesses, and may also lack the basic education needed to access
offered retraining programs. In these cases, the extent of EGF



- 139 -
ANN   8
Page 9
programatic intervention will be limited. Facilitating access to JRY
and NRY, the existing employment schemes for the unemployed rural and
urban area poor respectively may be the most that can be offered in such
cases.
30.   AccountinA and Auditing Since NRF currently takes the fonm of a government
budgetary account, its accounting and auditing will be conducted in accordance with
the normal accounting and auditing procedure for government budgets. The only
difference between NRF and other ordinary government budgetary accounts is that NRF
is a public acc6unt, meaning that the balance in the NRP account is automatically
carried over to the next fiscal year, whereas an ordinary government budgetary
account closes at the end of each fiscal year. A more detailed discussion of these
processes is given in Attachment 5.

Sources of Funds
32.   The GOI initially allocated Rs.2,000 million (US$67 million) to the NRF
account for FY92/93 and FY1993-94, but is now engaged in enlarging the balance
to enable its handling of the demand on resources anticipated by the ongoing
PSE restructuring activity. GOI has pledged that significant proceeds from PSE
disinvestment will be directed to NRF. While current proceeds from PSE
disinvestment are lagging somewhat behind expectations, the government is firm
in its commitment of Rs.10,000 million (US$333.3 million) in 1992-93 to the
NRF and estimates a contribution of Rs.12,500 million (US$416.7 million) from
disinvestment in 1993-94. In addition, GOI will use a portion of the
counterpart funds generated by the proposed IDA Credit and bilateral donor
support to provide further liquidity to the NRF.
Uses of Funds
33.   National Renewal Grant Fund (NRGF).  See para.14-20 for the information
on the uses of the NRGF funds.
34. Employment Generation Fund (EGF). See para. 21-27 for the information
on the uses of the EGF. EG? monies will also be used to help support services
delivered to the rural poor under the Jawahar Rozgar Yozana (JRY) program,
enhance services through the Nehru Rozgar Yozana (NRY) program to urban
populations affected by restructuring, support the counseling, redeployment
and retraining of workers directly impacted by restructuring, and encourage
the exploration of locality- specific employment regeneration schemes.
35.   Jawahar Rozgar Yozana (JRY).  The Prime Minister has publicly expressed
his concern about the impact of.-stabilization and macro-economic reform on the
rural poor. He decided to increase funding of the JRY through the NRF in the
amount of R9.5,000 million (US$166.7 million) for 1992-93. For planning
purposes, the Ministry of Industry projects a similar commitment in 1993-94.
36.   Nehru Rozgar Yozana (NRY).  In recognizing that the one group which will
be affected by industrial restructuring will be individuals working in the
informal sector and tied to servicing the formal sector industrial and service
units undergoing adjustment, NRF funds vill be directed to NRY. NRY will
receive Rs.350 million (US$11.7 million) in 1992/93 and a projected Rs.500
million (US$16.7 million) in 1993194. NRY proposes to not apply its poverty
line eligibility criterion in the case of large-scale enterprise
restructuring, thereby opening NRY services to workers suffering employment
losses as enterprises close or scale down operations. District Urban Devel-
opment and local ERY Committees will work with ARCs to serve workers
expressing interest in NRY.
37.   Counseling and Retraining Services.  Rs.1,000 million (US$33.3 million)
is being allocated for 1992193 and Rs. 1,500 million (US$50 million) for
1993/94 to cover expenses related to the operation of ERCs and ARCs, and to
fund the redeployment and retraining of workers. At present, only preliminary
cost and service load estimates on these activities can be developed.

38.   Area Regeneration Schemes.  The  4inistry of Industry is pursuing a
"bottom-up" approach to the identification of area employment regeneration
schemes. An amunt of 19.500 million (US$16.7 million) each year (1992-93 and
1993-94) vill be used to fund promislng Initiatives proposed by ARCS and the
SLSCs.

The Voluntear Zetir.mt Schemn
1.    The basic provisions of the VRS as per the October 1988 notification by
the Bureau of Public Enterprises are :
(a)   it is available to employees who have completed 10 years of
service or who are 40 years of age or more, although management
has the right not to grant the voluntary retirement; and
(b) payment includess (i) the balance of the employee's Provident Fund
Account, (ii) the cash equivalent of accumulated earned leave,
(iii) one to three months notification pay, and (iv) 45 days pay
per year of service or 30 days pay per year of service remaining
(to mandatory retirement age of 58), whichever is less. The
provisions allow for additional amounts as agreed to by the
enterprise.
2.    Variations in VRS Payments:  There are significant variations in the
sise of VRS packages.   By formula, the major sources of variation are the
monthly wage rate and the years of service completed. Beyond this,
information from the Employees' Federation of India suggests wide variations
from enterprise specific agreements. Legislation has also introduced
differences in payments. For example, provisions of the Industrial Disputes
Act mandate an additional 15 days per year of service in certain
eircumstances.
3.    The range of packages agreed to is demonstrated by the following
examples s
(a)   payment of three months wages in lieu of notice, plus 40 days
wages per year of service;
(b) payment of four months gross wages per year left until normal
retirement;
(c)   payment of 40X of monthly wages for a period of up to eight years
or a lump sum payment equal to half of the total amount of
compensation offered over time;   and
(d)   1.25 months gross pay per year of service plus one month gross
wage for each completed seven years of service except for workers
within three years of retirement, who receive 36 months pay.
4.    VRS and the NRP   NRF will make compensation payments to:
(a)   workers in  public sector units under the VRS;
(b)   workers affected by closure orders of PSUs and private sector
units as recommended by BIER;



- 143 -                       ANNE 
Attachment 1
Page 2
(c) workers affected by downsizing resulting from enterprise
rehabilitation schemes as orders by BIFR, both in the public and
private sectors; and
(d)   workers affected by closure of private sector units already under
liquidation.
5.    While the formal VRS program applies only to PSEs, the NRF anticipates
compensation conditions similar to VRS in the other three cases as well.
6.    Variations in average compensation payments should be expected because
of factors beyond differences in average wages and years of service across
enterprises. For example, the presence of strong union representation is
likely to raise the average compensation payment amount in some enterprises
relative to others. NRP must be concerned about these differences because:
(a)   differential payments across enterprises which are not justified
by differences in average wages and years of service, raise equity
issues across enterprises;
(b)   differential payments also invite escalation of payments, with
subsequent enterprises/unions trying to better previous
settlements in winning the support of the enterprise workforce;
and
(c)   escalation will directly impact the extent of industrial reform
which is supportable by NRP funds.
7.    VRS Payments to PSU Workers from 1988-1991/92.  Table 1 shows the use of
VRS by PSU employees over the period 1988. It should be noted that the
numnbers in the table are not exhaustive as they are calculated based on the
information available.

BOARD FOR INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL RECONSTRUCTION
1.    Background  In 1985, the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions)
Act (SICA) was passed to "make, in the public interest, special provisions
with a view to securing the timely detection of sick and potentially sick
companies owing industrial undertakings, the speedy determination by a Board
of experts of the preventive, ameliorative, remedial ana other measures which
need to be taken with respect to such companies and the expeditious
enforcement of the measures so determined and for matters connected therewith
or incidental thereto.'
2.    SICA provided for the establishment of the Board for Industrial and
Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) as a quasi-judicial body to "exercise the
jurisdiction and powers and discharge the functions and duties conferred or
imposed on it by or under SICA."
3.    Composition of BIFR      The Board consists of a Chairman and not more
than fourteen other members all of whom are persons who are, or have been, or
are qualified to be High Court judges or persons with adequate professional
knowledge and experience in, inter-alia science, technology, economics,
banking, law etc. The Act also provides for an Appellate Authority for BIFR,
to consider appeals against BIFR decisions. BIFR now has a membership of
eight persons plus the Chairman.
4.    Benches of BIFR      The jurisdiction, powers and authority of BIFR (or
the Appellate Authority) is exercised by Benches consisting of at least two
members per bench. Four benches are in operation now and a request for an
increase to six is under consideration by the Ministry of Finance.
5.    References to BIFR       SICA applies to those industries which fall
under the First schedule to the Industries (Development & Regulation) Act,
1951 with the exception of the scheduled industry relating to ships and other
vessels drawn by power. The Central Government in consultation with RBI may,
however extend the coverage of SICA to these latter industries by
notification.  Industrial units manufacturing items not covered by I(D&R)
Act 1/ and those in the small scale and ancillary sectors are also excluded.
Formerly, SICA did not apply to Public Sector Enterprises, (PSEs), but these
were also included in November 1992.
6.    SICA requires the Board of Directors of industrial companies, whose net
worth is completely eroded to make a reference to BIFR. The three conditions
to be fulfilled for reporting sickness are: (a) the company is more than 7
years old; (b) its net worth is negative; and (c) it has incurred cash losses
during the preceding two years. Potentially sick industrial companies (i.e.
companies whose net worth is eroded by 50X or more) are also required to send
a report to BIFR though such a report is not required to be inquired into.

ANNEX 8
Attachment 2
Page 2
7.    Procedures followed by BIFR   References received from the sick
industrial companies are scrutinised by the BIFR Registrar to rectify defects,
if any, and registered thereafter. While the onus of making a reference is on
the Board of the Company, the Central Government, State Governments, RBI,
Financial Institutions and Banks can also make references. The registered
reference are placed before a Bench for review. The Chairman may join any one
of the Benches in specific cases, when it becomes a "Special Bench".
8.    The sequence of the review is as follows:
(a) the Bench confirms whether the concerned company is "SICK' as per
the conditions;
(b)   a special director is then appointed to safeguard the interest of
that company;
(c)   the Bench considers whether the Company, on its own, can make its
net worth positive, and, if so, issues an appropriate order; and
(d)   if such action cannot be taken, the Bench considers the
feasibility of reviving the company and appoints an Operating
Agency (OA) to prepare a Rehabilitation Scheme.
8.    Operating Agencies       At present, four Central Financial Institutions
and eight nationalized banks are notified as OAs. The OA is required to
prepare within 90 days, a scheme providing for any or more of the following
measures, viz.:
(a)   the reconstruction, revival or rehabilitation of the sick
industrial company;
(b)   the proper management of the sick industrial company by change in,
or take over, of the management of the sick industrial company;
(c)   the amalgamation of the sick industrial company with any other
industrial company;
(d)   the sale or lease of a part or whole of any industrial undertaking
of the sick industrial company;
(e)   such other preventive, ameliorative and remedial measures, as may
be appropriate; and
(f)   such incidental, consequential or supplemental measures as may be
necessary or expedient in connection with or for the purpose of
the measures specified in clauses (a) to (e).
9.    Operating Agency's Scheme to be submitted to BIFR        Based on the 0's
report and further hearings, the Bench may formulate a draft scheme for
revivallrehabilitation of the sick enterprise. The draft scheme is circulated
to all concerned, inviting suggestions/objections, and is also published in



- 147 -
AMN=X 8
Attachment 2
Page 3
two daily newspapers inviting comments/objections from employees, creditors,
shareholders etc, who if they so desire, are heard before a rehabilitation
scheme is approved.
10.   Where the scheme provides for financial assistance by way of loans,
advances or guarantees or reliefs or concessions or sacrifices from the
'Central Government. State Governments, any Scheduled Bank or other bank, a
public financial institution or state level institutions or any institution or
any other authority, the scheme can be sanctioned only with the consent of the
concerned agencies. A copy of the sanctioned scheme is then sent to the sick
Company, Operating Agency, State Government etc., for implementation.
11. Winding up notices to be issued by BIFR to non-viable units If the
OA's report concludes that revival/rehabilitation is not possible, or where
consent from the agencies required by the scheme to provide financial
assistance is not given, the Bench may form the prima facie opinion that the
company be wound up. Show cause notice for winding up is then issued to all
concerned. The prima facie opinion of the Board that the company be wound up
is also published in two local dailies inviting comments and objections if
any, from employees, shareholders, creditors etc. The objections and comments
received in response to the notice for winding up are considered carefully and
a further hearing is held again. Base on the hearing, the concerned Bench may
revise its earlier decision to wind up the company, or confirm its earlier
opinion. In such an event, the Board's decision is communicated to the High
Court. Based on the comments and objections and further hearings, the Bench
may be requested to reconfirm its opinion to the High Court for action to
liquidate the company.
12.   BIFR Results       The uumber of cases registered with BIFR and the
outstanding position relating to the cases since its inception in FY 1987 are
given belows

14.   As regards the time taken for disposal since time of registration, it
takes about 18 to 27 months for final disposal. However, liquidation cases
take longer, and the completion of liquidation takes s6veral years. The speed
of disposal depends on several factors including the quality of preparation of
the cases and the extent of agreement among the concerned parties.
15.   BIER and PSEs     Since inclusion of PSEs within the ambit of SICA, some
78 PSEs (including State level PSEs) have been referred to BIER and 7 of them
have been rejected. As of 9th October 1992, some 48 of these PSEs, including
33 Central PSZs have been registered. The list of Central PSEs is given in

16.   Government officials are optlmistic that PSE cases should generally be
disposed of within one year. While on the other hand Government being the
owner helps quicker disposal, PSE labor has been more "pampered" than private
sector labor and this could be a negative factor.
17.   Linkage of BInR cases to the National Renewal Fund (NRF)  NRF will
provide for redundancy payments to labor affected as a result of closures or
rehabilitation of enterprises. While payments made under voluntary retirement
schemes (VRS) could be made by NRP without awaiting DIFR decisions regarding
concerned cases, NRF vould await such decisions to consider compensation
payments to others. Once a BIFR decision is made in such cases, NRP would
seek agreement with labor to pay compensation through the following channelss
(a)   for PSI labor, through the concerned ministries and/or state
governments; and
(b)   for others, e.g., private sector companies, possibly through MOt.
This aspect will be decided on by the Empowered Authority of the
NRP.

1.   General Descri&tion      The RTC was created In the early 1970s to manage
103 textile units which were closed In the 19609 and 19708 due to a lack of
economic viability caused by employment protection schemes and a lack of
technological adaptation. The units were nationalized In the late 19709 and
grew to 124 units, 15 of which are government managed but not government
owned.
2.   Currently, the NTC is organized as a holding company and nine
subsidiaries. The holding company and a subsidiary in the South are In good
health; two units, one in Delhi and one In Bangalore are nearing good health;
and six have been chronically sick over the last 20 years, years though some
units within these are profitable.
3.   The ill health of ETC is due to : (a) poor Industry health;  (b) poor
government regulation of quantity and price despite excellent cotton quality;
(c) protectionism and employment guarantees; (d) improper fiber mix due to
government tax treatment of synthetics; and (e) uncompetitive production unit
size.
4.   Key current problems includes low labor productivity due to excess
labor, and low capital productivity as detezmined by comparison to textile
industry regional norms defined by Textile Research Association. The current
staffing includes 160,000 laborers and 3 to 4,000 staff. Labor wages are
About Rs. 1800 per month to start, rising to Rs. 3000 per month.
5.    NTC USE OF VRS    NTC's use of VRS dates back to 1988:
Year              Individuals
1988-89              3,985
1989-90              5,427
1990-91              4,666
1991-92              2,885
Total               16,963
Total Cost         m . i90 mllion
6.    NTC attributes the decline In the use of VRS in 1991-92 to the
announcement by the G00 of the establishment of NIP. Workers Interested in
the VRS buyout suspected greater payout amounts to be likely under VRW and
delayed their decision accordingly.

ANNEX 8
Attachment 3
Page 2
7.    The payout formula used by NTC was the established VRS formula augmented
by an additional 15 days pay per year of service as per the Industrial
Disputes Act.
S.    NTC AND THE NRF   In announcing the NRF, 0OI mandated an annual 25
percentage point cut in the textile mill subsidy, with the goal of ending mill
subsidy support by 1995-96. This dictated the timetable for NTC planning. If
the GOI subsidy reduction decision had allowed a longer adjustment period, NTC
would have proposed a more gradual downsizing.
9.    In response to the creation of NRF, NTC submitted a three year
adjustment plan including the closing of 14 units in non-urban concentrations
(locations with no more than one NTC mill) and 21 mills in urban
concentrations, the shedding of economically non-viable activities and the
retooling of other mills. Accompanying the plan, NTC forwarded details on the
geographical and skill distributions of the affected workers to assist the
planning of .ehabilitation efforts. The plan contained the following year to
year actions:
Year     Proposed        Actual to      Mill Closures
Retrenchment   9/30/92
(Numbers)
1992-93     38.417         3,332        No mill closures. Close down
uneconomic operations within plants.
1993-94     20,703                      14 mill closures
1994-95     20,862                      21 mill closures
79,982
10.   Additional retrenchments are likely if the 2 years plant modernization
plan progresses on schedule.
11.   The NTC's plan was approved by the Cabinet in August 1992.  Broad
details of the approved scheme are *
(a)   implementation of a VRS in NTC involving an outlay of Rs. 6,890
million (US$230.0 million) covering a total of 79,982 workers,
staff and officers;
(b)   approval in principle to close down 35 non-viable nationalized
mills, the closure however to be attempted mainly through VRS;
(c)   improvement in machine productivity through modernization
involving an outlay of Rs. 5,327.8 million;
(d)   approval of Rs. 2,000 million to the NTC to provide for liquidity
during the period of transitiont
(e)   creation of a rehabilitation fund of Rs. 500 million for
counselling, retraining and redeployment of the rationalized
workers; and

ANNEX 8
Attachment 3
Page 3
(f)   approval in principle for selective disinvestment of
shares/privatization of NTC units on a case to case basis.
12.   Funding mainly for VRS has already comenced.  Actual rationalization in
the field has also commenced and initial response is reported to be one of
enthusiasm rather than resistance to the scheme.
13.   Redeployment/Retraining  The NTC restructuring plan includes three
schemes to rehabilitate surplus mill workers: schemes whereby the individual
would purchase two or four plain power looms from NTC, or purchase 2 or 4 new
power looms from the manufacturer, or purchase reeling machines and bundling
presses to hank yarn. Details on the loom acquisition part of these schemes,
Including projected production, income, and profit/loss figures are contained
In a NTC Technical Document Division Report dated August 1992.
14.   The schemes involve two types of workers in the milles weavers and
others (winders, sizers, bleachers, dyers, and printers) and proposes a
training program for each. The program for weavers proposes 48 hours of
training 8 hours in classroom refresher training as a weaver, 8 hours
practical training on the loom, and 32 hours practical training on the skills
required of jobber/fitters. The program for non-weavers involves 12 hours of
classroom training on weaving, a 20 hour practice on the loom followed by 4
weeks of on-the-job training, and 64 hours of training as a loom
jobber/fitter. The proposal also contains a one week (48 hour)
entrepreneurship development program to develop management and coordination
skills in would be enterprise operators, and a proposal for a "Train the
trainer" program.
15.   The proposal includes cost estimates for training, based on a projected
class size of 20. The estimated cost is Rs.30,000 for a two-week weaver
training program (Rs.l,500 per worker) and Rs.45,000 for the three week
program (Rs.2,040 per worker). The six-day 'train the trainer" program is
costed at Rs. 42,000 (Rs. 2,010 per trainer).

18.  Proposal   DTC's proposal to overcome the above problem is to reduce
the fleet of 3,300 and manpower to 28,000 to have a vehicle/manpower ratio of
It8. On this basis, some 12,000 workers would be displaced and a Voluntary
Retirement Scheme (VRS) has been proposed to pay compensation to them. This
proposal will require an outlay of about Rs. 20,000 million to be paid over
two years oan the basis of the Governmet VRS, i.e. 1.5 months' pay per person
per year of service completed.
19.   Status      Cabinet approval is awaited.
20.   Opportunities for discharged labor  Most of them are trained or
experienced staff who should be able to find alternative employment in Delhi.

Attachment 4
T   aG           POSAL
1.    The Abmedabad proposal is les detailed than that of NTC, in part
because it cuts across a number of enterprises, takes a community rather than
a unit perspective, and was developed without the financial information
available only to the managers of the individual enterprises. As a result, the
proposal should be treated as an Initial prospectus requiring more detail
before action could be taken.
2.    The proposal starts from the premise that, despite past renewal efforts,
15 textile mills and 32,000 textile workers in Ahmedabad remain idle five to
seven years after production activities were suspended. The 15 closed mills
are under liquidation and a liquidator has been appointed by the High Court.
The affected workers are all under the Textile Labor Association whose
leadership has advanced the view that the "liquidator must be liquidated",
i.e. that workers must be paid their legal dues as quickly as possible, and
the assets of the mills (equipment and the land) immediately applied to
productive use in the industrial regeneration of the ci'y.
3.    Supporting this approach, the School of Planning in Abmedabad was
comissioned to study the alternative uses of the millls' land holdings. This
study valued the mills' holdings at Rs.15,100 million. The TLA subsequently
estimated compensation due the textile workers at Rs.870 million, or 5.74Z of
the mills' asset value.
4.    The proposal calls for the formation of an area Textile Restructuring
Assets Trust (TRAT) to devise a five to ten year redeployment plan for the
city, key elements of which would be:
(a)   lmediate take over of the assets c' the sick mills;
(b)   izmsdiate payment of legal dues to displaced workers;
(c) design and administration of payments to displaced workers beyond
their legal due;
(d) disposal of assets to finance development plans;
(e)   compensation to owners after all other liabilities have been met;
(f) training programs for displaced workers;
(g)   suitable financial restructuring of weak textile units which can
be revivad via modernization; and
(h) Introduction of new industries and redeployment of workers.
5.    The Government of Gujarat endorsed these broad outlines in July 1992 and
has requested the Central Government that the Abmedabad TRAR be endorsed and
used as a pilot project for the rest of the country. The proposal currently
rests at this stage with the Central Government.

ACCO X  AD AUDITING OF THE URF
(Prepared by the Department of Industrial Development;
Ministry of Industries)
1.    The provision in the Demand No. 51 - Department of Industrial
Development for NR? under C.l(7)(1) transfer to National Renewal Fund is made
from the Budgetary resources of the Consolidated Fund of India. The Fund is
transferred to the Public Account wherein it is maintained under the Head
28235-General and other Reserve Fund-NRFn.
2.    In the current year (FY92/93), the provision of Rs. 2,000 million under
NRF has been transferred to the Public Account. The expenditure incurred on
the separate provisions in the VRS (presently the provision in the Be is Rs.
1,487.5 million) to be debited against the NRP account is maintained in the
Public Account. Accounting instructions have already been issued to the Pay
and Accounts Officer (PAO) of the concerned Ministries/Departments to debit
the final Read and recoup the account of NEF by showing an equivalent amount
as deduct amount met from the NRP by directly operating on the debit side of
the NRF account in the Public Account. The PAOs send a monthlj statement of
expenditure to the PAO of the Department of Industrial Development, who is the
Nodal PAO so that a watch over the outflow from NRF is kept. The PAO,
Development of Industrial Development is maintaining a performa account for
NRE and there is no separate balance sheet, Income and Expenditure or receipt
and payment account etc.
3.    As per the guidelines of the NRF, new Heads of Account can be opened for
expenditure under the appropriate operating Department. Once these procedures
are finalized as and when expenditure is incurred on the basis of the
clearance of the appropriate Agencies such as the Empowered Committee, the
National Renewal Fund which gets credited to the Public Account and maintained
therein will get debited and performa account will be maintained by PAO,
Department of Industrial Development reflecting the latest status of the NRP
account.
4.    The National Renewal Fund and the transactions connected therewith thus
pass through the Budget and accounts of Government and these are on cash basis
and not accrual basis.
5.   Under the provisions of the Constitution of India the accounts of
Government are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General who is
a constitutional authority independent of Government. As the fund is routed
through the consolidated fund of India and since the expenditure will be met
from the respective budgets of the Departments concerned, the transactions
will be automatically covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India
and also such internal audit arrangements as exist in the various
Ministries/Departments.

1.    Several members of the India Consortium have responded to GOI's request
to provide additional support for the activities encompassed under the IDA-
supported operation. The following cofinancing arrangements are presently

2.    The above mentioned cofinancing arrangements vary considerably as
regards their status of preparation, individual scope and timing, and their
linkages to the IDA-supported operation. In some cases, the cofinancing
facilities would be earmarked for specific activities; in others, general
financial support for the activities covered under the Program for
Strengthening the Social Safety Net would be provided.
3.    These arrangements would provide a substantial enhancement to the
sustainability of the Social Safety Net Sector Adjustment Program.
Furthermore, while providing yet another example of IDA's ability to play a
catalytic role in large scale, long-term adjustment processes, the proposed
cofiLsncings demonstrate the Consortium's ability to respond to Tndia's
changing needs. The individual cofianmcing arrangements are outlined in the
following paragraphs.

4.    Germany.  A DM 50 million loan through Ireditanstalt fuer Viederaufbau
(KfW) would be provided under the framework of the 1992 German-Indian
agreement on Bilateral Financial Cooperation and would be available to support
employment generation schemes under the National Renewal Fund such as the
Jawahar Rosgar Yojana (JRY) and Nehru Rozgar Yojana (NRY). It is estimated
that this loan could become available in the third quarter of 1993.
5.    The Netherlands.  Responding to 001 request for assistance for the
Program, made at the June 1992 meeting of India Consortium, The Netherlands
authorities are currently considering to provide an untied grant in the amount
of up to DF1 100 million, which would be limited to Social Safety Net Program
activities only. The proposed cofinuacing, which would be joint, would be
disbursed in two tranches (DFl 50 million in 1992 and DF1 50 in 1993) under a
trust fund arrangement to be set up on the basis of existing arrangement
between the World Bank and The Netherlands for the administration of trust
funds dated December 11, 1986.
6.    The United States of America.  The United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) is actively considering to support NRF
activities through an allocation of a substantial portion (about 70?) of the
Rupee proceeds generated from the local sales of edible oil provided as a food
aid grant to India in 1992. It is estimated that USAID contributions to NRF
could thus reach US$35 million equivalent, possibly even more, depending on
the prices realized at the auctions. As of the end October 1992, thpse
proceeds had already reached about Rs. 300 million (US$10 million equivalent).
According to USAID estimates, there was a possibility that the entire quantity
of the donated oil could be sold by year-end 1992, thus enabling USAID to
provide the full amount of its support for NSF activities in the near future.
Depending on the success in the Implementation of NRM-supported activities and
the continued ability of USAID to provide assistance to India, a similar level
of support for NRF could be envisaged for 1993.
7.    Asian Development Bank (ADB).  The Government has requested ADB support
of about $100 million for NRF activities. ADB preparatory work coincided with
the IDA approved mission. It is estimated that ADB project appraisal could
take place by January, 1993 followed by a loan approval by mid-1993.
8. The Commission of the European Communities (EEC) has been requested by
the Government to support the Education For All program in Madhya Pradesh,
which would form a part of its Social Safety Net program for that State;
preparations are currently underway for a facility that is estimated at about
ECUs 150 million, which would become available to India by the second or third
quarter of 1993. It is expected that IDA and EEC would be able to coordinate
closely their support for the Social Safety Net activities in the primary
education sector, to ensure that the program support provided by the former
and the project financed by the latter would be mutually reinforcing. A
parallel cofinancing arrangement between IDA and nEC is envisaged.

1.          Objectives.  The Supervision Plan for the Social Safety Net Sector
Adjustment Program is designed to ensure that all necessary steps are taken.by
the GOI to implement the Program as outlined in the Letter of Development
Policy (LODP). The main focus of Supervision will be on the extent to which
progress is made in meeting the specific conditions of second tranche release.
In addition, an overall judgement will be made on the progress of the Program
as outlined in the Letter of Development Policy, by taking into adcount
implementation of the measures taken prior to the release of the first tranche
and the implementation of key efforts related to the safety net which are
noted in the LODP but not specific conditions for release of the first or
second tranche. This w*uld include actions such as: (a) the new medical and
dental manpower training policy; (b) the actions taken by GOI and the States
to ensure that Special Nutrition Programs, Early Childhood Education Centers
and Balwadi Nutrition Centers are not duplicated in ICDS blocks; (c) the
decisions regarding the location of 100 blocks in the targeted focal districts
identified under the ICDS program; (d) the establishment of Area Regeneration
Councils in key cities which have been impacted by industrial restructuring
programs; and (e) the impact of GOI's stabilization and structural reform and
adjustment program on the population especially the poorer segments, based on
the National Sample Survey of 1990-91 and the 001's program of Monitoring
Human Development Indicators.
2.          The Supervision Plan consists oft (a) a mission in January, 1993
which will focus on the technical assistance requirements for The National
Renewal Fund (YU), particularly inputs to activate quickly the Employment
Generation Fund, as well as learning from Government about actions being taken
to revamp the Public Distribution System (PDS) and the Jawahar Rozgar Yojanna
(JRY), as well as actions taken relating to other specific elements outlined
in the LODP; (b) a mid-term review mission which will be carried out in March,
1993 with an emphasis on the implementation of the measures included in the
Safety Net Program for the key social sector programs and the NRF, and (c) a
mission in June/July, 1993 which will be conducted prior to second tranche
release to ensure that tranche release conditions including overall progress
in the implementation of the Program are satisfied. The estimated dates,
staff and staff-inputs requirements are outlined below.

and specialists in primary

and food security.@
3.          Bank Supervision Input.  The Supervision Plan covers all major
components of the Program, i.e. primary education, primary health, disease
control, nutrition, the National Renewal Fund, PDS and the employment programs
(JRY and NRY), because it is unrealistic to plan separate supervision missions
for each of them. Both supervision missions and the mid-term review will
consist of staff based in Headquarters and the Bank's New Delhi Office (NDO)
which includes specialists in education, health, and nutrition. Consultants
would be used for the manpowerilabor aspects of the NRF and for food security.
The staff required for these supervision and mid-term review missions would be
additional to regular supervision needs covering procurement, disbursements
and other reporting.
4.          Borrower Contribution to Supervision.  It is expected that the
various line Ministries will prepare progress reports which will be submitted
to the Bank by the Borrower. The overall responsibilities for monitoring the
satisfactory compliance of conditions reside with the Department of Economic
Affairs (DNA). The DNA would also be responsible for coordinating
arrangements for IDA Supervision missions and for providing information as
required prior and during missions.
5.          Contribution by Co-financiers to Supervision.  Staff from the co-
financiers of the Program e.g. Netherlands; Federal Republic of Germany and
EEC are also expected to participate in these supervision missions.
6.          Beyond the Second Tranche Release.  The Bank staff will continue
to monitor progress with specific policies and programs, particularly the
adequate funding of the new initiatives and the commitments made by GOI to do
so until at least the end of the Eighth Five-year Plan period (1997). Since
IDA regards this operation as an "umbrella" under which future investments are
to be made, project preparation and appraisal of specific investment
operations in each of the core social sectors would closely relate to the
progress being achieved by GOI in implementing the Program beyond 1993-94.
