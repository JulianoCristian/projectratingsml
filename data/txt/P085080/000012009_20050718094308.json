The project has three components:\n            Institutional and Capacity Building Program, Road Safety\n            Demonstration and Awareness Program, and, Road Safety\n            Monitoring and Evaluation Program. The first component will\n            provide technical assistance within the implementation of\n            the project to strengthen the management, and technical\n            capacity of the National Traffic Safety Committee (NTSC)\n            Executive Office, and the Traffic Safety Project Management\n            Unit (TSPMU), and will further prepare a national road\n            safety strategy. The second component will assist the\n            government in developing, and implementing comprehensive,\n            integrated safety programs, which includes the enhancement\n            of road safety auditing processes, and funding of blackspot\n            treatments, for three high-risk road corridors. In addition,\n            a program of road user education, traffic safety\n            enforcement, and emergency service preparedness along the\n            three demonstration corridors will be implemented. Finally,\n            the third component will support the development of a\n            national road accident database system, to be used initially\n            by the Vietnam Road Administration (VRA) to enhance the\n            identification and treatment of blackspots, and by the\n            Ministry of Public Safety to improve enforcement strategies\n            and priorities."}, "docdt": "2005-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
