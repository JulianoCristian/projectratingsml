were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: responsible lead organization with\n            effective decision making powers is a prerequisite to manage\n            an effective road safety program; simplicity of design and\n            implementation arrangements are key for safe system inspired\n            road safety approaches, which put the emphasis at once on\n            road user behaviors, road designs, institutional capacity\n            and stakeholders awareness; sustainable funding and the\n            availability of adequate knowledge and skills are essential\n            to the delivery of road safety interventions; Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) systems need to be based on a\n            comprehensive road safety management information system,\n            including a national road accident database."}, "docdt": "2013-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
