                         The project development objective is to reduce the rate of accidents, injury and death associated with road transport through physical improvement and institutional
                         development to strengthen the management of road transport safety.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With the world's first stand-alone, second generation road safety intervention nearing completion, the project’s results exhibit positive outcomes. The project's demonstration corridors
                         have shown reductions in accident rates - from 39 (baseline) to 25 accidents per 100 million vehicle-km, injury rates - from130 (baseline) to 107 injuries per 100 million vehicle-km,
                         and fatality rates - from 13 (baseline) to 5.1 fatalities per100 million vehicle-km. A comprehensive national road safety public awareness program is in place, with a major emphasis
                         on drink-driving prevention, following speed limits, and proper use of quality motorcycle helmets, all of which are reinforced with new policies on setting fines for these offenses. The
                         National Traffic Safety Committee has installed equipment in all (63) Provincial Traffic Safety Committees, and has developed a web-based management information system for

                         Additionally, the national road accident database system is being operationalized in all national and provincial traffic police departments. The Traffic Camera Enforcement System is
                         in place along the demonstration corridors, and it is expected that after a forthcoming Decision from the traffic police, issuance of speeding tickets and fines for illegal lane changes
                         will begin before the end of the year. Many of the demonstration initiatives that have been advocated under the project are being expanded and integrated into stand-alone sector
