                         The project development objective is to reduce the rate of accidents, injury and death associated with road transport through physical improvement and
                         institutional development to strengthen the management of road transport safety.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As the world's first stand-alone, second generation road safety intervention, initial project outcomes indicate that the development objective is being met, as evidenced by: (i) a 28
                         percent reduction in the number of deaths and a 20 percent reduction in accidents after the removal of 40 identified blackspots on three project road corridors in 2010; (ii)
                         improvement in compliance with licensing standards, with 97 percent of motorcyclists having been issued a valid license on project road corridors after upgraded equipment for driver
                         licensing systems in all (63) Provincial Departments of Transport nation-wide were made operational; (iii) a draft outline for the national road safety strategy that specifies achievable
