                         The Project implementation progress has been shown that the project development objective reducing the rate of serious injury and death associated with road transport is
                         achievable: (i) number of death on project road corridors reduced from 289 in first 6 months in 2009 to 165 in same period of 2010; (ii) the draft outline of road safety strategy
                         specifying achievable performance targets and a financing plan have been submitted and discussed with both government and the Bank; (iii) several activities for improvement of
                         driver behavior and compliance with vehicle and licensing standards have been completed such as purchase of equipment for vehicle inspection centers and driving and licensing
                         centers; and (iv) the draft design of national road accident database system (NRADS) has been completed and a workshop for comments on the draft design has been organized.
