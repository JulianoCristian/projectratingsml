PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Shanghai Port Restructuring
and Development Project in China for which Loan 3552-CHA for US$150.0 million was
approved on December 22, 1992 and made effective on May 13, 1993. The loan amount was
revised US$124.26 million on November 30, 1997, to take account the cost savings of US$25.74
million. The loan was closed on June 30, 1999, as originally planned without any extension. Final
disbursements were made on January 19, 1999. The total amount of the loan disbursed was
US$120.07 million. The remaining balance of US$4.19 million was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Toshiro Tsutsumi (Task Manager) and Han-Kang Yen
(Economic and Financial Analyst) of the Transport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Region;
reviewed by Messrs. Jitendra N. Bajpai (Sector Director, EASTR), Robin Carruthers (Principal
Transport Economist, EASTR), Marc Juhel (Senior Port Operations Specialist, TWUTD), Ismail
Mobarek (Principle Maritime Transport Specialist, SASIN), and Kek Clhoo Chung (former Bank
Staff).
Preparation of this ICR started before the project closing date and was based on material
in the project file. The Borrower contributed to the ICR by evaluating the project's execution and
initial preparation.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
SHANGHAI PORT RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT (LOAN 3552-CHA)
CHINA
Objectives
1. Shanghai Port is the largest port in China and gateway to eastern and central China. This
project was the third Bank-financed project for Shanghai port. The first and second projects
focused on containerization and alleviating congestion, providing additional modern terminal
facilities and improving institutional management capacity. The third project focused on
restructuring the port, i.e., providing facilities along the Yangtze River and shifting port
operations from the congested city center and further commercializing the port authority's
activities. When the project was identified, Chiina's economy was growing very rapidly and
Shanghai Port traffic was expected to increase rapidly as well.
2. The project's main objectives were to help the port of Shanghai in: (a) the long-term
development of the port and the use of its facilities by gradually slhifting port operations away
from the congested city center and by promoting terminal specialization; (b) providing needed
additional capacity in a rational, optimal, and environmentally sound way; and (c) increasing
efficiency by introducing modem methods of operational and financial management.
3. Project components included: (a) provision of new and replacement cargo handling
equipment (for existing terminals) to improve cargo handling efficiency and promote terminal
specialization; (b) measures to improve Shanghai Port Autlhority's (SPA) financial condition
through tariff restructuring, computerization of accounting, auditing and budgetary control; (c)
the construction of new terminals (first stage) at Waigaoqiao (for containers) and Luojing (for
coal) with procurement and installation of the necessary cargo hanidling equipment; and (d)
techi ical assistance and training.
4. A joint venture between a Hong Kong operator and SPA, Shanghai Container Terminal Ltd.
(SCT), was established to run container operations at Jungonlu, Zhanghuaban and Baoshan
terminals. The Waigaiqiao terminal developed under the project was operated by SPA in
competition with SCT at the other terminals, which created intra-port competition.
Implementation Experience and Results
5. The project was completed satisfactorily by June 30, 1999, as originally planned. Major
components were completed before the closing date. Bank procedures were followed and project
objectives were achieved. Physical components-Waigaoqiao and Luojing terminals-were
constructed, implementation of corporate planning and several studies for specialization of
terminal operations were carried out, and replacement equipment for existing terminals was
procured. Both managers and workers of SPA received extensive training, and operational and



vi                           SHANGHAI PORT RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
maintenance capacity improved. In addition to the Port Cost Managemenit Information System
(PCMIS) established and implemented under the second Bank-finaniced project, thle Port Tariff
System was established to increase SPA's financial management capacity. Waigaoqiao terminal's
productivity equals that of the SCT and intemational standards. In addition, SPA is seriously
implementing organizational reforn to improve institutional efficiency.
6. These satisfactory achievements were due to the increase in SPA's capacity in the face of
competition and its experience with previous Bank projects, as well as good coordination
between SPA and the Ministry of Communications (MOC), in particular for the implementation
of the Port Tariff Study.
7. Cost estimates at appraisal were very reasonable. The final cost is estimated at about
Y2,253.3 million, compared to an SAR estimate of Y2,439.4 million. Actual US$ project costs
amounted to US$314.7 million, about 25 percent lower thani the US$424.3 million estimated at
appraisal. The lower US$ amount is due to the devaluation of the Yuan and savings achieved
from competitive bidding (paragraph 23, main text).
8. The project's benefits were also achieved, including savings in cargo-handlinig costs, ship
waiting and berthing time and cargo time. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was
estimated at 29.2 percent against 36.7 percent in the SAR, wlich is still consider-ed satisfactory
(paragraph 22, main text, and Annex 2).
9. SPA's financial performance is sound. The operational ratio (operating costs/operating
revenues) was close to the SAR estimate (69 percent compared to 68 percent for 1997). In
addition, as container traffic is likely to continue to increase, SPA's financial conditioni should
remain sound.
10. No environmental or resettlement problems arose during preparation and implementation. A
very small number of people were resettled.
Sustainability
11. The project is considered sustainable. Because containier traffic will continue to grow along
with economic development in the Shanghai area, the port's revenue will increase. SPA's
productivity at Waigaoqiao Container Terminal has proven competitive to that of the SCT joint
venture terminal (see Table 6).
12. Port facilities located in the downtown area should be restructured in the medium- to long-
term. This process will require comprehensive coordination between SPA, municipality, terminal
users, residents and private investors. SPA has already provided guidelines for investors to
facilitate coordination.
Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
Summary of Findings
13. Competition among ports in the Shanghai region increased significanitly in the past five years
because of deregulation of grain cargo, private sector participation and cargo owners' having
their own terminals. Shanghai Port does not have a monopoly on port facilities to serve the



SHANGHAI PORT RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT                                 vii
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Shanghai region. It has competition from  neighboring ports (e.g.. Nantolng, Zhanjiagang,
Nanjing) and terminals constructed by power plants thlat compete witlh coal unloading facilities.
14.    Significant changes have been made since the Bank's first involvemenit in China's port
sector in 1982. Major port authorities were decentralized from MOC to municipalities. Joint
venture container terminal operations with foreign operators were started first in Shanghai and
then in other ports (e.g., Dalian, Shenzheng, Tianjin, Xiamen, Fuzhou and the Guangdong area).
While port authorities are now more aware of the role of the port as a vital transport link with
other transport modes (rail and roads), policy coordination in the central government needs to be
strengthened to improve the efficiency of multi-modal transport.
Future Operations
15. SPA needs to continue its efforts to transfer terminal facilities out of the city, with the coal
terminal receiving top priority. SPA has established guidelines for the land use plan for the city
center terminals, and is encouraging investment by the private sector.
16. SPA needs to continue to restructure, right-sizing personnel, computerizing the financial
accounting system, maximizing equipment use, and reducing operating costs.
17. To maximize use of bulk facilities, SPA must attract grain and coal traffic. To do so, it needs
to monitor coal and grain traffic flows (in relation to the domestic harvest and national energy
policies), transshipment patterns in the Shanghai region, and the supply-demand balance dictated
by the world market economy (which in turn affects cargo owners' port and terminal choices).
18. The capacity of Waigaqiao terminal will need to expand further as demanld increases.
Additional quayside container and rubber-tired gantry cranes will be required to meet future
increases in container traffic. SPA also is constructing an additional 900-in-long container
terminal with its own funds next to the Waigaoqiao terminal to meet expected future demand.
Civil works are substantially complete, but capital investment for equipment has yet to be
secured. To foster a higher degree of intra-port competition for future container terminal
operations, SPA may wish to consider options, including concessioninig, beyond joint venture
arrangements.
19. The Government of China (GOC) is deepening the approach channel to the mouth of the
Yangtze River. When the project is complete, the port will benefit significantly from larger
vessels and transport cost savings. While this is a long-term development, SPA should carefully
monitor the progress and prepare appropriate scenarios and master plans.
Key Lessons Learned
20. The public sector's performance at Waigaoqiao terminal is noteworthy because it was as
strong as that of the joint venture terminals. While competition between SCT and Waigaoqiao
terminals is limited, given that SPA holds 50 percent and 100 percent of shares, respectively,
successful performance was possible only in an environment of competition. It would be
worthwhile for the Bank to consider providing furtlher assistance to the port sub-sector if the
introduction of more open competition is proposed.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
21. SPA's past experience in completing two previous Bank-finainced projects satisfactorily was
a factor for successful implementation. SPA has been familiarized with the Bank procedures and
policy requirements; thus, no confusion in procurement procedures and compliance with legal
covenants arose.
22. Continuity of staff played a factor for success. Both SPA and the Bank maintained the same
multidisciplinary teams.

PART I. IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1. Shanghai Port is the largest port in China and the gateway to eastern and central China. This
was the third Bank-financed project for Shanghai port. The first and the second projects, the
Three Ports Project and Ningbo and Shanghai Port Project, focused on containerization and
alleviating congestion, providing modern terminal facilities and improving institutional
management. The third project focused on restructuring the port.
2. The project's main objectives were to help the port of Shanghai in (a) the long-term
development of the port and the use of its facilities by gradually shifting port operations away
from the congested city center and by promoting terminal specialization; (b) providing needed
additional capacity in a rational, optimal, and environmentally sound way; and (c) increasing
efficiency by introducing modern methods of operational and financial management.
3. Project components included: (a) procurement of handlinig equipment to improve cargo
handling efficiency and promote terminal specialization; (b) improvement of SPA's financial
condition through tariff restructuring and computerization of accounting, auditing and budgetary
control; (c) the construction of a container terminal at Waigaoqiao and a coal terminal at Luojing,
including the procurement and installation of cargo hanidling equipment; and (d) technical
assistance and training.
4. A joint venture between a Hong Kong operator and SPA, Shanghai Container Terminal Ltd.
(SCT), was established to run container operations at Jungonlu, Zhanghuaban and Baoshan
terminals. The Waigaiqiao terminal developed under the project was operated by SPA, in
competition with SCT at the other terminals (see Table 6 for comparison of performance).
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Project Implementation
CYvi Works
5. Construction of the Luojing coal terminal began in 1993. It was built under international
competitive bidding (ICB) after prequalification procedures were followed. A domestic
conractor won the contract and local consultants supervised it. The terminal was completed in
December 1996, and after testing, adjusting equipment, and a trial period, was officially accepted
in Docember 1997. The quality of construction improved compared to that under previous Bank-
financed projects due to the improved capacity of domestic contractors.
6. Conshtion of Waigaoqiao terminal started on July 1, 1991, and was basically completed in
October 1993. After testing, adjusting equipment and a trial period, the terminal was officially
accepted in October 1994. The multi-purpose terminal was converted to a container terminal

IMPLEMENTATION COMP'LETION REPORT
between July 1997 and June 1998, and is now fully operational. Waigaoqiao terminal was also
satisfactorily constructed and financed locaily.
7. Construction of a bulk fertilizer berth (locally finaniced) was canceled because of low
demand. Fertilizer handling will be transferred out of the city center in accordance with the port
master plan.
Equipment
8. Procurement was carried out through ICB, national competitive bidding (NCB) and shopping
procedures. Major items of equipment were procured tlhroughl ICB (96 percelnt of the total
allocated for Category 2-Goods). The largest procurement package was for equipment for
Luojing coal terminal (two bucket unloaders, one grab unloader and a conveyer belt system).
Documents were issued on June 17, 1994 and evaluation of bids was completed on January 5,
1995. No notable procurement probtems arose.
9. Procurement Procedures. Procurement of equipment required a lengthy evaluation period,
while civil works procurement was carried out quickly. A two-level authorizationi procedure for
equipment procurement-one at the regional level by SPA and anotlher at the central level by the
State Evaluation Committee-slowed the process. Procuremelnt of a towing tractor took 217
days, the longest evaluation period of the project. SPA needed adequate time to compare the
technical specifications tendered in the bids. In contrast, only 1 3 days were required to evaluate
the civil works contract for Luojing Terminal, which did not require two-stage authorization
(Table SC). Two-stage bidding procedures were followed to procure a computer system and bids
were satisfactorily evaluated and implemented.
Technical Assistance and Training
10. SPA successfully implemented extensive studies related to: (a) Corporate Planning, (b) Bulk
Fertilizer Terminal Restructuring, (c) Dangerous Cargo Handling, (d) Cargo Unitization, and (e)
Port Tariff Development. Details are provided in Table 7.
1 1. The Corporate Planning Study was intended to lhelp SPA build capacity for planning,
monitoring budgets and preparing slhort- and long-term strategies tlhrough training and providing
a corporate plan. The plan was satisfactory completed in June 1995 and included Comprehensive
Development Strategy, Port Layout and Port Construction Investment Plans.
12. The objective of the Bulk Fertilizer Terminal Restructuring Study was to prepare a plan to
remove the fertilizer terminal from the city center. The study began in May 1996 and was
completed satisfactorily in May 1997. It recommended moving the fertilizer terminal to
Wuhangou in Waigaoqiao according to the Municipal Master Plan.
13. The Dangerous Cargo Handling Study evaluated how to improve safety at Shaniglhai Port and
prepared guidelines on dangerous cargo handling. The study began in May 1995 and was
completed in 1997. It recommended that dangerous cargo be removed from the city center in the
long term, but in the short term, concentrated in a few areas to facilitate safety supervision and
control possible pollution.
14. The Port Tariff Development Study provided the port with a computerized cost-based tariff
structure. This is an extension of a Port Cost Management Informationi System developed under



SHANGHAI PORT RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT                              3
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
the Bank's second Shanghai port project. Since tariffs at major ports are reguLlated by MOC,
implementation of the study was coordinated closely with MOC. The computerized tariff system
developed under the study is generic and can be used for China's other ports in accordance with
requirements of MOF.
15. Institutional Reforms. In 1997 and 1998, SPA made significant institutional changes,
reducing the number of its employees, implementing cost-coniscious management, and sharing
cargo handling equipment with other terminals. While some activities (e.g., providing early
retiremenit packages) temporarily increased expenditures, SPA will benefit in the long term.
Project Results
16. All project objectives were achieved during implementation.
Private Sector Involvement and Public Terminal Performnance
17. During project preparation, the Shanghai Container Development Company, owned by SPA,
and a Hong Kong-based private investor established a joint venture company, SCT, to operate
container terminals in Shanghai. This was the first joint venture for container operations in the
major ports in China to involve a private investor. SPA used a part of its assets to take a 50
percent share in the company.
18. The Waigaoqiao container terminal was completed uLnder the project and operated entirely by
SPA. The productivity of the Waigaoqiao terminal is as high as that of the SCT terminals.
Waigaoqiao terminal throughput increased steadily from 11 8,000 teu in 1995 to 675,000 teu in
1998. In 1998, the average throughput capacity of quayside cranes was 129,000 teu, compared to
SCT's 127,000 teu. The average container dwelling and vessel waiting times at Waigaoqiao are
4.6 days and 8.6 hours, respectively, compared to SCT's 5.2 days and 9.6 hours (Table 6).
19. The Luojing coal terminal was completed and operational as of January 1, 1998. Because
coal traffic decreased at Shanghai Port, Luojing handled only 0.3 million tons. While coal traffic
at Luojing terminal is expected to more than double in 1999, traffic will still be low in relation to
the 10 million-ton capacity of the terminal. It is recommended that SPA take advantage of the
capacity at the Luojing terminal to expedite transferring coal traffic from the city center to
Luojing. Meanwhile Luojing is hanidling mineral ore, of which about 2.3 million tons were
handled from July 1997 to May 1999.
20. SPA replaced obsolete equipment with new ones at existing terminals. It also reviewed the
existing equipment inventory at each terminal and operating company and redistributed
equipment, reducing idle time and maximizing their use.
21. One of the major objectives of the project, moving cargo handling out of the city center, is
being achieved. Cargo volume handled inside the city decreased from 111.4 million tons (68
percent of total tonnage) in 1996 to 98.0 million tons (60 percent of total tonnage) in 1998, while
the traffic outside the city center increased from 53 million tons to 66 million tons.
22. Other expected benefits, including savings in cargo-hanidlinig costs, ship waiting and berthing
time, and cargo time, were also achieved. Although the EIRR of 29.2 percent at project
completion is lower than the 36.7 percent estimated at appraisal, it is considered satisfactory.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
23. Cost estimates at appraisal were very reasonable. The final cost is estimated at about
Y2,253.3 million, compared to an SAR estimate of Y2,439.4 millioni. Actual US$ project costs
amounted to US$314.7 million, about 25 percent lower tlhan the US$424.3 million estimated at
appraisal. The lower US$ amount is due to the devaluation of the Yuan and savings achieved
from competitive bidding.
24. The cost of procuring equipment was about $32 million lower tlhan expected. Of the project
cost savings, $25.74 million was cancelled on November 30, 1995, and $6.89 million went
towards increasing the disbursement percentage in the civil works category from 34 percent to 65
percent to match the foreign currency component. The civil works disbursement percentage had
originally been set low because of the constraints imposed by the loan amount.
25. No environmental or resettlement problems arose during preparation and implementation.
Three hundred seventy families at the site of the Waigaoqiao termnilal were resettled by SPA and
received financial compensation and new housing. Discussion with members of randomly
selected resettled families revealed that the resettlement terms were generous and satisfactory.
Financial Performance
26. Since the project became effective in 1993, three major chaniges have affected the financial
condition and the reporting procedures of SPA.
27. New Financial Reporting Procedures. Under regulations from the Ministry of Finance, SPA
changed its financial reporting procedures in July 1993 to be consistelnt with international
accounting procedures. The new financial reporting procedures require SPA to prepare modified
financial reports for subsequent years to accelerate the commercialization of the port.
28. Container Operations. The joint venture container hiandling company SCT established in
1993 now plays a dominant role in port container operations. For example, in 1998, about two-
thirds of container traffic at Shanghai port was handled by SCT.
29. Reevaluation of FixedAssets (RFA). The RFA of the port took place twice, in 1992 and 1994.
The first RFA was confined to the five major types of hanidlinig equipment; and increased the
value of fixed assets by about 13 percent (or Y423.8 million). The second RFA increased the
value of fixed assets by about 10 percent (or Y345.6 million).
30. Port tariffs have been regulated on the low side and have not been modified in a timely way
to reflect the escalation of prices. SPA's profit shrank because of the gap between price increases
and tariff levels.
Past Financial Performance
31. The overall financial performance of the port was low compared to projections in the SAR
but still is considered acceptable. The total volume of traffic hanidled by the port reached its peak
in 1993 (112.6 million tons), decreasing by an average of 4.3 percent each year to 90.5 million
tons in 1998 due to the diminution of bulk traffic (coal and fertilizer) passing tllrough the port.
For example, in 1997, included in SAR projections, SPA hanidled 91.4 million tons of cargo, 22.6
percent less than the projected 118 million tons. Despite this, actual total operating revenues of
Y2.7 billion were only about 7 percent less than the SAR's projection of Y2.9 billion. This makes
the actual unit revenue of Y29.6/ton 20 percent higher then the SAR's forecast of Y24.6/ton.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
32. The growth of unit revenue came about as a result of two changes in cargo handling
operations. First, the tariff table was modified for foreign-going cargo in 1994 and 1997,
increasing the tariff by 15 percent in 1994 and 25 percent in 1997. However, these modifications
did not fully reflect price escalation, and the low tariffs eroded SPA's profitability. Overall unit
revenue was 19.6 percent higher in 1998 than in 1993. This was much lower thanl the domestic
price escalation of 50.7 percent for the same period. The slow unit revenue increase (due to the
slow growth of Government-regulated tariffs) has reduced after-tax unit profits (profitability) to
only 19.1 percent of the 1993 level. The following table summarizes unit revenues.

33. The simulation test shows that if tariffs had growni at the same rate as domiestic prices, in
1998 the port would have generated a YI.35 billion after-tax profit. The return on ANFA, debt
service (D/S) coverage, debt/capital ratio and current ratio would have been much higher--25.0
percent, 22.5 percent, 17.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. The results of the simulation test
are summarized below.

34. The composition of cargo traffic changed from  lower-profit coal traffic to higher-profit
container traffic. Between 1993 and 1998, coal traffic decreased from 44.3 million tons to 20.9
million tons (or an average of 14.0 percent per year). During the same period, container traffic
increased from 8.5 million tons to 27.7 million tons (or an average of 26.7 percent per year). In
1993, container traffic amounted to 7.5 percent of total port traffic, but by 1998, it had increased
to 32 percent of the total, compared to 30.6 percent for coal.

35. The financial reporting procedures established in 1993 excluded surcharges (administrative
and financial costs) from operating costs, better reflecting the operating efficiency of each
business entity. The SAR did not reflect this exclusion in its financial forecast because the report
was prepared before the new financial reporting procedures were established. The underestimated
surcharges caused the actual after-tax profit to be much lower than the SAR's projection.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
36. While surcharge costs were higher than anticipated, the SPA improved operating costs until
1997. The lower net profit also caused a lower financial rate of return on1 average net fixed assets.
In 1996, internal management reforms and cost-control efforts helped improve the profitability of
the port.
37. However, in 1998, rapidly increasing surcharge costs caused the unit profit to decrease to
YO.38 /ton. The razor-thin profit in 1998 caused a shortage of internally generated funds as
shown below (see more detail in Table- 1 . 1, Annex 1).

Present Financial Performance
38. In 1998, D/S coverage was 5.2, which was satisfactory, but much lower than the 21.7
forecast for 1997 in the SAR. In the same year, the debt and capital (DC) ratio reached 30.5
percent, close to the 28.4 percent forecast for 1997 in the SAR, up from 21.2 percent for 1991.
The lower-than-expected internally generated funds caused SPA to look to outside financiers to
support its capital investment. SPA's borrowing caused the current debt-to-equity ratio to reach
51:49 in 1998, stretching SPA to its financial limit.
39. Furthermore, SPA borrowing is concentrated in short-term  debt. In 1998, short-term  debt
(current liabilities) constituted about 58.9 percent of total debt, or more than triple the SAR's
estimates of 17.1 percent for 1997. The high proportion of short-term debt lowered the current
ratio to 0.7 (to avoid short-term solvency problems, the current ratio should be more than 1.0).
Since the debt service coverage and DC ratio of the port are still in an acceptable range, SPA
should consider restructuring its debt by refinancing much of the short-term debt inito long-term
debt to maintain the current ratio at 1.0 or higher.
40. The most noteworthy points of the balance sheet are summarized below (see Table 1.2,
Annex I for details).

Future Financial Performance
41. Although SPA is making efforts to improve the profitability of its operations, its capital
investment program has exerted a heavy toll on SPA's flow of funds (see Table 1.3, Annex 1).
The demand on revenue to repay loans in coming years is very high. For example, in 1998, loan
servicing constituted 7.3 percent of cash outflow, up from 2.3 percent in 1996. SPA should take
steps to strengthen its financial condition, as outlined below.
42. Restructure debt. Since 1993, short-term debt (current liabilities) has exceeded long-termn
debt. The port should avoid short-term borrowing to finance long-term investments.
43. Improve liquidity. SPA should shorten its operating cycle to reduce the amount of cash
required for operations. The operating cycle is the average number of days it takes to collect
accounts receivable plus inventory turnover days. The port's operating cycle is observed to be
increasing steadily. A long accounts receivable cycle and increased inventory days (higher
operating costs) drain the port's much-needed cash. A shortened operating cycle would improve
liquidity.

Number of days to collect accounts receivable      105.9    138.5    150.0

44. Management reform. In the face of rapidly increasing overhead, SPA is taking action to
control administrative expenditures, including merging its own retirement plan into the city's, and
enforcing management reforms at headquarter agencies. Other possible actions include
transferring welfare or social activities not directly related to daily operations (e.g., hospitals),
along with their operating costs, to municipal agencies.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
45. Proper Tariff Level. GOC should give port authorities more flexibility by modifying tariff
levels in a timely way to reflect actual costs. Since MOC and Shanglhai port have developed a
cost-based tariff structure under the project, tariffs should be modified promptly to reflect current
local conditions.
46. Economic Reevaluation. The economic analysis in this report is based on t[he reevaluation of
SAR estimates of traffic, operational performance, economic costs and the benefits of project
components. The methodology used in the ICR is similar to that in the SAR.
*  Capital investment and maintenance costs have been revised to reflect December 1999
prices and are included in the cost stream.
*  The benefit stream, also reflected in December 1999 prices, consists of savings in cargo
handling, ship port time (berth and waiting), and cargo port time (berth and waiting).
*  The project life is assumed at 20 years and the capital investmenit period for all berths is
from 1991 to 1999.
*  Benefits started to accrue for container berths, constructioni materials bertlhs and general
cargo berths in 1995. For coal berths, benefits started in 1997.
47. Use of the berths changed during project implementation because the composition of traffic
changed. The economic analysis for this ICR took into account the cancellation of one bulk
ferti l izer berth.
48. In 1998, traffic handled by SPA totaled 90.54 million tons, about 25 percent lower than the
SAR's estimated 121.07 million tons. Traffic on the project berths is about 22 percent lower than
the SAR's projection (83.13 million tons actual compared to 106.83 million tons projected).
Except for the traffic on container berths, the traffic on all other project berths is less than
estimated. The increase in container traffic cannot totally offset the combined loss in coal, break
bulk and construction materials traffic. The sharp decline in coal traffic from a record-breaking
44.33 million tons in 1993 to 20.91 million tons in 1998, due to cargo owners' constructing their
own unloading facilities, affects the overall economic rate of return despite an 18.3-percent
economic cost savings in constant December 1999 prices.
49. After assessing the revised data, the reevaluation of the economic internal rate of return for
this project is 29.2 percent, which is lower than the SAR estimate of 36.7 percent, but still
acceptable. A detailed analysis is presented in Annex 2.
50. The reevaluation of the economic internal rate of return and the SAR estimates of the project
in terms of the economic rate of return and the net present value (NPV) are given below.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
51. Several factors contributed to the success of the project. The project design was
straightforward, a single agency was responsible for the development and no complicated
coordination between government agencies was required for project implementation. The
economy of the region and the country grew, and port traffic, particularly container traffic, the
most profitable, increased.
52. At the time of loan approval, SPA was already un1der strong pressure to restructure (i.e.,
reduce personnel, close three coal berths in the city center, control budgets better) in the climate
of China's move toward a market economy. During project implementation, productivity
improved further in response to competition between Shanghai port and other ports in the region
(Nantong, Zhangjiagang, Ningbo) and between the terminals at Shanghai port (SCT and
Waigaoqiao container terminals). Productivity is expected to continue to improve.
53. The project benefitted from SPA's experience in implementinig Bank projects and familiarity
with Bank procedures. No major problem in procurement, disbursement, financial auditing, or
compliance with legal covenants arose. What was more significant, beginning with the previous
projects and continuing through this project, continuity in the staff of the Bank, MOC and SPA
helped the project teams establish fruitful relationships with trust and confidelnce on all sides.
This contributed to smooth project implementation.
54. There were also negative factors which played a role in project outcome. The Asian financial
crisis slowed regional economic growth and cooled the private sector's interest in investing in the
region. Since restructuring the port required large private investmenit, the process was hampered
by the crisis. Coal traffic also declined during project implementation. Although this might have
helped expedite the restructuring of the coal terminals, it served to weaken SPA's financial
position, thus limiting SPA's options for restructuring.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
55. At completion, the project is considered sustainable. Container traffic is expected to continue
to grow along with economic development in the Shanghai area and port revenue will increase.
SPA has proved that it is as productive at the Waigaoqiao container terminal as the SCT in its
joint venture terminal. It is expected that GOC will use the cost-based tariff structure system to
modify tariff levels promptly.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
56. The Bank identified and prepared the project in a timely fashion-the project was identified
in April 1991 and appraised in May and June 1992. Bank staff resources for the project up to
appraisal were 114.7 staff weeks. Bank supervision was efficient, with an average of 11.3 staff
weeks per year that included several specialties (see Table 12). This was possible because the
supervision of several Bank-financed port and inland waterways projects was well coordinated.
57. With regard to procurement, the Bank took a consistent position and provided guidance when
neesr.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
58. The Borrower's performance was good and preparation and implementationi were adequate.
The action plan targets were met substantially during implemenitationi. and as slhowni in Table I0,
Part 11, covenants generally were met as well. The Borrower's performance, therefore, was
evaluated as highlly satisfactory.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
59. This project is assessed as highly satisfactory because it aclieved all major objectives
without any shortcomings or delay of the closing date.
60. Net present value was positive, Y3,260 million against Y4,585 million in the SAR, when
flows were discounted at 12 percent for a major portion of the investment. EIRR at completion
was 29.2 percent as compared to 36.7 percent estimated at appraisal. The project tlherefore would
be considered a success in both economic and financial terns.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
61. For the future SPA needs to continiue its efforts to transfer facilities away from the city center
witlh restructuring of the coal terminal in the city receiving top priority. Plans are at hand for this
process as SPA has established guidelines for the land-use plan and is contacting the private
sector for participation.
62. SPA needs to continue to restructure, right-sizing personniiel, computerizing the financial
accounting system, maximizing equipment use, and reducilng operating costs.
63. To maximize use of bulk facilities, SPA must attract grain and coal traffic. To do so, it needs
to monitor coal and grain traffic flows (in relation to the domestic harvest and national energy
policies), transshipment patterns in the Shanghai region, and the supply-demand balance dictated
by the world market economy (which in turn affects cargo owners' port and termlillal choices).
64. The capacity of Waigaqiao terminal will need to expand furtlher as demand increases.
Additional quayside container and rubber-tired gantry cranes will be required to meet future
increases in container traffic. SPA also is constructinig an additional 900-in-lonig container
terminal with its own funds next to the Waigaoqiao terminal to meet expected future demand.
Civil works are substantially complete, but capital investmenit for equipment hlas yet to be
secured. To foster intra-port competition among future container terminal operationis, SPA may
wishi to consider options, including concession, beyond joinlt venlture arrangements.
65. GOC is deepening the approach channel to the mouthl of the Yangtze River. Wlhen the project
is complete, the port will benefit significantly from larger vessels and transport cost savings.
While this is a long-term development, SPA should carefully monitor the progress and prepare
appropriate scenarios and master plans.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
66. Summary of Findings. Competition among ports in the Shanighai region increased
significantly in the past five years because of the deregulation of grain cargo, private sector

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
participation and cargo owners' having their owIn terminals. Shanghlai Port does not have a
monopoly of port facilities to serve the Shanghai region, but competes with several neighboring
ports (e.g., Nantong, Zhanjiagang, Nanjing). In addition to these ports, some power plants have
constructed th-eir own terminals that compete with coal unloadinlg facilities.
67. Significant changes have been made since the Bank's first involvement in Chinla's port sector
in 1982. Major port authorities were decentralized from MOC to munLicipalities. Joint venture
container terminal operations with foreign operators were started first in Shanghai and then in
other ports (e.g., Dalian, Shenzheng, Tianjin, Xiamen, Fuzhou and the Guangdong area). While
port authorities are now more aware of the role of the port as a vital transport link with other
transport modes (rail and roads), policy coordination in the central governmeent needs to be
strengthened to improve the efficiency of multi-modal transport.
68. Key Lessons Learned. Public sector performance is compatible to that of the joint-venture if
conditions are right as evidenced by SPA's performance at Waigaoqiao terminal which was in
fact better than SCT's performance. This is possible because of the competitive environment
under which SPA and SCT operated. Given this finding, it would be worthwhile for the Bank to
consider providing further assistance to the port sub-sector if the introductioll of more open
competition is proposed.
69. SPA's past experience in completing two Bank-finanlced projects satisfactorily was a factor
of successful implementation. SPA was familiar with Bank procedures and policy requirements;
tIIus, no confusion in procurement procedures and compliance with legal covenants arose.
70. Continuity of staff played a role in the project's success as well. Both SPA and the Bank
maintained the same multidisciplinary teams.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TABLE 7: STUDIES INCLUDED IN PROJECT
Corporate Planning
1. The major objective of the study was to establish a corporate plannling process to assist the
senior management and other key individuals within SPA to introduce plans and strategies to: (a)
develop efficient and reliable port organization and improve the corporate image of SPA, (b)
promote the use of SPA facilities by shipping, cargo and other interests, and (c) maintain and
develop controls through management policies and objectives and monitoring of investments.
The study was undertaken by SPA with assistance from a corporate planning expert (an
international consultant). The report was satisfactorily completed. The Corporate Plan served as
reference in restructuring and development in the Port of Shanghai.
Bulk Fertilizer Operations
2. The objectives of the study were to: (a) identify current and future demands in the bulk
fertilizer operation in the Port of Shanghai, (b) determine the necessity to move the operation
from the city's center; and (c) review the feasibility of implementing the move. The study was
undertaken by the Shanghai Port Design Research Institute of SPA and was started in May 1996
after SPA confirmed that bulk fertilizer traffic was not increasing. In May 1997, the final report
proposed that bulk fertilizer operations should be moved from the city center in accordance with
the master plan of Shanghai city and port. The proposed location, Waigaoqiao, was considered
ideal for bulk fertilizer, and the shift of operations would be carried out in conjunction with
implementation of the urban development master plan of the city of Shanghai.
Dangerous Cargo Handling
3. The objectives of the study were to: (a) identify current and future trends of dangerous cargo
operations, (b) review the current methods of handling dangerous cargo, (c) define the possible
dangers and impacts on the environment at each handling point, and (d) devise a plan to handle
the dangerous goods operations in accordance with safety protection measures. The study was
undertaken by the Shanghai Port Design Research Institute of SPA. The study concluded that the
operational areas for dangerous cargo in Huangpu River should be removed or reduced in
accordance with the urban development master plan of the city and the master plan of the port. At
present, efforts should be made to allocate limited berths for dangerous cargo to facilitate
implementation of safety measures and monitoring of contamination.
Unitization of General Cargoes and Its Operation
4. The objective of the study was to unitize the break-bulk cargo to enhalnce operational
efficiency and reduce handling costs, specifically to: (a) identify ways of cargo unitization,
mainly container, (b) analyze handling efficiencies and vessel berthing times of unitized and non-
unitized operations, (c) encourage cargo unitization by owners of ships and cargo and by ports of
loading and (d) prepare an action plan to promote unitization over the entire port. The study was
undertaken by the Shanghai Port Design Research Institute of SPA. The objectives of the study
have been achieved, particularly in container operations, which in recent years saw annual
growth of 27 percent.

Port Tariff Restructuring
5. The objective of the study was to develop software for a cost-based port tariff structure to
reflect actua; costs. This was an extension of the PCMIS developed under the Bank-financed
Ningbo and Shanghai Port Project. The study was carried out by international and domestic
consultants with coordination by the Department of Water Transport of the Ministry of
Communication, which was responsible for national port tariffs. Software development and
installation, the hardware set-up, and user training were satisfactorily carried out in June 1999.

SHANGHAI PORT RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LN. 3552-CHA)
SUPERVISION MISSION, MAY 25-JUNE 2, 1999
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    A World Bank mission comprising Messrs. T. Tsutsumi and H.K. Yen visited Shanghai
Port from May 25 to June 2 to review project implementationi. This aide-memoire records the
discussions, understandings and agreements reached and recommendations made with SPA). The
recommendations of the mission, as incorporated in this aide-memoire, are subject to review and
confirmation by the Bank management. The mission expressed its gratitude for the cooperation
and courtesies extended by the officials of SPA. A list of key officials met by the mission is
attached in Annex 1.
2.     Progress of the Project. All contracts have been signed. All civil works and supply of
equipment have been completed. Technical assistance (studies), and training have substantially
been completed and the project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999, as originally
planned. The remaining payments and their expected completion date are as follows:

Tariff Study                                80,000          June 30, 1999
Total                                      469,000          June 30, 1999
3.     Waigaoqiao Management Information System (MIS). Hardware and all network have
been installed and software has been developed. Container operation system withiin MIS has been
operational since November 3, 1998, and now is under testing and verification stages. SPA
expects that the final acceptance will be completed by June 30, 1999.
4.     All commodity inspection equipment has been delivered to Port of Shanghai. Payment
will be completed by June 30, 1999.
5.     Tariff Study is progressing satisfactorily under the coordination of Ministry of
Communications (MOC). Training of responsible staff in SPA has been completed and software
development is being completed. The study is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999.
6.     Traffic Performance. The port traffic has been consistently decreasing since reaching its
highest record in 1993 (112.64 million tons). The average annlual rate of the decrease is 4.3%
between 1993 and 1998. In 1998, the port handled 90.54 million tons of cargoes slightly less
(0.82 million tons or 0.9%) than 91.36 million tons in 1997. The main reason for reduction of the



26                            SHANGHAI PORT RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
traffic was decrease in coal traffic (3.83 million tons of 15.5%), from 24.74 million tons in 1997
to 20.91 million tons in 1998. The decrease in coal is mainly due to the clhange of the energy
policy. The government is planning to further reduce the nation's coal production in 1999.
7.    In contrast to coal, the container traffic is growing very fast. The average growth rate
during the last five years (1993-98) was 26.7%. Despite the impact of financial crisis in East Asia
in 1998, container traffic still grew by 20.6% and has become the biggest single item of SPA
(30.6% of the total port traffic). It is expected that the growth would contilnue. Given the
government economic policy and the Shanghai regional development, it is also expected tlhat the
overall annual port traffic will stabilize around 90.0 million tons in coming years and grow
slowly thereafter.
8.    Financial Performance. The mission reviewed and discussed the port's 1998 financial
statements. A decrease in coal traffic has less impact on the financial condition, because SPA had
better control of its operating cost and the loss of coal revenue was almost totally absorbed by the
much profitable container handling. Inl998, the unit operating cost only increased by 0.5%
raising from 19.68 Yuan! ton in 1997 to 19.77 Yuan/ton in 1998, Despite 15.5% decrease in coal,
the unit revenue only reduced by 1.7% from 29.58 Yuan/ton in 1997 to 29.08 Yuan/ton in 1998.
Total operating profit for 1998 was 758 million Yuan (or only 7.2% less then 1997).
9.     The fast increases in surcharges (mainly administrative and financial charges) haseroded
all operating profits. Without the profit transfer from Shanglhai Container Terminal Ltd. (SCT)- a
joint venture company to SPA, SPA would have been facing the negative operational profits
After cash injection from SCT, the 1998 income statement of SPA showed a 34.0 million Yuan
net profit after tax. Although the final financial result of SPA in 1998 was still considered
acceptable, it is clearly revealed that the increase of surcharge costs were very hiigh. Between
1997 and 1998, surcharge costs were increased by 18.8% to 1.07 billion Yuan, including 220
million Yuan of financial costs which increased by 76%. The mission recommlaenided SPA to
access the reasons of increase and take necessary actions to control the growth of tlhis account.
10.   Auditor's Report. The mission requested, and SPA agreed, to submit an auditor's
financial report for 1998 to the Bank before June 30, 1999.
11.   Preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The mission discussed
with SPA technical, economic, financial and institutional aspects and collected additional
information. The mission provided to SPA an outline of the ICR. SPA has also provided
"Borrower's Contribution for the ICR". The agreed timetable for the preparation of the ICR is as
follows:
(a) SPA will provide comments for the outline of the ICR by Junle 30, 1999.
(b) Bank will send a draft ICR to SPA and MOC for comments by November 20, 1999.
(c) SPA, in combination with MOC, will send comments to the Bank by December 10, 1999.
(d) Bank will finalize the ICR and send to Secretary of the Board by December 31, 1999.
12.  SPA agreed to further cooperate in preparation of the ICR by providing additional
information to the Bank, if requested.

APPENDIX B: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
General Assessment
Shanghai Port Restructuring and Development Project (Loan 3552-CHA)
(Prepared by Shanghai Port Authority)
Portion I
I.     The World Bank's loan package of Shanghai Port Restructuring and Development
Project (3552-CHA) implemented by Port of Shanghai with total amount of 150 million U.S
dollars covers Phase I of Waigaoqiao, Phase I of Luojing Coal Terminal and procurement of
relevant equipment for pre-existing terminals. The loan is mostly for purchase of machines and
equipment with partly being for civil works. The acquisition of all items is tlhrough international
competitive bidding as directed by the World Bank with exception of small quantity of equipment
that were procured via domestic competitive bidding.
II.    Civil works of Phase I of Waigaoqiao was formally initiated on July 30, 1991, basically
completed by October 1993 and accepted by the State in October 1994. The works that proves
high quality was put into operation same year. 4 newly-constructed 10,000-Ton classification
berths created 2.4 million tons of handling capacity. The construction of civil works of Phase I of
Luojing Coal Terminal saw its inception on July 1, 1993, the works was basically completed by
December 30, 1996 and approved/accepted by the State on1 July 30, 1997. The works proves high
quality and was put into service same year. The creation of these two newly-built 10,000-ton
berths gets 10 million tons of additional capacity.
Aforesaid two terminals have acquired 6 pieces of new 10,000-ton classification berths,
suggesting 12.40 million tons of additional capacity.
Equipment procurement for pre-existing terminals began in June 1994 and was accomplished by
end of December 1995.
Procurement of associated equipment for these three Bank's financed projects was successfully
completed by end of December 1995 following initial international bidding in July 1993. Of all
398 sets/pieces including 275 sets/pieces obtained from worldwide bidding and 123 sets/pieces
from locally, 78 sets/pieces for Phase I of Waigaoqiao terminal, 16 sets/pieces for Luojing Coal
Terminal and 181 sets/pieces for pre-existing terminals were acquired though international
competitive bidding, plus another 123 sets/pieces for Phase I of Waigaoqiao terminal that were
obtained through the bidding locally.
III.    The project proves a rationalization in overall layout, handling technology and berth
structure design, plus reliable parameters of equipment with fairly high level of automation of its
handling technology. By and large, the project was successful with all targets having been
achieved and Port's throughput capacity substantially increased. Statistics show that 19.191
million tons of accumulated throughput were handled by end of 1998 since Phase I of
Waigaoqiao terminal was put into service, suggesting 3.19 million tons of yearly average growth.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Phase I of Luojing Coal Terminal has created 4.799 million tons of throughLput since end 1998
when Phase I was completed.
IV.    During the period of implementation of the pro ject, internationial bidding was adopted
into process of equipment procurement, making contribution to cut-down cost of individual
equipment and improvement of handling technology, plus a few techniicianis getting their training
courses. Thanks to newly-constructed berths together with added necessary equipment plus
handling capacity enlarged, the Port lhas eventually kept pace with the demands of ever
increasing transportation.
V.     The Project comprises 6 pieces of 10,000-ton classification berths (3 for general cargo, I
for container and 2 for coal handling ). These additional berths have contributed to enhancement
of integral capacity and functions, ideally stimulating increase of Port's throughput. By end of
1998 the whole Port witnessed 163.88 million tons of yearly througlhpLut.
VI.    The loan (3552-CHA) falls into 5 technical assistance items:
A.     Study on corporation planning. started in May 1993 and ended in July 1995, this study
was jointly undertaken by those retained professionals who were granited by the Bank. The
conclusive study report was submitted to the Bank in 1995.
B.     Study on relocation of bulk fertilize handling operation in Port of Shaniglhai. This one-
year long study (May 1996 to May 1997) was completed with submission of the report to the
Bank in 1997.
C.     Study on dangerous cargo in Port of Shanghai. Began in May 1996 and finished by July
1997, the report of this study was submitted to the Bank in 1997.
D.      Study on unitization of break-bulk cargo hanidlin1g and transport in Port of Shanghai.
This study (from March 1993 to January 1994) was concluLded with submission of relative report
to the Bank in 1994.
E.     Study on port tariff in Port of Shanghai. The participants for this study were from both
Water Transportation Department of MOC and Shanghai Port ALuthority with former being as
contact to the Bank. Shanghai Port Authority formally reached a workinig contract with Huazheng
Accountant Software Company of Ministry of Finance in September 1998 with the concurrence
of the Bank. This target has been basically achieved.
F.    All of above-listed technical assistance items have reflected the demand by the Bank in
its evaluation report. The Port could take this case as a reference to extend for future expansion
and development.
VII.   In the process of terminal construction and equipment procurement, we have paid
attention to both environmental and safety aspects. We have strictly followed associated rules and
regulations of the State by configuring environment protection measures into relevanit portions of
the Project, for instance sewage treatment, dust control instrumentation. Local environmental
protection agency felt fairly satisfactory over various criteria as result of inspection

VIII.   In order to exact international bidding procurement, Shanghai Port Authority has
desirably set up a dedicating agency of "Office of Bidding for World Bank Financed Equipment
Procurement " to reconcile procurement procedures. The staffs involving in thlis office ate
technical professionals from Shanghai Port Authority. Those people are fully aware of bidding
procedures of the Bank with a good command of English language and rich managerial
experience to ensure smooth implementation of the project under instrLuction of experts from the
Bank. They have also successfully implanted the practice of international bidding into domestic
process.
IX.    Design of botlh Phase I of Waigaoqiao and Luojing Coal Terminal is mainly undertaken
by local institutions, including No. 3 Navigational Design Institute, MOC and the like.
Construction units are determined through competitive bidding mostly from local market. By and
large, the design is successful and both design and construction units have made their
contributions to satisfactory implementation of the project.
X.     Bidding document for procurement of equipment is jointly prepared by both Shanghai
Port Autlhority and client. Some reliable advanced technologies that are locally acceptable have
been intentionally introduced into relevant technical specifications. Reality proves that the
bidding tasks are successful, and the process of equipment procurement is fully coherent with the
contents of evaluation report by the Bank, while the implementation is of contractual consistent
and associated equipment timely delivered.
XI.    June 30, 1999 is loan expiration as set forth in Bank's evaluation report, thanks to
emphases laid on this task by our leaders and to the efforts by specially set up dedicating
"Bidding Office", all items in the project have witnessed smoothly implemented, culminating in
successful closure of account before June 30, 1999.
XII.   Introduction of international bidding has played a contributory role to reducing unit price
of equipment, resulting in some saving at bases of 150 million U.S dollars that was originally
budgeted. With approval of the Bank, 25.74 million U.S dollars have been returned accordingly.
124.26 million U.S dollars are due to spend, the actual figure however is subject to the Bank
upon closure of account.

ANNEX 2: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. TRAFFIC
1.      In 1998, Shanghai port authority (SPA) handled 90.54 million tons of cargo, about 25
percent less than the SAR forecast of 121.1 million toins. The total cargo handled by the project
berths was also 22.2 percent less than the SAR's projectioni (83.13 million tons actualvs. 106.83
million tonls projection). Except for container traffic, all cargo traffic for the project berths,
including break bulk, coal and construction materials, was less than projected by the SAR. Coal
in particular decreased 9.6 percent annually between  1991 and 1998. The rapid increase in
container traffic (an average of 28.1 percent annually between 1991 and 1998) partially offset the
decrease in traffic from other project berths. In addition, the cargo hanidled by the project berths
in 1991 constituted 79.4 percent of total port traffic. In 1998, this ratio had increased to 91.8
percent, higher than the SAR's projection of 88.2 percent. It is clear that construction of the
project berths met port traffic demand.
2.       The detailed SPA traffic, including traffic on the project berths, shown in Table 2.1 is
summarized below.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
3.     Total port traffic has decreased since 1994. However, based on first quarter
performance, total port traffic is expected to increase to 95.0 million tolls in 1999, especially
given current Government economic policy (to boost annual economic growth by 8 percent).
B. SHIP TIME ANALYSIS
4.     Break Bulk Carriers: Comparing 1992 figures (without the project) with 1998 figures
(with the project), general cargo carriers spent an average of 3.49 days and 1.67 days,
respectively, in the port, of which waiting (nonproductive) time decreased from 1.80 days to 0.60
day. During the same period, the average working time per ship (productive time at berth) also
decreased from 1.43 days to 0.86 day because of improved hiandling efficiency (Table 2.2).
5.     Container Carriers: Despite the increase in container traffic (in tonnage) by an average
of 28.1 percent per year from 1992 to 1998, the average total per-slhip time spent in the port
decreased from 1.35 days to 0.56 day. The average time to unload (productive time) decreased
from 0.37 day to 0.22 day. The new equipment improved handling efficiency and maximized
equipment availability. The average per-ship nonproductive time attributable to the pcrt
decreased from 0.35 day to 0.01 day per ship, while the total number of container vessels calling
at the port increased five-fold. Thus, without the project, additional traffic would have lengthened
ship-waiting time.
6.     Coal Ships:   Coal traffic used to be the biggest single item lhandled by SPA. In 1991,
it constituted 43.2 percent of total freight traffic of the port. In 1998, coal was still the second-
largest cargo category-after container cargo-constituting 23.1 percent of total freight traffic of
the port. Any slight improvement in coal handling will mean large savings for cargo and ship
owners. Comparing 1992 with 1998, total nonproductive time at berth has improved from 0.15
day per ship to 0.14 day.
7.     To attract coal traffic, SPA provided an extra service to users, allowing tlhem to stockpile
coal. The separate stockpile operations require more time for handling. As a result, coal
productive time at berth increased from an average 0.40 day per ship in 1992 to 0.78 day in 1998.
8.     Construction materials ships: Ship time in port for construction materials ships
improved since 1992 because of investments in facilities to handle the traffic. The per-ship port
time continually improved during project implementation. The average stay in port is 0.37 days,
an improvement of 30 percent over the 0.54 day in 1992.
C. BERTH OPERATIONS
9.     Operating data for general cargo, container, coal and construction materials at the port
differ somewhat from the SAR estimates. Detailed operating data used for the econonmic
revaluation of each project berth are shown in Table 2.3, and are highlighted as follows:

economic prices (Table 2.4). Financial costs were converted to economic costs by shadow pricing
each berth's input categories. Conversion factors for each input category were based on estimate:3
determined in completed Bank studies.
11.    The overall conversion factor is 1.03, including general cargo for break bulks, coal berths
and construction-materials berths at 1 .03 and container berths at 1.04. The factors derived for thi
various cost items were applied to annual project expenditures to obtain the stream of project
economic costs (Table 2.5).
12.   In the [CR, shadow-pricing project costs elevated economic costs 16.4 percent over
financial costs. Total project economic costs are 18.3 percent less than the SAR estimate in
constant December 1999 prices. The comparisons are summarized below:

Economic Benefits
13.    To estimate the port traffic, SPA carried out a detailed market survey in 1998 to all twelve
major cargoes of the port. It is expected that the total port traffic would be I 00 m illion ton in 2000
or increase 5.1 % pa from 1998, of which, coal traffic may increase 5.6 % pa. Based on the first
four months actual performance in 1999, the total port traffic has increased by 14.9 % compared
with the same period of 1998 and coal also has increased by about 5 %. The long term traflic
projection (2000-2005) estimates that the annual growth of total port traffic would be 4.1 % pa. and
coal traffic would be 4.0 % pa. In addition, the fast increase in construction materials (sand, stone
and bricks) between 1998 and 2000 (25.6 % pa.) is resulting from the recent large infrastructure
projects taking place in Shanghai metropolitan area which generate transportationi demand. For the
long term forecast (2000-2005), the growth rate of constructioni materials is expected to be 4.0% pa.
14.    The economic analysis focused on the benefits derived from relieving port congestion.
Details of the traffic forecast are shown in Table 2.1. The project will yield quantifiable benefits in
the form of savings in cargo handling costs, ship time (both waiting time and operating time), and
cargo time (Table 2.6). In the case of coal handling and other equipment for rehabilitation berths,
large benefits will be obtained from reduced pollutioni but, unfortunately, these are not yet
quantifiable in monetary terms. Based on 1998 actual performance of the port, the total project

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
benefits is expected to be 1.05 billion Yuan and the distribution of the project benefits would be 47
percent for ship time savings, 45 percent for cargo handling cost savings and 8 percent for cargo
time savings.
15. Savings in Ship Time. These include reductions in ship timie waitilg for berths and working
at berths due to improved cargo handling. Estimates of savings in ship waiting time due to the
project are shown in Table 2.8. Ship costs used for the economic evaluation were at the low end
of the ship cost model developed by the Bank. The annualized ship resale value, plus operating
costs, was used to calculate project benefits. The annual resale value of ships was assumed to
reflect the present state of the shipping industry and gives a slightly lower returnl than the
annualized replacement value.
16.    Savings in Cargo Handling Cost. Savings are relatively small and are expected to
accrue from the direct cost of cargo handling in the new facilities as compared with the present
ones. Without the project, the only way to handle traffic in excess of berth capacity would be
through "lightening," but it is estimated these costs would be three to four thimes greater than
normal handling costs. Detailed estimates of handling cost savings are showni in Table 2.7.
Lightening was assumed for cargo tonnage exceeding 95 percent berth occupancy, at a cost three
times that of normal handling. Substantial savings in handling costs are expected after existing
berths are renovated and new berths are built. Savings in handling costs were converted to
economic benefits by shadow-pricing the main cost components of normal handling and
lightening. Conversion factors of 1.05 for berth handling and 1.1 for lighteninlg are used; these
factors were estimated in a previous Bank study.
17.    Savings in Cargo Time. Savings in ship cargo time also apply to the interest saved on
the value of the cargo. For domestic cargo, the marginal source of working capital would be loans
from the National Development Bank of China at an overall average I 0 percent interest rate. For
foreign cargo, the higher foreign exchange working capital needed would require more foreign
borrowing, and it is assumed that this would be at China's marginal cost of capital (approximately
12 percent).
18.   Total project benefits for the items presented above are presented by year in Table 2.8.
The major project benefit would be in ship time savings. These would accrue first to ship owners
and could be passed on to cargo owners. Only coal ships and construction material ships are
completely owned by the Chinese. As for other cargo, the vast majority of ships calling at the
port are either Chinese-owned (COSCO) or Chinese-operated; it is estimated that project benefits
for 80 percent of break bulk cargo and 65 percent of container cargo would accrue to China
directly.
E. OVERALL ECONOMIC REEVALUATION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
18.   Table 2.9 sets out the reevaluated economic internal rate of return (REIRR), net present
value (NPV) and sensitivity calculations for the entire project. The overall REIRR is 29.2
percent. Compared with SAR estimates (36.7 percent), the sensitivity of the project to variations
in costs and benefits is summarized as follows:

Notes:    (i) theoretical daily berth capacity = cranes per berth x average crane productivity per hour x average working hours per day.
(ii) theoretical annual berth capacity = theoretical daily berth capacity x herthi operating days per year.
(iii) maximum annual capacity per berth = theoretical annual berth capacity x maxilmlulm berth utilization.
/_1. For lighterinig operation, throughput capacity is taken as 50% of normal berth thiouglpLut capacity.
/ 2. Figures in the table are the costs for normal berth handling. If cargo traffic exceeds 95% berth occupancy rate, additional cargo will be
Handled by lightering at roughly three times the costs for normal berth handliln.
i_3. Equivalent to 14,300 dwt (1,000 teu) and 21,500 dwt (1,500 teu) per ship.
/_4. Seven berths share the total of six cranes, one teu n  10.0 ton.
/_5. Seven berths share the total of ten cranes.
/_6: Starting July 1998, two break bulk berths and one constr-Lction  material berth have been converted into two containier berths.

Notes:    (i) annual ship berth days required  traffic/theoretical daily capacity per berth.
(ii) annual ship berth days available = number of berths x berth operating days per year.
(iii) berth occupancy rate = annual ship berth days required / annual ship berth days available.
(iv) waiting time queuing factors are from Port Development, UNCTAD 1978. and Berth throughput, UNCTAD. 1978.
(v) annual ship waiting days = annual ship berth required x waiting time queuilg factors.
/_1. Includes foreign (in/out), loaded and empty containers.
/F2. Traffic would exceed the practical capacity of these berths. For the purpose of the economic evaluation it has been
Assumed that ways will be found, e.g., through lightering, to move the traffic through the port with waiting times
not exceeding those corresponding to 95% berth occupancy rate.
