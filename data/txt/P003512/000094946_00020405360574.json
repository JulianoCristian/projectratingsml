Significant\n            changes occurred in China's port sector since 1982,\n            when major port authorities were decentralized, and joint\n            venture container-terminal operations, first started with\n            foreign operators in Shanghai, and other neighboring ports,\n            creating competition. There is now an awareness of the vital\n            role of the port as a link with rails, and roads, thus\n            policy coordination, at the central government level, needs\n            to be strengthened to improve Shanghai's multi-modal\n            transport efficiency. The key lessons convey that, given the\n            competitiveness environment created thus far, further Bank\n            assistance is worth considering for port sub-sector\n            activities, since evidence suggests that the Shanghai Port\n            Authority (SPA) performance at the Waigaoqiao terminal, was\n            indeed better than the Shanghai Container Terminal,\n            indicative that the compatibility existing between public\n            sector performance, and that of joint ventures, is at par.\n            It is worth noting that, the SPA's experience, and\n            familiarity with Bank operations, greatly contributed to\n            this successful implementation, easing the way in\n            procurement procedures, and compliance with legal covenants.\n            Furthermore, staff continuity proved successful as well,\n            where a multi-disciplinary team was maintained."}, "docdt": "2000-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
