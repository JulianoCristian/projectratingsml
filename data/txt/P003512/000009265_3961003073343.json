The project will consist of: (1)\n            formulation and implementation of an action plan for\n            restructuring the existing port facilities on the Huangpu\n            river to rationalize their use and move cargo operations\n            away from the city center, (2) provision of new and\n            replacement cargo handling equipment for existing terminals,\n            (3) measures to improve the Port Authority's financial\n            condition through tariff restructuring and other measures,\n            (4) construction of new terminals at Waigaoqiao and Luojing\n            on the Yangtze river, and installation of the necessary\n            cargo handling equipment, and (5) technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1992-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
