Project and\n            program-related Lessons outline inter-agency cooperation at\n            border cross points, where a cooperative culture should be\n            encouraged and promoted top down by the management of\n            regulatory agencies, making changes in procedures at border\n            crossing points as needed in the future. It is suggested\n            that frequent rotation of staff in the Customs Directorate\n            be avoided, to ensure smooth project implementation, and\n            that Customs control remain under efficient selective\n            procedure. Bank-related Lessons suggest focusing not only on\n            trade facilitation, but on legitimate security requirements,\n            and anti-terrorism aspects, such as a container security\n            code for scanning of cargoes. Further, the Bank should\n            recognize that, when the project involves several innovative\n            reforms, it is expected to have higher risks, but higher\n            rewards as well. Main characteristics of the project were\n            that it was result oriented, with measurable indicators, a\n            unique quality and a major factor which contributed to the\n            success of the project, as well as policy dialogues and\n            cooperation among several border agencies, which deepened\n            the project success. In addition, the regional approach,\n            better results are achieved as opposed to a stand-alone\n            project, for it creates peer pressure among the\n            participating countries, in turn, generates competitiveness\n            and motivation for improved performance. Finally, the\n            contribution of the United States as a parallel financier\n            contributed to the success of the project: the USAID Grant\n            was instrumental in improving public-private partnership,\n            especially in light of the Government's reluctancy to\n            borrow for technical assistance to the private sector."}, "docdt": "2005-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
