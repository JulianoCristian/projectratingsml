The project generated momentum, and most of\n            the reconstruction program was timely completed.\n            Additionally, economic activities and delivery of services,\n            were restored, and public awareness of disaster preparedness\n            has deepened. The lessons learned provide valuable insights\n            for emergency lending operations, as follows: 1) Future\n            emergency lending operations need to address an adequate\n            balance, between the actual emergency needs, and the desire\n            to attain mitigation measures for future emergencies.\n            Similarly, the ability of a participatory management, with\n            ad hoc resources to mobilize, as well as local\n            participation, should not be compared to the management\n            ability of the central Government, which is a permanent\n            structure. 2) The General Reconstruction Guidelines for\n            earthquake reconstruction should be considered a living\n            document, updated frequently, and, featuring the latest\n            applied earth science, essential for disaster preparedness.\n            3) An innovative outcome of the project, suggests the use of\n            bamboo for construction of seismic resistant structures;\n            preliminary studies suggest its economic feasibility is\n            worth researching. 4) Based on the project's\n            experience, efficiency and sustainability wise, the Bank may\n            wish to design appropriate responses for improving\n            contracting industries' performance."}, "docdt": "1999-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
