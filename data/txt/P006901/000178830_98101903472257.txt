COSTA RICA
APPRAISAL OF POWER AND TELECOIMMUNICATION PROJECTS
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Costa Rica has asked the Bank to consider the
financing of the foreign exchange cost of a power and a telecommunication
project.  Both would be carried out by Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (ICE), a fully Government-owned corporation.
ii.       The Bank made a loan of $8.8 million to ICE in 1961 to finance the
foreign exchange cost of the 30 MW Rio Macho hydroelectric plant and other
system extensions. The work has progressed satisfactorily and should be
completed during 1963.
iii.      The new power project includes the construction of the 70 MW Cachi
hydroelectric plant, associated transmission facilities and other extensions
to ICE's existing power system. The telecommunication project includes the
installation of automatic exchange equipment for 26,000 telephone lines,
cable and line networks and radio equipment for interurban connections.
The total cost of the two projects is estimated at about $36 million
equivalent. The proposed loan would amount to $22 million.
iv.       ICE is well managed and operated and it has an efficient and
experienced staff. Satisfactory arrangements are planned for the execution
and operation of the projects.
v.        The projects are technically sound and required to meet the
reasonably estimated increase in power demand and to provide the country
with the first stage of a modern and efficient telecommunication system.
vi.       The financial results of ICEts power operations have shown a
marked improvement in recent years. Additional rate increases are being
implemented by ICE to assure that by 1964 the return on net fixed assets in
operation would reach the level of 7.5% agreed upon at the time the previous
Bank loan was made. ICE will establish and maintain telephone tariffs on
a level sufficient to produce a satisfactory level of earnings.
vii.      The financing plan prepared by ICE for the financing of the
proposed expansion programs is adequate and the financial forecasts show
that the company should be able to maintain a sound financial position.
viii.     The two projects are recommended as a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of $22 million. Taking into account the different type of the two
projects, a term of 23 years, including four years of grace, is proposed.



COSTA RICA
APPRAISAL OF POWER AND TELECOM1iUNICATION PROJECTS
INTRODUCTION
1.        The Goverrment of Costa Rica has asked the Bank to consider the
financing of the foreign exchange costs of two projects, the Cachi hydro-
electric plant with associated transmission facilities and a telecommunication
system. Both projects would be carried out by Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (ICE), and a single loan of $22 million is therefore proposed
representing 61% of the total estimated cost of $36 million equivalent.
2.        The past activities of ICE have been limited to power operations.
In order to take advantage of the Company's experience in utility operations,
the Government has now also entrusted it with the responsibility of providing
telecommunication services. The proposed project would be ICE's initial
effort in this field.
3.        Because of the different technical nature of the two projects and
of the fact that the consideration of the power project and ICE's power
operations could be based on extensive information on the Company's past pe;-
formance while no similar data are available for telecommunications, it was
found appropriate in this report to appraise the two projects separately.
Consolidated financial forecasts have been prepared to provide a basis for
the discussion of the estimated results of the combined operations. This
discussion and conclusions are presented at the end of the report.
4.        The report is based on comprehensive feasibility studies prepared
by ICE, supplemented by information obtained by a Bank mission which visited
Costa Rica in February 1963.
THE BORROWER
5.        ICE is a fully Government-owned statutory corporation.  It was
established in April 1949 to plan and carry out a coordinated program of
electrification of the country. The law establishing ICE defines it as an
autonomous organization which shall carry out its activities completely
independent of the Government except for the approval of rates.
6.        By a decree dated March 31, 1958, ICE was given the responsibility
of providing telecommunication services in Costa Rica. For financial and
political reasons, the construction program prepared at that time had to be
postponed and the planning was only resumed in 1962.



-2-
Organization and Management
7.        The Board of Directors of ICE consists of seven members  appointed
by the President of the ReDublic. They serve staggered eight years' terms.
According to the law, at least three members must be engineers, one a
lawyer, one an economist and the last two must have recognized experience in
the fields of finance, industry or agriculture. The members are eligible for
re-appointment and four of the present members have served more than one term.
8.        The Chief Executive officer of ICE is the General Manager who is
appointed by the Board. This applies also to the Deputy Manager, the Treasurer
and the Chief Auditor. All other officers are selected and appointed by the
General Manager. ICE is well managed and operated; it has an efficient and
experienced staff and, with the assistance of its present consultants, is
fully qualified to assume responsibility for the execution and operation of the
proposed power project. For the execution and operation of the telecommuni-
cation project, some reinforcement of the present staff is being planned
(see paragraph 97).
Financial Position
9.        At the time the first Bank loan was made to ICE, its financial
position was unsatisfactory. W4ith the increases in power rates introduced
between 1959 and 1962, and averaging 33% for wholesale rates and 40% for
retail rates, a substantial improvement has been made. Further increases are
scheduled and have been approved by the Government regulating authority, to
assure that a 7.5% return on investment would be achieved and maintained. A
return of this magnitude was agreed upon at the time the previous Bank loan
was made.
PART A
CACHI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I.  INTRODUCTION
10.       In January 1961 the Bank made a loan of $8.8 million to finance
the construction of the 30 MW Rio Macho hydroelectric plant, an 8 MW expansion
of the Colima diesel electric plant and associated expansion of the power
system operated by Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE). In
February 1963 the work on ttnis construction program was well advanced. The
Colima diesel units were put in operation in 1962 and the two units of the
Rio Macho plant should be in operation in June and October, 1963, respec-
tively. This is about two months later than originally planned.
11.       To meet the increasing demand for electric power, ICE has prepared
a new construction program which includes the construction of the 56 MW Cacni
hydroelectric plant and further expansion of the transmission system. The
total cost of this program is estimated at ¢154.3 million ($23.3 million) of
which $12.5 million would be required in foreign exchange. The Bank has been
asked to finance this amount.

II. ELECTRIC POWER INqDUSTRY
12.       The electric power industry in Costa Rica is regulated by the
National Service Law enacted in 1941. The law is administered by Servicio
Nacional de Electricidad (SNE), the regulating authority, which awards
franchises for production and distribution of electric energy, subject to
the approval of the Congress, and is responsible for the appraisal and
regulation of rates and service standards. Decisions on rates are subject
to Government approval.
13.       The rate provisions of the Electric Service Law are not specific.
They state that electricity rates shall be computed to provide revenues
sufficient to cover the cost of the service including a fair compensation
for the use of capital, With respect to ICE, SNE has authorized rate in-
creases to achieve and maintain a return on investment of 7.5%.
14.       The bulk of the electric power production and supply in Costa Rica
is concentrated in the Central Zone.  This area, which covers some 1,500
square miles, extends in an east-west direction across the central part of
the country (see -nap attached).
15.       Almost two-thirds of the population live in this area;  it accou,xts
for 95% of both coffee and sugar cane production, 93% of total industrial
production and includes all main towns including the capital, San Jose.
16.       The principal public utilities supplying power in this area are
ICE and Compania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL). An integrated transmission
system connects the generating plants of the two companies. To this system,
which extends from Puntarenas on the Pacific to Turrialba on the Atlantic
slopes, are also connected additional small plants belonging to a number of
municipal and private enterprises.
17.       The total generating capacity of the Central Zone system in the
beginning of 1963 amounted to 99.1 WiZ (67.1 MW hydro and 32 MW thermal
capacity).
18.       Outside of the Central Zone the main towns are served by isolated
plants, either hydro or diesel installations. Most of these small plants art
operated by municipal or private companies and very limited information is
available about their operations. Due to financial and technical difficulties
of a few of these companies, ICE has in recent years assumed managerial
responsibilities.
ICE
19.       ICE sells primarily power wholesale to other utilities for dis-
tribution. In some towns in the Central Zone and, in particular, in other
parts of the country where no distribution companies are at present operating,
ICE is also responsible for distribution. In 1962, about 235a of the total
sales was retail. As a general policy, however, ICE tries to encourage the
organization of local municipal or rural distribution companies.



- 4 -
20.      In the Central Zone, ICE's generating facilities include the 30 MW
La Garita hydro plant and the Colima diesel plant with a total capacity of
20 MW1. The 30 MW Rio Macho hydro plant is scheduled to come into operation
in 1963.
21.      ICE is responsible for the dispatching in the integrated Central
Zone system, controlling the operation of both its own plants and the plants
belonging to other utilities, to ensure the most economic utilization of
system generating capacity.
22.      Outside of the Central Zone, ICE operates two small hydro and three
diesel plants with a total capacity of 3 MW.
C_FL
23.      CNFL is a subsidiary of American and Foreign Power.  The company was
established in 1928 and supplies energy to consumers in San Jose and the
surrounding area. Its present concession expires in 1966. It seems likely
that the Government ultimately will purchase the CNFL installations but no
serious discussions or negotiations have yet taken place.
24.      CNFL operates six hydro plants with a combined capacity of 29 MW
and one thermal plant with a capacity of 12 MW. In 1962, the company pur-
chased from ICE about 55% of total energy required.
Other Utilities
25.      Two municipal companies serve the towns of Heredia and Alajuela.
They operate three small hydro plants with a combined capacity of 3 MW but
the bulk of their energy requirements are met by ICE.
26.      A private company, Alfonso Madriz, operates two small hydro plants
with a combined capacity of 3.9 MW.  The total output is sold to ICE.
Finally, the iMiller Company, also privately owned, distributes power in the
small town of Tres Rios and the surrounding rural area. It operates three
small hydro plants with a coabined capacity of 0.75 MW and in addition buys
power from both CNFL and ICE.
Power Resources
27.      Costa Rica has substantial hydro resources;  preliminary estimates
by ICE indicate that a capacity of 1500 MW could be developed economically.
A large part of this potential is located in the Central Zone, close to the
main load centers. ICE, in cooperation with other Government institutions,
has in recent years increased considerably the number of rain and stream
flow gauging stations, to provide the data required for the preparation of a
comprehensive plan of development.
28.      Costa Rica has a distinct dry season lasting through the months of
January, February and March, during which the stream flows reach a minimum.
Unless seasonal regulation is provided, the firm capacity of the hydro plants
depends on the dry season flow. The detailed investigations carried out by



- 5 -
ICE have been concentrated on the two main rivers, Rio Grande de Tarcoles,
which flows to the Pacific, and Rio Reventazon, which flows to the Atlantic,
and their tributaries. The Reventazon, which is the most important, has an
estimated potential of 467 W.
29.      In its planning of future expansion, ICE concentrates on the
development of the most attractive sites which can provide firm energy at
the lowest cost. The plants, are, however, designed to permit later extensions
for installation of peaking capacity. This capacity would require to be
supplemented by thermal capacity to insure a firm supply during the dry
season, but this stage in the development is not expected to be reached for
a considerable period.
III. POWER MARKET
30.      As already mentioned, practically the total consumption of power
in Costa Rica is concentrated in the Central Zone served by the inter-
connected system and the consideration of the power market will therefore
be limited to this area.
Past Sales
31      Total sales in 1962 amounted to 381.5 million kwh.  Based on the
estimated population of 792,000, the average consumption per inhabitant
amounts to 482 kwh. During the period 1956 to 1962 the average annual in-
crease in consumption was 8.8%.
32.      The present power market is characterized by a high proportion of
residential sales. Their share of total sales has however decreased slowly
over the last six years, but was still 71.3% in 1962. Commercial and in-
dustrial sales amounted to 14.2% and 10.8% respectively and the balance of
3.7% represented sales to Government institutions and miscellaneous other
consumers.
Future Sales
33.      The estimate, prepared by ICE, of future sales for the next eight
years is based on detailed records and information obtained from all the
po:-er utilities operating in the Central Zone. For residential and commercial
sales a continuation of past trends has been assumed but with a gradual de-
crease in the rate of growth. Special allowance was made to take into account
the loads of a number of small towns in the area towards the Pacific, to be
connected to the integrated system in 1963.
34.      The forecast of industrial sales takes into account the consumption
of two new industrial plants now under construction, a fertilizer plant
scheduled to start operation in April 1963 and a cement plant to come into
operation in the Spring of 1964. Plans are under study for the construction
of a pulp and paper mill based on bagasse and of an oil refinery. These
possible loads were included in the original ICE estimates, but since no
decisions have been taken about the construction of these plants, the estimates
have been revised to exclude them.



-6-
35.       Included in the forecasts, however, are the loads of a substantial
number of small industrial plants which are being constructed as the results
of the Government's active policy of encouraging industrial development.
These plants will produce a wide variety of products including processed food,
leather goods, lumber and wood products, textiles, glassware, small appliances
and many others. Some twenty plants came into operation in 1962 and an even
higher number should start operation during 1963.
36.       While the estimated increase of industrial sales from 41.2 million
kwh in 1962 to 135.5 million kwh in 1966 appears high, it is based on a
detailed evaluation of the loads of industrial plants already in operation,
in construction or for which firm arrangements have been made for construction.
37.       Total sales are estimated to increase from 381.5 million kwh in
1962 to 547.2 million kwh in 1965 and 751.4 million kwh in 1970. This
corresponds to an average increase of some 12.5% annually for the first three
years and about 7% for the following five years. As a result of the sub-
stantial increase in industrial sales, their proportion of total sales is
expected to increase from the present 10.8% to 23.9% by 1970 and the pro-
portion of residential sales will decrease correspondingly from 71.3% to
61.3%. (Details of the forecast are given in Annex 1).
ICE Sales
38.       ICE power sales have increased rapidly from 42.8 million kwh in
1956 to 269 million kwh in 1962. About 77% of the total in 1962 was bulk
sales to other companies. The most important of these is CNFL which accounted
for 75% of ICE's bulk sales.
39.       ICE's retail sales were 61.4 million kwh in 1962 and are mostly
limited to small towns. Of total retail sales in 1962 about 17% were in
towns outside the Central Zone, the two most important are Limon on the
Atlantic coast and Liberia in the province of Guanacaste.
40.       The forecast of ICE's sales are based on the estimates made for
the Central Zone system. Because the other operating companies have no plans
for adding generating capacity, the total increase in consumption will have
to be met by ICE. Its sales will therefore continue to increase at a rapid
rate averaging nearly 17% for the next four years but are then expected to
taper off to a more moderate rate of about 7% annually. The bulk sales will
account for most of the increase, but even retail sales are expected to in-
crease at a high rate during the next two years because service is being ex-
tended to a number of towns not previously served and in addition ICE is at
present carrying out a program of extensions and reconstruction of its dis-
tribution systems.
41.       The forecasts of ICE's sales are realistic and form a reasonable
basis for estimating its future revenues (for details see Annex 2).
Forecast of Load Growth
42.       The peak load in the Central Zone power system is estimated to
increase from 1]845 MW in 1963 to 202_1 MW in 1970. This estimate is based
on the sales forecasts given in paragraph 37 and on the assumption that



- 7 -
system losses and the system load factor would remain at their present levels
of about 17% and 0.50 respectively.  (For details see Annex 3).
43.       A graph showing the estimated peak load in relation to system
capacity is shown in Annex 4. It can be seen that system demand exceeded
capacity in 1960 and 1961. During the wet season, lasting from April through
December, ample water is available to operate the units of the Garita hydro
plants on maximum overload capacity giving an additional 6 MW but during the
first three months of 1961 some load reductions were necessary. This situ-
ation occurred again in the beginning of 1963.
44.       With the two units of the Rio Macho plant, which will come into
operation during 1963, sufficient capacity is available until the end of
1964. During the dry period in the beginning of 1965 the shortage is
expected to re&zh 5 - 6 MW, and some curtailment of load will be necessary.
During the following months the overload capacity available both in the
Garita and the Rio Macho plants should be sufficient to help meet the demand
until the first unit of the Cachi plant comes into operation towards the end
of 1965. To preserve some reasonable reserve capacity in the system, it
will be necessary to plan for further additions of generating capacity before
the end of 1968.
45.       In the isolated system of Limon, now served by an 0.8 MI hydro
plant and a 1.9 MW diesel plant, the 1962 peak load was 2.3 M4W. An additioral
0o5 MW diesel unit is being installed in 1963, To meet future load growth
ICE is planning to interconnect this system with the Central Zone by 1966.
At the same time, two additional small towns in the area will be provided
Twith service.
IV. THE PROJECT
46.       The project submitted for Bank financing includes the Cachi hydro
plant with a capacity of 56 MW, associated transmission lines to connect
the plant with San Jose and other extensions to the transmission system
operated by ICE.
Cachi Plant
47.       The main works consist of a thin arch dam, 54 meters high and 80
meters along the crest, located on the Reventazon river near the town of
Cachi, intake works, a 5,942 meter long pressure tunnel, a surge tank, a 566
meter long penstock including a 116 meter long section of steel-lined tunnel
and a power house.
48.       The Cachi reservoir will have a capacity of 10.5 million cubic
meters. The Reventazon above the dam site carries a substantial bedload in
the form of gravel and sand. To prevent accumulation in the reservoir one
of the two tunnels constructed to divert water during construction will be
concrete-lined and equipped with gates. During the rainy season water will.
be released through this tunnel which will have a capacity of 600 cubic
meters/sec. The reservoir will be maintained at its minimum level of 945
meters above sea level and the plant will in effect be operated as a run-Oc.-



- 8 -
the-river installation. In December, the reservoir will be filled to its
maximum level of 970 meters, assuring a firm stream flow of 18.0 cubic
meters/sec. during the three dry months.
49.       The power house will be equipped with two vertical type Francis
turbines designed to operate under a head varying between a maximum of
246 meters and a minimum of 221 meters. The generators will have a nominal
capacity of 28 NF each, but designed to produce 35 MW each when operated on
rmaximum overload. (For detailed description see Annex 5).
Associated Transmission System
50.       These works consist of the Cachi plant step-up substation equipped
with two 40 MVA, three-phase transformers, 14 km of 138 kv, double circuit
transmission lines connecting Cachi with the Rio Macho plant, installation
of the second circuit of the existing Rio Macho-Colima 138 kv line and ex-
tensions to the existing substations at Rio Macho and Colima.
Other System Extensions
51.       These works include the construction of 184.5 km of 33 kv trans-
mission lines, 96 km of 138 kv lines, two 138/33 kv substations and expansion
of nine 33 kv switching stations.  Finally, a 300 kw diesel unit will be in-
stalled to serve Liberia in the Guanacaste province.
Design and Engineering
52.       The project has been planned and designed by ICE, which also will
be responsible for the execution. To advise on engineering and construction,
ICE retains the services of Dr. Miguel Quinones, consulting engineer of
Puerto Rico. For the design of the arch dam, and for supervision of con-
struction, ICE has, in addition, retained the services of the Portuguese
consultant, Dr. Laginha Serafim. His preliminary report, based on extensive
explorations of the geological features on the site, confirms the favorable
condition for the construction of an arch dam. Additional tests and model
studies are now being carried out to provide the data necessary for the de-
tailed design. Because this is not expected to be completed by the time the
proposed loan is made, ICE has undertaken not to start any concrete work on
the dam before the plans have been reviewed by the Bank.
Status of the Project and Schedule of Construction
53.       Construction of the Cachi plant was started early in 1962. Con-
struction facilities,access roads and other preliminary works have largely
been completed. The twin tunnels for diverting the river at the dam site
have been excavated and work on the main pressure tunnel has been started.
Following its usual practice, ICE is carrying out most of the civil works with
its own forces.
54.       The initial operation of the plant depends now mainly on the delivery
terms which can be obtained for the main pieces of equipment.



- 9 -
Assuming that the orders can be placed in August 1963, the first unit could
be scheduled for initial operation in July 1965 and the second one by the
end of 1965. For initial operation, the cofferdam will be used as diversion
dam, because the arch dam is only scheduled for completion at the end of 1965.
55.       The expansion of the transmission system will be carried out con-
tinuously over the 1963-1966 period. The construction schedules planned by
ICE are tight but can be realized.
Procurement
56.       Orders for all equipment and materials required for the project
are being placed by ICE on the basis of international competitive bidding.
Initial orders have been reviewed by the Bank.
Estimated Cost
57.       The estimated costs of the principal features of the project are
(for details see Annex 6):
Foreign     Local             Total Costs
Exchange    Costs            Expressed in
$ millions  $ millions  $ millions  0 millions
Cachi hydro plant                  6.75       37.1        12.3         81.7
Associated transmission system     1.31        3.6          1.9        12.3

Contingencies                      1.24       10.1          2.8       18.3
Sub-totals                   11.38        71.7        22.2       146.9 2/
Interest during Construction       1.12        -           1.1          7.4
Totals                       12.50       71.7        23.3       154.3
58.       The costs of civil engineering works are based on detailed estimates
of quantities and unit costs experienced by ICE in the construction of the
Rio Macho plant, adjusted to the level of material prices and wages at the
end of 1962. Equipment costs are based on recent quotations obtained from
suppliers in several countries. The estimate includes the costs of land and
rights of way, labor and social benefits, freight and insurance charges and
allowances for engineering, supervision, overhead and administration.   ICE
is exempted from paying duties on equipment and materials required for the
project.
59.       To provide for unforeseen construction expenditures and possible
increases in labor and material costs during construction, allowances of
20% on civil works and 12.5% on equipment have been added to the estimates.
Based on the experience with the Rio Macho project, these allowances are
reasonable. The project cost estimates are realistic.
1/ This amount includes about 015.7 million of expenditures incurred in
1961 and 1962.



- 10 -
60.       The cost of the Cachi plant alone, including overhead, engineering,
contingencies and interest during construction amounts to $17.4 million
equivalent. Based on the firm capacity of 56 MW, unit costs will amount to
$310/kw. As explained earlier, to take advantage of ample water available
during nine months of the year, the units are being designed to operate on
overload. Using the maximum capacity of 70 MW, unit costs would amount to
$250/kw. These unit costs are low for a hydro development of this type.
61.       The cost of energy generated in the Cachi plant and delivered at
substation in San Jose is estimated at 5.1 centavos per kwh (7.8 U.S. millsl
kwh). The estimate is based on actual operating costs of La Garita hydro
plant and includes reasonable allowance for depreciation and a return of 7.5%
on the capital investment. This energy cost is about 30% lower than that
estimated for the Rio Macho plant.
Alternative Generating Plant
62.       ICE has investigated several alternative hydro developments but
the Cachi plant as now proposed was found to be the most suitable and could
provide the new capacity needed at the lowest cost.
63.       At the time the Bank appraised the Rio Macho project, this plant
was compared with a possible alternative thermal plant installation. The
return on the additional investment required for the hydro plant was
estimated at 13%.  Since the capital cost of the Cachi scheme is about 25%
lower than that of the Rio Macho plant, a thermal plant alternative need not
be considered.
V. ICE EXPANSION PROGRAM 1963-1970
64.       In addition to the project now considered for Bank financing, ICE
has also made tentative plans for further expansion of its system up to 1970.
To provide the new generating capacity required in 1968, construction work
on a plant with a capacity of about 60 MW is expected to be started in 1966.
Allowance has also been made for the construction of an additional plant to
be started in 1969 and commissioned in 1972.
65.       A substantial expansion of ICE's distribution facilities is
currently underway. This program is partly financed by a loan from IDB and
should be completed in 1965. Finally, ICE carries out a number of minor
expansion and iim'provement works.  The total costs of the works outside the
proposed Bank financed project are estimated as follows (exclusive of
interest during construction):

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
66.       The accounts of ICE are audited annually by a local firm of
certified public accountants. The accounting records of ICE are kept on a
calendar year basis.
Tariffs
67.       ICE's wholesale and retail power rates are established in accord-
ance with the provisions of the National Electric Service Law. These state
that the rates shall reflect as closely as possible the cost of the services,
defining cost to include all operating and administration costs, depreciation
calculated on a straight-line basis plus a fair return on net assets in
operation. The lawi is implemented by Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (SNE).
68.       At the time the previous Bank loan was made, the Government and
SNE agreed to permit ICE to increase gradually both its wholesale and retail
rates, so as to achieve a return on net assets in operation of 7.5% by 1964,
the first year of operation of the Rio Macho plant.
69.       The agreed program of monthly adjustments of the rates has been
followed by ICE and as a result the average wholesale rate was raised by 20%
and the average retail rate by 9% from 1961 to 1962. Following the same pro-
gram further adjustments are being made in 1963 to result in average in-
creases of 6% and 15% respectively. The financial forecasts prepared for
this appraisal (see paragraph 88 below) show that with these scheduled in-
creases the estimated return would not quite reach the 7.5% level in 1964.
To achieve this, an additional 2% increase of total revenues might be
necessary. To maintain the return on the agreed level, ICE has already
scheduled an increase of its average wholesale rate of 10% in 1965 and of its
average retail rate of 4.5% in each of the years 1964., 1965 and 1966. These
increases have also been authorized by SNE.

Present Financial Position
70.       ICE was established in 1949 but commenced operations only in 1953.
Condensed balance sheets for the last three years are shown in Annex 7*
71.       On December 31, 1962, the total invested capital was 0241.4 million
($36.5 million) consisting of /87.3 million ($13.2 million) of long-term debt
and ¢154.1 million ($23.3 million) of equity, the debt/equity ratio being
36/64. Details of the long-term debt are shown in Annex 8.
72.       Equity consisted of ¢140.3 million ($21.2 million) representing
Government contributions and subscribers connection fees and ¢13.8 million
($2.1 million) representing accumulated surplus. No dividends are paid on
the equity.
73.       Fixed assets in operation amounted to 131.6 million ($19.9 million)
after depreciation, and the construction work-in-progress amounted to ¢82.9
million ($12.5 million). The fixed assets in operation are recorded at
original cost. On September 3, 1961, the colon was devalued by 20% from
/5.615 to ¢6.625 per $1.00. At this time an adjustment was made to the value
of the construction work-in-progress to offset the increase of the outstand-
ing foreign debt.
74.       The current position of ICE is satisfactory.  The working capital,
representing current assets after deduction of current liabilities, amounted
to 026.9 million ($4.1 million).
Past Earnings Record
75.       During the early years of operation ICE's revenues from power sales
were insufficient to cover operating expenses. Starting in 1958, as a
result of increasing bulk sales and more realistic rates, a small net profit
was achieved. During the last three years net income, after interest,
increased from ¢3.9 million in 1960 to ¢8.3 million in 1962. This increase
reflects the higher power rates and resulted in a corresponding increase in
the return on net fixed assets in operation from 3.8% in 1960 to 5% in 1961
and 7.4% in 1962. Income statements for the period 1960 to 1962 are given
in Annex 9.
Financial Plan
76.       An eight year forecast of Sources and Application of Funds is
given in Annex 10. Total construction expenditures during the period
1963-1970 are estimated at ¢370.7 million ($56 million). A breakdown of
capital requirements and the expected sources of funds is as follows:

77.       During the construction period 1963-1966, net internx.l cash generati>i
would represent 28% of total requirements. During the total period con-
sidered (1963-1970), this share would increase to 47.%. The existing and
proposed Bank loans would represent 50% of the funds required during the
initial period and 26% during the total period.



- 14 -
78.       If the above program is carried out as planned, ICE's net fixed
assets in operation at the end of 1970 would be valued at %454.8 million ($68e7
million), more than three times their value at the end of 1962.
79.       The Government equity contribution to ICE would consist of three
annual payments of %6 million each in 1963, 1964 and 1965. These would be
paid out of the profits of "Fabrica Nacional de Licores"1, a Government
monopoly, according to provision of a law passed in 1959. While the law
does not specify any time limit, it is expected that the contributions would
be suspended after 1965. Customer connection fees are estimated to provide
equity contributions of 02.1 million during 1963-1966 and 02 million during
1966-1970.
80.       The previous Bank loan of $8.8 million was made in 1961. The un-
disbursed balance of about $2 million is expected to be withdrawn during 1963
with the completion of the Rio Macho project. The loan carries an interest
rate of 5-3/4% and is for a term of 25 years including a three years' period
of grace. The first amortization payment is due on may 1, 1964.
81.       Of the proposed new Bank loan, $12.5 million would finance the
estirnated foreign exchange requirements of the Cachi project and associated
works, including interest charges during the construction period. For the
purpose of calculations, an interest rate of 5-1/2% and a term of 23 years,
including a grace period of four years, have been assumed.
82.       To cover the foreign exchange requirement of tentative future con-
struction work an additional foreign loan of about $8.5 million has been
assumed to be obtained in 1967. The same interest rate and terms have been
assumed as for the proposed Bank loan.
83.       ICE obtained from IDB in 1962 a loan of $2.672 million to finance
the estimated foreign exchange cost of an expansion and rehabilitation of
ICE's distribution facilities. The loan carries an interest rate of 5-3/4%
and has a term of 20 years, including four years of grace. In accordance
with the provisions of the agreement covering the existing Bank loan, ICE
obtained the Bank's approval before incurring this debt.
8h.       In connection with the financing of the Rio Macho project, ICE
obtained a loan from Banco Nacional de Costa Rica (BNCR) amounting to 08.8
million with an interest rate of 8%.  In 1962, an additional loan of %6.7
million was obtained from the same source, this time with an interest rate
of 7%. Both loans are to be amortized over the period 1963-1967.
85.       At the beginning of the period considered, ICE has available net
current assets of /26.9 million. This would be reduced to 014.5 million at the
end of 1964 and to 022.4 million at the end of 1970. Throughout the period
the cash balance will be maintained at a reasonable level to meet the re-
quireiments for construction activities and for working capital. The proposed
financing plan provides an adequate basis for the execution of the proposed
construction works.

Estimated Future Earnings
86.       The forecast of earnings for the eight year period 1963-1970 is
given in Annex 9. This is based on the estimate of future sales discussed
in Chapter III, the authorized increases in power rates described in para-
graph 69 and the financing plan outlined above. Operating costs have been
increased gradually to reflect the additions to generating plant and trans-
mission and distribution facilities during the period. Fuel costs are based
on estimated programming of available generating plant. Depreciation allow-
ances used by ICE are 2.5% for hydro plant installations and 3,33% for trans-
mission lines, substations and thermal plants. These allowances are reasonable.
87.       Net income from operations before interest is expected to increase
from %11.5 million in 1963 to ¢24.8 million in 1966, the first full year of
operation of the Cachi plant.
88.       The forecast shows that with the rate increases now scheduled, the
return on average net fixed assets in operation would, during the next few
years, faILshort of the agreed level of 7.5%.  Based on present estimates,
an additional average increase in rates of about 2% would be required to
reach this level in 1964 and maintain it thereafter. ICE has the general
authorization from SNE to make the necessary rate adjustment, and has con-
firmed that, if required, the additional rate increase would be implemented.
Rate Covenant
89.       In the agreement covering the existing Bank loan, ICE undertakes
to maintain rates at a level to provide revenues sufficient to cover operating
expenses including adequate maintenance and depreciation, taxes and interest.
amortization payments on long-term debt exceeding the provision for depreciation
and to create a surplus for financing a reasonable portion of the cost of
future expansion. It is proposed that the same covenant would be maintained
for the proposed loan.
90.       In a side letter, ICE undertook to obtain rate increases designed
to achieve by 1964 a return on net fixed assets in operation of 7.5%. It
was estimated that this would permit ICE to achieve its aim to finance 40%
of the cost of future expansion by internal generation of funds. According
to present estimates, as shown in paragraph 77, ICE should be able to meet
47% of the cost of the next eight yearst expansion.
Debt Service Coverage
91.       The debt service coverage would be 1.6 in 1963 and in 1964 and then
increase to 2.7 in 1969. A limitation on new debt is discussed in Part C
covering the consolidated position of ICE (paragraph 153).

PART B
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PFOJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
92.       As a result of earlier discussions, ICE asked in December 1962
the Bank's assistance in financing the first stage of a program to provide
Costa Rica with a modern and efficient telecommunications system. The pro-
ject consists of new automatic exchange equipment for 26,000 telephone lines,
cable and line networks and radio equipment for interurban connections. The
total cost is estimated at $12.6 million equivalent of which $9.5 million
will be required in foreign exchange.
93.       The appraisal of this project is based on a conprehensive feasibility
study prepared by ICE engineers with assistance provided by the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU). The program has also been reviewed by the
French team of experts retained by the Bank to carry out a coordinated study
of the telecommunication needs in Central America and Panama under a grant
made by the U.N. Special Fund.
II. ORGANIZATION
94.       ICE has retained a small group of engineers who have obtained
specialized training in telecommunications and are forming the nucleus of
the telecommunication division which has been established. This division
will be fully responsible for the planning,construction and operation of
telecommunication facilities. It will maintain separate accounts, showing
thefinancial results of the operation of the telecommunication system in
accordance with provisions of the decree giving ICE the responsibility of
providing telecommunication services.
95.       The division will operate under the supervision of ICE's manage-
ment. Full advantages will also be taken of ICE's existing legal, personnel
and accounting services.
96.       ICE is planning to obtain the additional specialized staff needed
for the execution and operation of the project by employment of foreign key
personnel and, concurrently, by an extensive training program. ICE has made
contact with a number of former employees of the Cuban Telephone Company who
have indicated interest in taking employment in Costa Rica. For the training3
ICE will take advantage of the many programs offered by operating companies
and government institutions in the United States and European countries.
97.       The plans for reinforcing the present efficient but small staff of
ICE's telecommunications division are reasonable. ICE has confirmed that
these plans will be carried out to assure that a sufficient and qualified staff
will be available for the execution of the project and sound operation of the
new system.

III. EXISTING TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
CNFL
98.       Most of the existing telephone services in Costa Rica are provided
by Compania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL, see paragraph 23). It operates
its telephone system under a concession granted in 1942 and expiring in 1967.
CNFL has agreed to sell its telephone installations to ICE and the negoti-
ations regarding the main points in connection with the sale have been con-
cluded. The preliminary draft agreement provides for the purchase price of
about $0.9 million to be met by monthly payments to be made by ICE over a
period of about 6 years.
99.       It is expected that the preparation and signing of the final
detailed contract will require an additional month or two. With agreement
already reached on all important issues, there is no reason to expect any
further delays.
Telephone Installations
100.      The principal part of CNFL's telephone installations is located in
San Jose and consists of a manual central exchange with 6,400 subscriber lines,
240 rural lines and 300 pay telephones together with an associated cable net-
work. A total of 15,171 telephones are connected to the system, indicating
the heavy overloading which exists.
10O      Outside San Jose, CNFL operates telephone systems in eight smaller
to'Dns. Six of these have manually operated exchange equipment and two have
small automatic step by step exchanges. The exchanges have a total of nearlv
2,500 subscriber lines and a total of about 2,700 telephones are connected.
The interurban network consists of aerial cables and open circuit wires.
102.      The CNFL system is generally well maintained but most of the in-
stallation has reached the end of its useful life.
103.      Outside the CNFL system, five municipalities have installed their
own small automatic exchanges to provide local telephone service.
Telegraph Installations
104.      Telegraph service is provided by the Government post and telegraph
administration. It operates a network of pole lines in the central part of
the country and 17 connections by radio to isolated towns. All traffic is
handled manually, no telex service is available. For the time being, the
Government would continue to operate the telegraph service.
International Service
105.      International telephone and telegraph service is provided by Cia
Radiografica International de Costa Rica (Tropical Radio), a subsidiary of
United Fruit Company. They operate telephone and telegraph radio circuits
to Miami, Panama City and the capitals of the other Central American countrie3.



- 18 -
IV. DEMAND FOR TELECO;IItNICATION SERVICES
Local Service
106.      The existing telephone installations have been insufficient to
meet the demand for telephone service for many years. The manual type
equipment in use is both inadequate and not fitted for any expansion. The
capacity of the new system proposed was therefore initially based on the
number of present subscribers with an allowance for connection of new sub-
scribers.
107.      Early in 1963, ICE started registration of prospective subscribers,
requesting them to confirm applications for service by payment of a nominal
fee of 02. The total numbers as of the end of February were 17,300 for
San Jose metropolitan area, and 2,840 for four of the five other towns where
service will be provided initially. This includes practically all of CNFL's
present subscribers who will be transferred to the ICE system when completed.
108.      The new system has been planned with a total exchange capacity of
26,000 lines. By use of party line services the maximum number of sub-
scribers is estimated at 29,000. With the applications already on hand and
allowing for additions during the two years before service can be provided,
it is reasonable to expect the capacity of tlenew system to be fully utilized
a short period after it can be put in operation.
109.      A detailed breakdown of categories of subscribers is not yet
available, a sampling of applicants shows the following:
Category                              % of Total Lines
Large Commercial and Government offices                   7
Small CommErcial and Professional offices                30
Residential single line service                          39
Residential party line service                           24
Total                                         100
110.      The number of telephones per 1000 population would reach about
25 after completion of the program now planned. This corresponds with the
present average telephone density of all South America. The average for
Europe is about 80 and for the United States 410.
111.      Estimates of further increases in the requests for telephone
service in the years after the completion of the initial program must
necessarily be based on a rough judgement. The tentative plans for additicnal
expansion have been based on an annual increase in subscribers of 10%.  The
estimates will be revised as soon as ICE gains some operational experience.



- 19 -
Long Distance Service
112.      The present facilities are both inadequate and unreliable and it
is therefore not possible to use information about present traffic as a basis
for estimating future requirements. To establish the number of long distance
circuits to be provided initially, reference was made to information obtained
from other countries in Central and South America but taking into account
local conditions which might affect the volume of traffic. The new facilities
were planned to permit future expansion.
113.      The long distance traffic has been estimated on the basis of 57
calls annually per subscriber for the initial years of operation. This is
low based on the experience in other countries and is likely to be exceeded
once the system is established and the subscribers become familiar with the
new service.
V. THE PROJECT
1t4.      The project to be financed by the proposed Bank loan would consist
of construction of telephone exchanges, cable networks and long distance
facilities in the following localities (see map attached):
San Jose
115.      In the center of the city, close to the existing manual exchange,
a new, building would be constructed, designed for installation of a 20,000
lines exchange. Equipment for 13,500 subscriber lines would be installed
initially together with boards for long distance traffic and information
services.
116.      At San Pedro, in the eastern part of the city, a new exchange would
be ccnstructed, equipped initially for 5,000 subscriber lines. This ex9hange
would also include terminal facilities for radio and carrier circuits.-
The building would include space for administration offices, maintenance shops.,
stores and other service facilities.
117.      The suburban areas would be served by six unattended satellite
exchanges with a total of 1,310 subscriber lines. New buildings would have
to be constructed for all six.
118.      With the exception of a part of the existing primary cables in the
center of San Jose, which is in good condition, primary and secondary cable
networks would be installed to connect the exchanges with the subscribers.
Other Towns
119.      Central exchanges would be installed in Alajuela, Cartago, Heredia,
Puntarenas and Limon. The capacities of these exchanges would range from
200 to 1,300 subscriber lines with a combined total of 4,900 lines. In all
the towns, buildings would be constructed and necessary cable networks installed.
1/           The traffic capacity of existing open wire lines carn be increas-Erd
by instellation of relatively simple high frequency transmitting and
receivilng ejuipment.



- 20 -
Equipment would be provided to permit direct dialling between any of these
towns and San Jose.
120.      In an additional 17 locations, small automatic exchanges would be
installed with a total capacity of 1,240 lines.  Space for this equipment
would be available in existing government or municipal buildings*
Long Distance Facilities
121.      The connections between San Jose and the towns Alajuela, Heredia
and Cartago would be provided by aerial cables. A number of smaller towns
would be connected to these centers by open wire circuits. Microwave links
would be constructed through the center of the country between Buena Vista
in the south and Liberia in the north with a branch to Limon on the Atlantic
coast. Finally, VHF radio equipment would be installed to provide connections
to 17 isolated small towns.
Telephones
122.      The proposed exchanges would permit a total of 29,000 telephones
to be connected, allowing for use of party lines. To provide a reasonable
number of spares, the purchase of 30,000 sets has been assumed. In addition,
300 public telephones would be purchased and installed.
Engineering and Construction
1230      The plans have been prepared by ICE with the assistance of experts
of ITU under the U.N. Technical Assistance Program. The plans have also been
reviewed and endorsed by the team of engineers from the telecommunication
administration of the French Government (PTT) retained by the Bank to carry
out a coordinated study of telecommunications in Central America under a U.N.
Special Fund grant. The French engineers are also assisting ICE in preparing
specifications, in particular for the automatic exchanges.
124.      The detailed plans for the long distance facilities and in
narticular for the microwave links, can only be prepared after the French
PTT team has completed the plans for the Central American regional tele-
communication network, to assure proper coordination of these facilities.
ICE has agreed not to place orders for long distance facilities before this
coordination of plans has been made.
125.      ICE will require continued assistance and advice to complete the
detailed planning, preparation of specifications, review and comparison of
bids and supervision of installations. It has asked the French PTT to pro-
vide this service but no firm arrangement has yet been made. ICE has con-
firmed that satisfactory arrangements with the French PTT or another qualified
organization would be made.
Procurement
126.      ICE intends to invite bids on a wide international basis for the
supply of all equipment and supplies.



_ 21 -
Schedule of Construction
127.      The commissioning of the project is controlled by the time required
for the manufacture and supply of automatic exchange equipment. Information
received from main suppliers indicates a period of delivery of about 20
months from the time of order. Allo-wing for bid invitations, bid analysis
and installation, initial operations should start towards the end of 1965
and the project should be completed in the middle of 1966.
Cost Estimate
128.      The cost of the project is estimated as follows (in thousands):
Local
Foreign Cost       Cost        Total Costs
in $    in   _     in ¢        in $ in ¢
Land and Buildings              225   1,489      4,489         903   5,978
Central exchanges             3,214  21,276      3,990       3,817  25,266
Local cable networks          1,400   9,268      6,0o40      2,312  15,308
Toll cables and lines         1,000   6,620      4,600       1,695  11,220
Radio equipment               1,675  11,088        -         1,675  11,088
Telephones                      495   3,276        -           495   3,276
Overhead and administration     280   1,853        831         405   2,684
Totals              8,289  54,870     19,950      11,302  74,820
Interest during construction 1,211    8,020        512       1,289   8,532
9,500  62,090     20,462      12,591  83,352
129.      The estimates are based on price information obtained from a
number of large suppliers of telecommunication equipment. The average prices
were used and these were from 10% to 15% iligher than the lowest prices quoted.
The difference is in effect a contingency allowance.  In the civil works, the
estilnate was rorepared by ICE's construction department and based on recent
experience. Contingencies of about 15% have been included in the costs of
individual structures. The estimated costs are considered reliable.



- 22 -
VI. FUTURE CONSTRUCTION
130.      In addition to the initial construction program ICE has prepared
tentative plans for further expansion of its telephone system after 1966.
They are based on the assumed annual increase of 10% of the number of new
applications for telephone service.  Preliminary estinates of total costs
amount to about ¢70 million ($10.5 million), of which about $8.5 million
would be required in foreign exchange. The details of this further expansion,
which would be carried out during the period 1967-1970, would only be worked
out after ICE has obtained some operational experience and results which can
be used as a basis for a review of the expansion plans.
VII. ECONJOMIC CUNSIDERATIONS
131.      The present telephone system in Costa Rica is inadequate and
cannot provide the services required for a reasonable standard of telephone
communication. For technical reasons, there is a need for replacing it with
a modern system, designed with the necessary flexibility to permit extensions
to be made.
132.      The capacity of the new system is justified by the applications
for s-rvice already received, and it can be reasonably expected that full
utilization would be achieved within a short time after completion.
133.      The new system would be of special importance to the Government
administration and co:tribute to better efficiency. The Government attaches
a high priority to the execution of the project.  For the business community
the lack of a satisfactory telephone system has caused difficulties and
delays, and excessive time and effort has to be used for routine communications.
Of the toll circuits, the new connections between San Jose and the ports of
Puntarenas aid Limon would be of particular assistance for the export and
import trade.
VIII. FINlAIXCIAL ASPECTS
General
134.      The costs of the preliminary work carried out by ICE's Tele-
communication Division have been covered as a part of ICE's general ad-
ministration expenditures. With the start of the prooosed construction
program, the Division will establish its own accounts which will be separated
from those of ICE's power operations.
135.      The complete lack of any data of actual operating results, makes
the estimates of future operations and financial results more uncertain than
usual. The estimates prepared by ICE are reasonable but have to be considered
to be primarily illustrative and the conclusions reached would have to be
reviewed at the time when actual operating results become available.



- 23 -
Tariffs
136.      ICE has prepared a system of tariffs which were designed to pro-
vide revenues sufficient to cover all costs including a return on investment
of 7.5%. Financial forecasts show, however, that the return during the
initial years of operation would only reach an average level of 5.9% (see
paragraph 149). An adjustment of the tariffs is therefore likely to be
required to obtain a return of 7.5%.
137.      The tariffs consist of a flat monthly charge which varies according
to type of service, allowing 60 free calls per month, and with surcharges for
additional calls and for calls lasting longer than ten minutes. For long
distance calls standard rates are contemplated on a zonal system (details of
the tariffs are shown in Annex 12).
138.      Each subscriber will be charged an installation fee equal to twelve
times the monthly flat charge. In addition, each subscriber must make a
deposit of ¢50 for each telephone set installed. This deposit will be repaid
when service is discontinued.
139.      The proposed tariffs are about the same as those charged in neigh-
boring countries and are considerably higher than CNFL's present rates. The
tariffs were published by ICE in connection with the invitation to the public
to register applications. They have not yet been submitted to SNE for review
and approval.
Financial Plan
140.      A forecast of Sources and Application of Funds for the period
1963-1970 is shown in Annex 13. Total capital expenditures, including interest
during construction, during this period are estimated at ¢164.6 million
($2h.9 million). This includes the proposed project, additional expansion
during 1967-1970 and the purchase of the properties belonging to CNFL.
141.      The tentatively agreed purchase price of the CNFL properties is
¢5.9 million. As proposed at present, CNFL would continue to operate the old
system until the end of 1963. The purchase contract would provide for interest
to be paid at 8% and the principal amount would be paid to CNFL over the years
1964-1970.
142.      The requirements and sources of funds during the periods 1963-1966
and 1963-1970 are summarized as follows:

Total Sources of Funds                  95.9           176.0
143.      Net internal cash generation during the periods considered would
necessarily be limited and would only amount to about 12% of total require-
ments. The proposed Bank loan would represent 66% of requirements during
the construction period and 36% during the total eight year period.



144.      The part of the proposed Bank loan earmarked for the tele-
communication project would amount to $9.5 million and would cover the
foreign exchange cost, including interest during construction. For
calculation purposes, an interest rate of 5-1/2% and a term of 23 years,
including 4 years of grace, have been assumed.
145.      The local currency costs during the initial period would be
partly covered by estimated receipts of installation fees amounting to ¢7.8
million and estimated subscriber deposits amounting to ¢1.3 million. In
addition, $10.0 million has been assumed to be financed by a local currency
loan. For purposes of calculation an interest rate of 7% and a life of 15
years with a three year period of grace has been used.
146.      Preliminary arrangements have been made with the Caja Costarricense
de Seguro Social to borrow the 010.0 million on the above terms. The obtain-
ing of a loan of this amount has been made a condition of effectiveness of the
Bank loan.
147.      A sho-t term local loan of $3 million has been assumed in 1968,
mainly to provide working capital during that year.
Estimated Future Earnings
148       The forecast of earnings for the eight year period 1963-1970 is
shown in Annex 14. The estimates are based on the tentative financial plan
discussed above, and the preliminary tariffs described in paragraph 136.
Dopreciation has been estimated on a straight-line basis assuming an average
life of the installation of 20 years.
149.      According to the estimates, the operations of the telephone system
would show reasonable profits. The estimated return on net fixed assets in
operation, however,would average about 6% during the initial years and would
first reach 7.5% in 1969. The operating revenues have been estinated on a
conservative basis and the actual return might be higher. To assure satis-
factory financial results in future years, once the new system has been put
in operation, ICE has agreed to establish and maintain telephone rates at a
level sufficient to produce a return of at least 7.5%. The Government has
confirmed that ICE would be permitted to follow this policy.

General
150.      For the evaluation of ICE's future financial position consolidated
forecasts covering both power and telephone operations have been prepared.
They include a statement of Sources and Application of Funds, Operating State-
ment and Estimated Condensed Balance Sheets and are shown in Annexes 16, 17

152.      During the construction period 1963-1966, net internal cash
generation would represent 22% of total requirements of funds. During the
total period considered (1963-1970) this share would increase to 36%. The
existing and proposed Bank loans would during these periods represent 56%
and 29% respectively of total requirements of funds.
153.      In 1961, when the Bank made its previous loan to ICE, it was
estimated that ICE in future years could finance more than 40% of its con-
struction costs by internal cash generation. As a result of the increase
in the size of the power construction program caused by the more rapid
growth in power demand and even more as a result of the addition of the tele-
communication construction program it would not be possible for ICE to
maintain this level of self-financing during the next eight years. After
the initial effort in establishing the telecommunication operations and by
appropriate adjustments of power and telephone rates to maintain a 7.5% re-
turn on net fixed assets, ICE should be able to maintain a reasonable level
of self-financing of about 35%.
Estimated Future Earnings
154.      Net income before interest is estimated to increase from 011.5
million ($1.7 million) in 1963 to ¢28.2 million ($4.3 million) in 1966 and
to 048.9 million ($7.4 million) in 1970.
155.      The estimated return on net fixed assets in operation would reach
7% in 1963, decrease to a low of 6.7% in 1965 and then increase to over 8% in
1068. Relatively small adjustments in pow2r and telephone rates would be
required to maintain a r2turn of at least 7.5% throughout the period.
Debt Service
156.      Debt service coverage during the next four years would vary between
1.4 and 1.7 and weuld then improve gradually to a level of 2.3.
157.      Under the terms of the existing loan agreement ICE is precluded from
incurring new debt other than for the Rio Macho project, except by agreement
with the Bank, until the Rio Macho project has been completed. Thereafter,
ICE cannot, without the Bank's consent, incur debt unless at the time of the
proposed borrowing, its annual revenues adjusted to reflect the rates in
effect at the time are not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service in
any future years on existing debt plus the proposed new debt. While the new
borrowings now contemplated would increase ICE's debt beyond the limit pro-
vided by this test, the proposed expansion program and its financing is
reasonable and it is proposed that the Bank permits the new debt to be in-
curred. The covenant in the existing loan agreement should also be included
in the agreement for the proposed loan.
Debt/Equity Ratio
158.      The year end debt/equity ratio wJould increase from 36/64 in 1962 to
a maxmnum of 53/47 in 1965 and then decrease gradually to 48/52 in 1970.

Security
159.      Since at present practically all properties of ICE are encumbered
in one way or another, it was found necessary that ICE undertake to establish
a mortgage on the properties to be acquired by ICE for the construction of
the Cachi powerhouse and dam and on the principal properties to be acquired by
ICE for the construction of the telecommunication system. The Bank's first
loan to ICE was similarly secured by a mortgage on the Rio Macho properties.
ICE's undertaking to the Bank is firm as far as the mortgage on the properties
for the power project is concerned; the mortgage will be established promptly
after title to the properties concerned has been transferred to ICE, which is
expected to take place within the next six months, either as the result of
purchase negotiations between ICE and the present owners, or as the last step
of the expropriation procedures, the initiation of which is a condition of
effectiveness of the loan. As far as the mortgage on the properties to be
used for the telecommunication system is concerned, the Bank and ICE will agree
after such properties have been acquired by ICE whether ICE shall give a
mortgage to the Bank on these properties, or instead extend the existing mort-
gage on the Rio Macho properties, securing the Bank's first loan to ICE, to
secure also part of the proposed loan.
CONCLUSIONS
160.      The two projects proposed for Bank financing are technically sound,
the estimated costs are reasonable and construction schedules are realistic.
161.      The projects are necessary to meet the expected increase in demand
for electric power and to provide a reasonable standard of telephone services.
162.      The management of ICE is experienced and efficient and reasonable
arrangements would be made for the construction and operation of the projects.
163.      The financial results of ICE's operations have shown a marked im-
provement in recent years and its present financial position is sound.
Adequate financing plans have been prepared for the execution of the projects.
164.      ICE has, in particular, undertaken:
(a)  Not to start the concreting of the Cachi arch
dam structure before the detailed plans and
supporting data have been reviewed by the Bank
(paragraph 52).
(b)  To make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
to obtain the technical and operating staff
required to expand its Telecommunication Division,
as well as the technical assistance and advise for
the engineering and execution of the telecommunication
project (paragraphs 97 and 125).



- 29 -
(c)  Not to place orders for long distance facilities
before the plans have been coordinated with the
plans for the Central American regional tele-
communications network (paragraph 124).
(d)  To complete arrangements to provide the
additional funds required to complete the financing
of the proposed construction program (paragraph 146).
(e)  To adjust and maintain power and telephone rates at
a level sufficient to assure a return on net fixed
assets in operation of at least 7.5% in accordance
with authorizations already obtained by SNE and which
will permit ICE to finance a reasonable portion of
its future expansion by internal cash generation
(paragraphs 88 and 149).
(f)   To arrange to give the Bank appropriate security
(paragraph 159).
165.      The two projects form a suitable basis for a Bank loan of $22
million isdth a term of 23 years including a grace period of four years.

ANNEX 5
COSTA RICA
Detailed Description of Power Project
1.        The Cachi hydro-electric project is located in the middle
section of the Revantazon River basin in the Central Zone of Costa Rica.
The dam site is located in a narrow gorge 300 meters downstream of the
San Antonio bridge near the town of Cachi.
Geoloay
2.        A detailed report on the geology of the project area has been
prepared by ICE's own geologist. Advice on special features, in
particular in the dam site area, was obtained from outside consultants.
The findings, based on surface explorations, extensive drillingsp
excavation of several test pits and trenches and seismic investigations,
show that the conditions in general are favorable and no unusual or very
difficult construction problems are anticipated.
Catchment Area
3.        Revantazon aiver in the largest in Costa Rica.  It rises in
the Talamanca mountains in the Atlanitic water shed at an elevation of
about 2,500 meters. It flows eaot and north and discharges into the
Caribbean Sea. The total catchment area is 2,037 square kilometers of
which 919 square kilometers lay above the dam site. An analysis of
rainfall data obtained from 18 stations located in the basin shows an
average annual rainfall of 2,007 mm. in the area above the dam. The
average annual run-off at the dam site is 49.5 cubic meters/sec.
Hydrolo y
4.        Continuous flow records for a period of 17 years are available
from a gauging station located a short distance upstream of the dam site.
The most critical period occurred during the 1959 dry season when a
minimum flow of 11.4 cubic meters/sec. was recorded. This critical year
was used to compute the firm annual energy output of the project. The
reservoir with a capacity of 10.5 million cubic meters will regulate the
average dry season flow to 18 cubic meters/sec.
5.        The maximum recorded flood was 1,020 cubic meters/sec. on
October 14, 1955. The peak of the estimated design flood would reach
2,653 cubic meters/sec. Allowing for the damping effect of the reservoir
and a discharge of 600 cubic meters/sec. through the overflow tunnel,
the spillway would discharge 1,165 cubic meters/sec. with a maximum
reservoir level of 976.2 meters. Calculations were also made for a
maximum probable flood with a peak of 6,772 cubic meters/sec.  Under these
extreme conditions the spillway would discharge 3,950 cubic meters/sec.
with a maximum reservoir level of 984 meters.



ANNEX 
Page 2
Siltation
6.        The course of the Revantazon River above the dam site has a
slope of 20 per 1,000. Its sediment carrying capacity is very great.
To prevent the reservoir from being silted within a short period, it
will be operated at the low level of 945 meters throughout the rainy
season and the excess water would be discharged through the diversion
tunnel. The velooity of the river will be maintained preventing
siltation. In December, the gates of the diversion tunnel will be closed
and the reservoir filled to elevation 970 meters. This will be maintained
during the dry season through April.
Project Features
Cachi Dam
7.        The dam is a concrete arch structure, 54 meters high and a
developed crest length of 80 meters. The base of the arch is 25 meters
long. The spillway length is 35 meters and will under normal conditions
have a discharge capacity of 1,165 cubic meters/sec. Under extreme
conditions a maximum of 3,950 cubic meters/see. may be discharged. A
highway bridge will be constructed as a separate structure. The diversion
works consist of two parallel tunnels, each with a capacity of 600 cubic
meters/sec.  One of these will be concrete lined, equioped with gates and
operated as an overflow tunnel during the wet season.
8.        The dam will create a reservoir with a capacity of 10.5 million
cubic meters, covering an area of 90 hectares.
9.        The intake works on the right bank will consist of a funnel
shaped concrete chamber equipped with sliding gates and trash racks.
Pressure Tunnel
10.       The pressure tunnel will be 5,942 meters long and will be
excavated in three sections. The tunnel will be concrete lined and have
a capacity of 35 cubic meters/sec. An underground surge tank will be
located at the end of the pressure tunnel.
Penstock
11.       The penstock will consist of a 116 meter long steel lined
tunnel section and a 450 long steel section supported by concrete
saddles and anchor blocks.
Poverhouse
12.       The powerhouse will be located at El Congo coffee and sugar
mill. It will be equipped with two Francis type turbines operating under
a head varying between a maximum of 246 meters and a minimum of 221 meters.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
The two generators will each have a capacity of 28 MW and will operate at
60 cycles, 13.8 kv and 514 rpm. A short tailrace channel will return the
water to the Revantazon River.
Transmission lines and Substations
13.       An outdoor step-up substation will be constructed adjacent to
the powerhouse. It will have two 40 MVA, 13.8/138 kv transformers and
one 10 MVA 138 kv/33 kv transformer.
14.       A 14 kilometer 138 kv double circuit transmission line will
connect the Cachi plant with the existing Rio Macho substation. A second
circuit will be added to the existing Rio Macho - Colima 138 kv line.
The Rio Macho substation will be extended by installation of additional
circuit breakers to sectionalize the transmission lines. The Colima step-
down substation will be extended by installation of a 30 MVA, 138/33 kv
transformer and additional circuit breakers.
Transmission System Extensions
15.       The following transmission lines will be constructed.

17.       The Colorado diesel plant near Liberia will be expanded by
installation of a new 300 kw unit. In 1964 it will be replaced by a
500 kw unit transferred from Puntarenas and the 300 kw unit will then
be installed at Santa Cruz. These two plants will continue to serve
small isolated systems in the Guanacaste province.
