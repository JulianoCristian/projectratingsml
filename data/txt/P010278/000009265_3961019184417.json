The project\n            partially achieved its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was partially successful,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, in situations where\n            difficult technical problems prevail, specialists in the\n            technical field should be used extensively. Second,\n            unreliable water supply for any reason destroys farmer\n            confidence in the ability of irrigation authorities and\n            leads to weak cooperation in construction and O&M works.\n            Third, participation of beneficiaries in the design,\n            construction, implementation, and O&M is very important,\n            especially in large public irrigation systems. Fourth,\n            training farmers to understand the design of the water\n            system and its performance is necessary for large public\n            irrigation systems where they have to share according to\n            agreed time and quantity. Fifth, the design adopted for a\n            large public irrigation system must be flexible, simple, and\n            socially acceptable by small farmers and their communities.\n            Sixth, service charges to cover full O&M costs of public\n            utilities after improvement must be imposed. Also, this\n            should be considered as a country-wide issue in any\n            investment project. Finally, public and government awareness\n            of proper utilization of natural resources must be\n            instigated through various means of investment lending."}, "docdt": "1996-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
