MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR THE SUNSARI MORANG IRRIGATION [I PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal
for SDR 31.2 M (US$40 M equivaleat) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms and would help finance a project to rehabilitate and
improve the existing irrigation facilities in the Kosi zone of Nepal. The exchange
rate risk would be borne by His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN).
2.      Background.  Agriculture continues to be the dominant sector of Nepal's
economy, contributing about 60% of GDP and about 70% of total export earnings, and
employing over 90Z of the total labor force. Agriculture in Nepal is largely rainfed
and characterized by small-scale subsistence farming devoted mainly to the cultivation
of cereal crops (94% of the area sown). During the 1970s and early 1980s, foodgrain
production grew at an average annual rate of about 1.6%, while population growth was
at 2.6%. Future growth of the sector depends essentially on improving agricultural
productivity through reliable irrigation facilities and effective agricultural sup-
porting services, which together would encourage greater use of improved inputs.
3.      During the past three decades, HMGN has devoted considerable resources to the
development of irrigation, yet yields in many irrigated areas remain below their
potential because the service is unreliable and inequitable. As a consequence, water
is overused in some areas and in short supply elsewhere. These problems are the
result of shortcomings in both management and physical infrastructure. Ephasis needs
to be placed on rehabilitating existing systems and improving their O&M if the poten-
tial contribution of irrigation to agricultural production is to be realized.
4.      The project will rehabilitate an irrigation scheme using the water of the Kosi
River, an international inland waterway flowing from Nepal to India. The riparians
entered into an agreement on April 25, 1954, called the "Kosi Project Agreement." The
agreement, which was amended on December 19, 1966, provides that "HMGN shall have
every right to withdraw for irrigation and for any other purpose in Nepal water from
the Kosi River and from the Sun-Kosi River or within the Kosi basin from any other
tributaries of the Kosi River as may be required from time to time. The Union (GOZ)
shall have the right to regulate all the balance in the Kosi River at the barrage site
thus available from time to time and to generate power in the Eastern Canal." In the
opinion of the Bank's staff, the project will not adversely change the quality or
quantity of water flows into India. In accordance with the Bank's policy relating to
rehabilitation projects on international waterways, there is no need to notify the
riparian state (India) about the project. The HMGN has also informed the Bank that it
is not within the purview of the Indo-Nepal Kosi Project Commission, established under
the above-mentioned Agreement, to exchange information about the project.
5.      In 1978, IDA supported a first-stage project-the Sunsari Morang Irrigation
and Drainage Project (Credit 812-NEP, US$30.0 million)--to help modernize the existing
scheme. The project was scheduled to close in June 1984, but was extended for three
years. The scope was revised in 1983 to concentrate on rehabilitating the first
12,000 ha of the scheme, about 9,750 ha of which is now almost completed. After
considerable start-up delays, some relating to procurement problems and the design
changes, execution capacity improved. Experience with the project has demonstrated
additional needs for improved desilting arrangements, for the development of improved
operational plans and related adjustments in the overall system design, for
strengthened 0EM management, and for reinforced attention to water user group develop-
ment and extension support.



-2-
6.      Proiect Obiectives.- The proposed project aims at increasing agricultural
production and farmers' incomes througb the continuing rehabilitation and improvement
of the existing irrigation system, and at the same time at incorporating the lessons
learned under the Stage I project. The overall objective would be achieved by:
(i) introducing improved design and operation principles in the irrigation system to
ensure that farmers receive reliable and equitable service; (ii) protecting the caval
system from siltation; (iii) providing an effective drainage system; Civ) strengthen-
ing the institution responsible for irrigation and drainage activities; Cv) encourag-
ing organized farmer involvement in operation and maintenance; (vi) improving the
agricultural extension support to farmers; aud (vii) strengthening the link between
t'e Department of Agriculture and project management.
7.      Proiect Description.  The project is to be implemented over a seven-year
period and would include: (i) improvements to the Chatra Main Canal including provi-
sions for improved desilting; (ii) the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation
distribution and drainage works in 16,700 ha; (iii) further minor improvements to the
irrigation and drainage system in the Stage I area (9,750 ha); (iv) the construction
of buildings for offices, and staff quarters; (v) the provision of equipment and
vehicles for OM, and equipment for the project workshop; (vi) institutional
strengthening through technical assistance, training, and studies; and (vii) financial
support for the costs of incremental project establishment atJ maintenance. One of
the important irrigation management improvements will be the extension of the dis-
tribution system to reach 4-5 ha blocks. This feature is expected to: (i) enable
farmers to construct channels to individual fields; (ii) simplify the allocation of
water, ia that supplies will be rotated among farmers in turn; and (iii) lead to the
formation of more effective water users' groups (WUG).
8.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$49.9 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$36.6 million (73Z,. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nepal are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6655-NEP, dated Hay 13, 1987, has
been circulated separately.
9.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  This project closely reflects the UMON irriga-
tion development strategy, which gives priority to improving performance of existing
systems and extending the benefits of basic infrastructure already in place. Irriga-
tion is seen as a key factor in Nepal's effort to reverse the deterioration in per
capita food production and the strain placed by this deterioration on both welfare and
the balance of payments. IDA involvement would help ensure that the technical prin-
ciples tested and the lessons learned under the Stage I project are applied to the
benefit of the proposed project. The design of the system, based on rotational water
supply principles, represents a departure from past practices in Nepal. IDA involve-
ment in the project would support the needed improvements in infrastructure, O&M,
project management, vater charge collection methods, and a progressive increase in
water charges to cover full O&M requirements. IDA collaboration on the Sunsari forang
operation is part of a larger package of ongoing IDA assistance in strengthening
irrigation management and planning in Nepal, the assistance package including, in
addition to several other rehabilitation and expansion projects in execution: col-
laboration with UNDP and USAID in strengthening the capacity of the Irrigation Depart-
ment and development of more sharply focused planning of irrigation expenditures; and
periodic consultation under the recently approved Structural Adjustment Credit on
improved expenditure planning and management of core development programs.
10.      Aareed Actions.  During negotiaticns, agreements have been reached with EMGN
to: Ci) provide an effective agricultural extension service in the project area;



-3-
(ii) retain appropriate consultants to supervise construction and studies; (iii) plan,
design, construct, operate, and maintain works in accordance with satisfactory stand-
ards and criteria; (iv) provide resources and funds to execute the project in accord-
ance with the agreed implementation and expenditure achedules; (v) maintain sound
accounts with tinebound audits; (vi) provide and train the staff required to properly
manage and operate the project; (vii) undertake agro-economic impact, water manage-
ment, and desiltation studies; (viii) consult annually with the Bank on detailed O&M
plans and results; Cix) introduce effective assessment and collection procedures for
water charges and review progress periodically with IDA; and (x) periodically review
and adjust vater charges to ensure that revenues would cover the average OSM costs aud
a reasonable share of investment cost. With respect to cost recovery, other
IDA-supported irrigation projects in Nepal have been planned on similar principles and
include similar agreements; thus with the proposed project, such agreements will cover
most of the public sector irrigation projects.
11.     Justification.  The project would reduce production risk by providing a reli-
able irrigation service. The quantifiable benefits at full development would include
an increase of about 40,000 tons in annual foodgrain production and also substantial
increases in oilseed, vegetable and potato production, altogether valued at about
US$10.1 million per year. About 13,600 farm families would benefit directly from the
project. The project is expected to generate about 3,100 farm jobs per year. The
economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated at 212.
12.     Risks.  Possible risks that could affect the achievement of project objectives
include inadequate desiltation provisions, inadequate water management, insufficient
funding for O&M, and delays in implementation. These risks would be addressed in
various ways. With regard to the desiltation problems, EMN has indicated its deter-
mination to resolve them but has exkressed its preference for noomechanical solutions.
Studies to identify feasible nonmecbanical solutions would be concluded by the end of
the second year of project implementation. If the studies indicate that there is no
effective nonmechanical solution, it is expected that RNGN would implement the already
identified mechanical solution. To help minimize any remaining risk of delayed
implementation, disbursements after April 30, 1990 would be contingent upon HEMGN's
having initiated implementation of a satisfactory desiltation facility. With regard
to water management, autoatic stream dividers would be installed to replace the
traditional gates, thus minimizing the need for operators; the distribution system
would be extended closer to the farm gate; and WUGs vould be strengthened and given
specific responsibilities. The reliable and equitable irrigation service would
increase farmers' willingness to pay for water. With regard to OEM, EMGN would review
the proposed 06M budget with IDA annually, while the assessment and collectiou proce-
dures for water charges would be rationalized and the level of charges linked to O&M
costs. Finally, on project implementation, delays have previously occurred in the
sector on a number of occasions. In mitigation of this risk, tender documents for
the main contracts were made ready by appraisal, the main works are to be let under
ICB coutracts, and experienced contractors with proven ability to perform effectively
under local conditions are available. The project is not expected to have adverse
environmental effects.
13.     Recomiendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomauend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
