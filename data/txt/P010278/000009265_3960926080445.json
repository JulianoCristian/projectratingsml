    Project aims at increasing  agricultural production and\n            farmers' incomes through the continuing rehabilitation\n            and improvement of the existing irrigation system, and at\n            the same time at incorporating the lessons learned under the\n            Stage I project.  The project to be implemented over a\n            seven-year period includes:  (i) improvements to the Chatra\n            Main Canal including provisions for improved desilting; (ii)\n            the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation\n            distribution and drainage works on 16,700 ha; (iii) further\n            minor improvements to the irrigation and drainage system in\n            the Stage I area (9,750 ha), and (iv) the construction of\n            buildings for offices, and staff quarters.  It further\n            involves (v) the provision of equipment and vehicles for\n            O&M, and equipment for the project workshop; (vi)\n            institutional strengthening through technical assistance,\n            training, and studies; and (vii) financial support for the\n            costs of incremental project establishment and maintenance.\n            One of the important irrigation management improvements will\n            be the extension of the distribution system to reach 4-5 ha\n            blocks.  This feature is expected to:  (i) enable farmers to\n            construct channels to individual fields; (ii) simplify the\n            allocation of water, and (iii) lead to more effective water\n            users' groups."}, "docdt": "1987-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
