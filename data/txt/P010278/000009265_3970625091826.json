The project to be implemented over a\n            seven-year period includes:  (i) improvements to the Chatra\n            Main Canal including provisions for improved desilting; (ii)\n            the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation\n            distribution and drainage works on 16,700 ha; (iii) further\n            minor improvements to the irrigation and drainage system in\n            the Stage I area (9,750 ha), and (iv) the construction of\n            buildings for offices, and staff quarters.
