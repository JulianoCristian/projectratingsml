Bank was\n            satisfactory and the Borrower was rated deficient. Lessons\n            learned from the project are: simplifying objectives,\n            activities and institutional arrangements; defining a\n            critical path and closely monitoring its execution;\n            ascertaining that conditions are favorable for providing\n            greater continuity in leadership and administration; and\n            ensuring that the required expertise will be available.\n            Lessons of experience should not detract from the merit of\n            Govemment's and the Bank's decision-makers when\n            the circumstances prevailing at the time of preparation and\n            appraisal are taken into account.
