who\n            need them. Specifically the project will provide technical\n            assistance to : (1) prepare and implement programs for\n            improvements in resource allocation and utilization, cost\n            recovery and targeting; (2) introduce administrative reforms\n            and streamline processes in order to improve programming and\n            budgeting of sectoral expenditures; (3) train federal and\n            provincial sector managers; (4) build or strengthen\n            information systems to support policy making and post\n            evaluation capacity; and (5) put in place a better targeting\n            system for the needy. Since the project is multisectoral, a\n            coordinating unit will ensure that overall goals are\n            reflected in the activities of each component. The loan will\n            provide funds for consultant fees, training, vehicles,\n            furniture and equipment, and civil works."}, "docdt": "1988-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
