PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURKINA PASO
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(IDA Credit 557-UV)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Burkina Paso
(formerly Upper Volta) Livestock Development Project. The initial Credit
of US$9 million was approved on May 27, 1975. The Credit was reduced to
US$6 million in June 1979 and closed in February 1984.
This report was prepared by the Western Africa Regional Office on
the basis of the Government's draft project completion report, a PCR
mission to Burkina in July 1985, a review of available documents and
interviews with Bank staff involved in the various stages of the project.
The PCR was submitted to the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in June
1986. In October 1986, OED made the decision not to audit the PCR. The
report was sent to the Borrower on December 23, 1986, for comments; those
received were taken into account in the final report and appear as an annex
to the PCR.
The Government of Burkina Paso provided considerable assistance
during the preparation of the report. Not only was much effort made by the
Government to prepare their own report, but the PCR mission was given a
great deal of help by officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURKINA FASO
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(IDA Credit 557-UV)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Between  1975 and  1984,  IDA financed a Livestock Development
Project  in southwestern Burkina Faso  (then called Upper Volta).   The
project aimed to establish group ranches and a group ranch development
centre, improve veterinary services, construct a livestock market, a
holding group and stock routes, renovate a slaughterhouse and to provide
training, field trials, monitoring and evaluation and follow up project
preparation  (paras.  1.10 to  1.15).  Altnough it achieved most of its
physical goals, the project failed to develop a successful group ranch
component, which was the most costly, important and difficult part of the
project. Progress was made in creating pastoral associations. At the time
of appraisal in 1974, project costs were estimated at CFAF 2.5 billion and
IDA support at US$9 million (US$1- CFAF 225 at appraisal). Final project
costs were CFAF 2.0 billion and the IDA credit was reduced to US$6 million.
As a result of slow start-up, technical problems and delays in tendering,
procurement and construction, project completion took 9 years instead of
the 5 years envisaged at appraisal.    The project did not achieve its
technical or economic goals. In this summary, the relevant sections of the
main text are indicated by paragraph numbers.
2.        The aim of the project was to assist some 300,000 traditional
cattle producers through a programme of group ranch development, improved
livestock marketing facilities, meat processing and veterinary services.
The project was managed by a Project Unit and was to include training,
field trials and project preparation components (paras. 1.1 to 1.15).
3.        Two revisions took place after c.Led:ft effectiveness.  The first,
in 1979, was stimulated by poor project performance and reduced the initial
credit from US$9 million to US$6 million. The second revision, which did
not alter the total credit, took place in 1983 (paras. 2.4 and 2.5).
4.        Most physical targets --e achieved, except in the group ranch
development component (paras. 2.6 to 2.28). A series of annual vaccination
programmes was carried out; they effectively controlled the most serious
endemic diseases, including rinderpest. The principle and practice of cost
recovery was successfully, but only temporarily, established. The project
played a significant role in distributing trypanocides in the area. This
became crucial to cattle survival in the area (paras. 2.16 to 2.18).
5.        After considerable delay, a livestock market was constructed in
Bobo-Dioulasso and 500 km of stock routes were developed (paras. 2.19 to
2.23). This entailed providing water points and boundary markers. The
construction delay was due to the initial choice of an inappropriate site
and to difficulties in obtaining title to an alternative site. A 6000 ha
holding ground also had problems with land allocation and was never



- v -
satisfactorily completed. The facility is still being used (1986), but is
in need of maintenance.
E.        The Bobo-Dioulasso slaughterhouse was renovated and re-equipped.
The work, although not completed until the end of 1979, was of high
quality.  The simple, but efficient, design of the slaughterhouse was an
important factor in ensuring good operation.  Subsequent maintenance has
been poor (paras. 2.24 and 2.25).
7.        The proposed development of 9 group ranches never took place.
Technical factors were the main constraints (paras. 2.7 to 2.15).  The
component was significantly revised in 1979 to become a pilot, rather than
commercial, venture. By the end of the implementation period, six ranches
had been started and four had operational Pastoral Associations;
substantial physical development had only taken place on four ranches.
These ranches had considerably fewer member families and head of livestock
than expected. Large numbers of crop farmers, who had traditional land use
rights, were present on the ranches. They were in the majority and had
neither the wish nor the incentive to participate in the project. Landless
migrant farmers settling in the area exacerbated this problem. The basic
concept--a group ranch project in an area with good soils and high
rainfall, and where the majority of the population was already involved in
farming--was  wrong.   There  was  an  initial  misconception  about  land
capability and this adversely affected the project (paras. 3.6, 5.12, 6.1).
Issues of land tenure and equity, as well as social and cultural problems
all resulted from the inappropriate aim of establishing ranches in the area
(paras.  5.7  to 5.11,  6.1).   Throughout  the project's  life there was
conflict between herder and farmer.  Tnis cor.flict was continuing in 1986.
The appraisal mission, the issues meeting and the government delegation at
negotiations all stressed the need to include support for crop production
in the project design to achieve some balance. Due to lack of follow-up by
both the Bank and the Government (paras. 3.1 and 3.6), this suggestion was
never  acted  upon.   The  alternative  solution  of  ensuring  that  other
crop-related projects assumed this role was never developed. Although a
number of alternatives were discussed, most of which concerned the use of
funds from other projects to finance crop development in the area, these
ideas were never pursued by either Government or Bank staff.   The impact
of a high immigration rate was also not foreseen during preparation.
Increased demographic pressure in the area made project implementation more
difficult.
8.        Despite  occasional  liquidity  problems  and  barely  adequate
accounting, no major financial constraints affected implementation directly
(paras.  2.33  to  2.38).    Reimbursement  of  project  accounts  by  the
Government, however, was not satisfactory.  Procurement and construction
(paras. 2.31 and 2.32) were delayed due to late preparation of bidding
documents and the poor performance of contractors. Cement shortages were
an occasional problem in construction programmes.
9.        There  was  inadequate  training,  particularly  of  pastoralists
during the early part of the project. Field trials were not pursued with
vigor (paras. 2.26 to 2.28). Reporting was generally good, though the
standard of accounting was poor but adequate (paras. 2.29 and 2.30).



- vi -
10.       No global ERR was calculated for the entire projec  due  to
changes in the important group ranch com )nent (paras. 4.1 to t.7).  The
veterinary services and marketing/processing components, however both had
positive ERRs. The veterinary component had a very hl.gh ERR (38 I), albeit
over a short period.  The validity of the benefit assumptions was tested
and verified. The marketing/processing component had a return of 12.4%.
11.       Although consultants prepared proposals for a follow-on project
in 1983, no immediate follow-on is expected, th3 initial reason being
inadequate policy dialogue between the Government and the Bank (paraq. 5.13
and 5.14). More recently, however, there has been a chaaxge of Government
and government  policy.   Government policy  now clearly recognizes  the
importance of a more broad-based and participatory approach to resource
management.   A sectoral livestock project does not have high priority
within this policy.  An analysis of the project points up a number of
important strategy issues, of which one can cite the following (paras. 5.1
to 6.1):
(a) The development of group or communal rane:hes must be
approached with great care and skill.  It cannot be rushed
and must involve all the potential participants from the
start. Training, literacy and the creation of socially
viable and cohesive groups arxe the crucial first steps;
(b)  Extensive ranching should bE supported only in those areas
where the ecological and soc!.al conditions make it the best
land use option;
(c) It is important to integrate livestock projects with other
rural development activities;
(d) Range management skills must be improved within the
Government's livestock service;
(e) Other aspects of animal production apart from cattle
production must  be  examined.   Small  stock,  poultry  and
fodder and forage production are important, particularly for
the poorer farmers;
(f) Cost recovery is possible in practice and should be
encouraged;
(g) Basic veterinary services, particularly against the major
pandemic diseases, must be available to producers; and
(h)  The importance and complexity of land tenure and land use
issues cannot be ignored or underestimated.



I.   INTRODUCTION
A.   Background
1.1       The  Livestock  Development  Project  was  the  Bunk's  first
livestock-related  investment  in  Burkina.   Now,  as  at  the  time  of
preparation, agriculture was the most important economic activity,
employing between 80-90% of the population.  Within this sector, livestock
represents an important resource, providing approximately 10% of the GDP
and 50% of recorded exports. The great majority of the national herd is
owned and managed by Fulani pastoralists.  There is litti? integration of
livestock into the farming systems and little use of modern production
techniques.  Traditional production rates are low, due to disease, poor
pasture and herd management, low and erratic rainfall and poor genetic
potential.
1.2       Bank involvement in Burkina's agricultural sector started in 1970
with  the US$6.4 million West Volta Cotton Project.   The  first Rural
Development Fund Project (US$2.2 million) was approved in 197", and the
US$2.0 million Drought  Relief Project  in  1973.   The Bougouriba Rural
Development Project (US$8 million) was approved in 1974. By early 1975,
seven IDA credits totalling US$30.7 million had been approved for the
country.   Non-agricultural  credits were  for  telecommunications  (US$5.3
million), road construction and upgrading (ItS$4.15 million), and education
(US$2.05 million).
1.3       Bank Group strategy at the start of the project was determined by
the poverty of the country and the importance of the agricultural sector.
The broad strategy was to aid the rural sector by favoring movement away
from the densely populated central plateau towards the resource-rich
southwest. The livestock development strategy underlying the project was
to increase the productivity of livestock within the framework of. a sound
overall agricultural development policy. The need to integrate livestock
and animal production into the country's farming systems was diacussed at
the start of the project, though it was not taken into account in the
project as it was implemented. Earlier ideas for improved integration were
neither included in the credit agreement nor followed up by other projects.
1.4       The project covered 58,000 km2  of  the Sudanian and Guinean
agro-ecological zones in che southwestern part of the country. The project
area consisted of the region covered by the Dedougou and Bobo-Dioulasso
ORDs. (These entities were later renamed "Volta Noire" and "Hauts-Bassins",
respectively.) Average annual rainfall varied from 600 mm in the North to
1100 mm in the South. The population of the area was approximately 900,000
people. The group ranch component was to involve an area of 300,000 ha
situated 100 km west of Bobo-Dioulasso.
B.   Origin and Preparation
1.5       The project originated from an economic wission to Burkina (then
called Upper Volta) in August 1970. No mention of the project appeared in
World Bank files, however, until June 1971.  Initially, the Government
wanted the project to cover two areas: the Sahel in the North and the



- 2 -
Bobo-Dioulasso region. A feasibility study, financed by FAC, was carried
out  in  late  1973 by  the  consulting  firm.   The  project's  components
subsequently underwent considerable changes. In July 1972, for instance, a
US$3 million project was being considered which included a breeding station
for pigs and poultry as well as refrigerated meat transport units, but no
ranching components. The preparation mission was in the field in March and
April 1974 and a draft of the feasibility study was produced in April of
the  same  year.   A  pre-appraisal  sociological  study  undertaken  by  a
consultant made overly optimistic predictions about the local population's
readiness and willingness to participate in the group ranch component;
hence the unrealistic appraisal goals for this component.  The study also
underestimated the problems to be faced in changing land tenure and land
use patterns.
C. Appraisal to Signing
1.6       The five-man appraisal mission visited the country late in 1974.
The Issues Paper was produced on November 22 and the Decision Meeting took
place on December 4. The appraisal mission proposed an integrated rural
development project that included group ranching, assistance to crop
farmers, the provision of wells, dispensaries, schools and rural roads. In
addition to the rural development component, there were to be dam
construction, veterinary services, livestock marketing, slaughterhouse
rehabilitation and technical services.   The problem between farmers and
livestock owners was recognized at appraisal, as was the need to minimize
conflicts arising from land and resource use rights.
1.7       At the decision meeting, it was agreed with the appraisal mission
that the feedlot operation should be downgraded from a commercial to a
pilot basis and that the smallholder fattening operation should be dropped.
It was also decided that the rural development and crop development
components should be transferred to other Bank-financed projects.   The
responsibility for following up on these points was not clearly allocated
at the time. These components were thus left out of the livestock project
and ignored by other projects. Some of those present at the decision
meeting expressed concern that a purely livestock-oriented project would
not receive support from the population in an area where crop producers
were in the majority. The need to encourage integration between livestock
and crop systems was acknowledged, but never effectively implemented.
1.8       The credit was negotiated in Washington from April 21 to 29,
1975. The Voltaic delegation was led by the then Secretary of State for
Planning, Rural Development, Environment and Tourism. There were no major
changes to project concept and design during negotiations. However, the
Voltaic delegation, echoing some of the concerns of the decision meeting,
stressed the importance of including crop farmers, who comprised 85% of the
area's popuiation, in the development process. The Bank agreed that this
was essential, and proposed that fundb from the West Volta Cotton Project
and from a possible RDF II or Second Cotton Project be used to finance an
agricultural development component.  This proposal was never effectively
followed up.

1.9       The Staff Appraisal Report was produced on May 8, 1975. Board
presentation and approval took place on May 17, 1975. Official signing of
the Credit Agreement (lio. 557-UW) took place on June 18, 1975, four years
after the first mention of the project in files and eight months after
appraisal.
D.   Objectives and Description
1.10      As  described  in  the  Staff  Appraisal  Report,  the  project's
objectives  were  to establish a broad-based program  to assist cattle
producers in the area through group ranch development, the improvement of
livestock marketing, meat processing and veterinary services. The project
aimed to help about 300,000 traditional cattle producers and hoped to
introduce modern commercial ranching to the traditional sector. There were
five major components:
(i) Establishment of nine group ranches and a ranch
development centre;
(ii) Provision of improved veterinary services throughout
the project area;
(iii) Construction of a livestock market and holding ground
at Bobo-Dioulasso and 730 km of stock routes;
(iv) Renovation of the slaughterhouse at Bobo-Dioulasso;
(v) Training, field trials, monitoring and evaluation and
project preparation.
1.11      All operations were coordinated and supervised by a Project Unit
based  in Bobo-Dioulasso.   The Unit was  to be established within  the
Ministry of Planning, Rural Development and Tourism. Key personnel in the
unit were to be:  the Project Director, a Voltaic national responsible for
project   management   and   coordination;   an  Assistant   Director,   an
internationally  recruited agro-economist  responsible  for financial and
agro-economic aspects of the project; a Civil Engineer; a Livestock
Specialist; an Accountant; and Voltaic counterparts for all expatriate
staff.
1.12      At  appraisal,  substantial  benefits  were  expected  from  the
project. At full development, the value of annual incremental livestock
production was expected to be US$3.4 million (1979 prices) providing annual
net foreign exchange benefits of US$1.6 million. It was estimated that the
annual cash incomes of 50,000 pastoralists benefitting from the veterinary
services component would increase from US$85 to US$105 and that the annual
incomes of 3,000 pastoralists participating in the group ranch component
would  increase  to  about  US$200.   Approximately  220,000  farmers  were
expected to see their average per capita cash income increase from US$5 to
US$7.   The  14,000 farmers expected  to participate  in the group ranch
component were to increase their annual cash incomes from livestock by an
additional US$56.



1.13      Unquantifiable   benefits  were  considered  to  have  greater
potential importance than the quantifiable.  These unquantified benefits
included: (a) organizing traditional producers into group ranches and the
solution of complex social, cultural and land use issues; (b) increasing
crop farmers' awareness of the need to integrate livestock into the farming
system; and (c) significant benefits from institution building, training
and technical assistance.
1.14      The greatest risks were correctly identified in relation to the
group ranch component.  This was the first project of its kind in West
Africa.  Insufficient understanding of what the project would involve and
land tenure problems were the main concerns.  Although the sociological
study carried out at appraisal indicated that potential group ranch members
would be willing to participate, it was not certain that they really
understood what group ranch development would entail and what would be
required of them. The second risk factor in the ranching component was the
possibility  that   crop  farmers would be reluctant  to surrender  their
traditional usufruct rights to the area. It was realized that without this
concession on their part, the ranches could not be developed at all. The
concerns about the risks were not accurately reflected, however, in the
physical targets and expected benefits of the project.
1.15      At the time of signing, total project costs were estimated to be
US$11.5 million (CFAF 2,587 million), with a foreign exchange component of
US$4.85 million (CFAF 1,086 million). Ranch development accounted for 61%
of the base cost of US$7.91 million. Physical contingencies and expected
price increases added US$3.59 million to base costs. The anticipated ERR
was 28%; this was considered sufficient to offset a substantial amount of
the anticipated ri.,ks.  It was estimated that 10% and 20% increases in
costs would lower the ERR to 24% and 21%, respectively; a 10% decrease in
expected benefits lowered the ERR to 24%.
II. IMPLEMENTATION
2.1       Project implementation took nine years rather than five, and
though it achieved many of its physical goals, it did not make satisfactory
progress in the crucial group ranch component.   This chapter describes
progress of the project from effectiveness to completion.
A.   Effectiveness and Start-Up
2.2       There   were   five   main   conditions   for   effectiveness:
(a) appointment of the Project Director and the assumption of his duties;
(b) ratification of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government
and BND; (c) Government authorization of treasury overdrafts of CFAF 60
million each for the Project Unit and BND; (d) the completion by Government
of all necessary steps to designate the Group Ranch Development Area a
special development area and to make it possible for the groups to obtain
security of tenure for at least 50 years; and (e) completion of suitable
arrangements by Government and ONERA for the use of funds for the
livestock marketing and meat processing components.



- 5 -
2.3       Before the project became effective on November 19, 1975, it was
necessary to make minor amendments to the main Credit Agreement and to the
agreements between the Government and both BND and ONERA, in order to
reflect changes in implementation responsibility.  The Project Unit had
been created by Government decree on October 14, 1975 and the Director was
appointed at the same time. In mid-November, the Project Director moved to
Bobo-Dioulasso to establish the project headquarters. Other senior Project
Unit staff did not start arriving until February 1976. It was possible to
start the project's first vaccination campaign, however. The first meeting
of the Policy and Steering Committee took place on January 19, 1976, and
the Government decided early in 1976 that the Project Unit, rather than the
Bobo-Dioulasso ORD, should be responsible for the group ranch component.
Border tension between Burkina and Mali during the first two years of the
project created an atmosphere of tension that reduced the rate of start-up.
B.   Revision of Project Content
2.4       Two major revisions took place after credit effectiveness (see
Annex Table 1). The first was formalized in October 1979 when the credit
was reduced by US$3 million due to unsatisfactory progress of the group
ranch component and a decision to abandon the original idea of 9 commercial
group ranches and to develop 3 pilot ranches instead. These rancaes were
to be financed through grants for on-ranch investment rather than the BND
credits envisaged for the commercial ranches. The reduction in the total
credit amount was accompanied by a major reallocation of the remaining
funds.
2.5       The  second  revision  took  place  in  June  1983.   The  project
description was slightly changed and funds were reallocated within the
total  of  the  credit.   This  enabled  the  project  to be  extended  and
approximately US$500,000 then remaining in the credit to be used to finance
an emergency rinderpest vaccination campaign in four ORDs and studies for
the preparation of a follow-up project.
C.   Physical Progress
2.6       In this section, the progress of each of the five main components
will be summarized.
(i)       Group Ranch Development Centre and Group Ranches
2.7       This component was seen at appraisal as the most important, most
expensive and most  risky.   The allocation of a high risk status was
unfortunately justified: the progress of the ranches was slow and generally
unsatisfactory. Within this component were the Group Ranch Development
Centre, studies, a pilot fattening operation and the development of nine
commercial group ranches.
2.8       It was expected that more than 80% of the investments in the
Group Ranch Development Centre (CARC) would be made during the first year.
In practice, however, there were considerable delays.   Initially, these
delays were due to slow preparation and approval of tenders and contracts
and, subsequently, to poor performance by contractors and shortages of



- 6 -
cement. Although the CARC director arrived in 1976, he and other senior
CARC staff did not move to Samoroguan to live at CARC Headquarters until
1979. The fact that they were at first living in Bobo-Dioulasso, some
100 km away, was a serious constraint to effective development and
management.
2.9       A number of studies were undertaken for the ranch component.  A
soils study of the ranching area was completed by UNDP/FAO in 1976 and a
hydrogeological study undertaken between November 1976 and April 1977.
Between November 1979 and March 1981, IEMVT undertook a study of small
ruminants in the project area; the report of the study was completed in
1982. The same institute conducted an agrostology study in 1978/79 funded
by FAC. Studies on trypanosomiasis and its insect vector (Glossina spp.)
were started in February 1977 by personnel from ELAT, based in
Bobo-Dioulasso.   In addition to studies of the disease, ELAT and CRTA
developed and tested a new technique for controlling the tse-tse population
(para. 2.15).
2.10      The pilot feedlot operation had a varied, though generally poor,
career.   After  a  number  of  transformations  during  preparation  and
appraisal, trials were started by CARC at Samoroguan 1978. There was a 50%
cattle mortality in the first year and "other" losses. The high mortality
is reported to have been due to trypanosomiasis in Zebu cattle which had
been bought in the North of the country. This experience led a mission at
the end of the year  to  recommend  a  limit  of  100  locally purchased
trypanotolerant animals at any one time. For the years 1979 through 1982,
the numbers of animals on hand at the end of each year were 54, 64, 326 and
218, respectively; mortality rates were lower after 1979 but remained at
undesirably high levels. Average daily weight gains were approximately 250
grams, a low figure for animals on a concentrate ration. In 1982 it was
decided to expand the operation to 400 animals and to build a new yard and
dip.
2.11      The development of group ranches did not progress as expected,
partly due to anticipated problems being worse than anticipated, and partly
due to unanticipated problems.  Although land use conflicts and normal
project start-up delays were partly to blame, uncertainties due to military
activity in the area was also an important factor. By the end of 1978,
after three years of work, only one group ranch was operational.   It
included only 12 families with 1000 cattle. The second group raneh had
been  demarcated  and  work  was  underway  on  boundary  clearing.   This
unsatisfactory progress  prompted the change in project design and the
credit revision already mentioned in paragraph 2.4.

(1) Appraisal Estimates, not shown here, were for nine ranches.
Note: In July 1985, there were 50 families and 6670 cattle on the four ranches,
fewer than in February 1984.



- 8 -
2.12      Table 2.1 provides information on the physical status of the
group ranches. This is compared with target estimates for 3 group ranches,
this being the number fixed for pilot development from 1979 onwards.
Although the ranches covered an area three times greater than targeted,
they held only 15% of the anticipated number of member families and half
the number of cattle.  There were, however, large numbers of non-member
families on the ranches. Basic buildings were provided for the first three
ranches, but water development goals were not met. Fewer wells were sunk
than expected, mainly due to overly optimistic appraisal assumptions
concerning the water table.  Nine earth dams, or "dugouts", were built
following trial work by a consultant in early 1979.  They enjoyed only
limited success, though this was the first time the technique had been used
in Burkina.
2.13      The ranches never developed the 625 ha of improvec pastures that
were envisaged at appraisal. By 1978, it was clear that cattle could not
live throughout the year on the ranches, as there was no reliable dry
season grazing. A Stylosanthes trial was started by CARC in 1977, and the
first group ranch planted 25 ha of Stylosanthes which was destroyed by a
bush fire in 1979. The appraisal mission had planned to improve dry season
nutrition through a dam and irrigated fodder production, but this proposal
was  rejected  before negotiations.   Ranches  1 and 2 were consequently
allocated 500 ha of Souri floodplain grazing; this was later enlarged to
2,600 ha. This addition of very productive land to the ranches increased
friction between tne ranchers and their neighbors, and aggravated conflicts
on the ranches between the livestock owners and farmers.
2.14      Despite investment in civil works, the creation of a Special
Development Area status and a ratified Group Ranch Statute, the four
ranches never operated as cohesive and viable ranch units. Four Pastoral
Associations, each with an elected committee, were operating at the end of
the project.  They were not able .o control the situation or stop the
increasing settlement of farmers. There were always more non-ranch members
than ranch members living within the ranch boundaries, there was no form of
effective and organized resource management and there has been continuing
conflict between ranch members and others, with the "others" very much in
the majority.   Conflicts between livestock owners and farmers existed
before the project started, and increased immigration of new farmers from
the over-populated Central Plateau aggravated the situation.
2.15      Tse tse control tests were carried out by ELAT in 1982, using a
technique involving blue screens treated with the insecticide Decamethrine.
The new technique was found to be cheaper (CFAF 825/ha vs. CFAF 1000/ha for
conventional DDT ground spraying), less damaging to the environment and
more effective at reducing tse tse numbers (96% vs. 77% reduction). There
has been interesting work continuing on this technique by CRTA in
Bobo-Dioulasso.
(ii)      Veterinary Services
2.16      The animal health component of the project was successful and
controlled cattle diseases fairly effectively during the life of the
project. The project area was spared outbreaks of rinderpest in 1981, even



- 9 -
though neighboring areas were badly affected.  Available data on numbers
vaccinated are somewhat conflicting; Table 2.2 shows vaccination figures in
percentages fox the first four years of the project. There was a decline
in  the numbers vaccinated  against  rinderpest  and CBPP.   A number of
possible theories have been advanced for this decline, the most plausible,
expressed  in  a  1979  supervision  report,  being  that  "the vaccination
campaigns became victims of their own success". Presumably, with control
of the disease the herders become less interested in subsequent vaccination
campaigns.  The increasing charges to herders caused by the cost recovery
programme may also have been a factor.  The use of trypanocidal drugs
increased dramatically during the life of the project. It is likely that
there was a change in the pattern of the disease during the proj'ct's life.
Trypanosomiasis was not a major disease problem at the time of appraisal,
but there was a significant increase in the sale of drugs from 1977
onwards. The project played a major role in helping producers respond to
the threat of trypanosiomasis.   It is important to note that by 1986 the
standard trypanocidal drugs could no longer be used in the area due to drug
resistance.
2.17      The project established the very important principle of cost
recovery for veterinary drugs. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that the Government would move towards a cost recovery system. In August
and November 1978, Government decrees established the legal basis for cost
recovery for veterinary drugs. This was the first time such a system had
been established in West Africa. In 1981, however, the system collapsed
due to policy changes; the vaccination campaign was put under a national
programme of FAO and EDF funding. The Government issued a statement the
following year saying that all rinderpest and CBPP vaccinations would be
mandatory and free, thus ending West Africa's first experiment in cost
recovery for veterinary drugs. In 1982, a supervision mission noted that
as a result of the abandonment of cost recovery, there was no money to pay
suppliers in Dakar, and hence no vaccine for the campaign.

It was anticipated that investment in civil works for the veterinary
service component would be completed in three years. In reality, the main
service buildings were completed by 1978, but the construction of
vaccination crushes was  seriously delayed.  The bidding documents were
inadequate and there were subsequent delays in the delivery of materials.
The vaccina'cion crushes were finally completed in 1983. Construction costs
of the crushes were reduced by 30% from original bid costs by splitting the
procurement and construction contracts.
(iii)     Livestock Marketing
2.19      There were three sub-components to this activity: the livestock
market, the holding ground (both to be built at Bobo-Dioulasso) and 730 km
of  stock  routes.   The  market  was  completed  satisfactorily  after
considerable delays, and 501 km of stock routes were established. The
holding ground was not completed.



- 11 -
2.20      ONERA,  the  organization meant  to play  a  key part  in  this
component,  was  established  in  1976.   Due  to  late  completion  of  the
structures, however, ONERA never took an active part in this component
during the project's life.   In early 1977, it was agreed that in order to
speed up implementation, standard plans would be used for the Livestock
Market.  Later that year, however, there was a standstill when it was
realized that the site for the proposed market conflicted with alignment of
a proposed IDA-funded road (part of Urban Project - Credit 766-UV). A new
13 ha site was selected which had more room but was 1.2 km farther away
from the railhead and a reliable source of water. Title for the new site
was not received until March 1979. Construction was finally completed in
1983.   Considerable  savings  in  construction  costs  were  realized  by
splitting procurement and construction contracts.
2.21      Like the market, the holding ground was initially placed in the
wrong site. The 6,000 ha site was 10cated within a classified forest that
was to be part of a USAID-funded forestry project.  This was known at
appraisal and despite many assurances given to supervision missions, the
problem was not resolved during the life of the project. Some development
work, including two earth dams, was implemented at the site but the holding
ground was never completed.
2.22      A study of water points for the stock routes was completed in
1978. The construction of 10 wells started in March 1979, but progress was
very slow. The contract for the posts to mark the stock routes was not
approved by the Bank, due to inacceptable cost increases, until 1979. The
contract unit price for the posts was eventually CFAF 37,500, compared with
appraisal estimates of CFAF 8,500. The demarcation of the stock routes did
not prevent cattle straying into cropped land. Eleven wells were built on
the stock routes, generally close to a village, as it was expected that the
villagers would be the main users of tle wells.  The wells had potential
delivery rates of between 1.8 and 2.5m per hour. Average depth of the
water table was 12.37m (range 8.5 to 16m). The encroachment of villages
around the wells in the dry season, however, became a serious problem and
created tension between stock owners and farmers along the stock routes.
2.23      Project data on the use of the stock routes between 1977 and
1980, and for 1985, show a significant increase in the number of small
stock before the routes were Improved (up to 1980), and a considerable
increase in cattle movement between 1980 and 1985. It is unfortunate that
there are no data for the intervening years. It is difficult to analyse
this sort of data as there are many factors determining the number of
livestock using the route. The fact that 1984 was a serious drought year
and that people were trying to sell cattle in the first half of 1985 has
probably had some bearing on the figures.

(iv)      Slaughterhouse
2.24      The renovation and equipping of the Bobo-Dioulasso slaughterhouse
was straightforward and successful.  The slaughter-house was simple and
very well designed.   The simplicity and lack of complicated operations
contributed to its ease of running. Tender documents were prepared by a
consultant made available by German technical assistance and were approved
in 1977.  The two important contracts were let early in 1979.  It was
initially hoped that the new facilities could open in July 1979, but this
was not possible because: (a) some essential parts for the chill room were
missing; (b) ONERA had no futnds to buy cattle; (c) butchers failed to
cooperate as they were not prepared to accept the loss of the 5th quarter;
and (d) the Islamic community doubted that the stun-gun slaughter technique
conformed to accepted religious practices. The slaughterhouse eventually
started working at the end of 1979 with a daily capacity for 80 bovines and
more than 100 small stock. Slaughter fees were CFAF 2,200 for cattle and
horses, 325 for small stock and 1000 for pigs. The increase in slaughter
fees to a realistic level was a direct result of the project.
2.25      Slaughter data for 1976 to 1981 show that small stock and pig
slaughter rates doubled after the renovations were completed at the end of
1979 (see below). However, increases in small stock slaughter, like the
increased use of the stock routes by small stock noted earlier, started
before  project-relaucd  facilities  had  any  impact  on  the  area.   The
anticipated development of the export market never materialized.

1977              22,224           14,886          1,213             92
1978              21,889           26,378          1,589            127

Although no detailed data are available since 1981, the throughput in 1985
was similar to 1981 for cattle and pigs, but lower for small stock.
Records appear to have been poorly kept and senior staff frequently
changed. In 1985, it was not possible to see even basic accounts for the
previous year's operation.  The physical state of the slaughterhouse in



- 13 -
1985 was not encouraging. Only six years after completion it was in need
of rehabilitation, the scale for we,ighing animals before slaughter had not
worked since 1983 and one chill rocm was not working. The Dutch Government
has been approached to finance a new slaughterhouse.
(v)       Training, Field Trials, Evaluation and Monitoring
2.26      The training component of the project followed the broad outlines
of the proposals in the appraisal document but was considerably less
extensive. Two senior ONERA staff attended training courses for abattoir
management in France. One CARC agent took a three-month course in Mali.
The Project Director and CARC Director visited Kenya in 1977 to study the
group ranches there. This was followed later the same year by a visit by
CARC staff and four group ranch members to the SODEPRA ranch in C8te
d'Ivoire.
2.27      There  was  insufficient  attention  given  to  the  training  of
pastoralists, stock owners and potential group ranch members.  Although
this was an initial oversight during project preparation and appraisal, it
should have been  remedied  during  implementation.   In  1982,  30 young
pastoralists were trained at CARC and there was some discussion of
functional literacy programmes at both the beginning and the end of the
project; nothing significant was done.
2.28      The only trial work on pasture development undertaken by the
project was the establishment of 20 ha of Stylosanthes at CARC in 1977 and
some  night  grazing  experiments  in  1983.   Detailed  results  are  not
available, though it was reported that the stylo grew well and that access
to night grazing increased cattle weight gains fourfold. The potential for
stylo, particularly in mixed farming systems, was not followed up. Trial
work on tse tse control was undertaken by ELAT (see para. 2.15).
D. Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation, Accounting
2.29      Satisfactory quarterly and annual reports were produced during
most of the project. There are no records of annual reports for the last
two years, however. A Project Completion Report prepared by the Project
Director was finished in 1985. At appraisal, emphasis was placed on the
importance of monitoring, particularly in relation to group ranching and
livestock marketing activities. Despite this, no progress was made until
1979, when some monitoring work was started on the vaccination programmes.
Unfortunately it was not until 1983, very near the end of the project, that
an effective system was established. The system has not been maintained
and data on most aspects of the project are therefore inadequate.
2.30      The  overall  standard  of  project  accounts  was  poor,  though
sufficient to meet audit requirements. An accounting system was set up in
1976 by the expatriate accountant. A year later, however, the accounts
were in a very bad condition. At this time the accountant left the project,
and the country, without any warning. From late 1977 to early 1979, the
quality of accounting improved due to close supervision by an accountant
provided by the auditors, Coopers and Lybrand. Once this close supervision
stopped, the quality of accounts again deteriorated and financial control



- 14 -
became lax.  Auditors' comments persistently stress the need to improve
procedures, to use the accounts to identify specific activities and for
tighter control of the use of petrol and veterinary drugs, especially
trypanocides. The Group Ranch Development Centre kept its own accounts.
These were consistently worse than those of the Project Unit.
E.   Procurement and Construction
2.31      The project followed acceptable procurement procedures, including
the use of International Competitive Bidding where appropriate. There were
occasions when bidding documents or contract prices were questioned and
approval withheld by the Bank, but there were no major unresolved problems.
2.32      There were  delays  with  virtually  all  the  civil engineering
contracts.  A civil engineer provided by the French technical assistance
programme joined the project in 1976 and was responsible for preparing
bidding documents.   This was not always done as quickly as was hoped.
Tender documents for the livestock market, for instance, had not been sent
to IDA for approval four years afte. the start of the project, the contract
for stock route beacons took just under four years to sign and the bidding
documents for the wells on the stock routes were not approved until late
1978, three years after project start-up. In general, the construction of
houses and offices went faster than other civil works, although
considerably more slowly than expected a,. appraisal. Shortages of cement,
particularly during 1979, and problems with contractors were the most
common constraints hampering construction.
F.   Costs, Financing and Disbursement
2.33      Disbursement data by category is presented in Annex Table 1.A,
the summary of project costs in CFA? is given in Annex Table 2, and the
historical progress of total disbursements is shown in Annex Table 3.
2.34      Changes in exchange rates during the project life make realistic
comparisons of estimated and actual costs difficult. This is particularly
true for a project that experienced one major revision and a subsequent
realignment in project design with corresponding alterations to the credit.
During the life of the project, the CPAF/US$ exchange rate varied from CFAF
225 at appraisal to 249.69, when the first cradit disbursement was made in
May 1976, to less than 210 in 1980 and then up to 474 at the time of the
last disbursement in October 1984. The arithmetical mean of the bi-annual
IMF exchange rate during the life of the project is CFAF 290.29/US$.
However, as 75% of disbursements took place before 1982, a weighted
exchange rate of CFAF 275/US$ is a more realistic figure. This does not
tally with the rate implied by project data for CFAF equivalents of the IDA
contribution (Annex Table 2).  According to the project's figures, the IDA
contribution amounted to CFAF 1,586,357,490, which would correspond to the
credit total of US$6 million at a rate of CPAF 264/US$. Unfortunately, the
computerized data on disbursements, from which a truly accurate weighted
exchange rate could be calculated, have already been dumped. A compromise
exchange rate of CPAF 270 is used. A lesson to be learned here is that it
would be wise either to store computerized disbursement data until the
Project Completion Report has been written, or to ensure that the data are



- 15 -
used to compute a realistic weighted exchange rate for the project before
they are dumped.
2.35      The Project Unit's Completion Report data show total project
costs as CFAP 2,005,367,781,  or approximately US$7.4 million.   The IDA
Credit of US$6 million therefore covered 81% of costs, or close to the 78%
IDA funding foreseen at appraisal. A comparison of costs between appraisal
and completion, classified by disbursement category, shows dramatic
increases in the costs of the Project Unit and the Group Ranch Development
Centre. In absolute terms, and allowing a prorated distribution of the
unallocated portion of the appraisal credit, the Project Unit took three
times the share of the credit that was attributed to it at appraisal. In
relative terms, the Project Unit required 5% of the base costs at
appraisal, but in fact used 21% of total project costs and 18% of the final
disbursements from the credit. The Group Ranch Development Centre showed a
similar escalation in total and relative costs. The centre eventually used
more than 20% (U$t1.5 million) of the credit, while at appraisal only 6% of
the credit was to be used on the Centre (US$ 0.5 million).
2.36      The change in pattern of expenditure requires some explanation,
which may be furnished by an increase in management and administrative
costs during the life of a project, continually diminishing physical
targets and reduced implementation requirements. This suggosts a mixture
of overly optimistic appraisal and revision targets, inadequate resource
management during implementation and insufficient monitoring of expenditure
by functional unit. None of these problems are new to projects, but all of
them appear to have come into play during the Burkina Livestock Project. 1/
2.37      The last disbursement against the credit was made on October 12,
1984, nine years and one month after the project became effective. 'Due to
the alterations already discussed, disbursements were made for only 60% of
the original credit.   The project took 801 more time to disburse 60% less
'money than expected at appraisal. The lesson, learnt from a number of
similar projects in Africa, is that livestock projects involving range
management components are invariably more complex, more difficult and
slower to develop than expected at appraisal. They present crucial and
fundamental problems--social and educational development, land use rights
and long-term resource management issues--that cannot be solved by funds
alone. The technical aspc.Zts of the main problems will be discussed in
Chapter V.
2.38      Although  lack  of  funds  never  caused  serious  delays  in
implementation, liquidity problems were reported on a number of occasions
1/   The Government of Burkina does not agree with this analysis.  GOB
considers that the main reason for changes in expenditure patterns was
primarily the strengthening of the Project Unit through the creation
of such services as civil works, monitoring of veterinary activities,
better accounting within the ORDs, etc., in order to overcome certain
weaknesses observed in the project's administrative structures.



- 16 -
due to slow government reimbursement of project  funds.   A potentially
serious situation in 1979, when the Government was facing wide-ranging
financial difficulties, was averted vhen the project began to use money
from the Vaccine Cost Recovery Fund.  In 1979, there were only CFAF 5
million in the fund when there should have been CFAF 24 million. Towards
the end of the project, there was a serious problem in obtaining
reimbursement from Treasury.   The project again managed to bypass this
problem by using funds in the BND loan that were earmarked for developing
the fifth and sixth group ranches.  It is estimated that the Government
owed the project accounts between CFA? 83 and 89 million by the end of the
implementation period. Some CFAF 60 million of this deficit was financed
out of the BND Group Ranch Credit.  To the extent that these internal
transfers were properly recorded and monitored, they represented a sensible
and pragmatic reaction by project management to a difficult situation.
III. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A.   The Borrower
3.1       The Government sent a senior delegation to negotiations which
stressed the need for an integrated approach to the area's development and
the need for the project to include crop as well as livestock activities.
It should be stressed .Uat this was never put into action despite a number
of proposals for assisting crop farmers. Apart from the early draft of the
appraisal  report,  the  proposals  were  never  developed  fully.   The
involvement of a number of Bank-funded projects was suggested, but never
formalised or written into a project description. This failure had serious
consequences for the success of the project. It is to the Government's
credit that they were prepared to stress this issue, but is to neither the
Government's nor the Bank's credit that the issue was not followed up with
sufficient vigor.
3.2       The decrees and statutes required to implement the project had
something of a mixed history. In general, some action was taken, but it
was usually only partially adequate. ONERA, for example, was officially
created on April 17,  1975.  A year later, however, it still did not
actually exist as an operational entity. Another example was that although
the area for group ranch development was designated a "special development
area' on April 12, 1975, the group ranch statute was not ratified until
March 1977.  This statute was inadequate and needed to be revised the
following year to enable the ranches to operate. A final example is found
in the saga of cost recovery for the vaccination programme. Government
decrees of August and November 1978 established the basis for this, but the
policy was reversed in 1982. There thus appears to have been inadequate
policy and statutory support for certain project components. Although this
had a crucial effect on the cost recovery for the animal health component,
it probably had less impact on group ranch development.  The reasons for
this are not that correct policy and statutory background are unimportant
to group ranch development, but that there were other more immediate
problems hindering progress.  In the long run, of course, the policies and
statutes would have been of considerable importance if the ranches had
developed as planned.



- 17 -
3.3       Cooperation and commanications between the Borrower and the Bank
were satisfactory.  The project unit maintained good relations with the
central Government.
3.4       The project had little impact on the performance of national
institutions.  It was responsible for the creation of ONERA and CARC.
Neither  institution  makes  an  important  contribution  to  national
development, but both instead represent a significant drain on public
funds. The project made little contribution to staff training.
3.5       The project was responesble for the creation of four Pastoral
Associations in the group ranch ark ,. There are differing opinions on how
effective these have been. Even though they may have been functioning well
at the end of the project, by 1986 their influence on the area and the
management of resources was negligible.   It is, however, difficult to
believe that even during the project the Associations commanded effective
control of the area and its use when they were so outnumbered by farmers.
B.   The Bank
3.6       With  the  benefit  of  hindsight,  it  appears  that  the  most
unsatisfactory part of the Bank's involvement was its faulty technical
judgement relating, firstly, to the importance of maintaining a balanced
approach to the development of the area and, secondly, to the viability of
the commercial group ranching component. The intention to finance parallel
crop development activities in the area, which should have been reinforced
by the strong government request at negotiations, was never pursued with
sufficient vigor or responsibility. Many people suggested ways to support
crop development activities but, by default more than design, the ideas
were never put into a practical framework. The result was an unbalanced
development programme in an area where 85% of the population were crop
farmers and the agro-ecological potential of the land pointed to the
development of mixed farming with an integrated crop and livestock
production  system.   The  risks  of  the  group  ranching  component  were
emphasized at appraisal, but the innovative nature of the component should
have been more clearly recognized and the component planned accordingly.
Greater flexibility and a more realistic implementation schedule would have
helped considerably.
3.7       The Bank was responsible for the recruitment and employment of
most of the expatriate team working with the project, though the civil
engineer was employed through French assistance.   There was a serious
problem with the Project Accountant, who arrived early in 1976 and left
without any notice a year later. The first Director of the Group Ranch
Development Centre died while in post.
IV. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT AND RATE OF RETURN
4.1       The project had little direct impact on livestock production,
other than through the animal health component which reduced mortality and
weight  loss  in  cattle.   Changes  in  the  project  design  and  costs,
particularly those relating to the major ranching component, make it
impossible to calculate a realistic ERR figure to compare with the



- 18 -
appraisal figure of 24%.  However,  as less than 30% of final project
expenditure was used for productive activities; there can be no doubt that
the project failed to achieve the economic targets set at appraisal. This
was mainly due to overly optimistic assumptions concerning, firstly, the
ease of developing commercially viable group ranches and, secondly, the
development of the livestock markets. Calculations for the two successful
components--the animal health component and the marketing/processing
component--show an extraordinarily high, but not sustainable, rate of
return for the first and an adequate rate for the second. The rational use
of pastoral areas must also be taken into account in the framework of the
collective  ranches.   This  aspect  of  project  implementation,  although
difficult to evaluate and quantify, nonetheless represents an important
asset and constitutes for the Government the beginning of progress towards
ite main aims: halting the deterioration of pastoral areas, combatting
brushi fires, and stopping slash-and-burn agriculture.
A.   Agricultural Impact
4.2       The only component to have any direct impact on production in the
project area was animal health. This impact, however, did not persist much
beyond the end of the project and its support for the vaccination campaigns
and trypanocide distribution programme. Project estimates suggest that the
benefits of the trypanocide programme were ten times greater than the
incremental benefits of the vaccination programme. The distribution of
trypanocides had not been foreseen as an important activity at appraisal,
but was the main reason for the economic success of this component. Due to
the development of drug resistance, the benefits of this component were not
long lasting.
4.3       Although the marketing and meat processing components had a
positive ERR, it is unlikely that this had any significant impact on the
rate  or  pattern  of  animal  production  in  the  area.   Improved  water
distribution along the stock routes might have reduced weight loss during
the trek somewhat, but not by very much. The project was instrumental in
changing the pattern of charges for the slaughterhouse, but this had no
impact on production. External, non-project factors governed the price of
livestock and meat.
4.4       The group ranch component failed to reach its appraisal targets
and had little to show for the completed pilot venture at the end of the
project. In 1986, there was no evidence of improved production or better
land management within the group ranch areas, and disputes over land and
water rights continued.  This component may have actually increased the
conflict by providing unbalanced support and encouragement for extensive
cattle production in an area where it was inappropriate. In this respect,
the project probably had a negative impact.
B. Rate of Return
4.5       The failure of the ranching component to achieve any sustainable
impact makes it futile to calculate an ERR for the whole project.
Calculations were made, however, for the veterinary and marketing



- 19 -
processing components. High mortality rates and low growth rates rendered
the pilot feedlot operation uneconomic.
4.6       Project estimates of the benefits of the overall veterinary
componeut gave an ERR of 383%. The validity of this very high figure was
checked using a series of more conservative estimates of benefits. It was
consequently found that if only 10% of the incremental number of cattle
treated benefitted by 12.5% of their capital value, the ERR would still be
very high indeed (245%). The assumptions that give the 245% ERR are not at
all unreasonable, particularly for an area where trypanosomiasis is a
serious, but manageable problem.  If, however, only 5% of the programme
brought any benefit, and this benefit was worth only 5% of the capital
value of the animals, the ERR fell to -8.5%.    The veterinary component
was clearly very cost-effective, but its benefits were not durable. Drug
resistance has ended any further benefits from this component. The benefits
of increasing livestock numbers without corresponding improvements in
management are also questionable.  Project-generated estimates show that
the vaccination programmes were not cost-effective and that the overall
economic success of this component was due to the trypanocidal programme.
It is dangerous to draw general conclusions from this analysis, since the
benefit of a programme so obviously depends on the specific level of
disease challenge during a specific period. The challenge can, and does,
change.
4.7       The ERR for the marketing processing component was 12.4%. The
benefits would be more durable than those of the veterinary activities.
V. SPECIAL ISSUES
5.1       The most important lessons to be learnt from the project relate
to the most difficult com1oonent: group ranch development and the related
issue of land use. Other issues which will be mentioned in this section
include a lack of confidence in the Government on the part of the local
population, an unexpected increase in agricultural settlement in the
project area and the creation, at least during a part of the project, of an
innovative cost recovery system for the animal health componenta. Unlike
the situation for many agricultural projects in Sub-Saharan Africa during
this period, low rainfall and drought were not major issues.
A.   Confidence in the Government
5.2       During the 1975 border conflict between Burkina and Mali, the
Voltaic  Government  confiscated  4000  cattle  from  pastoralists.   This
reportedly reduced pastoralists' trust in the Government and reduced
participation in the project.   This is thought to have had significant
negative effects on the group ranch component. Inadequate communication by
the project with local populatiors during implementation did little to
overcome this problem and build trust between them and the Government.
B.   Settlement
5.3       Unexpected settlement and increased demographic pressure were



- 20 -
important negative factors for the project, vot only for the group ranch
development, but for other components as weli. Migration from the densely
populated Central Plateau greatly increased both the number of potential
croppers in the area and the imbalance between croppers and stock owners.
Tension and conflict between farmers and stock owners increased along with
competition for space and resources. The eventual settlement of the area
had been foreseen at appraisal, but the actual rate of migration was much
more rapid than anticipated. Conflict occurred not just within and around
the group ranches, but along the stock routes as well.
C.   Cost Recovery
5.4       The cost recovery system for the animal health component was the
first  of  its  kind  in West Africa.   This was an  important,  if only
temporary, breakthrough. Once collected, the funds were not always used to
refinance the purchase of vaccines, but this was through no fault of the
system (para. 2.58). The system was abandoned due to changes in government
policy, the reasons for which are not clear. The reduced interest of stock
owners in vaccination once the incidence of disease declined is significant
and relevant  to  the  future.   Long-term programmes  to control endemic
diseases may face lack of support from stock owners once control is
achieved and stock owners forget the severity of the disease. If farmers
have to pay for the vaccines they are less likely to give vaccination high
priority in the absence of a clear disease threat.
D.  Group Ranches
5.5       The problems associated with the group ranch component can be
broken down as follows:   (i) insufficient experience with this type of
development; (ii) insufficient attention given to equity, land tenure,
motivation, group development and education; and (iii) inappropriate land
use.
i)        Insufficient Experience
5.6       The Group Ranch programmes in Kenya provided the initial stimulus
and model for the component in Burkina. The Kenya ranches were not as
successful as was thought at the time of preparation of the Burkina
project.  However, even if the Kenya ranches had been successful, they
would have been an inappropriate model due to different ecological, social,
cultural and institutional circumstances.  Apart from these fundamental
differences between the two countries, Kenya had trained range management
personnel to oversee the development of the project. Burkina lacked, and
still lacks, such a group. The component started with the bold aim of
creating nine group ranches in three years. Risks were acknowledged and
some of these risks (as well as others that were not identified at
appraisal) changed the nature of the project from a commercial to a pilot
venture. The techniques and content of the component, however, did not
change substantially.  The lesson to be learnt is that a more cautious
pilot approach would have been appropriate from the start. This would have
allowed a more natural evolution of ideas, methods and skills. The approach
was classically and unfortunately "top-down". The incorporation of the
views and opinions of livestock owners and land users, rather than the



- 21 -
top-down imposition of an untried concept may have resulted from such an
approach. The targets set at appraisal had no practical basis in previous
experience in West Africa.  The physical targets diverted the project's
attention from the real social and institutional issues which were at the
heart of the problem.
(ii)      Equity, Participation, Tenure and Social Problems
5.7       In the group ranch areas, crop farmers were numerically superior
and held traditional land use rights.  They were expected to surrender
these rights and join the pastoralists in a group ranch venture. They had
little incentive to do this, particularly as the pastoralists owned most of
the cattle, and therefore possessed the tools to use the resources of the
ranches  and  the  benefits  of  the  project.   The  ratio  of  farmers  to
pastoralists in the proposed ranches (4.28:1) represented a reduction from
the pre-project ratio (5.25:1).   On these grounds alone,  it is hardly
surprising that the farmer's cooperation and participation were minimal.
5.8       The project did little to develop small stock and nothing to
encourage pou:try production.  The assistance to small stock production
came through the stock route and marketing components, which had been
designed for cattle rather than for small stock.   By concentrating on
cattle, the project exacerbated the equity problem in the area. At the
time of appraisal, 70% of the cattle were owned by less than 10% of the
population; 80% of the population owned virtually no cattle at all and only
a  few  small  stock.   By  concentrating  on  livestock  development,  and
particularly on cattle production, the project aimed to serve the needs of
a very small and relatively wealthy portion of the community. This portion
would have become even smaller during the project's life due to increasing
settlement  by  poor  and  cattleless  migrants.   The  project  made  no
contribution towards alleviating poverty, since none of its activities
affected the really poor people in the area.
5.9       From early on in the project, neither farmers nor stock owners
had a clear idea of exactly what the proposals and conditions of membership
in the group ranch meant.   Project staff never clearly explained this
crucial aspect. From the start, farmers were unlikely to be enthusiastic
participants, but stock owners also were hesitant to invest money in the
ranches.    Water   development   within   the   ranches   encouraged   some
participation from herders, but this was not accompanied by any level of
financial commitment.
5.10      The  decrees  and government  statutes were not  sufficient  to
resolve the conflict concerning land use and ranch development. This is
hardly surprising when one considers the complexity of the problem and the
difference between the proposed and existing situations. It is clear that
initial plans for developing the ranches were misled by overly optimistic
reports of the people's willingness to participate.  It is equally clear
that there was insufficient discussion with farmers and pastoralists before
and during the project. Discussions were held with groups, however: ending
in 1977 for the first Group Ranch, in 1980 for the second and third, and in
1981 for the fourth. These came too late and were inadequate. By 1985,
little had  changed.   Despite  statutes and discussions,  there were no



- 22 -
operational group ranches and the area was being increasingly settled by
migrants. The legal status of the land was not such an important factor at
this stage as was social situation and the attitudes and participation of
the population.
5.11      A crucial issue throughout the project was inadequate attention
to social and cultural factors. Stock owners were as unlikely to give up
animals to a centrally managed herd as crop farmers were to give up
traditional land use rights. The basic concept of the ranches, requiring
the integration of sharply contrasting and often conflicting user groups,
was unrealistic. Social cohesion and the evolution of viable groups were
unlikely under these conditions, particularly in the short time allocated
to the project. Even if this had started to develop, there would have been
a need for more social development, group organization and functional
literacy activities than envisaged in the project. Experience with later
projects has shown that these social and educational aspects are crucial in
developing range management projects.
(iii)     Inappropriate Land Use
5.12      The appraisal report recognized that ranching was a "sub-optimal"
type of land use for the project area. This recognition should have been
incorporated into project design. Since it was not, the project spent time
and money trying to encourage and develop a production system that was
technically inappropriate and which the majority of the project area's
population would not and could not follow. It is interesting to note that
the stock owners are taking up farming; in 1985, they were responsible for
some of the best stands of cereals seen in the "group ranch" area. Both
the Government and the Bank failed to pursue ideas for improving crop
development in the area by providing some balance to the livestock
component. Various suggestions were put forward, but never formalized or
put into the credit agreement or project description.
E.   Follow-up Project
5.13      A Second Livestock Project was foreseen at appraisal and was one
of the main concerns during the latter part of the project. Proposals for
a second project were prepared by a team of BDPA consultants in the second
half of 1983. This project was to cost approximately US$15 million, but
further studies were considered necessary before the details could be
finalized. It was decided that the group ranch and tse tse control work of
CARC (later to become CEZIET) would be managed by the IDA-financed
Hauts-Bassins Project. To date this has not happened.
5.14      The proposed Second Livestock Project has not gone beyond the
preparation phase, originally due to problems in clarifying government
policy. This, in turn, was aggravated by frequent changes of senior staff
and policy makers in the Ministry and the Livestock Service.   Recent
discussions with the Governtent, however, indicate that a free-standing
livestock project is not a high priority. The Government, with the Bank's
approval, is now putsuing a multi-sectoral and more integrated approach to
rural development.   Although this policy is appropriate and should be
supported, it must also be pointed out that a basic veterinary service is



- 23 -
essential, and that range management and animal production a.ctivities
deserve more attention than they have received in the past.  The most
pressing concern in the short term is the maintenance of effective
vaccination programmes, particularly against rinderpest.  If this is not
done, the national herd will be in jeopardy.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.1       The Burkina Paso Livestock Project, like many livestock projects
in Sub-Saharan Africa, had substantial problems with its range management
component.   After  changes  in  design  four  Pastoral  Associations  were
developed. They were not, however, able to control the use and management
of the ranching areas. There was a very profitable animal health component
and a livestock marketing and meat processing component which was viable,
if not durable. The following conclusions may be drawn from the experience
of the project:
(a) General
(i) Projects should not be based on a production system
which   is   inappropriate   to   the   agro-ecological
characteristics of the area, even if the system used is
relatively non-intensive, and hence unlikely to cause
ecological damage;
(ii) More attention should be given to relating the degree
of risk anticipated for a specific component to the
expected speed and estimates of success of its
Implementation. Unrealistic targets and estimates of
benefits based on limited previous experience can
commit a project to activities and investments that may
not be the most suitable or productive.
(b) Specific
(i) The social, organizational and training/education
aspects of group ranch development are crucial to
successful implementation. Without viable, motivated
and appropriately trained groups there is little point
in improving ranch infrastructure or in upgrading
stock.    Land   tenure   issues   require   special
consideration, but their solutions should develop in
association with, rather than in isolation from, the
development of group ranches or producer groups;
(ii) The project aggravated the inequality of incoma
distribution in the project area by concentrating on
livestock, and on cattle in particular. This point and
the previous one underscore the need to understand and
respond to the real needs of the majority of the
population in the project area; and



- 24 -
(iii) Burkina needs to diversify public services to the
livestock sector and put more emphasis on range
management and on production of small stock, poultry
and fodder. The past concentration on animal health,
particularly cattle diseases, must not be allowed to
continue.   Basic veterinary  services are essential,
however, to protect the valuable resource of the
national herd.

Subject:  Comments on the West Volta Livestock Project (PEOV 557-WN)
Dear Sir:
I am pleased to submit comments arising out of the livestock
project (557-WV) completion report.
Generally speaking, the report contains an objective assessment
of the execution of the West Volta Livestock Project. It therefore differs
little, basically, from the report drafted by the Government of Burkina
Faso. Overall we are in agreement with the conclusions shown on page 23 as
regards both execution of the project and the results obtained in the
field. There are some aspects that could be improved, however, as well as
some comments that do not seem fully justified.
Our first comment relates to Chapter 44 (presumably IV - TR.):
Agricultural  Impact  and Rate  of Return.   We  feel  that  the  rational
utilization of pastures, which was considerk.d to be the main issue, should
be viewed within the framework of the Group Ranch component. This aspect
of project execution, although difficult to evaluate, is nevertheless an
important achievement and for the Government this constitutes a start in
the process of solving some of its main concerns: halting the degradation
of pasturing areas based on a fight against brush fires, and the
abandonment of shifting cultivation among farmers. This result, which has
been brought about to some extent thanks to the Group Ranch program, has
had  a visible  economic  impact.   Even  if  only partial,  the  fact  of
environmental protection does need to be recognized.
Paragraph 2.36 - Costs, Financing and Disbursement:  We do not
agree with the suggestion that the reasons for the change in the pattern of
expenditures between project appraisal and execution lie, inter alia, in
inadequate resource management and insufficient monitoring of expenditure
by functional unit. Changes in the breakdown of expenditures were due
mainly to changes in the objectives assigned to the project during

execution. These changes became necessary in view of the situation found
in the field during project execution. In the first place there was the
strengthening of the Project Unit through the creation of such new
functions as engineering and veterinary monitoring, and the strengthening
of accounting at the ORDs that was required to fill some gaps discovered in
the administrative organization.
This explains the changes in the financial package for the
Project Unit that occurred between project appraisal and implementation.
These changes were in fact undertaken by agreement between the Government
and the World Bank.
As regards the Group Ranch Development Center-CARC, the main
reason for the financing changes was similar in nature. It was necessary
to adjust the projected financing for each ranch by assigning additional
funds to the Group Ranch Development Center in order to enable it to
undertake the work that the local ventures were not in a position to
undertake.  This  change  in the  financial package,  which was made by
agreement between the Government and the World Bank, was due to the
addition of this responsibility to the activities of this Group Ranch
Development Center.
Yours sincerely,
isl illegible
Secretary General
