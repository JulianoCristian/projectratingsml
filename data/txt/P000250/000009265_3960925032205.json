The\n            project was the Bank's first livestock-related\n            investment in Burkina. At the time of preparation,\n            agriculture was the most important economic activity,\n            employing between 80-90 percent of the population. Within\n            this sector, livestock represents an important resource,\n            providing approximately 10 percent of the Gross Domestic\n            Product (GDP) and 50 percent of recorded exports. The great\n            majority of the national herd is owned and managed by Fulani\n            pastoralists. There is little integration of livestock into\n            the farming systems and little use of modern production\n            techniques. Traditional production rates are low, due to\n            disease, poor pasture and herd management, low and erratic\n            rainfall, and poor genetic potential. The aim of the project\n            was to assist some 300,000 traditional cattle producers\n            through a program of group ranch development, improved\n            livestock marketing facilities, meat processing, and\n            veterinary services."}, "docdt": "1987-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
