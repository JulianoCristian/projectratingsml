{"cdata!": "The ratings summary for the Justice\n            Services Improvement Project in Peru are as follows:\n            Outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. One overarching theme\n            or impact from this Project has been the inter-institutional\n            coordination and collaboration that it has fostered across\n            the sector. When the Project began, these participating\n            agencies barely dealt directly with each other to resolve\n            sector issues, choosing instead to fight it out in the\n            press. Today, with the support of the Project, these\n            agencies (through technical staff as well as the agency\n            heads) have reached out to each other, and even joined\n            forces to show unity in their request to the Ministry of\n            Economy and Finance for a next phase. It is a noteworthy\n            impact that the Project has contributed to the maturity of\n            the sector and its development in this regard. One of the\n            Project\u0092s important achievements can be found under\n            Component 3 which financed a National Program on Legal\n            Education for Social Inclusion (PRONELIS) Programa Nacional\n            de Ense\u00f1anza Legal para la Inclusi\u00f3n Social) through support\n            to the Ministry of Justice (MINJUS). While a follow-on\n            project reflects a strong commitment of the key agencies, an\n            important lesson learned is the need to have better\n            communicated the Project\u0092s outputs. The achievements of this\n            Project have largely been seen or felt by agency staff\n            themselves or at the local level of users in communities.\n            Information campaigns and greater outreach to the public at\n            the national level to reach potential users of justice\n            services could have further strengthened reform efforts in\n            the sector. The use of greater public outreach to share the\n            outcomes of the Project with Peruvian society is a related\n            lesson in this sense."}, "docdt": "2010-12-25T00:00:00Z"}
