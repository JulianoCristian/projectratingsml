justice\n            sector. Specific objectives will be: (a) to strengthen\n            institutional capacity to lead the reform process and\n            achieve specific improvements in justice services delivery,\n            in particular in the Judiciary and in selected project\n            districts; (b) to establish human resource management\n            systems that ensure independence, transparency and\n            integrity; and (c) to enhance access to justice services for\n            the Peruvian society, in particular the poor (the three main\n            components beside project management).  The three main\n            components have an interrelated national and regional focus.\n            The Justice Services Delivery component will support central\n            as well as regional planning, plus court administration and\n            operation improvements. It will focus initially on 4\n            selected judicial districts, which are representative of the\n            variety of the Peruvian demand for justice services,\n            including such factors as workload and social and\n            demographic aspects (poverty indicators o f beneficiary\n            populations, access needs, proportion of indigenous\n            populations). While the Justice Services Delivery component\n            includes both national and regional level support, the\n            Judicial Human Resource Professional Development component\n            is national in scope, as is the Enhanced Access to Justice\n            component. Both these two components include broad policy\n            aspects and promote inter-institutional coordination to\n            improve the supply of justice services."}, "docdt": "2004-02-09T00:00:00Z"}
