    ARGENTINA - EMERGENCY PROJECT FOR THE PREVENTION AND
  MANAGEMENT OF INFLUENZA TYPE ILLNESS AND STRENGTHENING OF
            ARGENTINA'S EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SYSTEM

                                  Restructuring Paper

A. SUMMARY

1.     This paper proposes a second extension of the closing date for the Argentina,
Emergency Project for the Prevention and Management of Influenza Type Illness and
Strengthening of Argentina’s Epidemiological System (Loan No 7483-AR) by 9 months,
from March 31, 2013 until December 31, 2013. The cumulative extension would be for
21 months, and no further extensions are expected.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.        The A/H1N1 Project was prepared under OP/BP 8.00 Rapid Response to Crisis
and Emergencies, and was approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the World
Bank on February 23, 2010. It was declared effective on April 14, 2010. Two
restructurings have been approved. On April 27, 2011 the Project was restructured to: (i)
process a partial cancelation of US$88 million of the loan amount; and (ii) reallocate loan
proceeds. A second restructuring was approved on March 9, 2012 to: (i) extend the
Project’s closing date by 12 months from March 31, 2012, to March 31, 2013, (ii) adjust
the Project indicators in Table 1 of the Emergency Project Paper, and (iii) reallocate loan
proceeds. As of February 15, 2013, the Project disbursed US$139.5 million of the loan
amount (98.9%), and has an undisbursed balance of US$1.5 million (1.1%).

3.       The Project’s Development Objective is to support the Nation’s high-level
objective to reduce its burden of disease related to infectious and transmitted diseases,
and specifically acute respiratory infections (ARI). This requires improvements to the
Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and its epidemiological surveillance system
for the prevention and control of influenza-related illness, through strengthening the
capacity of Argentina’s epidemiological health surveillance system to: (a) prevent,
monitor and evaluate influenza activity; and (b) control epidemic waves of A/H1N1
influenza.

4.     The Project's implementation progress and progress towards achieving the Project
Development Objectives (PDO) are rated satisfactory, especially because of the
achievement of the A/H1N1 influenza vaccination coverage indicator, the Project's
contribution to strengthening the National Health Surveillance System (SNVS), and the
reduction of all types of influenza-like illness in the country. In addition, the Project
demonstrated highly satisfactory compliance with safeguards, and achieved high levels of
coordination between the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the provinces, through the
implementation of Provincial health situation rooms. To date the Project already achieved
the PDO indicator and met the target for 12 out of 14 intermediate outcome indicators
(PDI).


                                            5
5.       The proposed extension will allow the Project to achieve the targets of the two
remaining PDIs: (i) Number of situation analysis rooms certified and (ii) Number of
situation rooms that achieve a highly satisfactory level of accreditation at the end of the
Project (above 80 percent). These indicators are associated with one of the results-based
activities (output) financed by the Project under Component 1: "Health Situation Rooms
Certification". This output aims at strengthening the epidemiological surveillance system
for influenza and at improving the technical analysis carried out by the health situations
rooms that have been established in all 24 Provinces. The current value of these
indicators is zero because they have been introduced during the last Project restructuring
(March 2012) and the Provincial Ministries of Health need additional time to gather all
the documentation required to complete the third and last independent certification
process currently underway. This documentation will provide the necessary information
to measure both indicators and is expected to be completed by December 2013.

6.       Moreover, the extension would allow three ongoing activities, related with the
strengthening of the Argentine epidemiological surveillance and mobile emergency
systems, to be completed. These activities are: (i) operational research activities at the
Provincial level; (ii) epidemiological postgraduate courses for training more than 200
officials; (iii) purchase of ambulances for emergencies. In all cases, remedial actions have
been taken and implementation has moved forward. The Borrower has put an action plan
in place to complete all the activities related to the Project. Completion of project
activities and full disbursement of loan proceeds is expected by December 2013.
