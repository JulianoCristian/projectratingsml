7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The proposed project would contribute to the Nation#s higher-level objective of reducing its burden of
disease related to infectious and transmitted diseases, specifically of Acute Respiratory Infections, by
improving the EPI program and its epidemiological surveillance system for the prevention and control of
influenza related illness. The Project would strengthen the capacity of Argentina#s epidemiological health
surveillance system: (a) to prevent, monitor and evaluate influenza activity and (b) to control epidemic
waves of A/H1N1 influenza. These objectives will be implemented through key actions oriented to: (i)
expand and improve the quality of the epidemiological surveillance system for the timely detection of
reported cases of influenza-like illness, (ii) increase the coordination with the animal health
epidemiological surveillance, (iii) implement culturally adequate media campaigns at the local level for
prevention and to increase population#s responsiveness to vaccination, (iv) vaccinate 8.5 million prioritized
people to help reduce the communicability of the A/H1N1 virus, and mortality in the population, (v)
improve the access to ambulatory antiviral treatment for symptomatic patients, (vi) improve the response
capacity of hospital-based services, (vii) use of laboratory tests for epidemiological purposes, and (viii)
conduct specific operational research activities related to the pandemic, to establish the trend and the
evolution of the disease.
