                         contributing significantly to improvements in public health using a results-based financing approach.

                         The Project has met its development objective as measured by one Project Development Objective (PDO) indicator – direct project beneficiaries, for which end of Project results
                         surpassed the expected target by 55%. In addition, eleven out of fourteen intermediate results indicators were also achieved, and in many cases surpassed as evidenced in the

                         Project results table. For instance, the national coverage of the A/H1N1 vaccine included into the annual National Calendar of the Expanded Program of Immunizations (EPI) for 2013
                         was 91% of the targeted population at risk, surpassing the Project target of 90%. This accounts for the highest coverage rate of the eligible population in the Latin America Region for
                         the winter season. Also remarkable are the implementation of 37 Provincial Health Situations Room and the strengthening of the surveillance systems that will contribute to improve
                         Argentina's responsiveness to future health emergencies.

                         All project activities were finalized, and 100% of loan funds have been disbursed and will be documented before April 2014.
