                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project would contribute to the Nation#s higher-level objective of reducing its burden of disease related to infectious and transmitted diseases,
                         specifically of Acute Respiratory Infections, by improving the EPI program and its epidemiological surveillance system for the prevention and control of influenza related
                         illness. The Project would strengthen the capacity of Argentina#s epidemiological health surveillance system: (a) to prevent, monitor and evaluate influenza activity and
                         (b) to control epidemic waves of A/H1N1 influenza. These objectives will be implemented through key actions oriented to: (i) expand and improve the quality of the
                         epidemiological surveillance system for the timely detection of reported cases of influenza-like illness, (ii) increase the coordination with the animal health
                         epidemiological surveillance, (iii) implement culturally adequate media campaigns at the local level for prevention and to increase population#s responsiveness to
                         vaccination, (iv) vaccinate 8.5 million prioritized people to help reduce the communicability of the A/H1N1 virus, and mortality in the population, (v) improve the access to
                         ambulatory antiviral treatment for symptomatic patients, (vi) improve the response capacity of hospital-based services, (vii) use of laboratory tests for epidemiological
                         purposes, and (viii) conduct specific operational research activities related to the pandemic, to establish the trend and the evolution of the disease.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress on the achievement of the project objectives continues to be satisfactory; the project has currently met 11 out of 14 indicators and the achievement of the remaining three
                         indicators are expected to be achieved during 2012 when the processes related to the certification of situation rooms and AH1N1 and Pneumococcal vaccinations included in the
                         National Calendar end and after the completion of the agreed action plan with the Government to improve the report of pneumococcal vaccine applied in the 2010/2011 campaign.

                         The project also has highly satisfactory safeguards compliance, and has achieved excellent levels of coordination between the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Provinces, as well as
                         within different units of the MoH (Department of Epidemiology, Vaccines Unit-EPI, Surveillance Units and Hospitals), contributing to strengthening surveillance and decision-making of
                         health policy through the implementation of the situation rooms.

                         The procurement process regarding the mobile systems for adult emergencies in the overall country has already finished and the units are in the delivery process. However, the
                         procurement process for mobile systems for child emergencies is still underway.

                         The project was restructured in March 2012to: (i) extend the project s closing date by12 months (current closing date is March 31, 2013); (ii) reallocate the loan proceeds mainly to
                         finance an additional year for the operating Situation Rooms, and to consolidate the achievements of the epidemiological surveillance systems; and (iii) adjust the Project Indicators
                         so as to improve monitoring of Project performance without modifying the Project's outcomes.
