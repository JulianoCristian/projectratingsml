Strengthening of\n            Argentina's Epidemiological System Project for\n            Argentina were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome or global environment outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, Borrower (of\n            guaranteed loan) and implementing party performance was\n            satisfactory, and Government performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: Argentina's adoption of\n            a high-risk targeted vaccination strategy against A-H1N1\n            influenza was effective in containing the epidemic. A\n            comprehensive (human and animal) pandemic preparedness plan\n            will benefit from moving from a response approach using\n            emergency instruments to one that favors preventive risk\n            reduction and risk management through regular country\n            program and operations. High-risk groups can only be reached\n            through an intense communication effort. Despite a short\n            preparation period, it is important to avoid having tunnel\n            vision and think broadly when designing emergency loans. The\n            execution of projects within existing technical and\n            administrative structures has significant positive\n            externalities. A result-based financing (RBF) model is a\n            valuable strategy to influence subnational government\n            policies in federal systems. The World Bank should\n            re-evaluate the objective of the emergency recovery loan\n            instrument and its consistency with other fiduciary policies."}, "docdt": "2014-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
