                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project would contribute to the Nation#s higher-level objective of reducing its burden of disease related to infectious and transmitted diseases,
                         specifically of Acute Respiratory Infections, by improving the EPI program and its epidemiological surveillance system for the prevention and control of influenza related
                         illness. The Project would strengthen the capacity of Argentina#s epidemiological health surveillance system: (a) to prevent, monitor and evaluate influenza activity and
                         (b) to control epidemic waves of A/H1N1 influenza. These objectives will be implemented through key actions oriented to: (i) expand and improve the quality of the
                         epidemiological surveillance system for the timely detection of reported cases of influenza-like illness, (ii) increase the coordination with the animal health
                         epidemiological surveillance, (iii) implement culturally adequate media campaigns at the local level for prevention and to increase population#s responsiveness to
                         vaccination, (iv) vaccinate 8.5 million prioritized people to help reduce the communicability of the A/H1N1 virus, and mortality in the population, (v) improve the access to
                         ambulatory antiviral treatment for symptomatic patients, (vi) improve the response capacity of hospital-based services, (vii) use of laboratory tests for epidemiological
                         purposes, and (viii) conduct specific operational research activities related to the pandemic, to establish the trend and the evolution of the disease.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project's overall implementation progress is satisfactory, and the Mid Term Review (MTR) carried out between November 17-22, 2011 showed that progress on achievement of the
                         project objectives is satisfactory, in particular given the achievement of the flagship indicator of A/H1N1 vaccination coverage, the project's contribution to the Nation's epidemiological
                         surveillance system (SNVS), and country's important reduction of all types of influenza-like illness. However, regarding the Pneumococcal vaccine indicator, the MOH certified only
                         366.177 of vaccines applied out of 700.000 expected doses; 52% of coverage while the target for the indicator was 90%.The Government explained that the main reason for not
                         achieving the target was the underreporting of doses applied in the health facilities, and the insufficient coverage due to the recent introduction of the vaccine in the country
                         vaccination schedule. The project also has highly satisfactory safeguards compliance, and has achieved high levels of coordination between the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the
                         Provinces, as well as within different units of the MoH (Department of Epidemiology, Vaccines Unit-EPI, Surveillance Units and Hospitals). The mission evaluated positively the
                         project´s contribution to strengthen the National SNVS in the area of infectious diseases. The MoH requested Project's extension due to the need to consolidate achievements in the
                         epidemiological surveillance system, in particular to improve the results of the Pneumoccocal vaccination campaign to be incorporated in the regular 2012 vaccination calendar, and
                         finalize procurement process initiated regarding the strengthening of the mobile systems for emergencies in the whole country.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A Mid Term Evaluation mission was carried out between November 17-22, 2011, in order to (i) review progress in project implementation and main actions, (ii) review the financial
                         and procurement aspects of project implementation; (iii) evaluate the project´s important contribution to the strengthening of the National Surveillance System (SNVS); (iv) review the
                         design of the project´s Impact Evaluation, and (v) discuss a project restructuring including a potential extension. Supervision under the MTR included field visits to the Provinces of
                         Mendoza, Salta and Buenos Aires to evaluate the implementation of the Situation Rooms.
