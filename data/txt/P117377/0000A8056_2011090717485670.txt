                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project would contribute to the Nation#s higher-level objective of reducing its burden of disease related to infectious and transmitted diseases,
                         specifically of Acute Respiratory Infections, by improving the EPI program and its epidemiological surveillance system for the prevention and control of
                         influenza related illness. The Project would strengthen the capacity of Argentina#s epidemiological health surveillance system: (a) to prevent, monitor and
                         evaluate influenza activity and (b) to control epidemic waves of A/H1N1 influenza. These objectives will be implemented through key actions oriented to: (i)
                         expand and improve the quality of the epidemiological surveillance system for the timely detection of reported cases of influenza-like illness, (ii) increase the
                         coordination with the animal health epidemiological surveillance, (iii) implement culturally adequate media campaigns at the local level for prevention and to
                         increase population#s responsiveness to vaccination, (iv) vaccinate 8.5 million prioritized people to help reduce the communicability of the A/H1N1 virus, and
                         mortality in the population, (v) improve the access to ambulatory antiviral treatment for symptomatic patients, (vi) improve the response capacity of hospital-
                         based services, (vii) use of laboratory tests for epidemiological purposes, and (viii) conduct specific operational research activities related to the pandemic, to
                         establish the trend and the evolution of the disease.

                         Progress on achievement of the project objectives is Satisfactory, in particular given the early achievement of the flagship indicator of A/H1N1 vaccination coverage. The Project also
                         has highly satisfactory safeguards compliance, and has achieved high levels of Coordination between the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Provinces, as well as within different units
                         of the MoH (Department of Epidemiology, Vaccines Unit (EPI), Surveillance Units and Hospitals). The Government's request to cancel a retroactive portion of the loan in the amount
                         of US$88 million out of the total US$229 million loan amount has been processed and approved by the Bank on April 27,2011.
