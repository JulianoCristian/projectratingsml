Rehabilitation Project will\n            assist the Government in its efforts to achieve quick\n            economic recovery through the increased production of cocoa\n            and in reaching its longer term objectives for the\n            development of the agriculture sector as a whole.  To\n            achieve these objectives, the project will, first, increase\n            production and improve workers' social conditions in\n            two cocoa plantations (Bela Vista and Uba Budo), and,\n            second, reinforce Sao Tome and Principe's (STP)\n            agriculture sector.  The project will accomplish this latter\n            item by facilitating future financing of other plantations\n            in the cocoa subsector; creating applied research capacities\n            in the food crop subsector; (iii) supporting smallholders\n            development; and (iv) addressing other issues through\n            studies and consulting services.  This latter element will\n            assist the Government in formulating and implementing its\n            policies, in diversifying  its agricultural base, and in\n            shifting the status of its state enterprises to that of\n            mixed-economy enterprises."}, "docdt": "1987-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
