sustainable access to water for\n            potable, municipal, industrial, and irrigation uses in\n            priority river basins, primarily in areas with high\n            concentration of poor rural households; b) promote\n            participatory management and rational use of water\n            resources, focusing on three priority river basins,\n            Itapicuru, Jacare-Verde and Alto Paraguacu; c) develop\n            sustainable administration, operation and management systems\n            for rural water supply and irrigation infrastructure; and d)\n            develop an institutional model/prototype for all the river\n            basins within Bahia, with concepts which could be applicable\n            to other states. The project has two components: 1) water\n            resources management, to provide the necessary technical and\n            financial resources to strengthen the State of Bahia's\n            basins and user level institutions to effectively manage\n            water resources; and 2) infrastructure investments, to\n            finance the construction and rehabilitation of water\n            resources storage and distribution infrastructure in the\n            Itapicuru River Basin."}, "docdt": "1997-08-20T00:00:00Z"}
