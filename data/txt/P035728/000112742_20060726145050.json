Key lessons learned include: Reforms take\n            considerable time and effort to build consensus and\n            political support.  In dam construction the site selection\n            should be based on multiple evaluation criteria and diverse\n            water uses to maximize benefits while minimizing risks. An\n            integrated approach to rural development in a water scarce\n            semi-arid region should center on improving the availability\n            of reliable water resource for the different users. The\n            demand for water is beyond social and economic needs and a\n            project has to cater to satisfy multiple demands. In\n            addition, the overall demand for water needs to take into\n            account for ecological demand to satisfy the environmental\n            needs. Resettlement can be an effective instrument for\n            poverty alleviation if it is participatory and the support\n            is comprehensive. The existence of pilot to demonstrate to\n            the potential settlers is an important ingredient to garner\n            the confidence of settlers and for them to make an informed\n            decision.  Contracting or outsourcing some activities is\n            cost-effective and efficient, reducing the public sectors\n            burden and allowing the Government to focus on its normative\n            roles.  Successful piloting creates its own incentive to\n            replicate the experience in other places."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
