{"cdata!": "This is an environmental assessment of\n            the Water Resources Management Project for Bahia, Brazil,\n            which, focusing on three priority river basins, establishes\n            the regulatory and institutional frameworks to form and\n            implement efficient and sustainable water resources\n            management policies and plans; and finances the building and\n            repair of water storage and distribution infrastructure.\n            Negative environmental impacts caused by the Ponto Novo\n            reservoir include submersing the mata ciliar (a protective\n            vegetation that helps maintain the stability of the\n            riverbanks); altering water quality; changing the vegetative\n            cover; damaging the vegetation on the reservoir's\n            perimeter; accelerating erosion; and modifying the behavior\n            of aquatic organisms. The mitigative measures are to form a\n            technical commission for environmental management and a\n            vegetative growth clearing plan for the flooded area;\n            collect fruits/seeds from the flooded area; protect areas\n            with deposits of building materials and wastes; provide\n            adequate disposal of petroleum wastes and control dust;\n            educate construction workers about the environment; devise a\n            water quality recovery plan; rebuild and relocate roads and\n            electrical lines; control activities and transit around the\n            reservoir and river bank; and measure the impact on\n            indigenous species while stocking the reservoir with fish. A\n            resettlement plan assists in restoring or improving living\n            conditions for the displaced population, and offers them\n            compensation options."}, "docdt": "1997-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
