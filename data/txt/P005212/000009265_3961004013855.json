           research and extension in the four subprojects; and (c)\n            improve the planning and implementation capacity of sector\n            institutions.  The project comprises the improvement and\n            upgrading of four existing irrigation and drainage systems\n            serving a total net irrigable area of about 90,600 ha and on\n            an additional 16,400 ha.  The subprojects are Behbahan in\n            Khuzestan province, Moghan in East Azerbaijan, Zarrieneh\n            Roud in West Azerbaijan and Tajan in Mazanderan.  Existing\n            main and secondary canals will be provided with concrete\n            linings, and in some areas new canals will be added.  Main\n            and secondary drains will be improved and expanded to cover\n            all the subproject areas.  The tertiary systems will be\n            developed selectively using canalletes, concrete-lined\n            laterals, and open drains.  On-farm development will include\n            selective subsurface drainage and land levelling with an\n            emphasis on water management at the tertiary and farm\n            levels.  The Agricultural Service Centers and research\n            stations serving the project area will be reinforced through\n            the upgrading of existing staff, the construction of\n            facilities and the provision of additional staff, vehicles\n            and specialized equipment. Provision will also be made for\n            the import and sale of specialized farm machinery.  Special\n            emphasis will be given to strengthening the operation and\n            maintenance of all facilities from the main down to the\n            tertiary system, to developing farmer participation through\n            user groups, and to addressing critical environmental issues."}, "docdt": "1993-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
