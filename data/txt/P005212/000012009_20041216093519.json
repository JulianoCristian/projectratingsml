As for the Irrigation Improvement Project\n            (IIP), ratings differ from the ICR's, in that project\n            outcome, sustainability, and institutional development\n            impacts are downgraded to moderately satisfactory, likely,\n            and modest respectively, but concurs on satisfactory\n            performances by the Bank and Borrower. Experience confirms a\n            number of the Operations Evaluation Department - OED -\n            lessons: It is essential to understand sector institutions,\n            their governance, incentive structures, and\n            interrelationships before finalizing an investment\n            operation. A first step is to ensure that all stakeholders\n            are identified, and participate in project design. Failure\n            to do so risks that some objectives will not be fully owned,\n            and that lack of cooperation among key organizations, will\n            jeopardize achievements. Whatever water infrastructure is\n            provided or improved, a fundamental requirement for\n            sustainability is building adequate technical, and\n            beneficiary capacity to allow an integrated operation and\n            maintenance, as well as a dispute resolution mechanism. This\n            is particularly important when management is devolved\n            hierarchically, and separated between a public service\n            provider, and private users groups. Many countries have\n            excellent human and technical resources, particularly in the\n            private sector, and good project design needs to carefully\n            balance the type, scale, and use of external and internal\n            consultants. Too much foreign technical assistance\n            undermines local ownership, and causes resentment - too\n            little, risks inadequate capacity-building. Water\n            conservation is difficult to achieve if the water fee\n            structure is not linked to volumes of water used. In turn\n            this requires investment in water measurement, monitoring\n            and recording equipment, and a willingness to abandon the\n            crop and area basis for charging, as it provides no\n            incentive to farmers to conserve water."}, "docdt": "2004-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
