The main lessons follow. It is\n            suggested that the broad project objectives, and the vast\n            geographical spread in different subproject areas, were\n            overly ambitious, of particular importance since over a long\n            period, the Bank had suspended lending to Iran. Rather, the\n            project design should have been conservative, given this\n            extended lending inactivity, while the agencies'\n            implementing capacity was also overestimated, whose failures\n            were reflected in its weak staff capacity, all factors that\n            influenced negatively in the implementation process. Another\n            reason for the implementing inability, was the fact that the\n            financial resources foreseen for the Department of\n            Environment (DOE), were allocated to the Ministry of\n            Agriculture budget, and this lack of counterpart funds\n            resulted in the under allocation of budget to DOE, which\n            included project management inefficiency, and procurement\n            problems. Additionally, beneficiary participation would have\n            allowed faster irrigation implementation works, as\n            demonstrated by their involvement at a later stage, creating\n            the ownership, instrumental to achieve sustainable water\n            management. Similarly, operation and maintenance should have\n            been prepared early on, to ensure investments sustainability."}, "docdt": "2001-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
