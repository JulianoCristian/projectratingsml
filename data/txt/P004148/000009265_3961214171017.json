The objectives of the project were to\n            (a) support the development of onc of the Ieast developed\n            regions in Korea; (b) improve and expand water supply to\n            about 96 of the population in Kwangju Mctropolitan Area\n            (KMA) by 2001 and thus serve most of the region's\n            loss-income population; (c) ensure efficient use of scarce\n            water resources, (d) strengthen Kvangju Water Agency\n            (KWA's)  and Korea Water Resources Corporation\n            (KOWACO's) planning capacity and finances; and (e)\n            support institutional improvements in the sector These\n            objectives were consistent with the Korean sectoral\n            objectives, supported by the Bank, of increased focus on\n            social lending, environmental improvement, and institutional\n            development by transfer of technology. The project's\n            covenants provided a framework for financial discipline, and\n            supported the objectives of achieving and maintaining\n            satisfactory performance, consistent with appropriate\n            national economic and social objectives. The main lessons to\n            be drawn from the experience of implementation of the\n            project are. training of KWA staff on the new facilities\n            needs to be improved and guided by specialists in latest\n            technology; the importance of setting adequate tariffs has\n            to be understood by all involved agencies to ensure timely\n            funding of development projects; the means of achieving the\n            targets set in financial covenants to generate adequate\n            revenues can depend on national fiscal policies outside the\n            control of the borrower. In these cases, assurances should\n            be received that adequate funds for the operation of\n            facilities are made available."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
