JUAM REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN 3178-KO)
Evaluation Summary
A. Introduction
(I)    The Juam Regional Water Supply Project was designcd to incrcase the water supply in for
thc Kwangju Metropolitan Arca (KMA), a loss-incomc regioni in south\csterm Korca the KMA
includes Kwangjui City and eight other neighboring municipalities  Bcfore the project, the KMA
%Nas suffering from serious water shortage problems that wsere hampcring dcvelopnient Kwangju
City %Nas about to begin water rationing in 1990, and access to public %satcr supply in the other
municipalities w%as either non-existent or rationed The project was designcd to provide water to the
KMA from thc already constructed (1991) Juam Dam  A brief description of the luam Regional
Water Supply System appears in Appendix B
B. Project Objectives
(ii)    The objectives of the project %%ere to (a) support the development of onc of the Ieast
developed regions in Korea; (b) improve and expand water supply to about 96% of the population
in KlIA by 2001 and thus serve most of the region's loss-income population; (c) ensure efficient
usc of scarcc ssater resources, (d) strengthen KWA's and KOWACO's planning capacity and
finances; and (e) support institutional improvements in the sector These objectives were consistent
with the Korean sectoral objectives, supported by the Bank, of increased focus on social lending,
environmental improvcment, and institutional development by transfer of technology It should be
noted that the timing of the objective of expanding water supply to 96% of the population (by
2001) was sonse%hat outside thc timcframe of the project, but is nonetheiess a reasonable
objecti%c, %shich is well on the ssav to being nict
(iii)   To expand tic w%atcr supply made available under this projcct, it was necessary for
Kssaiigju City and the eight adjaccnt municipalitics to construct, wvith their own funds and local
loans, complcmcntary works, including a water treatmcnt plant (WTP) in Kwvangju and distribution
systcms in KMA and the municipalitics, not later than Dccember 1993
(Iv)    The projcct's covenants provided a framcwork for financial discipline, and supported the
objectives of achieving and maintaining satisfactory performance, consistent with appropriate
national economic and social objectives  This, in tum, supported the objectives of improving
institutional capacity and strengthening KWA's and KOWACO's planning capacity and financial
picture. Both KOWACO and KWA wvere required to set tariffs yilciding adequate revenues to mect
operation and maintenance costs including deprcciation, administrative expenses, and providing
rates of return on nct revalued fixed assets in operation
(v)    To further develop institutional capacity, KWA's manually prepared planning and
budgeting systems necdcd to bc modernized and, in addition, a management information system
ssas to be introduced with monthly water demand, income and expenditure, which wsere to be sent
to the Bank every' six months



iii
C. Iniplenientation Experience and Results
(vh) The project ssas %ell prcparcd  Thc plainimc g%as sound and thc results wsould suggest that
the project w%as wecll fouided, and the agrecncmts reachcd to promote realization of the objectives
werc realistic and %%ell conccixcd. The physical obhictwscs wecrc achiccd and the project benefits
arc sLustainable with clear support of' thc goserninncnt anid the nianagemenit and the proficiency of
KOWACO  which will opcratc thc s%stcii  The institutional objccti,cs were partially achievcd.
While non-revenuic watcr control et'forts w%erc successful, taiiffs did iiot keep pace witLh legal
covcnants   While wxater pricinig w.as not fulk satisfsctorix  ho,evcr, this did not interfcrc in
achieving the important obtectuve of niainmaiiiig eficctve aiid fcf'icicnt opcrations and maintenance
as funds for thcc purposes %vere provided froiii otler sources  Ovcrall. the performance of the
project wvas satisfactory
(smi)   The projcct delivered the water supply in thc volumes ariticipated. although a two year
dclay in completiorn of the project rcsultcd from  imisufficient national budget allocations  The
quality of the works wvas higih  Leakage was expericnced in the projcct tunncis due to an
operational accidcnt svhile testing comiiplcted works, which lcd to daniage to adjacent farm land.
Repair work to correct the leaks w%as completcd at the end of 1995
(viii)   The complementary works in KMA and the other municipalitics have becn completed to a
satisfactory standard, and havc resulted in water demand being met in Kwangju City after many
)cars of shortages. Thc project was modificd so that Mokpo town could be supplied from  an
cxtension of dic raw swater pipeline supplying Kw9angju City. The resulting reduced supply to
Kwangju City will be made up froni additional water froni the sccond stage of the Juam scheme,
presently schcduled for completion in 1998.
(ix)    The cstimated project cost at appraisal was US$ 183 0 million, of w%hich US$ 34 0 million
equivalent was to bc financcd by the Bank, with the balance from governmcnt contributions. Thc
actual cost of the projcct, including interest during constructioni, svas USS 150.3 million, not
incliding US$ 61.3 million for the Mokpo extension. In 1993, the Bank loan %sas rcduccd by a
canccilation of USS I 7 million cquivalcnt from savings nmade on equipmcnt and supplics, and US$
4.3 million cquivalcnt wsas cancclcd w%hcn the loan wvas closed on Dcccmber 31, 1994. Thus, the
nct loan aniount was US$ 28.0 million equivalcnt The economic rate of return expected at
appraisal w%as 8 0 pcrcent. The recalculation using dhe financial rate of return as a mcasure and
bascd on actual data including thc cxtensioni to Mokpo is 7.0 percent, which is adequate
considering the social naturc of the project.
(x)     KOWACO operates a uniform  w%atcr tariff policy, and any increase in its tanffs has a
knock-on effect on ovcr half the watcr companics in Korca  Due to Govemment's anti-inflation
politics in the carly 1990s, it was decidcd to scale dosn the incrcascs in KOWACO's tariffs, and
any shortagc of rcsources for opcrations and maintcnance of the corporation's facilities w%ould be
made up from fuinds generated form the sale of the corporation's land dcvclopmcnts. Duc to the
delay in raising watcr tariffs, KOWACO and KWA did not attain financial self-sufficicncy as
cnvisagcd during appraisal, but both agcncies rcceived adequate funds from othcr sourccs to
cfficicntly manage and opcrate thcir facilitics, thus meeting a major financial objective.
(xi)    Whilc it w%as intcndcd that KOWACO's w%ould be responsibic, beginning in 1990, for
financing constmction of all dams and regional water supply systcms from its owvn resources,
future self-sufficiency is still planned The current plan is that KOWACO will contribute 30% to



devclopment front 1996, and tariffs levels would bc increased in steps to achieve the required level
by 1999, by which time it %%ould meet its 5% rate of return target Nonetheless, since KOWACO
failcd to meet the agreed rate or rctumn concnant and to provide an acceptable action plan to correct
the situation, the last request for extension of the loan closing date was not accepted by the Bank.
D. Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
(xii)   Thc project was complcted after a twvo year delay, w%ith a modification to supply Mokpo
town w%ith raw%  w%ater front the Kwangju pipeline  The actual projcct cost w%ithout Mokpo
modification was IX% less than projectcd during appraisal, and w%ith the modification was 16%
above die projectionl
(xiii)  The complctcd  w%orks %%ill be operated atid  maintained  by  KOWACO, and  the
complemcntary w%orks by KWA and the niunicipalities  All thcsc agencics are cxperienced in
operating similar systems, and havc satisfactory nsanagemcnt and staff in sufficient numbers to
carry out the w%ork Financial performance is expected to be satisfactory
(xiv) The main lessons to bc drawvis from the cxperience of implenscntation of thc project are.
(a)    training of KWA staffon the nev facilities needs to bc improved and guided by
specialists in latest technology,
(b)    the importance of setting adequate tanffs has to be understood by all involved
agcncies to ensure timcly funding of developmcnt projects,
(c)    the means of achicving the targcts set in financial cov cnants to gcnerate adequate
rcvenucs can depend on national fiscal policies outside the control of the borroser.
In these cases, assuranccs should be rcceived that adcquatc funds for the operation
of facilities are niade available

JUA19 REGIONAL WATER SU;PPLY PROJECT
(LOAN 3178-KO)
PART 1: PROJECT IMPLEMENIATION ASSESSNIENT
A. Introductiojn
I      Bank lendinig during the past fev, scars in Korea has focused on sectoral lcnding,
particularly for social sectors, cnvironmental improvensicnt, institutional development, and transfcr
of tcchnology  In line with thc Bank's stratcg%, the JLtani Rcgional Watcr Supply Project
supportced the dceelopment of one of the country's least-dcveloped regions, vith emphasis on
cxpanding services to the lowv iiconic scction of the urban population  The Bank's continued
involvement has been instruniental in helping the gosemnsent to dcvelop a well-conceived
institutional framcework and policies itn the scctor
2      The Korea Water Resources Corporation (KOWACO) is a public entcrprise under the
Mlinistrv of Construction and Transportation (NIOCT) founded for the principal purpose of
improving public welfare through watcr supply and ssatcr quality improvemcnt. Its major
acti% itics include construction, operation and maintenance of multi-purpose dams, estuary
barrages, and devclopntent of long-distancc water suppls sNstems  KOWACO operates around
half of the water ssstems in Korea
3      In 1988. the Governmenit streamlined the responsibilities of several public corporations
and rc-cstablished KOWACO as the main agency rcsponsible for water resources and bulk wvatcr
supply. whilc centralizing land devclopments w%ith the Korea Land Dcvclopmctit Corporation
KOWACO hcld sevcral large land devclopmcnts and the salc of these assets over the following few
xcars vwould pros ide substantial rcecnues for improvcmcnt of watcr rcsouirccs It was also planned
that front 1990. KOWACO would have the responsibility for future construction and financing of
all dams and regional v,atcr suppBs systenis All previous and on-going capital projects had been
financed by the central govcrnnicnt, and the assets transfcrred to KOWACO as an cquity
contribution
4      The National Water Inlproscmcnt Prograns (NWIP) approved in 1989, formulated a policy
to cnsurc good quality water was available to the population, and to improve the efficiency of the
scctor Under the program. municipal Watcr Burcaus would gradualls be rcplaccd by Water
Agcncies equippcd wvith all the advantagcs of corporation status In Ksangju, the changc to
Kwangju Watcr Agcncy (KWA) took place in 1990
B. Project Objectives
5       During the 1960s, govcrnment investment wvas concentrated on devcloping the country's
industrial basc. Since that timc progressivcly highcr priontv has bccn given to social invcstments,
uicluding those for water supply and scscragc This initiative increased the availability of a piped
%vater supply and resulted in the gencrally improved health of the population



2
6      As a continuation of this investment strateg%, in November 1988 the government requcsted
Bank assistance to finance the project to suppiv siater frotti the Juanm multi-purpose dam to KMA
and cight ncighboring niunicipalitics.  The objctivcs of the project were to  (a) support the
dekelopnscnt of one of the least devclopcd rcgiolts in Korea. (b) cxpand the svatcr supply to about
96%  of the populatioti in KMA  by 2001 and thus scrvc nost of thc region's low-income
population, (c) ensure cfficicnt use of scarce svater resouirccs: (d) strengthen the KOWACO and
Ksvangju Watcr Agcncy's (KWA) planiting capacitN and financcs: and jc) support institutional
tmprovcments in the scctor.
7      The objectivcs kscrc well dcfincd, rcalistic and important for the sector development, and
tad the commitment of the govcmoient. KOWACO, Kssangju City, the provincial government, and
adjacent municipalities
8.     The project is the first stage of the Juam Regional Water Supply SNstens (summarized in
Appcttdix B), and vas impleniented by the Ministr of Construction and Transportation (MOCT)
ald operated and maintained by KOWACO.  The complemnentary facilities in KMA  wvere
implemented by KWA and the %sorks in the eight municipalitics by prosincial government and
municipal Councils.
9      The complcxity of the project was well within the capabilities of the management of
MOCT, KOWACO. KWA and the provincial govcmment. Thcre were no unusual risks, although
there could have been a risk if there had bccn a delay in tie construction of the water treatment
plant (\VTP) and distribution system  in Kwangju City and similar facilities in the other
municipalities. Hoscvcr, as %sater supply wvas of great conccrn to the governnicnt, precedencc was
givcn to this clemcnt by the concemcd ministries.
10     In a modification to the project, a feasibility study prcpared in 1991 recommended the
extcnsion of thc Juan rasv wvater pipeline so that the tosn of Mokpo (population 240,000) could be
siupplied svith 90,000 m3/d from the ra. syater pipclinc supplying Ksvangju City The rcduction in
supply to KMA wnould be offset by additional water from the Juam Rcgional Watcr Supply System
(JRWSS) sccond stage, dctailed designs of which s%crc completcd in Scptcmber 1994, and
conistruction of which is schedulcd for completion in 1998.
C. Achievement of Project Objectives
I1.    The project wyas timcly and svcll prcparcd, the scopc and scale sell thought out, and
accuratcly represcntcd in the SAR. The project concept was clear and sharcd by all rcievant
parties, and the design was carried out by consultants in close collaboration with all involved
agcncics.
Phvsical Obiectives
12.    The design of all the projcct componients represented the lcast-cost solution for the water
rcquiremcnts of Kwangju City and cight ncighboring municipalities, and scvcral components
included in the first stage s%cre built for the final capacity. All the physical components were
complcted by Deccmber 31, 1995, wvhich rcprcscnted a delay of t%vo years from the original
schedulc, mainly due to insufficient budgetary allocation through MOCT.  Test operations
commenced on November 1, 1995, and were completed by February 29, 1996



3
13     In Februarn  1995. the pipeline to Yongjon WTP in Kwangju w%as closed by KWA staff
without first notifying KOWACO. and this caused a leakage accident in four of the nine tunnels,
w,ith some resulting damagc to adjacent farm  areas   New operating procedures have been
introduiced to ensure this tx-pc of accident docs not happen again. There were also leaks in the
other tunnels constructed under the project, but repair work to all the tunnels w%as completed in
December 1995
14     The project supplicd 220,0(00 m3/d from Jul 1, 1994 and increased the proportion of the
Kwangju City's population servcd from 74% to 95%. and per capita consumption from 260 lcd to
380 lcd The ncighboring municipalities including Mokpo, Naju and Hvasun were supplied with
165,000 m3/d froni the cnd of 1995, and a further 255,000 m3/d will bc availablc from the
JRWSS second stage in 1997/98 otit of which KWA vvill rcccive an additional 220,000 m3/d
IS     The estimated cost of the project at appraisal Nvas US$ 183 0 million out of which US$
34 0 million w%as to be financed bN. the Bank The actual cost including intercst during construction
xwas US$ 211 6 nilion The project cost wNithout the addition of the Mokpo extension was US$
150 3 million, 18 pcrccnt less than expected at appraisal  The project was financed by the
governmcnt contributions and the reduced Bank loan of US$ 28.0 nitlluon after cancellation of US$
1 7 million in 1993 from savings made on equipment and supplics, and US$ 4 3 million was
canceled when the loan closed on Decembcr 31, 1994
Financial Obicctivcs
16     The financial objectivcs wecre established so that KOWACO's Water Division revenues
w%ould be sufficicnt to cover its operational and maintenance expenditure, dcbt servicing
requircments, increasing intcmal cash gencration and to accumulate cash rescrves for future
projccts KOWACO's Dams Division revenues should bc sufficient to meet its operational and
debt servicing requirements, and to gcnerate intenmal cash to makc contributions to its largc
invcstmcnt program   KWA's Financial objectives wcre sct to covcr operational and maintenance
costs, servicing of debts, and to providc appropriate intenal contribution to invcstment
17     To achicc thesc objcctivcs and protect the financial status of thc agcncies, tariffincrcases
wcrc considered neccssary to ensure appropriate pricing and providc an incentive to consumers to
avoid wastage and to thc municipalitics to reduce leakage. Based on the abovc considerations, rate
of retuni targets on fully rcvalued assets w%erc agrecd for both agencies
I8     The post project evaluation show%s that KOWACO's Water Division failed to achicvc the
rate of return targcts set in the Project Agreement betwcen 1991 and 1995, while the Dams
Division onlx rcached the targct in 1993 In most years during implcmcntation, KOWACOs
Watcr and Danis Divisions did not rcach the projccted rccnue amounts (actual results wcre 16%
lowcr than expectcd at appraisal), due not only to inadequatc tariff lcvcls, but also to rcduced
clectricity and watcr sales caused b\ lowcr than nonmal rainfall in somc ycars
19     The reduced revcnucs did not affect expenditure on operation and maintcnance, and all
debt servicing obligations havc bcen mct The additional funds neccssary to support KOWACO's
operations during thc years whcn therc wcrc no tariff increases mainly came from the salc of land
devclopmcnts to the Korea Land Development Corporation

20     The financial performance of KWA svas less than satisfactorv as it failed to achieve the
ratc of return targets betwveen 1991 and 1995. Revenues over the past three years are 16% below
projections made during appraisal due to the fact that water tariff levcls ssere not increased to the
required level, and water shortagcs sscrc experienced through to July 1994. This was somewhat
offsct by substantial improvement in the reduction of non-rcenuc svatcr from 48.6% in 1990 to
31.0% in 1995. During the inplementation pcriod die Ks"angju City's general account supported
KWA to cnsure adequatc fundinig for operations and maintenancc
21.    The actuial rate of retumns achicvcd comparcd to thc ratcs in the KOWACO and KWA
Project Agreements, are shosn in Table 2.

the Financial rate of return (FRR) as a measurc, %%as 8 0%. The recalculation of the FRR based on
actual data is not a direct comparison to the calculation made at appraisal, as it covers only the
first stage of JRWSS, because reliable infornmatiol rcquircd to include thc second stage is not
aNailablc. The recalculated FRR for the project including the cxtension to Mokpo is 7.0%, which
is adcquate considering the social nature of the project. The calculation appears in Tablc 9 of Part
II of this report
23.    A summary of pcrtincnt opcrational anid financial data from KOWACO's and KWA's
finaiicial statcmciits is in Tabic 6 of Part 11 of this report
Tariffs
24.    Duc to national alti-inflatioriari policies, the incrcases in tariffs cnvisaged at the time of
project appraisal did not takc placc at thc rcquired lcvels. Requcsts for tariff incrcases for
KOWACO have to be approvcd by MOCT and the Ministr\ of Financc and Econom) (MOFE).
I'hc city govemnicnt in Kwaitgju has held the posscrs zo approve tariff increascs for KWA since
1993. but is still subjcct to national anti-inflationary policics
25      KOWACO  tad no tariff incrcascs in 1990. 1993 or 1994, and thc incrcascs that wvere
approvcd in 1991 and 1992 were not sufficient to compensatc for scars sshcn there wcrc no
incrcases The rcduccd revenues did not adversely atlcct KOWACO's operations as opcrational
costs wvcre well controllcd and niost of dic shortfall of incomc was made up from sale of land
dcvclopments



5
26     The situation was similar for KWA which had no incrcascs in 1990 or 1993. The Kwangju
City govcmnmcnt made adcquate subsidy contributions from its general account to cover the
rcduction of operational revenues from thc failure to increase tariffs.
Institutional dcvclopment
27.    In KwangJu, the targets set to increase the efficiency of the distribution network and reduce
water leakagc, were exceeded. Actual NRW in 1995 was down to 31.0% from 34.9% projected
during appraisal.
28.    The objective for KWA to producc computerized planning and financial forecasting, as
well as management information, was not completed in the form expected under the project
agrccment, as it was set out in an unfamiliar format. An amended reporting structure proposed by
the Bank was accepted by KWA and introduced during project implementation. However, the city
regularly submitted its Five Year Plans which included a section on KWA's projections, which
were considered adequate by the agency. One of the main reasons for the financial forecasting
reports is so that the agency can prepare information to support the necessity for tariff increases.
This work was carried out by KWA finance staff, and annual submissions were regularly prepared
for review by the city government.
Scctor policics
29.    The project has not deviated from the sector policics of the govemmcnt, and the completed
projcct conforms with the approved detailed designs.
Environmcntal conditions
30.     The availability of reliabic, adequate and safc water supplies in the municipalities served
undcr the projcct has contributed to the hcalth and well-being of the local population. In Kwangju
City and the ncighboring municipalities of Naju and Hwasun, scvwragc systems and trcatment
plants are being expanded, especially for the additional watcr supplicd undcr the project. In smaller
municipalitics, scptic tanks and other sanitation systcms arc being upgraded.
31.    Thc quality of watcr in the newvly constructed Juam reservoir is of major importance as it
is the source of watcr for a total population of around four million (Kwangju City and the other
project municipalitics reprcsent about half of this total) To ensure the watcr quality is maintained
to an acceptable standard, it was necessary to introduce controls and makc investments in various
pollution control measures in the water sourcc arcas and around the dam. The Juam Dam Water
Pollution program includes the construction of sewcrage systems, sewagc trcatment plants,
trcatment of animal waste, installation of scptic tanks for houscs not connectcd to the sewerage
system, appropriatc solid waste disposal, and periodic cleaning of the rescrvoir.
32.    The responsibility for construction and operation of new sanitation and scwcragc facilities,
as well as upgrading cxisting facilitics, was allocated to the rcspcctivc guns (districts within the
provincc). The financing of the program is mainly from the central govcrnmcnt (70%), with the
balance bcing split cvcnly betwccn the province and the guns. The total investment is estimated at
W 176.4 billion, and is being implementcd in two phascs. The first phase (W 104.6 billion) started
in 1992 and is scheduled to bc complcted in 1996. The second phase ( W 71 7 billion) is expected



6
to start in 1997 and be completed by 2001. The program and the work completed to date was
satisfactory.
33.    The alignment of the raw water transmission main was changed to reduce the number of
houses to be relocated at the pumping station site during the project. The relocation and
compensation arrangements in Korea arc regulated by law, and arc satisfactory. During appraisal
of the project, it was expected that 14 houses would have to be relocated, but the amended design
reduced this number to two. However, in preparation for the JRWSS second stage, an additional
14 houscs had to be demolishcd and the families relocated. The relocation of all sixteen households
has taken placc; two locally, and the rcmainder have moved out of thc area. All sixteen have
rcceived acceptable compensation settlemcnts which conform to regulations, and there are no
outstanding disputes.
D. Major Factors Affectine the Project
34.    The main reason for the two year delay in project completion was that the MOCT's annual
budget allocation for the project was lower than planned due to reduced distribution from the
national budget. The priority level of investments within the country is under constant review, and
the allocation of funds for the Juam project was spread over a longer period than was projected at
the time of appraisal. Additional delay was caused by leakage in the tunnels constructed as part of
the project (para. 9).
35.    In October 1993, an amount of USS 1.7 million was canceled from the IBRD loan due to
savings made on equipment and materials. The borrower requested an additional one year
extension to the loan, but this was not approved as the ratc of retum financial covenant had not
bccn kept (para. 16). The loan was closed on Dccember 31, 1994 in accordance with the initial
plan, and the funal disbursement took place on August 2, 1995, at which time a balance of USS 4.3
million was cancccd.
36.     Lcaks were cxperienced at the exit of each tunnel's connection with the stccl pipeline.
Corrcctive action and repairs commcnccd on Octobcr 12, 1995 and were completed by the end of
December, 1995.
37.    A modification to the project was the extension of watcr supply to the port town of Mokpo
from the Kwangju raw water pipclinc. Construction startcd in May 1993 and was completed in
Dccembcr 1995 (para. 6).
38.    The standard of performance of the contractors for civil works, electrical and mcchanical
work on the pumping station and trcatment plant, transmission main and tunncls, was generally
good. Performancc on cquipment supply contracts was satisfactory; deliverics were not held up,
and all equipment supplied conformed to specification.
39.    Thc clear scctor policies and guidclines, as well as govemmcnt commitment to the project,
were major factors in the positivc, albeit delayed, rcsults of the projcct. Administrative procedures,
and staffing and management cffcctiveness wcre satisfactory.

E. Project Sustainability
40.    The project's achievements are expected to be fully sustainable The completed project will
be operated and maintained by KOWACO, which is an efficiently managed public enterprise. Its
financial management systems and management information system were strengthened, partly as a
result of the study undertaken under the Metropolitan Region Water Supply Project (Ln. 2350-KO)
in 1987, and the accuracy of its financial reporting and detailed projections aided management in
carrying out its responsibilities
4 1.    The complementary works will be operated and maintained by KWA, which is a semi-
autonomous agency within the city, and by the neighboring municipalities. KWA is efficiently run
and has successfully reduccd non-revenue water from 55.5% to 31 0% over a 10 year penod. At
the same time, the number of connections has increased by 33%. KWA's competence to sustain the
benefits of the project is fully expected. The municipalities staff is satisfactonly trained in the
MOCT national training facility and adequately supervised by the province.
42     Onc problem which could threaten sustainability is failure to set tariffs at levels which
would allow KOWACO and KWA to operate as self-financing public enterprises, where user
charges reflect the level of services provided. Both KOWACO' s Watcr and Dams Divisions and
KWA did not reach their rate of return targets due mainly to their failure to increase tariffs (para.
16). Since 1993, Kwangju City government has had greater freedom to raise tariffs, and this
authority was uscd to increasc tariffs in July 1994, and again from January 1, 1996 While
KOWACO does not enjoy the same powers, tariffs in both divisions were increased by around
15% in August 1995
43     The projcct's positi'e cnvironmcntal objective to provide reliablc, adequatc, and safe water
supplies to KMA and neighboring municipalitics has contributed to the improvement of the health
and living standards of the local population and is vholly sustainable (paras. 24-27)
F. Bank Performance
44.    The project wvas consistcnt with govcrnment's and Bank's dcvclopmcnt and country
strategy. Thc Bank "sas significantly involved during project prcparation which resultcd in changes
of dcsign and considcrable reduction in the cost of the raw water pipelines and easicr maintenance
and staging of the project.
45      The tcchnical altcmativcs selected for the project vscrc appropriate, and represented the
least-cost solution for the water requircmcnts of Kwangju City and the neighboring municipalities.
Thc Juam Dam is the only major sourcc of water available in the region, and dctailcd analyses
N%crc carricd out to sciect the best routing and sizing for the pipclines and tunnels
46.    There wcrc no unusual project nsks. The major risk was that the cnvisaged industnal and
social dcvelopmcnt in the region %%ould not evolve as projccted, and consequcntly the demand for
vater would be greater or smaller than planned. Thc dcvelopment within the area has progressed at
a slower rate than expected during appraisal (e g. Kwangju City population in 1994 was at the
level projected for 1991), but the two year delay in projcct compiction has partly balanccd this
position



8
47.    Continuity of Bank staff during implementation was highly satisfactory with only one
position changing between the appraisal through to the end of supervision. The continuity was
especially important as some of the key staff of the implementing and operating agencies changed
during implementation. The seven supervision missions were carried out at regular intervals
during implementation.
48.    The only significant issue betnveen the Bank and the government was the matter of tariff
policies, which lcd to the failure of KOWACO and KWA to achieve their rate of return targets as
requircd in Section 4.04 of the KOWACO Agreement, and Section 4.05 of the Kwangju
Agreement. Details of the required and actual rate of return figures are shown in Tabie 2 para. 16.
The breach of the covenant and failure to provide an acceptable action plan to correct the situation
led to the non-approval of the last requested extension of the loan.
G. Borrower Performance
49.    The project completion was delayed by two years mainly duc to inadequate budget
allocation to the project. This failure to commit the agreed fiunds on a timely basis was beyond the
control of KOWACO. Apart from this aspect, and thc failure to comply vith the rate of return
covcnant, the perfomiance of all involved agencies was satisfactory, particularly considering the
cooperation that was needed between the various organizations and the changes in management.
50.    The project's positive environmental impact rcflects the cooperation of the Korean
authorities, particularly KOWACO and MOCT which also showed rcsponsivcness to the Bank's
suggestions on project design and implementation.
5 1.    The format and content of rccords and reports on physical progress and costs, established
at the beginning of the project in collaboration with the implementing and operating agencies, the
consultants, and the Bank, proved to bc vcry succcssful.
52.     Performancc did not meet expcctations in the failure of KOWACO Water and Dams
Divisions and KWA to reach thcir forecasted revcnue projections and rate of return targets (para.
16). Although revenucs werc less than cxpected during appraisal, thcre wvas no reduction in
opcrational and maintcnancc expcnditure on the facilities (para 15).
53.    KWA's submission of opcrational and financial monitoring indicators, computerized
planning and financial forecasting, and a redesigned management information system was not as
agrced during negotiations, lcaving Bank supervision missions to gathcr the data and information,
and rcport the findings (para 22 ).
54     The performance of KWA in rcducing NRW is highly satisfactorv. The introduction of
the NRW program resulted from the Bank financed Second Water Supply Project (Nakdong
Barrage) Loan 2350-KO wvhich transferred technology in Icak dctcction to more than 20 water
agencies in Korea. NRW in the KWA system was at the unacceptably high figure of 48% at the
time of appraisal, but the program of Icak dctection and rehabilitation of old pipelines successfully
rcduced this figure to 31% in 1995. This program is on-going with the aim to rcach 20% of
production by 2001.
55.    The status of performance on the major covenants in the loan and projcct agreements is
showvn in Table 10 of Pars 11 ofthis report.

KMA, and supplies havc increascd to the ncighboring niuiiicipalitics including Nlokpo since the
cnd of 1995
51     The facilities compieted under the project are clearly sustainable KOWACO, KWA and
the other municipalities arc capable of plaining, constructitig, operating and maintaining their
facilities
59      Environmental issues arc addressed wiLth the Juam Dani Water Pollution Program to
protcct and improvc the quality of svatcr in thc reservoir, svhich providcs reliable and safe water
supplies (para 25) The residents in the region arc vetrs conscious of the cnvironmcnt, and the on-
going incrcased sewerage and sanitation facilities in KNIA aiid the other municipalities wilIl help to
isprovc their comnsunity
I. Future Operation
60      The completed project storks will be operated and maintained by KOWACO and the
complementary vsorks by KWA and the municipalitics The JRWSS second stage is alrcady under
construction and still provide additional water to the rcgion by 1998
6 1     KOWACO is a highly cxpcricnced public entcrpnse in construction, operation and
maintcnancc of multi-purposc dams and seatcr supply facilities, and currently opcrates about half
the ssatcr systcms in Korea It has a vscli devclopcd nsanagement information system and regularly
nionitors its phbsical and financial pcrformancc to ensurc effective operation of all the facilities
utider its control It has its ottn training school and supports various education programs for its
staff The futurc operating plan for the projcct will continuc to upgradc the organization's capaciry
to propcrly operate and maintain the ss stem and maximize the projcct bcnefits
62       KWA is expcrienccd in satisfactorily operating its original svatcr treatment plant similar
to the one constructed as part of the complemcntary vsorks The cxisting allocation of duties and
responsibilities is satisfactory, and the institutional developments are kccping pace with the growth
of the organization Regular monitoring of performancc is recordcd for nianagement including
financial results, operating efficicncy of the treatment plants, reduction in NRW, as wcll as other
management related matters.

J. Kev Lessons Learned
63.    The accident that caused Icaks in four of the nine tunuiels built under the project was
caused by operational inexperience. Thc implementing agencics should ensure that specialists are
employed to supcrvise construction wvhere nev technology is introduccd, and to provide manuals
and training to the staff of the opcrating agencies.
64.     The data for all the operational and financial projections werc provided by KOWACO and
KWA, and the former succcssfully continucd to updatc these projcctions. During appraisal it was
recognized that KWA did not have the in-house capability to producc thcsc reports, so members of
the finance staff received training, but KWA still did tiot producc these reports as expected. The
original reporting stnicture for KWA was changed and simplified to the Bank's satisfaction.
Coordination Avith the sector ministry may help to cnsure continuity of the acquired skills during
officers' rotation
65.    The importancc of setting tariffs to generate adequate levels of income has become more
significant to the borrower and operating agencies, especially from 1996, as KOWACO has to
contribute around 30% to all nesw capital projects, which in previous years have been financed by
the central government

74%,and litters per Capita Day wil reach 3S7 e /day from 257 Z /dav.
CW General Evaluation
o While This project(st=rted in 89.12 and will be finished in '95512)
being carried out,
on july 1 '94, water supply service to Kwang-ju  which was

contamrLnation in Young-san river began with 140,000ton/day.
From Dec. 21 '94 tiLl Mar. 7 '95, supply service arnount increased
to 300,0COton/day(parLially  through  yong-hyun  Water treatment
facility)
A,nd from Jan.. 4 '95 tll Mvar. 7 '95, wa;er of 150,COOton/day was
