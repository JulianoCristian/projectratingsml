Project objectives are to: a) support development of\n            one of the least developed regions in Korea; b) improve and\n            expand water supply to about 96% of the population in KMA by\n            the year 2001; c) ensure efficient use of scarce water\n            resources; d) strengthen KWB's and KOWACO's\n            planning capacity and finances; and e) support institutional\n            improvements in the sector. The project is comprised of the\n            following components : a) water pipeline; b) a pumping\n            station; c) tunnels for raw water transmission; d) treatment\n            plant; e) treated water transmission; and f) engineering services."}, "docdt": "1990-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
