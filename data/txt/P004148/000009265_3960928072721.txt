MEMORANDUM AND RECOM4ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCI11ON AND DEVELOPMIEN
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRCTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBUC OF KOREA
FOR A JUAM REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Korea for US$34 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan would help finance the Juam
Regional Water Supply Project and would be for a term of 15 years, including a five year grace period,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.      Background. Korea is one of the most urbanized of the developing countries. Its urban
population grew from 28% in 1960, to 76% in 1987, and would reach 80% of the toial population by
the year 2000. This rapid urbanization, averaging 3.2% p.a. during 1980-87, has overextended most
urban services, including water supply. Investments in the sector, which received comparatively lower
priority in the 1960s, increased rapidly and succeeded in expanding the population served by house
connections from 17% of the population in 1960, to 32% in 1970 and, remarkably, to 74% by 1988.
Ongoing investments, averaging about US$760 million p.a. will increase the population served to 80%
by 1991. However, many municipalities have much lower coverage than the average and still suffer
from restricted supply, water rationing and uneven water quality.
3.      Sector Reform. A fundameptal reorganization of the sector, which is supported by the Bank,
is being formulated. The key elements of this reform have been recently approved by the President
inder a National Water Improvement Program (NWIP) to ensure that: (a) good quality water is
available to the total population; (b) adequate monitoring and improved effectiveness of the sector
is achieved; and (c) adequate staff training is provided. The NWIP will be implemented between 1990
and 1995 and will expand the previously planned investments for water supply by US$2,060 million
which will be allocated to modernize several hundred existing treatment plants, replace about 27,500
km of corroded or leaking pipes, in order to reduce non-revenue water (NRW), and train sectoral staff.
About 50% of this amount would be financed by long-term government loans and the remainder by
internal cash generation made possible by a 30% increase in water tariffs between 1990 and 1992 (9%
p.a.). The NWIP would also improve the sector by: (a) converting the municipal Water Bureaus into
quasi-corporations; (b) unifying the planning, financing and construction of regional water supply
systems under the Korean Water Resources Corporation (KOWACO), which would also have a major
role in controlling water quantity (through dams) and quality (through sewage treatment plants) in
the main rivers and (c) strengthen the country's capacity to monitor, control and reduce water
pollution.
4.      A major focus of the NWIP is the cleaning up of the Korean rivers, which are increasingly
polluted as a result of accelerated industrial and urban development. Under the Plan, sewage treatment
plants would be completed in all cities, and even in small municipalities where their pollution affects
key water sources. Improvements and better monitoring and control would also be applied to about
26,000 industrial treatnent plants, and to pollution from livestock and farming. Many industries will
have to relocate to ensure protection of water sources. These investments would average about US$800
million per year.
5.      Rationale for Bank Involvement. Although Bank lending to Korea has been scaled down, the
Bank's capacity for technical analysis, as a basis for providing advice to help improve sector policies,
is valued by the Government. In general, the Bank's strategy focuses on sectoral lending, particularly
for social sectors, poverty alleviation, institutional development, and transfer of technology. In accord
with the Bank's strategy, the proposed project would suppo,t the development of one of Korea's least-
developed regions, with emphasis on expanding services to the urban poor. The Bank's involvement
in project preparation has already resulted in considerable savings in the project. The project would



introduce sound pricing policies and tariffs and improve the financial planning of the K(wangju Water
Bureau (KWB) and KOWACO. More significantly, the project would also allow the Bank to continue
a dialogue with the Government on the sectoral reorganization (paras. 3 and 4), which would have
profound implications for the management of water s-upply, sewerage, water pollution control, and
urban services throughout the country.
6.      Project Obiectiver. The objectives of the project are to: (a) support the development of one
of the poorest and least-developed regions in Korea; (b) improve and expand water supply to about
96% of the population in Kwangju Metropolitan Area (KMA) by 2001 and thus serve most of the
region's low-income population; (c) ensure efficient use of scarce water resources; (d) strengthen
Kwangju Water Bureau's (KWB) and KOWACO's planning capacity and finances; and (e) support
institutional improvements in the sector.
7.      Proiect Description. The Juam Regional Wazer Supply System would ultimately supply KMA
(which includes the Special City of Kwangju and eight smaller municipalities) with 640 million liters
per day (NLD) of water from Juam Dam. The proposed project is the first stage of that system and
includes: (a) a pumping station with a peak capacity of about 520 MLD; (b) a raw water transmission
main, including about 14 km of tunnels designed for the final capacity (about 2.6 m to 2.8 m in
diameter) and about 22 km of pipelines '1.8 m to 2.4 m in diameter); (c) a treatment plant with a
capacity of 60 MILD; (d) transmission pipelines for Naju and seven other municipalities (about 25.5
km) and (e) engineering services fot project design and supervision. Kwangju and the other
municipalities will be responsible for constructing and financing the complementary works, including
storage reservoirs and distribution networks required to use the bulk water provided. Kwangju will also
build and finance a treatment plant for 230 MLD of water. The project sets targets to increase the
efficiency of distribution and reduce water leakage in Kwangju, sets financial targets for KWB and
KOWACO, and supports improvements in their planning and management information systems.
8.      The project would be carried out in five years, and would be implemented by MOC. Its total
cost is estimated at US$178.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$63.2
million (35%). The total financing required, including interest during construction, is US$183.J
million, of which the Bank would finance US$34 million (190/o of the total) and the Government will
finance the remaining US$149.1 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in the Republic of Korea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8083-KO, is being distributed separately. The complementary works by KWB,
estimated at US$69.4 million, would be financed by bonds (US$33.0 million), KWB's net internal cash
generation (US$12.1 million), and Government loans (US$24.2 million). The complementary works
in the eight municipalities (about US$13.1 million) would be mainly financed by Government loans
and contributions from the municipalities and the Province. After project completion, the assets of the
bulk water system and its debt service liabilities, including the foreign exchange risk, would be
transferred to KOWACO. The municipalities will own and operate their facilites.
9.      Actions Agreed. Assurances were obtained (1) From the Government. that: (a) by December
31, 1993 the eight municipalities will expand their distribution systems to use the water provided by
the project; and (b) a Transfer and Operations Agreement for the project, a draft of which would be
presented to the Bank for comments by December 31, 1993, would be signed with KOWACO prior to
completion of the project. (II) From Kwanziu City that KWB would (a) complete the first phase of the
water treatment plant and distribution system by December 31, 1993; (b) include in its investment
program for 1990-93 a satisfactory program for leak detection and for rehabilitation of the water
distribution network; (c) implement by December 31, 1990, a program for computerized planning and
financial forecasting and provide periodic projections to the Bank; (d) implement by December 31,
1990, a management information system, with monthly information on water demand, revenues and
costs; and (e) achieve an annual rate of return of at least 9g% on revalued fixed assets in operation.



MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATnONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCllON AND DEVELOPMFNI
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBUC OF KOREA
FOR A JUAM REGIONAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Korea for US$34 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan would help finance the Juam
Regional Water Supply Project and would be for a term of 15 years, including a five year grace period,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.      Background. Korea is one of the most urbanized of the developing countries. Its urban
population grew from 28% in 1960, to 76% in 1987, and would reach 80% of the total population by
the year 2000. This rapid urbanization, averaging 3.2% p.a. during 1980-87, has overextended most
ii ban services, including water supply. Investments in the sector, which received comparatively lower

connections from 17% of the population in 1960, to 32% in 1970 and, remarkably, to 74% by 1988.
Ongoing investmnents, averaging about US$760 million p.a. will increase the population served to 80%
by 1991. However, many municipalities have much lower coverage than the average and still suffer
from restricted supply, water rationing and uneven water quality.
3.      Sector Reform. A fundamental reorganization of the sectar, which is supported by the Bank,
is being formulated. The key elements of this reform have been recently approved by the President
under a National Water Improvement Program (NWIP) to ensure that: (a) good quality water is

a dialogue with the Government on the sectoral reorganization (paras. 3 and 4), which would have
profound implications for the management of watei supply, sewerage, water pollution control, and
urban services throughout the country.

of the poorest and least-developed regions in Korea; (b) improve and expand water supply to about
96% of the population in Kwangju Metropolitan Area (KMA) by 2001 and thus serve most of the
region's low-income population; (c) ensure efficient use of scarce water resources; (d' strengthen
Kwangju Water Bureau's (KWB) and KOWACO's planning capacity and finances; and (e) support
institutional improvements in the sector.
7.      Proiect DescriDrion. The Juam Regional Water Supply System would ultimately supply KMA
(which includes the Special City of Kwangju and eight smaller municipalities) with 640 million liters
per day (MLD) of water from Juam Dam. The proposed project is the first stage of that system and
includes: (a) a pumping station with a peak capacity of about 520 MLD; (b) a raw water transmission
main, including about 14 km of tunnels designed for the final capacity (about 2.6 m to 2.8 m in
diameter) and about 22 km of pipelines (1.8 m to 2.4 m in diameter); (c) a treatment plant with a
capacity of 60 MLD; (d) transmission pipelines for Naju and seven other municipalities (about 25.5
km) and (e) engineering services for project design and supervision. Kwangju and the other
municipalities will be responsible for constructing and financing the complementary works, including
storage reservoirs and distribution networks required to use the bulk water provided. Kwangju wfll also
build and finance a treatment plant for 230 MLD of water. The project sets targets to increase the
efficiency of distribution and reduce water leakage in Kwangju, sets financial targets for KWB and
KOWACO, and supports improvements in their planning and management information systems.
8.      The project would be carried out in five years, and would be implemented by MOC. Its total
cost is estimated at US$178.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$63.2
million (35%). The total financing required, including interest during construction, is US$183.1
million, of which the Bank would finance US$34 million (19% of the total) and the Government will
finance the remaining US$149.1 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
sc', dule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operadons in the Republic of Korea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8083-K(O, is being distributed separately. The complementary works by KWB,
estimated at US$69.4 million, would be financed by bonds (US$33.0 million), KWB's net intemal cash
generation (US$12.1 million), and Government loans (US$24.2 million). The complementary works
in the eight municipalities (about US$13.1 million) would be mainly financed by Government loans
and contributions from the municipalities and the Province. After project completion, the assets of the
bulk water system and its debt service liabilities, including the foreign exchange risk, would be
transferred to KOWACO. The municipalities will own and operate their facilities.
9.      Actions Agreed. Assurances were obtained (a) From the Government. that: (a) by December
31, 1993 the eight municipalities will expand their distribution systems to use the water provided by
the project; and (b) a Transfer and Operations Agreement for the project, a draft of which would be
presented to the Bank for comments by December 31, 1993, would be signed with KOWACO prior to
completion of the project. (11) From KwanJlu Citv that KWB would (a) complete the first phase of the
water treatment plant and distribution system by December 31, 1993; (b) include in its investment
program for 1990-93 a satisfactory program for leak detection and for rehabilitation of the water
distribution network, (c) implement by December 31, 1990, a program for computerized planning and
financial forecasting and provide periodic projections to the Bank; (d) implement by December 31,
1990, a management information system, with monthly information on water demand, revenues and
costs; and (e) achieve an annual rate of return of at least 9% on revalued fixed assets in operation.



- 3 -
(all) From KOWACO that its Dams Division would achieve an annual rate of return of 5% on revalued
fixed assets in operation, and Its Water Division would achieve a rate of return on revalued fixed assets
of at least 2% in 1990, 3.5% in 1991 and 5% thereafter.
10.        Justification.  The proposed project would provide urgently needed water to K1A, one
of the poorest and least developed areas in Korea, providing basic social infrastructure for the
economic and social development of the area. The project would extend water services to most of the
population in KMA (91% by 1994 and 96% by 2001). The total additional population to be provided
with water by house connections for the first time would be considerable, more than two hundred
thousand by 1994, 55% of whom would be urban poor. The project capacity, supplemented in a
second stage by additional treatment and distribution facilities, would provide water to about one
million persons by 2011. The project would set adequate financial goals for KOWACO, which supplies
water to more than 100 municipalities throughout Korea, promoting the optimization of scarce water
resources and setting incentive, to reduce water leakage and wastage. The Bank would work jointly
with KOWACO (which is expanding its already large involvement in the sector) to maximize the
benefit of the ongoing NWIP. KWB would also benefits from financial targets and improved plannirg.
11.         Because of economies of scale, the treated water pipe and the tunnels will be constructed
for the system final capacity. This makes the investment lumpy and reduces the rate of return. The
ERR for the project is estimated at 8%. This is based only on tariff revenues. However, the benefits
measured by water sales comprise only a fraction of the total benefits of the project and underestimate
its ERR, by excluding important benefits which are difficult to quantify. These benefits include
improvement of the living standards of the population already connected, the consumer surplus, the
increased economic rents in new areas supplied with water, and the health and general welfare
benefits brought about by a safe and reliable water supply.
12.         Risks. There are no unusual project risks. The major risk is that the pianned industrial
and social development of the area would not evolve as projected, reducing water demand and
resulting in unused capacity. This risk is mitigated by the existence of other cities with very critical
water shortage problems, which could use the water by extending the transmission system. Another
risk would be delayed completion by Kwangju and the other municipalities of the treatment or
distribution works required to use the water provided by the project. However, the Government has
given high priority to water supply, and the concemed Ministries to the KMA. Failure to reduce NRW
would increase the cost of water and in the lor,g term reduce the number of persons benefited.
However, KWB has already reduced NRW considerably, and a NWIP includes actions for reducing
NRW through the rehabilitation of distribution systems, particularly in cities like Kwangju, which have
higher than average NRW.
13.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
