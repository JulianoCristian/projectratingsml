"The project is designed to increase\n            agricultural production, farm incomes and employment in\n            Central Tunisia. It consists of investments in: irrigation\n            infrastructure; farm access roads; credit; the support\n            services of ODTC and OMIVAK; aquifer monitoring equipment; a\n            pilot livestock development program and animal production\n            support services; studies for future investments in the\n            project area; training; and technical assistance. About\n            12,000 families would benefit overall, and about 1,500\n            additional jobs would be created. Improved marketing\n            infrastructure and information systems to be provided under\n            the project would minimize the risk of temporary\n            over-supplies of fruits and vegetables with accompanying\n            falls in prices; improvements to the Officers'\n            maintenance units, involvement of farmers in maintenance,\n            maintenance would assure that the rehabilitated irrigation\n            systems are maintained; differential water charges for\n            winter and summer would encourage maximum use of these\n            systems throughout the year."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
