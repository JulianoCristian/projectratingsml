assist the Government\n            to formulate an integrated program for the development of\n            the forest resources of the Hazara region of the North West\n            Frontier Province (NWFP). To that end, the project would\n            help to develop improved technologies in reforestation,\n            reinforce the Forest Department of the NWFP and other\n            agencies, and prepare follow-up projects for large-scale\n            reforestation and an integrated pulp and paper industry. The\n            project would: select suitable areas for large-scale\n            reforestation by systematic site assessment; update\n            inventory of existing forests; plant 2,000 ha of pilot\n            plantations with back-up research trials and a genetic\n            improvement program; finance a training program; develop\n            work arrangements to embrace private small-scale forest\n            owners in future development; finance pulping tests and a\n            feasibility study to define the type, configuration and\n            timing of pulp and paper industrial development; and set up\n            a management unit to coordinate activities and prepare\n            follow-up projects."}, "docdt": "1977-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
