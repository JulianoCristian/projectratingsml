The Bank amended the\n            single stage feasibility study approach and introduced\n            resource assessment as an initial phase. At appraisal the\n            sequence between resource assessment and the design of the\n            industrial feasibility study should be acknowledged and\n            hence formulation of a detailed industrial feasibility study\n            aiming at a specific development target (pulp mill) should\n            be avoided. Research responsibility should not be given to\n            the project unit which was neither equipped nor interested\n            in this specific field. Instead, the research program should\n            be made an integral part of the Pakistan Forest( PFI)\n            program. The appointment process of consultants should have\n            started soon after appraisal and appointments confirmed\n            before credit effectiveness. The fact that the nature of the\n            project changed considerably during implementation, due to\n            the finding that resources were insufficient to support a\n            pulpmill, should be seen as a positive step since the\n            establishment of a pulpmill would have been uneconomic. The\n            supervision missions which insisted on further assessments\n            of the resource base should be credited for that approach."}, "docdt": "1986-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
