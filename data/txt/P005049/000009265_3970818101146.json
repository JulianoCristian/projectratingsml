introduction of\n            integrated farming packages in the seven rice growing\n            governorates, which represent about 50 percent of the\n            cultivated area in the country.  The project includes:  (i)\n            provision of incremental farm inputs; (ii) provision of\n            agricultural machinery and spare parts; (iii) establishment\n            of machinery repair and service facilities; and (iv) a new\n            seed cleaning plant and two seed laboratories.  It involves\n            (v) training in extension, machine operation and\n            agricultural credit; (vi) establishment of mechanized\n            centers for the testing and demonstration of new machines;\n            and (vii) technical assistance to research staff.  The\n            technical assistance would help to develop appropriate\n            mechanization systems and the preparation of a study on the\n            seed industry.  Selective mechanization of farming\n            activities will be promoted by expanding the role of private\n            machinery hire services and by enlarging the network of\n            dealerships for agricultural machinery."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
