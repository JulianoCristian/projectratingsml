      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25% of the Bank’s
lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are
innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for ten closed Development
Policy Operations implemented as three programmatic series. Program-1 consisted of
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits s 6 to 10 (the second series of PRCSs) implemented
from 2007-2012. Program-2 included two operations of Public Investment Reforms
implemented in 2010-2012. Program-3 included three operations to support the Program
P135 Phase 2 Support Program (P135) implemented in 2007-2011. World Bank
disbursements for Program-1, Program-2 and Program 3 amounted to USD 985 million,
USD 210 million, and USD 850 million respectively. Program 1 and Program 2 were co-
financed by the Asian Development Bank, Australian Agency for International
Development (AusAID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA), Department for International
Development (DFID, United Kingdom), European Commission (EC), Germany, Ireland,
Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the German Reconstruction Credit
Institution (KfW), New Zealand, Netherlands Directorate General for International
Cooperation (DGIS) Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

The report was prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). It is based on
interviews, documents and data collected in the course of a visit to Vietnam in June,
2012, during which government officials, external development partners, business
groups, academics, non-governmental organizations, as well as other civil society groups
and stakeholders were consulted. The evaluation also draws upon in-depth interviews of
the staff of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, including current and
former members of the Vietnam country teams in Washington and Hanoi; and upon
published and internal documents from the two Institutions. The cooperation and
assistance of all stakeholders and government officials are gratefully acknowledged as is
the support of the World Bank Country Office in Vietnam.

Following standard IEG procedure, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the government
for review. Comments were received and are attached as Annex D.

Summary
This Program Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates three completed series of
Development Policy Operations (DPOs) that consisted of ten operations implemented in 2007-
2012. Around USD 2 billion was disbursed through these series between 2007-2012 (Table I).
These include: (i) the second series of Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) with five
operations broadly covering the main areas of Government strategy; (ii) Public Investment
Reform (PIR), a series of two operations aimed at improving the efficiency of public
investments and supporting Vietnam’s fiscal stimulus; and (iii) the Program P135 Phase 2
Support Program (P135) series of three DPOs that supported the implementation of the
National Targeted Program for Socio-economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme
Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas.

The objective of this report is two-fold. As a PPAR it assesses various dimensions of the
performance of these three series of DPOs and provides performance ratings for each of the
series based on both IEG and OPCS guidelines. At the same time the report builds on program
level evidence and contributes to learning. It draws broader lessons on the role of budget
support for promoting policy and institutional change based on longer term, multisector
engagement in Vietnam under the different series. It also assesses major design elements
(fiduciary, safeguards, institutional arrangements and analytic underpinnings). The structure of
the report reflects these two goals and is based on the following building blocks: chapter 1
introduces the background to the series and motivation of the report; chapter 2 reviews the
strategic underpinnings of the DPOs to assess the relevance of Bank’s interventions and their
objectives; chapter 3 focuses on the intervention logic and design of DPOs; chapter 4 presents
the results achieved under the series; the summary performance evaluation of the DPO series is
presented in chapter 5, and concluding remarks and lessons are presented in chapter 6.

This evaluation concludes that despite some noted achievements there were missed
opportunities to support the adoption and implementation of more ambitious policies.
Consequently, with diminishing returns to past reforms it will be more difficult for Vietnam to
sustain the type of economic performance that allowed it to approach (but not attain) that of
China in the late 20th century and of South Korea two decades earlier. This outcome is due, in
part, to the approach to reform adopted by the Government, the Bank and other development
                                                xii


partners. Experience under the first PRSC series demonstrated the value of flexibility, under
which difficult decisions could be postponed while further dialogue took place, until the
Government was ready to adopt reform measures. The second PRSC and PIR series attempted
to follow a similar approach. However, some key reforms were discussed but left largely
unaddressed and delayed beyond the period under review. The quality of actions taken
decreased progressively, as reforms became more process-oriented and less binding, and there
was evidence of reform fatigue.

Series 1: PRSCs 6 through 10

The overall objective of the second PRSC series (2006-2012, USD 985 million) was “to help
Vietnam develop the economic policies and institutions needed to become a middle-income
country” (Project Document, PRSC 6, paragraph 38). This broad goal was broken down into
four specific objectives, each of which corresponds to a policy pillar of both the Government’s
Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) and the PRSC series: “(i) promotion of growth
and transition to a market economy that will foster the development of businesses in an
environment crucial to the sustained growth of the country’s economy; (ii) poverty reduction
and social inclusion, enabling all players and stakeholders to participate and to enjoy the
benefits of development and growth; (iii) sustainable management of the environment and of
natural resources as the country seeks to harness them for development and growth, while
ensuring their sustainability; and (iv) building institutions that can support the country’s
development strategy through improving governance.” These objectives are highly relevant to
Bank and Government strategy and are harmonized with the aims of other development
partners.

Overall achievement of these multiple objectives was mixed. Efficacy of the first specific
objective – promotion of growth and transition to a market economy – is, on balance, rated
substantial.1 The Authorities’ sustained focus on encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI)
and export promotion bore fruit, and Vietnam continued to deepen its integration with the
global economy. The share of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in GDP fell, although this is
more a reflection of the rapid growth of FDI-financed production than of a shrinking SOE
sector. Public investment in SOEs as a share of total investment did not diminish as anticipated
despite booming FDI. This reflects slow divestiture and a political reluctance to accelerate
SOE reform. In the financial sector, achievement of a more capable Central Bank is
counterbalanced by persistent weaknesses in the banking sector’s portfolio and lack of
compliance of the state-owned banks with international loan classification standards.

There was substantial achievement of the second objective – reduced poverty and enhanced
social inclusion. Significant improvement was attained in many dimensions of education and
gender equality as well as in poverty reduction, maternal mortality and health insurance, which
received attention through DPL supported reforms. The results were less evident in promoting

  The efficacy of each objective is rated on a 4-point scale: High, Substantial, Modest, and Negligible
(IEG and OPCS guideline)
                                                 xiii


pension insurance among various groups, and sustainability of the pension system remains a
challenge.

Efficacy of the third objective -- sustainable management of the environment and natural
resources -- is rated modest. Despite its complexity, the objective was supported by few
concrete actions. The quality of evidence was diminished by the weak M&E framework. Some
success was recorded in allocating land to local communities and enhancing the rural
population’s access to clean water and improved sanitation. However, in many key areas, such
as overall environmental management and in improving the quality of air, forests and water,
achievements of program objectives were partial.

Achievement of the fourth objective of building institutions that can support the country’s
development strategy through improving governance was also modest. There was progress in
public administration reforms and in some sub-areas of public financial management, such as
the introduction of external audits and the use of an automated information system. However,
long standing issues surrounding the transition to modern accounting standards, elimination of
off-budget expenditures, and improving internal audit standards were not addressed as
programmed. Gains in anti-corruption were partial, while continued weaknesses in fiscal
management may affect Vietnam’s debt sustainability.

The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory.2 Risk to development outcome was
assessed as moderate. Vietnam’s transition to a middle-income country has reduced the
relevance of some risks, though others have emerged, notably those stemming from
weaknesses in governance. Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, reflecting a
combination of strengths in Quality at Entry (strong linkages between program design and
analytical work for the first operations, leading the complex development partner coordination
process) and moderate shortcomings such as a gradual softening of proposed policy actions
and weak macroeconomic dialogue. Borrower performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory, due to uneven and diminishing Government ownership of the PRSC agenda.
While transition to middle income country status was achieved, the focus on structural reforms
to make such a transition sustainable and pave the way for long-term balanced growth
weakened. There were serious systemic shortcomings in the Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) frameworks with respect to the choice of indicators, inadequate adjustments to the
results framework when needed, and reporting on progress at completion.

Series 2: Public Investment Reforms

The stated objective of the Public Investment Reform (PIR) series (2009-2012, USD 850
million) was to support modern governance. This broad statement was distilled into the more
specific objective of raising the productivity of public investment by (i) enhancing project
selection, notably through environmental screening; (ii) strengthening project implementation
through the use of cost estimates, bidding rules, bidding transparency, conflict of interest,
dispute resolution, land acquisition, and environmental management; (iii) improving financial
management through reporting and control, control of administrative costs, environmental

 The outcome rating is assessed based on 6-point scale: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, and Unsatisfactory (IEG and OPCS guideline)
                                            xiv


budgeting, subsidies and guarantees; and (iv) enhancing project oversight through better
documentation, monitoring and evaluation. The project documents also imply a fifth objective
– to support the Government’s fiscal stimulus – and this is taken into account in this
evaluation. With the exception of the fiscal stimulus, these objectives were initially covered by
the second PRSC series, but were not achieved due to weak Government ownership. The
objectives were thus substantially relevant. Relevance of design, however, was modest due to
the lack of an operational focus on macro and fiscal actions that could have helped to improve
the quality of the Government’s policy response to the crisis.

Achievement of the first objective of enhancing project selection in public investments is rated
modest, since promotion of environmental screening of public investments lacked sufficient
institutional depth and coverage. Achievement of the second objective --improving project
implementation -- was negligible. The aims of enhancing project approval, capacity building,
addressing conflict of interest, and dispute resolution were not met. The submission of the
Public Investment Law to the legislature – a key action --was dropped altogether due to lack of
political consensus and resistance from vested interests. Achievement of the third objective
(financial management) was modest. Although all the prior actions were implemented, these
actions were modified in a way that adversely affected the program’s results. The Public-
Private Partnership framework lacked clear provision for its operationalization, while the focus
on provisions for preparation of environmental assessments weakened substantially.
Achievement of the fourth objective on improving project oversight was negligible. The focus
on improving the M&E framework of public investments weakened with program
implementation. There is no evidence of public projects being reviewed by independent
evaluators.

The efficacy of the program’s support for fiscal stimulus was modest. The program did not
effectively contribute to a well-calibrated, timely countercyclical policy program. The
Authorities’ choice of macro and fiscal actions and their timing led rather to increased
volatility in 2009-2011. The quality of macro and fiscal policies continued to be weak in 2012-
2014 leading to a more fragile fiscal stance and debt accumulation.

Outcome is rated unsatisfactory. Risk to development outcome is assessed as moderate, as
the Government seems to be aware of the need to improve the efficiency of public investments
and the recently approved Public Investment Law under a new DPO series constitutes an
important step forward. Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory, reflecting major
shortcomings in the design and implementation of the program, such as the tension between
the identified need to support the macro-program while at the same time trying to accelerate
governance-related reforms with limited de facto Borrower commitment. The program’s
policy content was weak. Important actions were dropped from the second and last operation
that undermined the program’s results orientation. It is not evident that the Bank should have
proceeded with the second operation. M&E design suffered from output oriented indicators
that were not strongly linked to the objectives, and from non-reporting at completion.

Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. The significant weakening of the reform
agenda prior to the second operation was akin to a policy reversal as it undermined objectives.
The PPAR mission found that at the time of program implementation, consensus around the
reforms it supported was weak.

Series 3: Program P135 Phase 2 Support Program

The objectives of the P135 program (2006-2012, USD 210 million) were “to support policy
and institutional actions to improve the results of the National Targeted Program for Socio-
economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and
Mountainous Areas, known as Program 135, Phase 2 (P135).” There were four specific
objectives, to strengthen: (i) poverty targeting; (ii) decentralization, participation and
empowerment; (iii) fiduciary transparency; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation.

These objectives were highly relevant. They aimed to support sound implementation of P135,
which involved the delivery of substantial resources from both Government and external
partners to communes in targeted geographical locations where poverty reduction lagged
behind national trends. Prior actions in the first two DPOs were strong, those in the last
operation less so, and some actions did not cover the program’s whole geographical area. The
relevance of measures supported by the series became more robust following the program’s
mid-term review held prior to the second operation.

There was substantial progress in strengthening poverty targeting. Criteria for higher budget
allocations to the more disadvantaged communities and villages were issued in 41 out of 50
provinces. Progress was less obvious in pro-poor orientation of production support, although
the program continued to subsidize agricultural production inputs for the poor. The program’s
contribution to enhanced decentralization, participation and empowerment was also
substantial. Widespread and effective training was organized to enhance the capacity of local
authorities in various aspects of investment management. Household participation in project
selection increased as a result of program support. However, the goal of transforming
communities into investment owners was very ambitious and only partially achieved.

Improved fiduciary transparency and accountability was achieved to a modest extent.
Competitive bidding for larger contracts increased, but the majority continued to be procured
by direct contracting. Community Participation Procurement was attempted in only a few
provinces. Reporting and auditing remain insufficient. By the end of the program, all
provinces had been audited, but full public disclosure of financial information had not been
achieved. Achievement of strengthened monitoring and evaluation was also modest. By
program closure, the Monitoring Information System was fully operational in only 11 of the 50
provinces, while Citizen Report Cards were produced only once (in 2008) as an initial pilot.
Nonetheless, and despite delays in the impact evaluation, a good quality data set had become
available by program closure that made a crucial contribution to assessing the impact of P135.

Overall outcome rating is assessed as moderately satisfactory. Risk to development outcome
is rated moderate, since achievements in poverty reduction are unlikely to be reversed. Bank
performance was moderately satisfactory. Design shortcomings in the first operation were
subsequently addressed. Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.
Government commitment and ownership were strong. Program implementation was at times
challenging due to its complexity and the many stake-holders involved. M&E indicators were
revised and improved from one operation to the next, and together with an impact assessment
undertaken at the end of the program, provided an adequate basis for evaluation.

The following key consolidated lessons from the three series are amongst those detailed in the
report:

      Dialogue between the Government and the Bank on macroeconomic and fiscal issues
       assumes greater importance in the absence of an IMF program, especially during
       periods of macroeconomic risk. In the case of Vietnam, this warrants a rethinking of
       how macroeconomic stability can best be supported through DPOs. The approach
       during the past decade has not been effective. Fragmentation of macroeconomic
       dialogue among multiple, parallel DPOs tends to weaken both dialogue and operational
       content.
      Responding to macroeconomic crises at the same time as promoting long-standing
       institutional reforms in a single operation or series may reduce effectiveness, especially
       when risks that reforms may not be implemented are high and macro-stabilization
       issues are not specifically addressed by the DPOs.
      Excessive flexibility regarding the policy content of a programmatic series weakens the
       program. Although flexibility is an important feature of Bank policy lending, there is
       room for striking a better balance between flexibility and rigor. Inclusion of partially
       met triggers as prior actions should be considered with particular caution.
      Greater willingness on the part of the Bank and other external partners to withdraw
       their support for weakly implemented reform programs and unproductive policy
       dialogue can strengthen the content and outcome of future operations. The delays in the
       second operations of P135 and PIR, and PRSC 10 appear to have reflected concerns
       with program quality, which, however, were only adequately resolved in the case of
       P135. Arguments for budget predictability under the Paris Declaration are less relevant
       in Vietnam due to relatively small share of budget support in public expenditures.
      A strong knowledge base is of critical importance for upstream design of reforms and
       parallel technical assistance to support their implementation. Selectivity helps to adapt
       knowledge products and technical assistance to the most pressing needs in a timely
       manner.
      The design and implementation of M&E for DPOs remains a challenge, and the
       adequacy of the M&E framework needs to be reconsidered each time a new operation
       within a series is launched. Logical links need to be thought through carefully and
       institutional responsibilities clearly delineated. Impact evaluations, whenever feasible,
       should be an integral part of M&E.
      Use of budget support instruments for financing programs such as P135 may entail
       considerable risks. The state of decentralization and capacities and capabilities of
       subnational governments need to be taken into account in the design and
       implementation of targeted poverty programs.

1. Background to the Study and Country Context
Motivation
1.1     Vietnam, a one-party socialist state dominated by the Communist Party of Vietnam,
has since the 1990s moved towards a pragmatic, growth-oriented approach to economic
policy. During the past three decades years, Vietnam has experienced remarkable economic
and social development, even though since the international financial crisis economic growth
has been somewhat slower and the pace and the depth of reforms more modest. It was one of
the poorest countries in the world in 1986, and is now a middle-income country, with some
development indicators comparable to those of Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) members.3

1.2     The World Bank has actively supported Vietnam’s reform policies through multiple
development policy operations (DPOs) since the 1990s. The purpose of this report is to
review and evaluate the experience under three completed series of DPOs implemented
between 2007 and 2012, namely, the Second Series of Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits,
the Program P-135 Phase 2, and the Public Investment Reform Program. As a clustered
Project Performance and Appraisal Report4 (PPAR) the focus is on both accountability and
learning with respect to those DPO series. In addition, the study draws on information from
three other DPO series5 implemented in the same period but not evaluated here to derive
lessons on some important aspects of the use of the budget support instrument in Vietnam.

1.3     Poverty Reductions Strategy Credits (PRSCs) in Vietnam have already been the
subject of two recent detailed studies by the World Bank Independent Evaluation Group.6
(IEG) and the European Union.7(EU), which in turn built on previous assessments by
OECD.8 and Mokoro Consulting.9 A number of other reviews undertaken during the past six
years also provide various views of different aspects of PRSC implementation, although their
coverage of issues and level of detail are different from those of the present exercise.

Vietnam’s Experience during the Past Three Decades
1.4    Exceptional development outcomes during the past three decades. In 1986
Vietnam was ranked one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita income of
below US$100. By the end of 2013, it was a middle income country with a per capita income
of US$1,960. This record is unsurpassed by any country during the past 30 years, with the
exception of China. Four out of ten Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets have

already been met, and three more are likely to be attained by 201510. The percentage of
people living in poverty fell from above 60% in the 1990s to around 20% in 2010.

1.5    Drivers of success. A study undertaken by the Overseas Development Institute
     11
(ODI) identifies several causal factors associated with the effective adoption and
implementation of Doi Moi.12

         Pragmatic party leadership, which encouraged both internal debate and policy
          innovations based on a trial-and-error approach.
         Effective public administration at central and subnational levels.13
         Strong governing and market institutions.
         A wide-reaching network of infrastructure14 that enabled efficient and effective
          implementation of economic reform policies, and empowered the poor.15
         Equitable initial investment in human development and associated social
          expenditures.
         Equitable land reform with targeted investment in agriculture brought significant
          increases in agricultural yields and poverty reduction in rural areas.

Also noteworthy are: (a) careful and sequenced liberalization; (b) the ability to attract
substantial foreign direct investments (FDI)16 following WTO accession; (c) an open
economy with large and growing exports linked to FDI); (d) a favorable geographic
location;17 (e) a higher degree of formalization than most comparator economies;18 (f) level
of financial deepening well above most countries with similar income; (g) competitiveness

give it relatively high mark for economic management compared to other IDA recipients– see Annex

   There have, for example, been significant improvements in access to electricity and its availability,
as reflected in per-capita consumption (see Annex Tables A1.3 and A1.4).

   Detailed discussion of land reform is outside the scope of this review. However, it should be noted
that this reform together with provision of adequate rural infrastructure may have helped moderate
rural-urban migration in Vietnam, with the urban population currently at 31% and growing at 3% per
annum (p.a.), which ranks it the 164th least urbanized country out of 195; Vietnam Urbanization
Review 2011) and alleviate the need to rapidly expand urban infrastructure to prevent the formation
of major slums which are a feature of many cities in the developing world. It also differentiates
Vietnam from other low-income countries. A more detailed discussion of the topic may be found in a

   Investment averaged around 32% of GDP between 2012 (with a slight declining trend). It was
driven by public investments, notwithstanding efficiency and sustainability concerns as per 2012
VDR, and by FDI (about US$7.8 billion p.a. 2009-2012, on par with South Africa and about 20% of
total for Sub-Saharan Africa).

(the Purchasing Power Parity index19 rose from 0.24 in 2006, to 0.35 in 2012, and remains
below many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa); (h) the relatively low annual population
growth rate of 1.3% (to be contrasted with 2.7% in SSA); and (j) and a strong sense of social
solidarity and equity.

1.6    The elements listed above are the key factors that differentiate Vietnam’s experience
from that of other countries with similar starting points in the early 1990s.20 However, given
the low starting point due to inappropriate policies in the 1980s, reforms undertaken during
the 1990s combined with Vietnam’s human capital base and advantageous location, the good
performance that was observed could have been expected. A study published as early as in
200221 conjectured that growth would not be sustained unless institutional issues were
addressed inter alia through improved governance and dealing with the financial sector. It
would also require tackling remaining challenges22 including rising inequality, environmental
degradation and corruption,23 while addressing macroeconomic stability and accelerating
State Owned Enterprise (SOE) reform and bank restructuring.

The Political, Institutional and Social Context
1.7     Political Context in Vietnam. Although a one party system, there are mechanisms for
building consensus around prospective reforms, taking into account the interests of various
groups and making adjustments along the way. Ultimately, the Communist Party of Vietnam
(CPV) is accountable to the population. Administratively, the country is decentralized and
divided into 63 provinces, the provinces are comprised of districts and the districts are
composed of communes. The CPV has its cadres at each of these levels as well as at the
central level.

1.8    The CPV Congress takes place every five years.24 Leaders are appointed or re-
appointed at that time. The agendas are carefully prepared over the roughly two years
preceding a Congress and key strategies such as the SEDP are then adopted by it.25 They
contain some economic areas that are thought to require special attention during the years
following a Congress. The 2-3 years immediately following a Congress can be a window of
opportunity for reform. After that the momentum may wane as leadership turns to the
preparations for the next Congress.26

1.9     At the province and district levels, CPV officials compete with each other in
attracting resources, both domestic and external, to speed up the development of their
provinces. Many innovative approaches tend to be first piloted at a decentralized level before
they are introduced more widely. Promotions within the CPV are often related to
performance at the decentralized levels of the administrative hierarchy. CPV officials that
work in the rural areas today are embedded in these communities.27 This allows them to
understand the needs of the local people while at the same time spreading their political
values. In the process they develop a form of cultural conformity as the values of the two
groups influence each other.

1.10 Vietnamese can pursue their interests through various organizations, such as the
Youth Union, Women’s Union, Farmers’ Union or the overarching Fatherland Front. Co-
production is a process frequently used at the local level. Users get involved in service
delivery. This makes co-production more demand-oriented. Civil organizations fulfill many
functions typically undertaken by NGOs. They are interest groups with influence both on the
Party and on the people they represent. Individuals and sub-groups may pursue their
particular interests but in the end have to broker them with other groups until they reach a
consensual way forward. These unique structures influenced the “Grassroots Democracy”
decree of 199828 and later the Enterprise Law that both helped unleash much initiative at the
household level. These structures also played a key role in the design of Government’s P135
Program and other National Targeted Programs (NTPs). The design of the three operations in
support of P135 essentially mirrors these socio-political structures. The villagers participate
in decisions, “own” the projects and enjoy the new services, and the officials have an
incentive to make the projects succeed since this may help them advance in the government
hierarchy.

1.11 Influence of Political Economy Considerations. There are political economy
analyses on how the authorities approach major reforms in Vietnam, given the social and
political environment in which they were formed and now operated.29 The paper titled
“Making Difficult Choices: Vietnam in Transition,” considers the Vietnamese reform process
through conversations with groups who were intimately involved in the process. One of the
early lessons recounted in the paper was the process of “breaking fences.” Pilot experiments
were run at low levels, presumably with the approval of local Party officials, which if
successful would be brought to the attention of high CPV officials. This way the center was
not compromised if the experiment failed, but could help scale it up if it was successful. The
slogan was “Break fences locally, dismantle them centrally”.

1.12 The paper also highlights the importance of building consensus around change.
Working through the contradictions and resolving them by working towards consensus was a
key as the leaders understood that minds change gradually. This approach began with Doi

Moi30 and evolved further as the reforms progressed. Another feature of the thinking was that
in the design of reforms one had to take into consideration the losers as they may form a
strong opposing vested interest. There are many examples of compensatory programs
including those discussed in latter sections of this report. Pragmatism was another feature of
the reform process in Vietnam.

1.13 Political economy analysis was useful in the design of donor’s support for policy and
institutional change. Development partners learned to be patient. They did not, for example,
insist on removing what a partner might believe to be a binding constraint, and therefore a
sine qua non condition for aid. Instead, given Vietnamese political economy, a menu of
policy actions was proposed, thus increasing the chances that some reforms would occur,
while building the consensus for those yet to come. Vietnam was determined to develop
rapidly so in its external partners’ perception the question was not whether they would carry
out important reforms, but when. The downside of this is that some key reforms have not
been carried out and now seem to be exerting a drag on the economy.

The Budget Support Portfolio of the World Bank in Vietnam
1.14 Prior to 2006, Vietnam received budget support through a series of Development
Policy Operations: the first series of five PRSCs during the first half of the 2000s, and
Structural Adjustment Credits prior to that. Development partners provided funding to the
implementation of the SEDP 2006-2010 and initial years of the SEDP 2011-15, inter-alia
through general and sectoral budget support operations.31 The most important such vehicle
was in the form of the second series of PRSCs (6-10) which provided general budget support
between 2007 and 2012. The World Bank (the largest financier) and 13 other development
partners32 provided total financial flows through budget support over six years of US$2.9
billion. Table 1.1 below presents information on budget support operations supported by the
World Bank and its co-financiers. It includes the second PRSC series as well as five sectoral
operations. The first sectoral DPO series, P135, was approved in 2007.

sectoral DPOs which are disbursed into the consolidate budget.

(above US$100 million).

administration and macro-fiscal management has been initiated as a follow-up to the PRSCs
and the first two operations were approved in 2013 and 2014. The three ongoing sectoral
DPO series (higher education, power and climate change) were completed with approval of

provided by development partners on average only accounted for slightly over 1% of public
expenditures and about 1/6th of ODA, it was an important source of financing of the budget
deficit and external reserves during difficult times.

Past Assessments of Vietnam PRSCs
1.18 IEG study.34 A case study of experience under the first Vietnam PRSC series was
prepared by IEG in 2010 as part of a broader evaluation of the World Bank’s support for
PRSCs. This learning exercise (which does not provide ratings found in PPARs) focused
mainly on experience under the first PRSC series of five operations spanning 2001 to 2006,

as well as design issues and observations pertaining to the second series’ first three
operations, especially PRSC 6. The report’s main findings were the following: (i) rigorous
analytic underpinnings of PRSCs provided a shared vision of the development agenda and a
menu of policy actions; (ii) fostering a connection to an external anchor (such as World
Trade Organization accession) helped to maintain momentum in the PRSC process and
reform generally; (iii) PRSCs can function as an effective complement to, and catalyst for,
sector operations including sector budget support; (iv) broad sector coverage facilitates use of
the PRSCs as a platform for policy dialogue between international partners and the
Government, but requires adherence to tight consultation schedules and rigorous criteria for
inclusion of policy actions; (v) with large numbers of international and government
participants, it becomes increasingly important for both Government and the Bank that
responsibilities for coordinating inputs and consultation and maintaining a policy overview
be closely linked, defined, and adequately funded; and (vi) the success of PRSC engagement
and development of high-quality policy dialogue in particular sectors may depend on getting
and keeping the right staff involved from both the partner and Government sides.

1.19 EU Evaluation.35 This review focused on the extent to which PRSCs met their
intended goals. It covered all PRSCs completed by 2010 (excluding PRSC 10), with greater
emphasis on PRSC 6-9. It was intended as an input to the SEDP 2011-15. Its main findings
were:36 (i) PRSC appears to have accelerated the pace of some reforms; (ii) Vietnam
represents a success story in the area of donor harmonization;37 (iii) PRSC is judged to have
been one of the most successful budget support programs to-date in terms of longevity and
scope; (iv) the “soft” conditionality allowed for a sustained dialogue in a broad range of
sectors; (v) insufficient attention was paid to addressing the efficiency of public investment
in the face of declining output to capital ratios; (vi) policy contributions from development
partners can be ineffective in the face of competing strategic and ideological options, and
political constraints; (vii) post-PRSC operations should prioritize areas such as SOE
borrowing, monetary and credit policies, managing international financial flows and
efficiency of investment; and (viii) although there was no consensus amongst development
partners whether future operations should have a narrower focus combined with deeper
reforms, the broad PRSC approach appears to have been appropriate at the time.

The Report’s Approach and Structure
1.20 The analyses summarized above present a positive assessment of the contributions of
PRSCs to Vietnam’s development. Processes underpinning the PRSC in terms of
Government ownership, stakeholder involvement and donor harmonization, under the
coordination of the Bank, as well as the analytical base and implementation support have
been implicitly and at times explicitly considered best practice. The findings may have been

   The present report does not attempt to validate the findings, which have already been vetted by
development partners. Nevertheless, a detailed reading may lead some readers to conclude that some
findings might have been better justified. For instance, certain aspects of the PRSC’s success is
asserted, but not fully demonstrated or explained.

influenced by the overall country performance. There may also have been an expectations
(implicit based on the experience highlighted in the aforementioned IEG study) that an major
outstanding issue will be progressively resolved – especially as the most important issues
were well-identified through analytical work and discussed as part of the policy dialogue.
Vietnam’s successful economic performance spans several decades, and the reported success
of the first series of policy-based lending, has generated high expectations. This report
examines whether such expectations were realized during the more recent period under
review. It attempts to fill the gaps in earlier left by earlier reviews/evaluations, while at the
same time addressing still-outstanding issues that they raise. The report draws on a two-week
mission to Vietnam, which included a field visit to the Northern Region (one of the poorest).

1.21 As a cluster PPAR the report builds on program level evidence that it synthesizes for
broader lessons about the use of DPOs in Vietnam for promoting policy and institutional
change. This involved a thorough review of existing studies and documentation, which in
Vietnam’s case is extensive. The structure of the report is the following: chapter 2 reviews in
detail the strategic underpinnings of the DPOs to assess the relevance of Bank’s interventions
and their objectives. Chapter 3 is focused on evidence on the intervention logic and design of
DPOs. Chapter 4 presents the results. The performance evaluation of the three completed
DPO series based on IEG and OPCS guidelines is presented in Chapter 5, based on the
analysis of previous chapters. Concluding remarks and lessons learnt are presented in
Chapter 6.

2. Strategic Relevance and Underpinning of Budget
Support Operations
2.1    This chapter describes and reviews key strategic and policy building blocks outlined
in Bank Policy,38 including Government and Bank strategies, the macroeconomic framework,
poverty and social aspects, public financial management and public resource allocation, and
environmental implications.

Government Strategy
2.2      The Government strategy underpinning the three completed DPO series was based
on the 2006-10 SEDP that had three sector pillars (economic, social, and natural resources)
as well as a cross-cutting fourth pillar (public sector management and governance). The
SEDP was expected to provide a framework to allocate public resources over the medium
term, thus addressing a weak point in previous strategies.39 The absence of a clear policy
matrix and a satisfactory monitoring framework as part of the mechanism to align
development partner support with national priorities was largely addressed through the 2007
Vietnam Development Report (VDR),40 “Aiming High,” which also represents a joint
development partner assessment. The VDR thus became the basis for the implementation of
the aid effectiveness agenda built into the Paris Declaration and the subsequent Hanoi Core
Statement41 and linked Bank support, notably the PRSC, to Government strategy.

2.3      “Aiming High” covers in detail the four SEDP pillars as well as the 17 policy areas
subsequently covered by actions supported by the PRSC. It sequenced and ranked the
proposed actions towards those with highest priority.42 This prioritization was more within
pillars than between them, with cross-cutting issues being dealt with through the
establishment of a strong coordination mechanism supported by the great majority of
development partners. The report presents a results matrix of possible policy actions and
associated indicators subsequently taken-up in the PRSC. Together, the 2006-10 SEDP and
“Aiming High” provided a strong operational and strategic foundation for the second PRSC
series, especially the initial operations, and, to a lesser extent, the PIR series also. However,
P135, approved in 2007 -- just a few months after the VDR was finalized -- is not mentioned
at all under the social protection area, neither is there direct mention of electricity/power and
higher education.

2.4    “Aiming High” was not repeated for the 2011-2015 SEDP, the main objective of
which is to lay the foundations for a modern, industrialized society by 2020. Subsequent and

   Lack of prioritization and unrealistic expectation is a recurring shortcoming in typical Growth and
Poverty Alleviation Strategies. These pitfalls appear to have been avoided in Vietnam thanks in part
to the VDR, which also implies that alignment was with a good quality strategy.
                                                 27


previous VDRs were more sector-oriented. A joint assessment of the draft 2011-2015 SEDP
was prepared in 2010 with UN support.43 The key messages are that: (a) Vietnam’s growth
model may reach its limits soon; (b) productivity enhancements are needed across all sectors,
notably through a more efficient public investment; (c) renovation of institutions needs to
continue; and (d) environmental pressures, increasing economic inequality, stresses arising
from urbanization and migration, and the exogenous challenges arising from climate change
all need to be addressed.

2.5     During the 2000s Government introduced a number of initiatives targeting poverty,
including National Targeted Program of P135. The P135 program encompassed the
following areas (a) production/ livelihoods support; (b) infrastructure development; (c)
capacity building; (d) living conditions support; and (e) program management support. The
program specified its geographical scope, funding from the national budget, monitoring and
evaluation, planning procedures and legal framework. Even though the program was
reinforced by policies, it consisted mainly of an investment program (focused on rural
infrastructure) whose success depended more on proper implementation of a sector wide
approach than specific reforms.

2.6      With respect to the Government strategy underpinning PIR, the program was
developed largely on the basis of 2009 PFM study44 and the 2009 VDR45 focused on capital.
The main thrust of the recommendations were: (a) prudent management of foreign capital
flows to minimize macroeconomic and financial distortions through appropriate exchange
rate, fiscal and monetary policies; (b) investing efficiently, notably through greater scrutiny
of SOE investments; (c) addressing short-term finance and intuitional constraints through
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs); and (d) improved project selection, appraisal and
implementation, taking into account decentralized responsibilities.

2.7     Summarizing, The DPOs reviewed in this report were well grounded in strategies
developed by the country with substantial development partner assistance, with P135 being
more orientated towards implementation rather than policy (due to the specific characteristic
of the operation). These strategies further benefitted from generally frank assessments,
supplemented by analytical work undertaken by the Bank and other development partners,
which informed and operationalized their agenda. The Program Document (PD46) of the first
operation presented these strategies in detail. From these standpoints, in addition to the
quality of documentation and strategic thinking behind the programs supported by DPOs,
Vietnam’s experience is good-practice.

World Bank Strategy
2.8     The DPOs under review were approved under the 2007-11 and 2012-16 Country
Partnership Strategies47 (CPSs). The 2007-11 CPS48 was fully aligned with the 2006-11
SEDP and was organized around the following pillars: i) Enhancing the business
environment; ii) Strengthening social inclusion for the poor; iii) Ensuring a more sustainable
management of natural resources and reduced environmental degradation; and iv)
Strengthening governance systems.

2.9      The DPO series initiated under the 2007-11 CPS were thus fully aligned and
supported by them, with the CPS additionally envisaging complementary reinforcing support,
notably project lending and analytical work. The CPS Completion Report reviewed by IEG
concludes that the interventions (including DPOs) were well suited to the country’s needs. It
also underscores the role of PRSC as a platform for policy dialogue. However, the CPS
envisaged that the PRSC would provide the main vehicle for sector policy dialogue. It
approached sectoral DPOs cautiously and with some degree of skepticism. It therefore did
not fully anticipate the rapid progression of such instruments in the late 2000s.

2.10 The DPOs remained relevant under the 2012-16 CPS that have the following pillars:
(i) strengthening Vietnam's competitiveness in the regional and global economy, (ii)
increasing the sustainability of its development, and (iii) broadening access to opportunity. It
is worth noting that while the CPS envisages completing the ongoing series of sectoral
operations, it does not mention initiating any new ones. The CPS also describes a new more
focused DPO series to succeed the PRSC,49 while tackling issues that were part of the PRSC
and PIR, and where a substantial reform agenda remains.

Macroeconomic Framework
2.11 Overall Macroeconomic situation. Vietnam’s economy went through a turbulent
period between 2007 and 2013, as did the rest of the world. After a prolonged period of
growth at an average of over 7% per-annum, the Vietnamese economy began overheating
during 2007. This was driven by large capital inflows in the wake of Vietnam’s accession to
the WTO in January of 2007, which the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) was not able to
sterilize, together with high food and fuel prices. GDP growth in 2007 rose to 8.5% and by
early 2008 inflation was above 20% (Table 2.1). Domestic credit was expanding at a rate of
over 50% per year. The stock market index reached a peak in 2007 that was nearly ten times
its value in 2000, and real estate prices were rising extremely fast. The authorities recognized
the existence of a financial bubble and adopted a package of policy measures (“the eight
groups of measures”) in March 2008 to prevent further overheating and curb inflation. The
stabilization program included a reduction of recurrent expenditures by 10% and a
discontinuation of a number of nonessential public investment projects. Credit growth was
kept to 25% during 2008.

2.12 The authorities switched from stabilization to stimulus in the second half of 2008, as
the financial crisis spread from the US to the rest of the world. Vietnam’s exports began to be
affected by the slowdown in foreign demand. In November of 2008, the Government adopted
a package of “five groups of measures”. The main policy rate (the SBV refinancing rate) was
reduced by 7 percentage points (from its high of 21% in August of 2008), a credit guarantee
scheme was put in place for SMEs, an interest subsidy of 4 percentage points was introduced
for working capital loans and both enterprise and personal taxes were reduced or deferred. As
indicated in Table 2.1, this resulted in a substantial increase in the budget deficit in 2009 to
7.2% of GDP, compared to 2.2% in 2008.

2.13 The stimulus program, while encouraging economic activity, also increased
Vietnam’s external vulnerability, as reflected in a decline in foreign exchange reserves to the
                                              30


equivalent of 1.4 months of imports. Furthermore, critical macroeconomic information, such
as the exact size of the stimulus package and the level of international reserves was not made
public in a timely manner. This added to uncertainty and exacerbated the foreign exchange
shortage by inducing pre-emptive gold and hard currency hoarding. In November 2009, after
it had become clear that the stimulus was unsustainable, the Government announced another
policy switch back to stabilization. This, however, was only partially implemented. Although
the exchange rate was devalued twice (by around 10% cumulatively against the US dollar)
and the budget was tightened, continuing uncertainties on interest rates and bank credit
undermined the desired stabilization and recovery in market confidence.

2.14 As annual GDP growth approached 7%, the economy started overheating in the
second half of 2010. In December 2010 inflation reached a two year high of 11.8%, the Dong
came under intense pressure and international reserves dropped to 1.5 months’ worth of
imports. There were also concerns about the health of the banking sector, partly because of
the build-up of contingent liabilities of the SOEs. As a result of these factors, and following
the bankruptcy of one of the largest SOEs, Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s downgraded
Vietnam’s sovereign rating by one notch to BB-50 three levels below investment grade. Some
setbacks in the implementation of the macro-stabilization plan were explained by the
approaching Party Congress in January 2011, and the reluctance of policy makers to sacrifice
economic growth ahead of this critically important political event.

2.15 The consensus among the policymakers51 after the completion of the eleventh Party
Congress in January 2011 was that macroeconomic stability had to be restored, even at the
cost of a prolonged slowdown in growth. The Government approved Resolution 11, to pursue
“tight and prudent monetary and fiscal policy.”52 The measures included a devaluation of the
Dong by 9.3%, a severe tightening of monetary policy, a reduction of 3.2% of GDP in public
capital investments, a limit to the banks’ exposure to non-productive activities (including real
estate and security markets) to 22% of total credit by June 30, 2011, an acceleration in the
equitization of SOEs and measures to improve their governance, and increased disclosure of
information important to the various actors in the economy.

2.16 By 2012, Vietnam‘s economy had returned to a relatively stable macroeconomic
environment after the unstable stop/go period of 2007-11. The authorities accepted that a
lower GDP growth trajectory was the price of bringing inflation back to the single digit
range, stabilizing the exchange rate and improving the international reserve position. The
Dong/US$ exchange rate has been stable since the second half of 2011 and the parallel
market rate premium has disappeared. The export sector returned to its stellar performance,
driven by foreign direct investment. Vietnam registered its first trade surplus in over 20 years
in 2012 and its current account moved to a surplus of 5% of GDP.

2.17 Although macro stability was restored, the fiscal position deteriorated after the brief
consolidation in 2011 and became pro-cyclical in 2012-2013.53 This was largely due to the
effects of tax exemptions introduced during the crisis that have not been fully withdrawn.
Weaknesses in tax administration may have also contributed to the decline. Since 2008, the
tax to GDP ratio has declined from 24.4% of GDP to 17.7% (2013). In 2012, the fiscal deficit
widened to 7.5%, higher than at the peak of fiscal expansion during the global crisis. This
translated into an increase in the ratio of public debt to GDP, which is estimated to reach
55% in 2014. The overall picture is one of substantial narrowing of fiscal space at a time of
uncertainties in external developments and higher contingent liabilities arising from the
banking sector and poor performance of SOEs. The IMF’s most recent estimates indicate
that, the debt to GDP ratio is approaching levels beyond which debt sustainability would be
at risk.

2.18 In summary, Vietnam experienced a period of macroeconomic destabilization in
2009-2010 as a result of a major fiscal expansion and subsidized credit growth. Although it
regained macro-stability in 2011, weaknesses remain in the policy framework. The pro-
cyclical fiscal position of recent years, and resultant built-up of public debt have increased
macroeconomic risks. The economy is vulnerable to internal and external shocks. Vietnam’s
current public debt level is higher than that of its regional comparators. The IMF estimates
that a debt to GDP ratio of no more than 40 to 45% should be the medium-term benchmark
for Vietnam.54 Substantial improvements in fiscal management and institutional
transformation in the SOE and banking sectors are required to reduce the risks to more
manageable levels.

2.19 Macro-economic underpinning of Bank support. Vietnam has not had an IMF
program since the expiration of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility in April 2004,
which has implications for the Bank and its role in that country. The Bank remained an
important partner for Vietnam throughout the crisis, adjusting its lending program to address
the country’s increased financing needs. Its budget support portfolio was appropriately
countercyclical during the crisis, with the largest amounts approved and disbursed in 2009
and 2010. Total disbursements through DPOs peaked in 2010 at around US$1 billion, with an
additional US$250 million for the then ongoing PRSC and PRI series and the launching of a
new series of sector DPOs.55 The share of Bank DPOs in total net ODA flows to Vietnam
increased from around 5% in 2008 to more than 30% in 2010 (Chart 2.1 below). The second
DPO of the P135 series, approved in early March 2009, was doubled in size to US$100
million to offset the potential impact of the crisis in the rural areas (people losing jobs in the
urban areas and returning to the countryside).

2.20 Not all new series, however, were explicitly formulated as an anti-crisis response.
Only the series on Public Investment Reform under which US$850 million was disbursed
included a macro objective – supporting Vietnam’s fiscal stimulus program. Sectoral DPOs

53
   International Monetary Fund (IMF 2014), Article IV, October 2014
54
   IMF 2014, op. cit.
55
   Such sectoral DPOs had been envisaged in the 2007-11 CPS (para. 86) even before the financial
crisis: “Additional sector-level DPOs may be introduced, albeit selectively, when policy reforms and
program improvement warrant such intervention.”
                                                     32


launched during the crisis (Power, Higher Education, P135, and Climate Change, DPO
series) supported sector specific reforms generally without an explicit link to the
macroeconomic crisis. Nevertheless, the Power DPO series was launched at the peak of the
crisis and was large enough to have macro and fiscal implications (the first disbursement
took place in December 2010 in an amount of around US$310 million that brought overall
disbursements under DPOs to around US$1 billion in 2010). Although budget support
lending had tapered off from the peaks of 2009-2010, annual DPO disbursements were still
about US$400 million in 2012 and 2013, double the equivalent amounts prior to the crisis.

2.21 Conclusion. On balance, macroeconomic underpinning of DPOs were borderline
adequate. The economy never went into a full-fledged and prolonged destabilization.
However, in terms of the spirit of OP 8.60 with regard to macro-underpinnings of Bank’s
engagement through policy lending the Bank was taking high risks in lending in a volatile
environment without putting in place viable risk mitigation mechanisms (further discussed in
paras 3.2-3.8).

Poverty and Social Analysis and Impacts
2.22    Reduction of Income Poverty. There are two poverty lines used in parallel in
Vietnam. Government Statistics Office-World Bank (GSO-WB) poverty line is derived based
on consumption patterns identified by household surveys. The line was modified in 2010
survey reflecting improvements in the quality of the food reference basket (fewer calories
from rice, more consumption of proteins, vegetables, and fats) and a higher allocation for
essential nonfood spending, including housing and durables” (Poverty Report 2012 p.3). The
change in poverty line made it more appropriate for a middle income country, but it also
created a discontinuity in poverty data. Long-term poverty reduction trend, however, is
apparent: in the early 90s the poverty defined at US$2 per person per day (in 2005 PPP) was
                                                         33


above 80%, compared to around 20% in 2010 based on US$2.26 per person per day (in 2005
PPP).

2.23 So called MOLISA poverty line is based on household income data collected both
administratively and through limited use of surveys. This poverty line is computed only
every five years at the start of a new SEDP. For example for 2010, in preparation for the
SEDP 2011-15, the poverty line was set at VDN 400.000 for rural areas (70% of the
population) and VDN 500.000 for urban areas (30% of the population). On average for the
entire population, this was roughly equivalent to US$1.50 per person per day at 2005
purchasing power parity, which made it about two thirds of the of US$2.26. Unlike the GSO-
WB poverty line, the MOLISA cut-off level is kept fixed in nominal terms for five years
until the next SEDP. Poverty rates measured by MOLISA thus tend to drop more rapidly,
making poverty reduction look faster than it actually is. The MOLISA rate is useful both for
targeting assistance under the Government’s various NTPs as well as in budget allocations. It
may have been purposely been kept below the GSO-WB line in order to save scarce budget
resources.56 Table 2.2 summarizes poverty data by regions based on different poverty lines.

2.24 Extreme Poverty. According to the GSO-WB methodology, in 2005 8% of the
population was extremely poor, living at a level of less than US$1.5 per person per day
purchasing power parity US dollars, and 94% of the extremely poor lived in the countryside.
Poverty headcounts is also very different among regions, with the Northern Highlands facing

the worst hardships (especially in the northwest corner of the country). Ethnic minorities
were most affected by poverty.57

2.25 Other Indicators of wellbeing. Vietnam is on track to achieve most of its MDGs by
2015. Outcomes in the recent PISA tests compare well with many developed countries.
Average life expectancy now stands at 76 years of age. Growth has been strong both in the
countryside as well as in the urban areas, slowing down the migration of the rural population
into the urban areas, thus allowing some time for the urban areas to be able to absorb the
migrants. Over 96% of households are now connected to electricity and by all-weather roads.
With most households owning a motorbike, the mobility of the population has increased
substantially. This is further boosted by exponentially growing ownership of mobile phones.
And access to internet and TV has also helped to integrate the country.

2.26 Poverty and Social Analysis underpinning DPOs. Under each of the ten DPOs
evaluated in this report it had to be assessed whether the policy changes supported by the
DPO in question created specific losers who would need to be compensated. For example,
during the period running up to the accession of Vietnam to the WTO (which coincided with
the period of the preparation of PRSC-6), efforts were made to identify potential winners and
losers of the trade reforms. However, the conclusions were too ambiguous to provide a basis
for action. Instead, in 2006 the safety nets that had been available to redundant SOE workers
in prior years were extended to the private sector. For the first time in Vietnam,
unemployment insurance was started in 2006, norms for budged allocations to provinces
were made poverty sensitive, and preparations started for developing a modern social
insurance system, beginning with health.

2.27 Regionally concentrated ethnic minority areas, where poverty reduction had lagged,
were targeted geographically through the P135 program (supported in its second phase by the
series of three operations covered in this report).There were also parallel NTPs that
complemented the P135 programs. The overall range of assistance included the building of
local infrastructure, subsidies for inputs, agricultural extension, access to micro-credit,
subsidies for improving household toilet facilities, improvements in local health clinics and
some scholarships for students from very poor households. Not all the programs operated in
all areas, but over time, all but the most remote areas received substantial help (see Chapter
IV). Many of the initiatives were run at the lowest possible levels, involving the villagers in
the planning and selection of projects, in the process tailoring the projects more closely to the
people’s needs and keeping down the costs through community participation.



57
   In terms of headcounts, these two areas account for 40% of the extremely poor. Of these the vast
majority are ethnic minorities that tend to inhabit these areas. The North Central Coast and Central
Highlands regions, two other areas inhabited in substantial numbers by ethnic minorities account for
another 30% of the extremely poor. Poverty rates in these areas, particularly among the ethnic
minorities, have shown improvement over time, but the improvement was much slower than that in the
river deltas around Hanoi and HCMC, dominated by the Kinh majority. In 2010, 66.3% of ethnic
minorities were still poor, compared to only 12.9% of the Kinh, and a substantial 37.4% of ethnic
minorities were still extremely poor, compared to only 2.9% of the Kinh.
                                                 35


2.28 Some urban areas developed faster than others through economies of agglomeration.
This led to major windfalls to landowners. Inequalities emerged as well from premiums for
certain skills and the unevenness of development across regions. Offsetting policies were put
in place. In 2008, under PRSC-8, partial subsidization of the near-poor (and not just the poor)
was begun. A voluntary pension program for farmers and informal sector workers (of which
there are millions) was initiated with some assistance for the poor. Guidelines were issued for
forest development based on participatory land-use planning and independent monitoring.
This was particularly important in the ethnic minority areas.

2.29 With land prices soaring in some areas, issues of land became increasingly important.
Under the first PIR, Decree 69/2009/ND-CP was adopted as a prior action which includes
provisions on land-use planning, development of land funds, land acquisition and
compensation, and resettlement support. To ensure that land valuation reflected market
prices, the decree included articles on the relevant prices in the cases of land allocation, land
lease, land reclamation, and SOE equitization.58 Importantly, the decree prescribes the same
valuation procedures for allocated land as for land rented from the state. Those whose land is
reclaimed are entitled to full compensation based on market value, and various types of
assistance The decree also aims to reduce the processing time by one half to one third.

2.30 The period covered by this report witnessed considerable price instability, resulting
partly from external factors (fluctuations in commodity prices), but also from
macroeconomic policy. At some point, the annual rate of inflation approached 20%. The poor
are much more vulnerable to such price swings as they have no cushion to withstand the
shocks. During this period, the government came to accept that there is a trade-off between
growth and inflation, and to protect the poor put more emphasis on price stabilization
measures.

Safeguards.59
2.31 Bank Operational Policy 8.60 governing DPOs calls for negative environmental
impact and mitigation measures to be identified, together with a discussion of countries’
systems and knowledge gaps. Vietnam has been identified as a country that faces significant
environment challenges as well as being vulnerable to climate change. As part of this
evaluation the analysis below reviews the treatment of environmental issues under the PRSC,
PIR and P135 series. The report also discusses briefly the Climate Change and Power DPOs
due to their self-evident environmental dimensions. Although these series are not covered by
this evaluation, a review of their treatment of environmental issues adds important insights to
the knowledge about the overall use of DPOs in Vietnam.

2.32 PRSCs. The program document for PRSC 6 stated that the proposed PRSC series
supports a number of diverse policy actions which could have effects on the country’s

58
   Equitization involves sale of shares of SOEs with the State typically retaining a portion. This
approach and a broader analysis of SOE reform in Vietnam is described in a 2006 working paper:
State Owned Enterprises and Equitization in Vietnam
59
   This section is based on a detailed analysis undertaken by the mission and a draft detailed report
prepared as background document.
                                            36


environment, forests and other natural resources. Rather than trying to address those potential
impacts one by one, the approach taken in Vietnam was to mainstream environmental
objectives into the PRSC process. This approach led to the adoption and implementation of
legal frameworks for land, forests and environmental management. The PD notes that
supporting analytical work had been undertaken to address gaps in the existing arrangements
and incentives for environmental governance.60The PD did not specifically assess the
Borrower’s procedures for mitigating any adverse environmental impact of the reforms and
did not indicate whether there were “significant” gaps in this analysis or weaknesses in the
Borrower’s systems. In this sense, the PD for PRSC 6 did not strictly comply with the
requirements for DPOs, even if it covered many important areas.

2.33 While the program document of PRSC 7 emphasized that “despite progress in the
environmental assessment policy environment and good analytical and project work in a
range of sectors, Vietnam faces significant environmental challenges” it explained that the
major challenges Vietnam faces in the environmental arena require multi-pronged and long-
term solutions outside of the PRSC framework. The PDs of PRSC 8 and 9 suggested that a
number of policy actions raised at least the theoretical possibility of negative environmental
impacts, and identified their impact and mitigating steps to be taken. While a step forward,
there were still several problems with the assessment it indicated a number of areas where the
results of the actions taken either within, or parallel to, the PRSC series may not generate the
desired mitigation, without explaining the nature of the additional steps the Bank would take,
through the PRSCs or by other means, to help the Government to address such issues. The
PD of PRSC 9 also stated that “many potential environmental implications of growing
investment programs in Vietnam are most suitably addressed through the strengthening of
national capacity in environmental impact assessment” and that “under the World Bank’s
parallel DPO on Public Investment Reform, which is also being assessed by IEG (see below),
the Government has engaged to carry out a number of regulatory reforms and capacity
building initiatives” in the areas of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic
environmental assessment (SEA). This approach may lead to certain environmental issues
not being adequately dealt with.

2.34 The program document of PRSC 10, for the first time, gave explicit attention to all
the environmental impact of all four Pillars and their “medium-term objectives”. The basic
conclusion of this analysis was that of the 14 prior actions and benchmarks reviewed, none
were found to have a potential negative impact and two a likely positive environmental
benefit, ”with the most important of the positive benefits identified being associated with the
promotion of SEAs in development planning. However, this analysis did not cover the earlier
policy actions in the more sensitive areas previously mentioned that might have had less
positive impacts on the environment and which had not been specifically assessed in
connection with the appraisal of the earlier PRSCs. Overall, PRSC PDs undertook some
analysis of the environmental impact of reforms, and the quality of this analysis improved
over time.

2.35 Public Investment Reforms. Many of the reforms under the PIR were a follow-up
and/or related to those under the PRSC. The environmental analysis has thus similar
strengths and weaknesses, notably with respect to treatment of impact of SOE reforms and
public investment. There is general reference to SEA and EIAs (with reference to studies
already cited under the PRSC) and a statement that the program will have a positive impact
on the environment, forests, and other natural resources. The PD provides a classification of
prior actions in terms of their environmental impact and concludes that apart from
aforementioned positive effects, most of the actions are environmentally neutral. There is a
specific discussion of the prior action related to land compensation, which may encourage
investors to convert natural habitats such as forested land, rather than paying compensation
costs for acquiring agricultural land. The PD cites two laws that would discourage such
behavior but the argument is weakened by lack of evidence being provided on the
effectiveness and implementation of these laws in practice. Overall, the analysis should have
been deeper in order to meet the intent of the policy directive.

2.36 P135. As part of preparation of the first operation, a study of environmental and
natural resource (notably forestry) implications of P135 was undertaken. Based on the
experience of the parallel IDA-supported Northern Mountain Poverty Reduction (NMRP)
Operation and others, the PD (para. 147) concludes that any adverse impact would be small
while favorable ones would be large. However, there is no mention of safeguards concerning
indigenous people and involuntary resettlement triggered by the second NMRP (approved in
2010). The report also notes that significant analytical work has helped identify issues and
that (para. 148) “once ethnic minority households and communities acquire land through
state forest enterprise reform, they are able to access appropriate forms of market-orientated,
forestry extension support to help them make productive and sustainable use of forest land.”
The document notes that this issue and that of the adequacy of Government monitoring
systems would need to be followed through future operations in the series. Overall, given the
gaps in coverage of potential safeguards triggered and review of issues being pushed back to
the next operation, the first operation does not appear to have fully identified the issues nor to
have put in place appropriate mitigation measures.

2.37 The next operation built on the significant attention paid during the mid-term review
of the program to environmental issues. The PD provides a more detailed list of issues (paras.
95-96) and introduced specific benchmarks in the policy matrix as well as technical
assistance proposals on production methods and the use of production practices relying less
on chemical inputs. Resettlement is again handled as a risk to be addressed through the
parallel dialogue on strengthening country systems, as opposed to directly as part of the
program. Based on available information, it seems that while attention to environmental
issues improved after the first operations, there was insufficient focus on resettlement.
Furthermore, there is no information of whether on effectiveness of the mitigation measures
and how these affected outcomes.

2.38 Climate Change DPO. The PD affirmed that the DPO series was “likely to have
significant positive effects on the environment, forests and other natural resources” and
argues that “climate change itself will have negative impacts on forests and other
environmental resources over the long-term, so the enhanced climate resilience that is the
objective of this operation represents a significant positive environmental effect.” It
                                              38


acknowledged that a few of the specific policy areas to be supported are likely to have either
positive or negative effects on natural resources, and indicates that policy reforms that might
“theoretically generate negative environmental effects” were those associated with the
“irrigation sector.” The PD argued, that “the intention of irrigation policy reforms is to better
manage water resources for irrigation” although this “could result in more intense irrigated
agriculture in some areas and result in more use of pesticides and localized adverse
environmental impacts and reduce water availability for other purposes.” There is no
indication of specifically how potential increased pesticide – and other agro-chemicals – use
would be managed or its potential adverse environmental impacts mitigated.

2.39 Mitigation was to involve a “two-pronged approach” through the Mekong Water
Resources Development Project and through the strengthening of national EIA regulations
and processes under the PIR series and by technical assistance. However, the Mekong Water
Resources Project does not cover all parts of Vietnam where irrigated agriculture takes place,
and a recent Bank assessment suggests that improvements to the countries systems for EIA
and Strategic Environmental Assessment have been limited to date.

2.40 Power. The PDs argue that the investment plan for the sector is well known and the
two environmental consequences on air emissions and on natural resources and forests have
been reviewed. They conclude that the policies supported by the operations are unlikely to
have significant environmental impacts. There is no discussion of other safeguards.61 Greater
precision would, in any event, have been difficult since the proceeds of the DPOs were to be
on-lent to Vietnam Electricity,62 so that the use of these resource could not be identified.
Nonetheless, the PD could have provided a framework to ensure the identification and
mitigation of negative environmental and social impacts.

2.41 Summarizing, the Bank and other development partners carried out significant
environment-related analysis in Vietnam during the period immediately leading up to and
during the years when the PRSC 6-10 series was being implemented. However, the
respective PDs, while highlighting several policy action areas where significant impacts
might occur, did not adequately identify what those impacts might be. There was little
discussion as to whether the Vietnamese Government possessed the institutional capacity
necessary to address them effectively, nor of what the Bank might do in order to assist the
Government. Thus, the Bank did not fully comply with OP 8.60,63 particularly for the initial
operations in the PRSC series. Similar problems are present under the PIR and climate
change DPOs, and to a lesser extent, under P135. The relevant sector DPOs do not to appear
to address adequately the issues left uncovered in the series reviewed by this PPAR. The PD
for the Climate Change DPO reveals similar gaps to those identified in the PRSC series. The

63
   Perhaps similar scrutiny if applied to other DPOs would result in similar conclusions. However,
given Vietnam’s environmental challenges, it may be appropriate to take advantage of every
opportunity to cover this issue.

environmental analysis for the Power DPO series, is sector-oriented and may not cover all
relevant safeguard policies adequately.

Public Expenditure and Financial Management
2.42 Public Financial Management (PFM) in Vietnam. Vietnam had made substantial
progress in PFM in the years preceding the new series of PRSCs. The most important
achievement was enacting the new Budget Law in 2002 that was transformative in laying
down the foundation of a modern budgetary system with the Parliament and People’s
Councils deciding on budget allocations and the Government being accountable for budget
implementation. In 2005, the State Budget Plan was disclosed for the first time, which was an
important milestone in enhancing transparency in public finance.

2.43 This was followed by the enactment of new budgetary oversight regulations that
mandated disclosure of budgetary data at all levels of government and increased transparency
in public investments projects. Establishment of an Independent State Audit in 2005 was
important in promoting accountability of public agencies. As a first step in improving the
budget’s mid-term planning framework the Government began piloting a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in four sectors and for all provinces with the intention of
rolling out at the central government level. There had been improvements in consolidation of
capital and recurrent budgets into a single budget and introduction of budget norms of
expenditure planning.

2.44 In spite of these developments Vietnam’s PFM system was still in its “infancy” by
modern standards when the second series of PRCSs and support for the Government’s P135
National Program began. This was the reason that the CPS for 2007-2010, and the second
series of PRSCs focused on PFM as an important reform area. It has been recognized64 that
using internal standards of accounting in the public sector, introducing internal audit
mechanisms in public agencies, changing the practices of off-budget borrowing for public
investment projects, limiting carry-over of large a portion of annual spending without
subsequent reporting, reducing inefficiency in public investment program, and addressing
shortcomings in public financial management information system are the key challenges to
be met in improving budgetary efficiency.

2.45 Some of these areas (planning process, audits, debt management and public
investment), became the focus of the second PRSC series. There were also complementary
technical assistance and investment lending projects put in place to facilitate modernization
of budget management systems in 2007-12. In addition, the newly launched P135 programs
addressed some important aspects of PFM at communal level, mostly in the framework of
facilitating efficient use of resources transferred from the state budget for service delivery at
local level. A new DPO series (PIR) was launched in 2009 as an additional boost for public
investment reforms that had been largely stagnant under the second series of PRSCs in 2007-
09.

2.46 Between 2007 and 2012, the PFM system was in a process of change, although
progress was slower than expected given the ambitiousness of the Government’s reform
program. A modern treasury management system (TABMIS), and enhanced external audits
were introduced A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)65 exercise in
2013 diagnosed PFM issues. According to this, there were still large carry-overs of
expenditures to the following years that lacked standard economic and functional
classifications, a lack of reporting of expenditures at the commitment stage that limits the
efficiency of TABMIS, non-conformity of financial reporting with international standards,
large unreported government operations through extra-budgetary funds, a lack of multi-year
fiscal projections, and a lack of effective internal audit mechanisms. Although these
shortcomings make it difficult to analyze public expenditures, key trends between 2007 and
2012 have been assessed using available data.66

2.47 As noted in table 2.3 below, Government expenditures as a percentage of GDP have
declined slightly since mid-2000s. The fiscal envelope increased substantially in 2009 due to
the Government’s response to the financial crisis. However, total expenditures fell from 33%
of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 27.6% in 2013, thanks mainly to a four percentage point
decline in capital expenditures. This can be considered as a positive development given the
inefficiencies in Vietnam’s large public investment program. However, this assumes that the
reduction in the envelope has been made through the elimination of projects with the lowest
rates of return – the mission was unable to obtain information on this point.

2.48 The Government has maintained its focus on social spending during the period under
review. Expenditures in social sector (not including capital expenditures) have increased
from 8% of GDP in 2006 to 9.4% in 2013. The proportion of public expenditures on
education and training in GDP was at around four% in 2013 compared to 3.5% in mid 2000s.
There was also an increase in the share of health expenditures. Given that the overall fiscal
envelope in relation to GDP was somewhat smaller in 2013 than in 2006, Government’s
focus on social expenditures can be considered broadly adequate.

2.49 Conclusion: Despite their weaknesses, the public financial management systems
were sufficiently robust to justify the Bank’s budget support. In the same vein, budget
allocations were relatively appropriate and pro-poor. Therefore, DPO resources were likely
to contribute to poverty alleviation.

Analytical underpinning
2.50 The quality of policy operations is influenced by the analytical work upon which the
policy dialogue with the country is based, by how well lessons learnt are integrated,67 and by
constraints identified through sectoral operations and technical assistance. The most recent of
the World Bank’s Operation Policies and Country Service (OPCS) triennial studies makes
the following observations based on a universe of DPO evaluations covering various
countries completed in preceding years: (i) the need to fully use available studies68, which
may be an issue in Vietnam as some reports are not made public (e.g., the 2007 Country
Financial Accountability Assessment); (ii) the need to better use of Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis (PSIA) to support DPOs,69 and (iii) the need to clearly articulate, in Project

Documents, the links between analytical work and programs being supported70. One of the
reports also highlights the need for considerable improvement in the treatment of
environmental issues,71 which as seen earlier is also applicable to Vietnam.

2.51 Vietnam was an exceptionally well-studied country during the period under review
and all six DPO series benefitted from strong analytical underpinnings. The DPOs also
appears to have avoided some of the pitfalls highlighted by OPCS, notably through: (i) good
use of available studies, with at times clear linkages established with reforms being supported
(as for instance discussed above in the government strategy section); (ii) appropriate use of
relatively up-to-date PSIA (see sections in this chapter on environment and poverty); and (iii)
effective use of outside knowledge and analytical sources, including through join flagship
reports such as the VDR.

2.52 The main studies referred to in the PDs for the series reviewed are listed in Annex
Table B.7. As indicated, some of these studies, notably VDRs, were cross-cutting and
provided the basis for all the DPO series. Others were much more sector-specific, and well
integrated into the relevant DPOs. In the case of P135, the analytical inputs included
evaluation of the first phase of the program, as well as more than a dozen analytical studies
carried out on Vietnam during the period 2002-2009. These documents covered problems of
high relevance to P135 related to ethnic minorities, spatial poverty targeting, issues in
agriculture and forestry, irrigation, and rural development and poverty reduction in general.

2.53 Notwithstanding strong evidence of consideration of knowledge products into PRSCs
and the PIR, a minor shortcoming concerned the link between the studies and the design
reforms is not always evident and may have diminished over time, in the sense that some of
the most pressing identified reforms were not integrated into the program. One may assume
these were an integral part of the dialogue between government and development partners.72
Furthermore, the design of the PRSC series made it difficult to integrate studies undertaken
towards it latter years. For instance, the 2010 VDR had limited impact on the governance
area of PRSC 10.

2.54 Conclusion. Vietnam DPOs benefitted from extensive, good quality analytical work,
which in turn help enhance the formulation and implementation of reforms. The quality of
the work (based on the review of many such documents) appeared to have been generally
good and at times outstanding. There is credible evidence that this favorably and
substantively affected the overall design. In the case of the latter PRSCs, the integration of
recent analytical work into design was more limited.

3. Intervention Logic
3.1     The previous chapters examined the background to the DPOs reviewed in this PPAR,
and presented their building blocks. This chapter focuses on various aspects of intervention
logic and design, including analysis of underlying institutional arrangements, results
framework, and the Bank’s response to macroeconomic issues raised in the previous chapter.

Macroeconomic focus of Bank DPOs
3.2      The operational policy governing Bank’s policy lending underscores the importance
of a sound macroeconomic framework. The underlying principle behind this is that the
overarching objective of the Bank’s policy lending - poverty reduction through growth –
cannot be achieved and sustained without macro-economic stability. This typically means
that for DPOs to be successful, inflationary pressures need to be under control, budget
deficits and current account balances need to be sustainable, and the risk of the country’s
policy makers being unable to manage prospective internal or external shocks should be
reasonably low. The Bank’s operational policy also stipulates that where macroeconomic
stability is jeopardized, the program supported by the Bank policy lending should help the
borrower to return to macroeconomic stability through incorporating macro actions in the
DPO’s policy matrix

3.3     The macroeconomic situation in Vietnam during 2008-2011 was volatile due to a
combination of a major external shock and policy choices. Vietnam’s policy response to the
crisis was controversial, including the size, structure and timing of the stimulus that led to
overheating and destabilization. By all accounts macroeconomic stability was at risk during
most of 2010 and early 2011.73 Although the PDs of the DPOs implemented during the crisis
period considered the macroeconomic risks, the operations did not include macroeconomic
and fiscal policy actions in their policy matrices (except for the debt to GDP ratio objective
in the Governance pillar of the PRSC series that was underpinning the program’s PFM
agenda). The financing amounts of both ongoing series (the PRSCs and P135) were
augmented to provide additional financing to Vietnam without committing the Government
to take parallel macroeconomic policy actions. Neither did the two DPO series (PIR and
Power), which were approved at the peak of the crisis and provided US$1.5 billion in
financial resources to the country, contain any “corrective” macro actions in the programs
they supported. This absence appears to conflict with Bank guidelines. Vietnam has not had
an IMF program since 2004 (see Box 3.1 below), which further strengthens the case for
including macroeconomic actions within budget support operations.

3.4     Vietnam’s own policy agenda contained much that the Bank could have drawn upon
to design a program focused on macro-stabilization. In particular, in November 2009, the
Government issued a resolution to shift from stimulus to stabilization, which could have been
used for the policy matrix underpinning PIR1, Power1, PRSC9, third P135 and Higher
Education that were presented to the Board during 2010. Another resolution on stabilization


 In 2012 IMF had reported that Vietnam “has regained macro-stability” (IMF, 2012 Article IV
73

Report)
                                            44


was adopted in early 2011, which also not reflected in the DPO policy matrices of that
period.

3.5     The absence of macroeconomic measures from the DPO-supported programs may be
explained by the Authorities’ unwillingness to include them, in view of political economy
constraints. For example, stabilization measures might have been unpopular among various
political constituencies ahead of the Party Congress in January 2011, especially because of
their potential impact on fiscal allocations to provincial authorities. According to Bank staff
interviewed for this evaluation, Bank insistence on including macro-policy measures as prior
action for policy lending might have undermined the relations with Vietnam without
achieving much given the binding political constraints. However, the acceleration of lending
in the absence of such measures may have undermined voices within the administration that
argued in favor of greater attention to the macro situation.

3.6      In the absence of specific macro policy actions under the DPOs the burden of
promoting macroeconomic reforms shifted to the policy dialogue. As suggested by the
review of the first PRSC series, this approach was seen as a way to promote policy changes
in various areas without formally including them in policy matrices, and had arguably been
successful in the past in Vietnam. With respect to the period under review, there is evidence
that the policy dialogue was actively used for promoting policy adjustment only under the
PIR series. In particular, in 2009 the Bank delayed PIR processing to facilitate Government’s
decision to reconsider a reversal on a key proposed prior action related to the adoption of a
new investment law. In any event, policies became unsustainable again after the
disbursement of PIR1 in early 2010. In late 2010, the Bank delayed PIR2 until the Party
Congress in January 2011 for reasons that included the need to address the macroeconomic
framework. However, just when finalization of the PIR program was delayed, the Bank
prepared, approved and disbursed end-2010 the PRSC9 and Power1 operations. These
provided around US$500 million of budget support when macroeconomic uncertainties were
at their peak and these operations did not support measures to address them. The
fragmentation of policy dialogue through five DPOs implemented in parallel appears to have
weakened Bank’s focus on macroeconomic issues and contributed to mixed signals.

3.7      The avoidance to date of continued serious macroeconomic instability after 2012
owed little to Bank-supported programs or policy dialogue. It was due, rather, to greater
political openness following the Party of Congress of 2011 and to the perception on the part
of the Authorities, of the mounting costs of instability. Even the recent improvement in the
macroeconomic situation is relative. Vietnam’s economy is more open, and hence more
vulnerable to external shocks, than it was ten years ago. Problems in the financial and SOE
sectors can quickly translate into major macro-tensions. Vulnerability has been exacerbated
by the widening public sector deficit finance between 2012 and 2014, pushing the official
debt burden towards the frontiers of sustainability. The Bank took risks with uncertain payoff
by providing budget support at time of macroeconomic weakness and in the absence of
strong measures to regain macro-stability. The Bank may have been exposed to reputational
risks if its policy lending were to be seen as de-facto endorsements of the country’s anti-
crisis policy.
                                                         45


3.8      Conclusions. Quantitative data and qualitative information suggests that Vietnam’s
macro and fiscal management has weakened since end 2000. Dominance of political
economy factors over technically sound solutions appears to be a continuing pattern, even in
the current post-crisis environment. This stands in contrast with experience during the 1990s
early 2000s when a prudently managed economy mitigated macro and fiscal risks. The 2016-
SEDP and the next Party Congress provide the opportunity to deal with these issues, and
their substantial political challenges. Future DPOs should pay careful attention to the risks of
lending in the presence of a risky macroeconomic environment. However, despite Economic
Management and Competitiveness Credit’s (EMCC’s) intended focus on macroeconomic
stability (reflected in a result indicator on debt to GDP ratio) the ability of the Bank to help to
maintain debt sustainability remains limited. EMCC’s result indicator in macro and fiscal --
to maintain debt to GDP ratio below 65% -- is too broad and adds nothing to the already
existing law on Public Debt, which has a similar cap on the debt to GDP ratio. It is therefore
important for the Bank to develop effective engagement modalities in Vietnam to help
stakeholders address macro and fiscal concerns.


 Box 3-1. Relations with IMF
 There has not been an IMF program in Vietnam since 2004. No program was discussed between
 IMF and Vietnam in the period of global crisis and subsequent macro destabilization in Vietnam in
 2009-2010. According to the PDs of DPOs and the interviews with Bank staff the Bank was in
 active consultations with IMF on macroeconomic issues. This evaluation finds that the Bank and
 Fund teams at times had differing views on some key macro policy parameters, including the
 timing and the scope of corrective macro actions. Compared to the IMF, the Bank country team
 had more confidence in the Authorities’ ability to control macro developments and avert full-blown
 destabilization which may be explained by a closer relationship and deeper dialogue between the
 Bank and the authorities.
 According to the Guidance Note on Bank-Fund cooperation on DPOs, Bank teams are advised to
 seek an assessment letter from IMF (Fund Relations Note) at the time of program preparation as an
 annex for DPOs’ PDs. These letters, however, are not necessarily endorsement letters. Rather, they
 inform the Board on the IMF’s position on the country’s macroeconomic outlook. The IMF’s
 assessment letters for all DPOs were included in the PDs except that for the first Power DPO
 approved at the peak of crisis in 2010. This letter was not cleared for public release by the
 authorities due to a reference to large-scale reserve loss by the SBV. This indicates the sensitivities
 about macroeconomic issues and disagreements between the parties on the way forward for
 macroeconomic policies. In the assessment letters for PIR1 and PRSC 9, the IMF highlights major
 risks, uncertainties and outlines needed policy changes. Such policy changes are not, however, well
 reflected in the Bank’s program.

Integration in design of lessons learnt from past experience
3.9    PDs contain a specific section on lessons from past experience that provides insights
into how these were taken into account in a particular DPO and influenced its design. What
follows summarizes the analysis found in the PDs. The type of lessons noted depended on the
operation, with the PRSC relying more on Vietnam specific experience, while some sectoral
                                             46


DPOs took greater consideration of international practice. As a middle-income country,
Vietnam will need to give greater priority to learning from international experience, just as
low-income countries should learn from Vietnam’s.

3.10 Second PRSC Series. The lessons learnt integrated into the PRSC series provide a
fairly comprehensive record of how to engage with Vietnamese authorities effectively.
Additional ones are added over time, including a lesson stated in PRSC 10 that reform
programs should be based on what Government is willing and able to do and not necessarily
what is most desirable – the validity of which the present review questions further-on.
However, the following shortcomings are also worth noting:

         There is no reference to relevant experience in other countries.
         There is no reference to lessons from reforms undertaken under the previous
          operations in the second PRSC series. Such an analysis might have explained why the
          ambition of reforms apparently progressively diminished over time.

3.11 PIR. The lessons learnt section of PDs for the PIR series is sparse, especially that of
the second document. Insights on what has worked elsewhere might have helped identify and
perhaps alleviate some of the constraints that emerged later and resulted in important reforms
being abandoned and/or postponed.

3.12 P135. The lessons cited in PD1 differ somewhat from those in the last two. The
lessons learnt tend to be generic, broad, and unspecific, although more useful lessons are
drawn from a thematic IEG evaluation and from the conclusions of the mid-term review
(MTR) which followed completion of the first operation. However, lessons cited do not
always justify the lending approach proposed. For instance, the lessons highlighting demand-
driven approaches and capacity building seem better suited to sector-wide investment
lending. Furthermore, some key lessons were not adequately applied and reflected in the
design -- areas they were related to remained weak during implementation.

Link to other operations
3.13 The PDs help establish the links between the DPOs and other World Bank investment
operations and explain how this affected DPO design and ensured complementarity between
the instruments (there were few references to other development partners’ activities other
than cofinancing or technical assistance). Bank operations linked to each DPO are listed in
Annex B.8.

3.14 The link between the second PRSC series and other operations appears to have been
quite weak at first, but became stronger as the series progressed. For instance, the PD for
PRSC 8 explains74 the feedback loops between investment lending, grants and budget
support in the areas of financial sector, education and environment. The PD for PRSC 975
further describes the relationship with two sectoral DPOs (P135 and Power): “Some of the
policy issues that were originally included on the reform agenda at the beginning of this

PRSC cycle are transferred to sectoral DPOs once a strategic policy decision has been
made.” In a few cases, such as IDF grants and technical assistance (the output of which is not
public), it is not always apparent how these influenced the PRSC design. This comment also
applies to the PIR.

3.15 Similarly, there are strong links established between the PIR and the PRSC. The P135
series also aimed to scale-up at the policy level the institutional innovations already
demonstrated under ongoing IDA-supported CDD, health and education projects.76 Of all the
operations in this review the P135 series probably had the most links to other operations.

Institutional Design of DPOs
3.16 The institutional setting for DPOs was quite complex and required significant
coordination efforts by both Government and development partners, as well as with
numerous other stakeholders involved at various levels.77 The arrangements, under the
various DPOs are summarized in Table 3.1 below.

Notes: Development partners include World Bank

3.17 The following key aspects of the arrangements, which are further detailed in Annex B
are noteworthy: (i) arrangements are quite complex and differed for sector series; (ii) the
central Bank plays a greater than would be required by the content policy actions; (iii) the
effectiveness of the PRSC Steering Committee appears to have declined during the latter part
of the series; (iv) Civil society involvement in the PRSC appears to be mainly through
consultations with apex organizations and highly structured, as part of a growingly inclusive
process; and (v) all DPO series received significant development partner involvement in
terms of financing and/or participation in the dialogue, even though the number of
development partners involved decreased over time (from 12 to 8 in the case of the PRSC),
which in principle should have facilitated harmonization.

3.18 By the time of the PPAR mission (June, 2014), some development partners were no
longer active in the country. For most others, staff originally involved in the DPOs were no
longer present. Institutional memory had thus diminished, even though feedback received
was by and large consistent with past findings. There was greater willingness to discuss
weaknesses. Regarding the PRSC, there is broad agreement that it was directly based on the
Government’s reform agenda. In line with previous findings, the development partner and
NGO consultations were mentioned as “best practice.” Nevertheless some development
partners also highlighted specific coordination issues (see Box 3.2).


 Box 3-2. Coordination Issues
     Some partners pursued their own projects after the PRSCs, and some left Vietnam. This is why
      the ongoing Economic Management and Competitiveness DPO series is supported by fewer
      donors and poses fewer coordination problems.
     A bilateral partner championed budget support for P135 on the grounds that it promoted a
      strong momentum in favor of coordination around this program. It subsequently found the
      program ineffective and stopped funding it.
     Some donors felt that the World Bank halting its budget support to P135 undermined
      harmonization. .
                                                49


    Human rights concerns explain why some development partners opted out of providing general
     budget support

3.19 By PRSC 4, the number of triggers or prior actions had been reduced to around 15,
with the overall number of policy actions (benchmarks) remaining between 40 and 50.
According to the previous IEG study, this was manageable. The report also notes that “the
approach to flexibility (i.e; soft action and/or selection from a menu of choices) is based on
recognition that the pace of implementation in any individual policy area is a matter for the
Government to determine, with Bank and international partner support linked to an
assessment of the overall program. This approach has facilitated a broad coalition of
international partners with diverse priorities coming together in support of Vietnam’s reform
agenda. It has also provided a platform for dialogue on the implementation of the SEDP with
an increasing emphasis on outcomes and results as the basis for assessing the overall
program.”

The tradeoff between flexibility and depth
3.20 A risk recognized at time of preparation of the second PRSC series was that
flexibility in choice of actions may reduce the impact of PRSCs on deeper sector reforms and
policy developments requiring more ambitious measures. However, the experience of the
first PRSC series suggested that flexibility facilitated a broader dialogue on Vietnam’s
reform agenda and contributed to a greater degree of trust between the Authorities and the
Bank. Transformative reforms such as the acceleration of WTO accession and the
Communist Party’s approval of a roadmap for banking reforms have been attributed to this
approach. Box 3.3 below presents some of the feedback received during the mission, which
reveals a certain degree of skepticism over the quality of reforms and PRSC’s actual
contribution in recent years.

3.21 As the report presents in the next chapter ere few major breakthroughs under the
second PRSC series or indeed during the period during which the DPOs were implemented.
As noted in the ICR for this series, the commitment to key structural issues waned in later
PRSCs – a finding explained and detailed in this report.


  Box 3-3.Selected comments on Bank’s approach to flexibility in DPOs by various
 stakeholders, (including Bank staff and development partners)
    The PRSC instrument “rewarded” the Government for past policy actions, irrespective of the
     quality of current reforms (an external partner)
    Predictability of future financing is desirable, but only if it does not compromise the reform
     agenda substantially. In Vietnam, the imperative of meeting certain commitment dates for
     resources diminished the quality of reforms (an external partner)
    Vietnam pursues DPOs to enhance its international credibility and to shift attention to non-
     controversial areas (an external partner)
    The Bank was not the donor who advocated and created a consensus if favor of delaying PRSC
     10 due to the economic situation (an external partner).
    Early on, PRSCs established a tradition whereby limited implementation of the reform agenda
     would not have any implication in terms of disbursement (Bank staff)
                                                  50


        The same reasons that led to delays in PRSC 10 should have caused a delay in previous ones
         (an external partner).
        The Bank found it hard to balance credibility and cooperation and was unable to effectively
         advocate more ambitious measures (Bank staff)
        The PRSC should have been stopped long ago, as it had run its course in the middle of its
         journey.
        At present, only extreme financial circumstances would lead to difficult reforms being
         considered (Bank staff).


3.22 Consistent with the impressions reported in Box 3.3, there were few major reform
breakthroughs under the second PRSC or PRI series. The commitment to tackle key
structural issues waned over the course of the period covered by the two series, including
persistent weaknesses in the SOE sector, difficulties in the financial sector (which are
slowing down the domestic private and agricultural sectors), and governance. An opportunity
to address these issues would thus therefore appears appear to have been a missed
opportunity to address the structural issues that have affected the three out of four following
sources growth: FDI continues to do well, but SOE weaknesses are now apparent, and
difficulties in the financial sector are slowing down the private and agriculture sectors. A
recent study highlights certain institutional reform priorities and provides a blueprint that
could be used for future engagement by donors based on focusing on fewer policy areas and
tackling difficult challenges therein, including that related to governance. Important elements
of this agenda are covered by the post-PRSC Economic Management and Competitiveness
DPO series.

Risk Assessment
3.23 This section reviews how program design identified risks, whether the main issues
were covered and how the risks were mitigated

3.24 PRSC. The PD for the first operation in the second series identifies three risks listed
below together with an assessment of effectiveness of mitigation measures:

          Vulnerability stems from possible turbulence in the domestic financial sector and the
           development of capital markets. Upgrading of policies related to the banking sector,
           the securities market and the management of public debt were part of the proposed
           reform program. Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) were not addressed. They remain a
           major issue and have risen in recent years. Financial sector vulnerability remains a
           high risk.
          Global integration, resulting in large inflows of FDI and increased domestic
           competition in formally protected sectors, may also test Vietnam’s ability to preserve
           social inclusion and reduce a widening urban-rural gap. Inclusive policies in the
           social sectors, and transparent mechanisms to transfer resources to the poorer regions
           are among the mitigating measures supported by the PRSC. This risk was effectively
           mitigated, as demonstrated by the declining poverty rate.
          Cases of corruption and social strife are increasingly related to land. Tackling this risk
           requires rapid progress in transparency at various levels, from regional planning to
                                              51


       infrastructure master plans to land use to appropriate taxation to the monitoring of
       assets of the relevant civil servants, only some of which were PRSC measures.
       Corruption remains one of Vietnam’s biggest challenges.

3.25 Risks arising from resistance to reforms from vested interest and SOEs, limited
progress on the environmental front, slow-down in reform due to political cycle and other
reasons, and external shocks were not explicitly addressed in the second PRSC series. As
discussed in the previous chapter, the macroeconomic risk was not adequately considered.
Most of these issues were mentioned in analytical work and might have been addressed
through policy reform and dialogue under or in parallel to the PRSC. This was not, however,
the case. The documents for the later PRSCs in the series, notably the last operation, brought
out these risks and added other forward looking risks such as those stemming from the
decline in concessional financing and other challenges facing a middle-income country.
Macroeconomic risks continued to receive minimal attention.

3.26   PIR. The PD identified a series of risks and mitigation measures:

      Increased macro instability was mitigated in part by the stimulus package, which in
       practice proved to be pro-cyclical. The mitigation measures included fiscal and
       monetary policies, intended to result in a decrease in the budget deficit. Large deficits
       remain an issue.
      Policy actions would be insufficient to increase quality of public investments. This
       would be mitigated through the amendment of the investment-related laws. However,
       the public investment law was not modified until mid-2014 and the risk materialized.
      Resistance from vested interests would be overcome through dialogue and working
       around institutional obstacles, as in the past. This risk materialized and was not
       mitigated. The policy content of the operations was less ambitious than envisaged at
       the outset.
      Measures, once adopted, would not have their intended impact. Technical assistance
       was intended to mitigate this risk. However, the fact that some intended outcomes
       were not achieved, together with the continuing inability to measure some outcomes
       suggest that this risk was not effectively mitigated, and that the impact of technical
       assistance was limited.

3.27 While not mentioned as a risk in the PDs, reforms in areas such as the investment law
and PPPs had received limited traction under the PRSC. The reasons for lack of progress
under the PRSC constituted risks that needed to be mitigated.

3.28 P135. The first operation benefitted from a detailed risk assessment matrix outlined in
the first document. Its coverage included five institutional, two fiduciary, and six policy
related risks. Mitigation measures included targeted technical assistance (TA), and
institutional policy reforms. As explained in the PD for the third and last operation,
institutional capacity constraints was the main issue in practice, exacerbated in part by
inadequate sequencing of TA. Nonetheless, both this issue and coping with macroeconomic
instability during program implementation proved to be manageable Fiscal constraints did
not result in a significant reduction in Government financing of the program.
                                              52


Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) - Institutional Arrangements
3.29 PRSC. The program’s M&E was largely based on SEDP monitoring framework both
institutionally and in terms of selected indicators – as further developed in the 2007 VDR.
The PRSC coordination unit in the implementing agency was the responsible agency for
program’s monitoring. In choosing the indicators from the large pool of SEDP indicators
priority was given, to an extent possible, to those that depended less on administrative data
collection. This resulted in incorporation of many indicators for which no extra efforts were
required to collect. In the PD of the first operation in the series it is mentioned that due to the
large number of indicators requiring some additional data collection efforts there would not
be any annual updates of indicators. Instead, there was a plan to conduct jointly with
government mid- and end-program reviews of M&E to collect information and improve its
design. However, subsequent PDs of PRSC 7, 8 and 9 did not include a section on M&E and
a mid-program assessment was not conducted. There was an end-year assessment of M&E
framework which resulted in dropping of 27 indicators out of 51, and incorporation of 10
new indicators. Apart from reducing the number of indicators, this exercise failed to overhaul
the M&E. Even though not readily measurable as formulated, some dropped results would
have been nonetheless relevant to the evaluation of PRSC’s efficacy.

3.30 PIR. Program design gave prominence to M&E by including it within one of the four
thematic areas it covered. However, the institutional responsibility for overseeing M&E,
while presumably that of MPI, is not clearly specified in PDs (as noted above the operation
was not overseen by a Steering committee). The PDs argue, unconvincingly, that the program
does not readily lend itself to measurement of its impact (PD2 para. 108). Reasons advanced
include attribution (PIR is part of broader PFM reforms), inappropriateness of broad
indicators, and the lag between program completion and visible policy response. However,
the strategy highlighted in the 2007 Vietnam Development Report (VDR) and summarized
above (Chapter 2), if implemented properly, could have produced measurable results, even if
some would have been input-oriented. These might have included laws being in place (the
public investment law and clarity on PPPs), effective monitoring and management of capital
inflows and related alleviation measures, and evidence that the public investment law was
beginning to be implemented (such as increased efficiency of public investments).

3.31 P135. M&E played a prominent role in DPO design and constituted the fourth policy
area supported by the program. In the area of process monitoring, by the third and final
operation, the Aligned Monitoring Tool/Project Management Tool (AMT/PMT) became the
program’s Management Information System (MIS). The AMT/PMT tool was adequate at the
central and provincial levels for which it was developed but proved to be challenging to
implement at decentralized levels. The tool itself and the many indicators it contained were
unfamiliar to staff at local levels. Design of the MIS could have been improved had the
system been based on traditional reporting at local levels using existing indicators with which
local officials were familiar, and introducing new indicators only where essential to monitor
progress towards outcomes.

3.32 As part of a consensus-based approach, all partners participated in assessing the
progress of the program and identifying changes needed. Oversight over the program was led
by the Government, with coordination managed by development partners on a rotation basis,
                                                 53


through an annual Joint Program Review (JPR) exercise in which all key partners
participated. The AMT/PMT was implemented with major delays. Training of trainers was
initiated only in October 2008, and only subsequently did provinces and districts start using
the system. By the end of the program only 11 of the 50 provinces were able to use the
system fully. And citizen report card surveys were abandoned after the first round (although
substantial information was collected in this area in the end of the program evaluation).

3.33 In the area of evaluation, a randomized survey approach was used with designated
treatment and control groups of communes and villages. The baseline survey was carried out
in 2008 and helped in the development of better monitoring indicators in DPOs 2 and 3. A
survey was carried out at the end of the program in 2011/12, which enabled an evaluation of
the results of the program.

Structure of Policy Matrix and Quality of Results Framework
3.34 Each program’s policy matrix presented prior actions of on-going operations and
triggers for the next operations. The PRSC operations would present indicative triggers for
the next operation only, allowing flexibility for the program in general. The P135 matrix
covered the whole program.78 PRSC and P135 matrices also included policy actions that
were not prior actions (so called “benchmarks”). Current Bank guidelines encourage a focus
on select prior actions and do not promote the use of benchmarks. The main argument against
benchmarks is that they may constitute implicit conditionality. In the case of Vietnam,
presentation of Government’s actions in DPOs’ policy matrix, both implemented and
planned, that were not part of the Bank’s conditionality framework can be perhaps justified
in case of PRSC series that had 17 policy areas while the number of prior actions per
operation was capped at 12-13. At the same time, the PDs of PRSCs suffered from lack of
reporting on the status of some of those actions, and in general provided no information on
actions that were planned but never implemented. This inconsistent approach to the use of
non-binding policy actions undermined the quality of the policy matrix. It also made the
program harder to evaluate.

Analysis of the Policy Matrix and Results Framework
3.35 Thanks to the depth and breadth of upstream diagnostic and analytical work, notably
the Aiming High report, there was good basis for the policy reforms, and indicators and
intended results specified within a medium-term framework. Both the PRSC and P135 series
included detailed policy matrices (including non-core benchmark actions) that help set the
reforms within the program. The PIR’s policy matrix was limited to prior actions/triggers,
but the results were more in terms of output largely attributable to the specific reforms.79

3.36 A good understanding of the significance of actions is an important consideration
factor in the analysis of logical links. It is expected that prior actions should reflects political

78
     PIR consisted of two operations only.
79
  Actions supported by all DPOs between 2007 and 2011, with mapping to their relevant pillars are
summarized in Annex B.9.
                                             54


consensus for transformation and change, be significant in terms of scope and ambition, and
largely irreversible under reasonable assumptions. By these criteria the hierarchy of actions
with highest impact would include changes in regulations, such as approved legislation,
submission of draft laws to parliament that has high probability of approval, government
decrees, prime minister’s decisions and important national strategies. In contrast, “lower
order” prior actions such as ministerial level actions, including letters of assurance, draft laws
that have not received government approval or draft strategies before the stage of national
debate are less influential, reversible and/or left unimplemented.

PRSC

3.37 Selectivity, outcomes and scope. The second series of PRSC was a comprehensive
program encompassing all of the pillars of SEDP. It had 17 policy areas under key four
pillars or sub-objectives. Each policy area of the program initially had three results – which
was reduced to two in the last operation. Results were mostly aligned with expected 2007-11
CPS outcomes. In some cases they exceeded the CPS’s specific target areas and results
framework because the PRSC also reflected the strategic priorities of development partners.

3.38 The main area that was not directly covered by the CPS was legal development,
although it was highlighted as an important policy area in the 2007 VDR. The program
supported improved consultation in the legislative process, enforcement of civil judgments
and registration of civil society organizations. In addition, the CPS did not focus on public
debt management. The PRSC added late in the series the development of a modern budgetary
system – TABMIS. It was an outcome also supported by the Financial Management Reform
Project, implemented in parallel. In general, the PRSC program was well aligned with both
the CPS and the SEDP although mapping of policies differed in a few instances. For
example, reforms in State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) are presented as part of anti-corruption
reforms in the CPS, whereas the PRSC program includes them in the public financial
management policy area. Despite these minor inconsistencies, there was good alignment
between the PRSC, and the SEDP and CPS, within a harmonized donor structure.

3.39 Link to results. By and large the relevant actions are well described in the 2007
VDR. Most prior actions in the first three operations were pertinent for the results – even in
cases where results being captured were outcomes linked to higher level objectives that also
depended on other factors. However, seven prior actions80did not appear to contribute
directly to the expected results of PRSC, even if some were relevant for the CPS.81 On the
other hand, one result added in PRSC 10 (TABMIS) was not attributable to any of the
reforms undertaken by the PRSC.

3.40 Evolution of the agenda. Reforms supported by PRSC represented a broad spectrum
of actions. However, a shift toward “lower order” prior actions is evident in the

80
  Namely, HIV law (PRSC 6), support to establishment of NA committees (PRSC 6), support to
SAV (PRSC 6 and 7), mechanisms for social and environmental assessment of WTO accession
(PRSC 7), National Bar association (PRSC 8), and MOF synthesis reports of Economic Groups
(PRSC 10)

programmatic series. While the initial two programs were mostly supporting “high level”
actions, such as approved laws, government decrees and Prime Ministerial decisions, later
operations saw an increase in the number of policy actions at ministerial level. Figure 3.1
below illustrates the evolution over time of the structure of PRSC prior action. It shows a
clear change in the composition of actions away from “high level” (policy oriented) and
towards “lower order” (process and implemented oriented) ones in the course of each
successive operation.

3.41 It can be argued that at the onset of such operations it makes sense to support such
important actions such as legislation and national strategies, while the rest of the program
should focus on ensuring implementation aspects of these legislations. However, this link
was mostly missing in the case in the Vietnam second PRSC series. Many prior actions
supported by later operations were not related to preceding ones. Overall, PRSC 6 was the
most ambitious in terms of reforms and PRSC 10 the least, with a significant drop in the
quality of reforms, even compared to the two preceding operations. In this respect, the
change toward lower order policy actions reflects the weakening reform momentum rather
than implementation of already achieved legislative reforms. Many ambitious triggers were
dropped and replaced by lower order actions (see below and Chapter 4).

3.42 Even though the above-mentioned trend towards weakening of policy actions affected
all pillars, it was more noticeable and impactful in some policy areas than others. While, for
example, the social protection pillar was generally less impacted, prior actions in the
governance pillar were substantially weakened. All of the operations under the series
included a prior action in public financial management (PFM) due to its critical role for
Vietnam’s overall governance agenda. Initial focus was on supporting reforms in the State
Audit of Vietnam (SAV), which became independent82 through reforms supported by the
first PRSC series. Prior actions under the first two operations of the second series aimed to
improve the regulations under which SAV was functioning. The prior actions of last two
operations were less instrumental. That on regulation for internal audit of public sector
agencies was built around a number of draft documents and letters from SAV on their reform
plans, thereby reflecting intentions rather than actions. The prior action on the annual
exercise of synthesis report based on Economic Group’s financial reports was not only less
relevant for PFM agenda, it also seems routine and immaterial in terms of its impact.

3.43 In the first pillar of the series – business development -- there were further examples
of incomplete implementation of reforms. A key prior action on the separation of state
ownership rights from regulatory functions in Economic Groups83 and General
Corporations84 that would have helped to establish a more even playing field between SOEs
and private firms, was only partially implemented. In the financial sector, the equitization of
two state-owned banks was only partially implemented, while the issue raised in PRSC 7
concerning “insider” lending (i.e., the transparency and scope of transactions amongst
affiliated parties) was not addressed through a policy that would limit and regulate such
activities. Non-performing loans to SOEs continue to characterize the balance sheets of state-
owned banks. The design of the third pillar of the PRSC -- sustainable management of the
environment and natural resources -- also fell short of initial expectations. The policy content
of this area weakened as the series progressed. Many important actions proposed at various
stages of PRSC series were never implemented.

3.44 Measurability. Measurability of the impact of policy action is an important feature of
relevance and strength. However, the PRSC series contained a large number of prior actions
for the results of which there were no indicators, or the necessary data were not available at
closure or at the time the mission was conducted. In particular, for five prior actions there
were no corresponding results indicators (including assessing the scope of lending among

   Economic groups are state owned business conglomerates in strategically important sectors, formed
by consolidating independent SOEs into a holding company structure.

   general corporations are large-sized State Owned Companies established in strategically important
sectors either under the Prime Minister or under other line ministries or provincial governments

SOEs, financial management of SOEs, corporate governance of SOEs). That was mostly
because some results indicators were dropped at the end of the series. For an additional eight
prior actions, no data were collected for the results to which they were contributing, even
though there were indicators. About one quarter of prior actions suffered from lack of
measurability and/or actual measurement.

3.45 With respect to attribution, many of the indicators depended on factors exogenous to
the program. This includes ratios where the numerator (e.g., export) and/or denominator
(e.g., GDP, FDI) depends on the overall world and national economy, indicators largely
driven by events unrelated to the PRSC (e.g., FDI and total investment, or more traffic
accidents due to the higher number of vehicles).

3.46 Performance of triggers. The question concerning performance in meeting triggers
is important in the case of Vietnam, given the declining share overtime of prior actions that
can be considered as critical and strongly relevant for the program’s results.

3.47 Table 3.3 indicates that less than 60% of all triggers were fully met over the course of
the program. The program was adjusted to cope with this in a number of ways, including
accepting “partially met” triggers as prior actions, allowing the number of prior actions to
decline, proposing less critical triggers for next operations to increase the chances of
implementation, and, in one case, substituting the dropped prior action by a new action.

3.48 Often, the substitution of “partially met” triggers as prior actions led, in practice, to
new and much less ambitious prior actions. For example, an original trigger for PRSC 10 was
the unification of the national licensing system of health providers. The actual action, which
fell far short of this, was the establishment of a database of health providers. This was,
nonetheless, accepted by the Bank as a “partially met trigger” since it was considered to be a
step forward in the reform area. Another example concerns the trigger proposed for PRSC 7
on establishing a comprehensive approach to improving the selection of public investment
projects. The actual action fell well short, but was nevertheless classified as a “partially
implemented trigger” to be included as a prior action for the program.

3.49 There was a decline in the number of prior actions because triggers were not
complied with. As a result of the non-inclusion of 3 triggers, the number of prior actions for
PRSC8 declined to 8 across 17 policy area. Prior actions increased to 11 in PRSC 10. This
was achieved through incorporation of many less than critical policy actions. In response to
non-implementation of a trigger, PSRC 10 added a minor prior action on guidelines for
monitoring corruption. This newly added prior action did not contribute in a substantial way
to the Governance agenda.

3.50 As the PRSC series progressed, the design of each subsequent operation reflects some
consideration and reintegration of previously dropped triggers. In total, seven triggers were
abandoned in four operations. In three cases (health, gender and sanitation) the program
eventually addressed affected policy areas in subsequent operations through incorporation of
similar actions, albeit with reduced coverage and ambition. In the remaining four cases (Law
on Press, access to information, forest assessment and transport infrastructure finance) there
                                              58


was no further follow-up under the program (the trigger on transport infrastructure was
dropped from PRSC 10).

3.51 Role of “Non-prior action” actions in PRSC Policy Matrix.85 Each PD reports on
policy actions implemented as part of the proposed operation that were not prior actions. The

     Also known as “benchmarks”

PDs also provides a reference to government documents confirming implementation of the
action,86 which is in line with the standards of reporting on legally binding prior actions. This
treatment elevates the prominence and the role of non-prior policy actions in the overall
program. However, the PDs do not systematically report the status of policy actions that were
initially envisaged, but subsequently dropped. Unlike triggers, reasons for dropping or
modification were not normally provided. This omission is consequential: if they are
important enough to be included in the policy matrix, then they warrant monitoring.

PIR

3.52 The PIR was a more focused series of two operations. Its higher level objective was
to improve the efficiency of public investment, which, given typical lags, would only be
measurable in the medium- to long-term. The operations also helped to finance the fiscal
stimulus package. However, there were no actions in the program either to ensure an
appropriate macro-framework to underpin the stimulus, or that the stimulus expenditures
would be efficient and would address priorities. The initial operation included 9 prior actions
and proposed 13 triggers for the next one. The prior actions included specific laws, decrees,
circulars, and decisions. The second operation encompassed 12 prior actions, which were not
as ambitious as initially envisaged, as evidenced by proposed triggers. They included draft
documents, design of measures, and narrowly focused decisions, circulars and decrees.
Overall, the reforms supported by the second operation were less ambitious than under the
first. The policy matrix did not include any benchmarks.

3.53 While all the prior actions contributed to some degree to program objectives, the key
transformative reforms were embedded in the Private-Public Partnership (PPP) framework
and the Public Investment Law, both initially triggers for passing from the first to the second
operation. However, these two triggers were abandoned, and the contribution of the program
to its ultimate and specific objectives thereby diminished significantly. The specific results in
the matrix were mostly output-oriented, and were of less than critical importance. Also
certain expected results were neither measurable nor attributable (e.g., share of total
investment costs spent on preparation and consultation of Environmental Impact
Assessments).

P135

3.54 Intended Outcomes and Policy Areas. The aim of the DPO programmatic series in
support of program P135 was to reduce the entrenched poverty of the ethnic minorities in
Vietnams’ northern and central highlands. The series supported Government actions in four
broad policy areas: (a) Poverty Targeting; (b) Decentralization, Participation and
Empowerment; (c) Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability; and (d) Monitoring and


86
  See Annexes 5, 6, 4, 4 and 4 in PDs respectively for PRSC 6, PRSC 7, PRSC 8, PRSC 9 and PRSC
10. However, a minority of “expected” actions are not reported subsequently and the measures
themselves are affected by the similar issues than those for prior actions (i.e.; an uneven quality of the
legal and regulatory instruments used). P135 similarly reports on the implementation of benchmarks
but this is subsumed within the policy matrix.

Evaluation. Each of these four policy areas had, in turn, between two and four sub-areas,
amounting to a total of 13 sub-areas.

3.55 Previous experience across Asia as well as in a number of projects in Vietnam
suggested that a Community-Driven Development (CDD) approach may well be appropriate.
The hope was that engaging the targeted population in a participatory way would energize
them to develop their own communities through the building of local infrastructure and by
connecting them to, and integrating them into, the rapidly growing markets in the rest of
Vietnam. The effort would also dovetail with Vietnam’s decentralized approach to
development. But decentralization meant establishing implementation mechanisms all the
way down to the commune level. This would involve, inter alia: training for the new tasks of
participatory planning and implementation of projects, and putting in place financial
management capacities, as well as the capacity to monitor and evaluate the use of funds that
would flow into the communities through the program. It also meant developing materials for
use in training and communicating information in a variety of local languages. The
programmatic series was complementary to the PRSC series not only in its broad objective of
reducing poverty and increasing social inclusion but also in building decentralized
institutional and human capabilities of governance that would reinforce the efforts of the
PRSC series aimed at fulfilling Vietnam’s development potential. Some historical
background provided in Box 3.4 may be helpful in explaining the World Bank’s approach to
supporting CDD in Vietnam at that point in time.

3.56 Choice of Instrument: Investment vs. Budget Support. At the time of the Poor
Communities, Livelihoods and Infrastructure Program (P-CLIP) concept paper in mid-2004
(also see Box 3.5), the thinking as to the most appropriate instrument to use leaned in the
direction of an ambitious SWAP (sector-wide assistance program), with different
development partners supporting different slices of the “sector”. However, as the operation
moved to the preparation phase during 2005/06, the international community’s approach had
changed. The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness came out in March 2005, followed by
the Hanoi Core Statement which dove-tailed the Paris Declaration to Vietnam’s specificities.
There was now pressure not just to harmonize donor initiatives with Vietnam’s development
strategy as laid out in its SEDP for the period 2006-10, but to try to channel as much aid as
possible through budget support rather than investment operations. There was, by then,
considerable experience in Vietnam with budget support through the broad-based PRSCs, but
it would be a first for a CDD operation as well as being the first sectoral DPO. The demands
of implementation were considerable, not least because the two to three thousand communes
and/or villages to which the funds and TA had to be channeled were scattered across the
county. It was one thing to back broad policy reforms through budget support, but quite
another to do it for a nation-wide but highly decentralized CDD effort. Tens of thousands of
people had to be trained, decentralized procurement procedures developed, fiduciary systems
at commune/district levels put in place, and a complex M&E system constructed. Given the
successful experience with the first PRSC series, including the leading role it had played in
donor coordination, the Bank was a key participant in the discussions with Government,
DFID and other development partners on the potential to align financial support to National
Target Programs in general and P135 in particular. The Bank’s role was seen as particularly
important in strengthening the quality of M&E and fiduciary aspects of the program, as well
as strengthening linkages to the broader Consultative Group and PRSP processes. After
                                                  61


considerable discussion within the Bank and with its partners in Government and donors, it
was decided to utilize a programmatic development policy credit operation. This would help
to ensure that the majority of funding would come from Government’s own revenues and
therefore maintain full Government leadership and accountability. The program would rely
on the Government’s own apparatus to carry out the program, rather than having it
implemented through parallel development partner structures – which would increase the
prospects of long run sustainability, as well as mitigating coordination issues. The Bank’s
decision to go with a budget support operation rather than an investment operation was
experimental and hence risky. It held the promise that if it was successful, it would make a
major contribution to the Government’s efforts to strengthen its decentralized
provincial/district/commune administrative structures. The reasoning was that if budget
support for a CDD operation was going to work, Vietnam’s track record justified the
approach.


 Box 3-4. CDD approaches in Vietnam
 In 2004/05 when the Bank and other donors were thinking about how best to assist P135, the
 experience with CDD was already substantial and the documentation of what to do and how was
 extensive. Just in East and Southeast Asia the Bank been involved in more than 40 CDD projects
 over the previous 15 years, many of them highly successful, but none of them was a budget support
 operation. The experience was documented extensively for the region (OED 2005 – The
 Effectiveness of World Bank Support for Community based and driven Development , IEG 2006 –
 Safeguard Policy Review, and WB 2007 - Enabling East Asian Communities to Drive Local
 Development). In Vietnam itself the Bank had been involved in two major CDD projects – the
 Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project (CBRIP), and the Northern Mountains Poverty
 Reduction Project (NMPRP) – both of which focused on poorer provinces in central and northern
 highlands. Other donors had similar projects in other locations in Vietnam. The CDD experience in
 Vietnam was reviewed in a Bank-financed paper entitled Community Driven Development in
 Vietnam (Shanks et al 2003 – op. cit)
 In mid-2004 The Bank prepared an options paper for a CDD-type operation that would support the
 government’s P135 program, with a grant from the Poor Communities, Livelihoods and
 Infrastructure Program (P-CLIP). The bulk of the financing of the operation was to support
 investments in village and commune-level basic infrastructure and activities aimed directly at
 enhancing the livelihoods of poor households. The effectiveness of implementation would be
 enhanced through village and commune-level training in participatory budgeting and investment
 planning, community participation in procurement and some of the construction, construction
 supervision and O&M. It would also include sensitization and training of higher level (e.g. district)
 government staff to better equip them to facilitate local development. Public information and
 awareness-raising campaigns would be supported to ensure ethnic minority and gender inclusion,
 transparency and accountability, with materials developed in minority languages in addition to
 Kinh. A participatory M&E system would be used to track progress, there would be internal and
 external audits (both technical and financial), and periodic impact assessments


3.57 Analysis of Prior Actions. The number of prior actions in the three DPOs declined
over time. In DPO-1 there were 11 prior actions covering all but two of the 13 policy sub-
areas, declining to eight in DPO-2 and 4 in DPO-3. As in the case of the PRSC series, the
                                            62


contribution of prior actions to the attainment of the intended outcomes of P135 Program is
examined here according to their relevance, reversibility, and measurability.

3.58 While the logic of prior actions in the first two DPOs was compelling, that of those in
DPO-3 was less so. First, two of the four prior actions were implemented four months before
the formal closure of P135 in December of 2010. Second, one of the prior actions was
implemented in March of 2009, two years before DPO-3 was presented to the Board, right at
the time that the appraisal of DPO-2 was still ongoing, and might have been replaced with an
different measure with greater value-added at the time of final operation. Third, the prior
actions on Community Investment Ownership and commune-level procurement practices
applied to only 11 provinces (out of a total of 47) which raised doubts as to how broad an
impact of these prior actions was to be achieved as the program was ending.

3.59 Relevance. Most of prior actions were relevant to the achievement of objectives. In
the Policy Area of Poverty Targeting the prior action on the issuance of a circular on the
strategy for providing support services to upland communes that would help them earn better
livelihoods was vague and later required a further action to sharpen its focus. There were no
prior actions at the DPO-1 stage in the sub-policy areas of Operation and Maintenance
(O&M) and Procurement of Small-Scale Infrastructure giving guidance on how to encourage
competitive community contracting. There were relevant benchmarks in these areas, which
were important for the sustainability of local investments (and hence of the Program’s
outcomes).

3.60 Criticality. Almost all of the prior actions in this Program were in the nature of
strategies, action plans, inter-ministerial circulars, and guidelines. In principle any one of
them could be side-stepped or even ignored, but their totality and in their cumulative effect
would be very hard to counter-act. Local infrastructure has been built, people have learned
new skills, commune level institutions have been strengthened, many villagers have tasted
the experience of participating in decision making at the local level and have been
empowered. Overall, risk of reversal appears low and the totality of prior actions, triggers
and benchmarks has been helpful in achieving the outcomes of the program (of which more
in the following chapter) and in laying the foundations for sustainability of the Program’s
development objectives.

3.61 Measurability. There were few specific measurable indicators or targets in DPO-1.
Most of the outcome indicators were of a qualitative nature. This was corrected during the
MTR of DPO-1 so that in DPO-2 there was a measurable indicator for each of the four Policy
Areas (measures of the four development objectives) and ten measures of intermediate
outcomes, resulting in a measurable indicator for almost all policy sub-areas. For most of the
indicators there was also a baseline number and a target, although some of the latter were
unrealistic. The problem was that, in an effort to improve M&E, too many of the indicators
changed between DPO-2 and DPO-3 so they were hard to compare.

4. Results
4.1     This chapter discusses the achievements of the three completed DPO series in terms
of both implementation of policy actions and how these contributed to intended results as
reflected in the outcome indicators as well as other sources (including qualitative and
quantitative information collected during the 2014 mission). The discussion is organized
around the SEDP/PRSC pillars and according to policy area and DPO.

An Overview of Vietnam’s Institutional Reforms

4.2      Vietnam’s transformation that began in the late 1980s culminated in a number of
critical reforms in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This paved the way for a successful
episode of growth, global integration and poverty reduction sustained over almost two
decades. However, while growth remains strong, it has slowed. There is increasing evidence
that the pace of reforms has slowed down and that this may compromise Vietnam’s growth
outlook. The World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment.87 (CPIA) data
support the hypothesis of weakened reform momentum since the end of the first decade of
the 2000s (Figure 4.1).88 The overall (CPIA) rating for Vietnam has slightly declined since
2006, driven by deterioration in macroeconomic management and PFM. At the same time
there was an increase in the trade, social protection and revenue mobilization sub-ratings. It
should be noted that despite the decline in ratings of some components, Vietnam was one of
top CPIA performers in 2006 and 2012 among current IDA recipients.

  The Bank implemented six sector specific and multi-sectoral operations in 2006-2012 that
incorporated most of the policy areas assessed by CPIA.

4.3     The CPIA rating provides interesting insights on Bank-financed DPOs implemented
in Vietnam. The six sector specific and multi-sectoral operations in 2006-2012 incorporated
most of policy areas assessed by the CPIA. Improvements in trade and revenue mobilization
are noteworthy. These are related to WTO accession and private sector development, and to
public sector governance, which were policy areas under the PRSC.

4.4     Much of the analysis for this evaluation has been based on public documentation
complemented by additional information collected during the PPAR mission (June, 2014).
During the mission, a number of focus group discussions were held with members of civil
society. The selection of the individuals was based on their availability, expertise and
willingness to be interviewed. They do not, therefore, necessarily constitute a representative
sample of their peers. Nevertheless, feedback received, which is summarized in Box 4.1
below, reflects insights that shed additional light on the political economy of the reform
programs and the role of Bank policy lending.


 Box 4-1. Focus group discussions (civil society organisations and independent
 experts)
 Vietnam’s experience with institutional development and policy challenges
    The main change in thinking toward modernization and institutional development took place in
     the 1990s, and the main reforms were implemented in the early to mid-2000s
    There was strong support to the reform process from the international financial institutions
     (IFIs), especially through technical assistance accompanying lending
    1991-2001 was a period of opening up and designing of reforms, 2001-2006 was a period of
     implementing major reforms that had been in preparation for many years. From 2007 onwards
     transformative changes did not take place and Vietnam’s reform process is slowing down.
    Vietnam is different from China because reforms never stopped in China, whereas less has
     been done in Vietnam since accession to the WTO in 2007
                                                65


    The last two SEDPs were very broad, covering everything, while there are important policy
     priorities that requires more focus than others to ensure reform continuity
    Vietnam’s experience shows that large lending programs have failed in “buying reforms” after
     a certain point
    The World Bank stopped being critical about Vietnam since 2006/07, which led to its being
     perceived “less frank” by the public
    The IMF is tough on difficult issues behind closed doors, while the World Bank is not tough
     even in “private”
    The best way for IFIs to help Vietnam would be to focus on two or three very important reform
     areas in budget support operations
    Commune level decision making is very important, but there is insufficient delegation because
     of obstacles at provincial and districts levels
    Focus group participants recommended that given current realities of reform stagnation the
     World Bank should redirect budget support to project level financing that is able to deliver
     specific results.

Global Integration
4.5     This policy area built on Vietnam’s accession to the WTO in January 2007, which
resulted in a large FDI and export boom already documented at the outset of this report. As
outlined in the 2007 VDR, and reflected in the PRSC policy actions, major actions had
already been taken. The thrust of remaining reforms was to encourage regional trade and to
implement the legislative changes approved. Specific areas identified related to competition,
intellectual property rights and standards, notably with respect to food safety and agriculture.
The only prior action in this area was taken under PRSC 7 and consisted of the establishment
of consultation and information gathering mechanisms to identify the social and
environmental impacts of accession to the WTO. This action was not identified as a priority
in the 2007 VDR.
4.6      However, those short- and medium-term actions that were benchmarks were
implemented – the full list is provided in the consolidated matrix in Annex Table B.9. They
included trade and distribution rights for all foreign firms, regulations and enforcement
mechanisms to strengthen intellectual property rights, and improved agriculture health and
safety. The only measure not covered under the PRSC concerned the completion of the legal
framework for improved logistical services, the status of which is unknown at present.
4.7     The results framework included three indicators to measure progress in this area: the
exports to GDP ratio, the imports to GDP ratio, and the value of FDI inflows. The target for
all three indicators was surpassed. However, earlier WTO accession was the principle cause
of increased FDI89 and PRSC measures only contributed partly to its continued increase. The

same applies to trade to GDP ratios, where both numerator and denominator were affected by
exogenous factors.
4.8    The success of FDI-driven trade should not hide the continued presence of constraints
that make Vietnam less competitive than its neighbors (table 4.1 below). This may explain
the more modest performance of domestic firms, and why greater focus on trade logistics in
the DPOs would have been appropriate.

State Sector Reform

4.9     The limited development of a domestic medium- to large private sector has been
explained in part by the continued presence of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs)90 with
regulatory and market power. SOE reform in Vietnam has been mainly in the form of
equitization91 as the main means for divestiture of enterprises fully owned by Government.
This reduced the numbers of wholly state-owned SOEs from 5,600 to 2,100 between 2001
and 2006. It affected mainly smaller firms and did not resolve certain governance problems
associated with the continued presence of the state. This number of remaining SOEs is high
by international standards. The approach under the second PRSC series was to further reduce
the number of fully owned SOEs by equitizing the larger ones, and transferring ownership
rights from line ministries, agencies and provincial governments to the State Capital
Investment Company (SCIC), which would progressively sell the shares. The reform strategy
foresaw impediments to divestiture in some sectors such as forestry or associated with land
use, but lacked mechanisms for effectively overcoming vested interests or separating
regulatory functions from commercial ones prior to transfer of assets to SCIC. Another issue
was that it was unclear whether these transfers applied to general corporations92 (i.e.;
conglomerates). In practice, this proved difficult.

4.10 The PRSC series included one prior action per operation: (a) further restrict the list of
sectors where 100-% state ownership is to be retained; (b) assess the scope and nature of
lending and other transactions among affiliated parties in Economic Groups and General
Corporations; (c) approve equitization plans for two State Owned Commercial Banks
(SOCBs) and complete one; (d) strengthen financial management of SOEs and (limiting)
their investments in other entities, defining the level of such investments; (e) issue

90
     Defined as enterprises with 100% public ownership.
91
     Sale of shares with Government remaining in the capital and often in management.
92
  The various types of corporations as well as issues facing the SOE sector are described in a 2010
study; WB 2010: On the Governance of State-Owned Economic Groups in Vietnam
                                               67


regulations on state-owned economic groups for better corporate governance and set limits
for cross shareholding; and (f) the Prime Minister to issue a regulation to expedite
equitization of SOEs, and the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) to submit to the
Prime Minister a review of the state-owned Economic Group model.

4.11 These prior actions do not fully correspond to the triggers envisaged in the preceding
operation as three triggers were modified in a way that reduced their ambition and scope (c, e
and f above). The decision not to secure the participation of strategic investors in two state-
owned commercial banks (SOCB) s had adversely affected the performance and soundness
of (see below). Qualitative information collected during the mission indicates that some
reforms, such as limits to cross shareholding, are not enforced in key activities (such as
banking). This set of prior actions brought minor process changes, rather than reform, to the
governance of SOEs. Overall progress in the area of divestiture of SOEs was limited.

4.12 There were six benchmarks concerning SOEs aimed at improving the equitization
process, publishing SOE results, transferring ownership rights in SOEs and the two above-
mentioned SOCBs to SCIC, and separation of regulatory functions from unequitized SOEs.
Information collected during the mission indicates that transfer to SCIC was delayed through
various means, including the merger of some SOEs with general corporations and the need to
extract regulatory functions.

4.13 There were two PRSC outcome targets associated with this area: (a) share of the state
sector in GDP; and (b) state investments in SOEs as share of total investments. These
indicators are related to the level of divestiture efforts. However, they suffer from
measurement problems, in both cases due to a denominator that is determined by other
factors and the lack of classification of certain investments in SOEs as state investment.93
Furthermore, the indicators were not closely linked to the reforms. The first target was
achieved, although this reflects rapid growth of FDI-financed production rather than
shrinking SOE sector. The second target was not met, despite booming FDI. Divestiture was
and state investment in SOEs continues to be important.

4.14 As the World Bank’s 2010 study94 shows, a large SOE reform agenda remains to be
tackled: “(i) to re-clarify the objective of economic groups; (ii) to reconcile the conflicting
objectives; (iii) to expand and strengthen the role of SCIC, (iv) to strengthen the internal
governance mechanisms; (v) to develop a well-functioning capital market, (vi) to limit
diversification into non-core business areas; (vii) to enhance the transparency of ownership
structures, and (viii) to strengthen the protection of minority shareholders.” This agenda is
quite similar to that of four years earlier.

Financial Sector Reform

4.15 At the outset of the period under review, issues identified as principal financial sector
priorities were: (i) achieving greater transparency and autonomy for institutions within the
sector; (ii) promoting a greater participation of strategic investors in the sector; (iii)
93
     Some listed in the SCIC brochure.

separation of supervision from ownership in the case of SBV (and implicitly improved
monitoring of risks associated with the lending portfolio); and (iv) specific actions at the
level of the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB), and in areas such as credit information and
securities.

4.16     The policies supported were the following:95

        Require public disclosure of financial statements of SOCBs in line with
         internationally accepted standards. Currently 60% of SOCBs comply with this
         standard (compared to an unstated but implicit target of 100%).
        Approved equitization plans allowing participation of strategic investors for two
         SOCBs96 and complete the equitization of one of them.97The original goal of four
         SOCBs was reduced to two and participation of strategic investors was restated as an
         intention to fulfill this goal in the future.98
        Prepared revised law on the State Bank of Vietnam focusing its mandate on, and
         enhancing its autonomy in regard to, monetary policy and financial sector stability.
         This measure was by and large implemented, notwithstanding issues with financial
         sector stability raised below.
        Finalized regulations to better assess commercial banks’ portfolio risks, enhance
         public disclosure, and strengthen supervision. Portfolio risks remain high and public
         disclosure is imperfect/partial, especially in the case of SOCBs.
        SBV issued a regulation to enhance public disclosure and communication of SBV’s
         policies and banking sector statistics. This has largely been achieved, supported by
         IMF technical assistance.
        Other important policies were included in benchmarks: an increased equity stake in
         commercial banks by foreign investors,99 various roadmaps and strategies and revised
         enabling regulations.

4.17 The most important indicator associated with this reform concerned the quality of the
portfolio and required provisioning. Official figures show no progress in this area. According
to various sources, the actual required provisioning is much higher due to under-reporting of
bad loans.100 A second indicator consisted of banks following the qualitative criterion
(international standards) for loan classification. No bank met this criterion in 2006 and seven
(compared to the target of 5) met it in 2013. However, this did not include any SOCBs,
where exposure to bad loans is highest.

4.18 The reforms carried out did not attain the program’s objective to lessen the risk of
credit being extended to unprofitable and unproductive businesses – because they did not

address the root causes of the problem: weak balance sheets, poor risk management,
regulatory tolerance, and “insider” lending. These issues are now being tackled under the
EMCC.

Private Sector Development

4.19 Successful initiatives launched between 2000 and 2005, such as WTO accession and
improvements in the business environment, resulted in rapid growth of domestic Micro,
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The challenge for the period under review was
considered to be developing the “missing middle” (i.e.; domestic medium- to large private
enterprises) through improved access to finance, land and infrastructure, and an enhanced
investment climate. The decentralized nature of Vietnam could create regional opportunities
which needed to be identified. A sine qua non was the establishment of a level playing field
between SOEs and private firms (see above).

4.20 The investment climate agenda was quite comprehensively covered through the
following benchmarks:

          Introduce the investment climate monitoring tool as part of the annual enterprise
           survey. This is being undertaken on biannual basis.
          Reduce processing times and rationalize fee structure for business registration.
          Clarify authority on investment certificates and conditional sectors101, and standardize
           related documentation.
          Issue guidelines to foreign investors transitioning to new Investment and Enterprise
           laws.
          Establish consultative mechanism to streamline licenses and oversee implementation
           of new investment-enterprise regime.
          Establish a single-window mechanism for businesses to cover registration, tax, and
           seal formalities in selected provinces.
          Simplify enterprise registration by unifying tax and business identification numbers
           and streamlining seal (stamp) procedures.
          Rationalize incentives related to the Enterprise Income Tax and simplify tax
           procedures for household businesses.
          Raise the cap on shareholdings by single foreign investors in unlisted companies
           (from 30% to 100%.102)
          Issue regulations on agricultural extension in disadvantaged areas to promote poverty
           reduction.
          Promote Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) development through revising
           regulations, formulating an action plan for supporting industries, and improving
           coordination among responsible ministries.
          Establish national business registry with unique number for business, tax, statistics,
           and seal agencies.

         Improve disclosure requirements of audited financial information of public
          companies.
         Adopt regulation on disclosure of financial risks in the financial statements of
          enterprises and banks.

4.21 The IFC supported the implementation of some of these measures, while others were
necessary following deeper reforms (e.g.; d and g above). The two PRSC indicators were
increased employment in private enterprises and private domestic investment as proportion
of total investment. Both targets were achieved (50% and a 5 percentage points increase
respectively). As evidenced by the substantial change in “Doing Business” ranking103 (104th
in 2006 and 78th in 2012) the reforms had a significant impact on the overall investment
climate.

4.22 It should be noted that other operations, including the third Higher Education DPO
and EMCC also included PSD measures. The former initiated a process to facilitate private
provision of service through licensing foreign corporations; and the second extended
investment climate reform to ministries and provincial authorities, with a view to eliminate
duplication and streamline procedures.

Infrastructure.104

4.23 This policy area covered a diverse range of subsectors and issues. The agenda in the
2007 VDR included: (i) the avoidance of conflict of interest in projects financed by
provincial infrastructure funds, (ii) encourage Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) including
private participation in infrastructure through public-private partnerships (PPPs); (iii)
establish cost recovery and user fees; (iv) promote rural transport; (v) unbundle telecoms and
electricity services; (vi) better targeting of subsidies; (vii) improved urban planning; and
(viii) enhanced automobile transport (including for the disabled).

4.24 The PRSC focused on measures with broad national impact, while most others were
included as benchmarks. The PRSC also included a “gateway” measure that paved the way
for the energy DPO series. The prior actions were the following:

         Decentralize investment ownership105 to better integrate capital and recurrent budgets
          in the road transport sector.
         Clarify contract specifications, investor qualifications and treatment of unsolicited
          proposals for BOT projects. While this may have dealt with immediate concerns, this
          measure was an imperfect substitute for the adoption of a PPP framework consistent
          with international practice, which was subsequently attempted under the PIR.



103
    The shortcomings in this rating have been recognized by IEG, which also hide variances within the
country. This information is provided for illustrative purposes and because it is used by GoV in its
monitoring of PSD reforms.
104
    Policy actions related to energy is reported under a separate heading in Annex Table B.9, which
covers the Energy DPO. This separation is not needed in the main text, which has a narrower focus.

    Transfer of about 40 transport projects to the road authority.
                                               71


         Adopt market-based pricing systems to estimate the costs of state funded civil
          engineering investments (which notionally also supported the PIR agenda).
         Adopt a pricing system for electricity from renewable energy as a way to encourage
          independent producers106 and provide incentives for government procurement of
          energy-efficient equipment.
         Adopt a Gas Master Plan to 2015 with Visions to 2025.

4.25 A PRSC 10 trigger related to road operation and maintenance. It was dropped due to
the complexity of the task and delays.107 Benchmarks covered the remaining agenda. A
notable action consisted of a key initial step towards power sector reform, involving
unbundling the assets of the vertically integrated national company. The main PRSC
indicator was the electricity generated by entities other than Electricity of Vietnam (EVN)
(made possible by the administrative unbundling of EVN activities). The target was exceeded
and this performance is even more impressive when one considers the rapid growth in
electricity generation capacity (which roughly doubles every 5 years). The second indicator
concerned a reduction in road fatalities, although its attribution to the PRSC is partial.

PILLAR 2 - SOCIAL INCLUSION

Education

4.26 Vietnam had already reached its MDG target for primary education by 2005.
Enrolment rates at the lower and upper secondary level had arisen rapidly, leading to an
expansion of the educated labor force. Reflecting rising demand, the estimated wage premia
of workers with lower and upper secondary education over those with primary education
remained steady at about 10% and 30% respectively, between 2002 and 2008 (World Bank
2013.108) More dramatically, the corresponding premium for college graduates surged to 80%
in 2008 from just over 60% in 2002.

4.27 The second PRSC supported policy actions that were expected to encourage and
enable all players and stakeholders to participate in the benefits of increased and better
education. Policies were to be inclusive, supporting the poor and otherwise disadvantaged
children.

4.28 The expected results were to increase the number of poor children and those with
disabilities attending school, to improve learning outcomes in primary schools, and to enable
universities to meet international quality standards. The prior actions were:

         Extending performance standards for primary teachers nationwide, including
          evidence-based assessments.

         Revising tuition fees at secondary and tertiary levels, better reflecting market
          conditions, and enhance policies to protect the poor.
         Formulating the education development strategy to 2020, focusing on equity of
          learning outcomes and relevance of contents.
         Producing cost estimates and initiating public consultation on full-day schooling for
          primary education.
         Issuing a regulation to institutionalize regular nationwide assessments of student
          learning outcomes at primary and secondary levels. This modified the original
          triggers, which referred to international assessments.

4.29 Benchmarks concerned a roadmap for an education information system to improve
the sector’s management, implementation of the previous prior action, and the adoption of
transparent criteria to decide on university admission quotas on a pilot basis.

4.30 To increase the proportion of disadvantaged children completing post-primary levels
of education, poor students109 are protected against the negative impact of fee increases by
exempting them from school payments and through their free access to educational materials,
such as books, notebooks, and paper.110 Previously tuition fees were calculated “intuitively”.

4.31 Table 4.2 shows that exemptions from school fees and other contributions are now
widely practiced at all levels of education. In 2012, 45.2% of all students were exempted
from school payments in 2012, many of them in primary schools. The rest of the exemptions
include poor households and ethnic minorities as well as those living in remote and
mountainous communes and in difficult circumstances.

4.33 The sustained development of an increasingly inclusive education system is
illustrated by greater gender equality in school enrollment. Except in higher education, where
boys continue to dominate, the enrolment rates are now essentially equal or favor girls in
primary and secondary education. In terms of enrolment, females are now emerging as the
more favored gender – characterized in the recent poverty assessment report (World Bank
2012a) as “reverse gender inequality.”

4.34 The PRSC targets on enrolment were achieved. The primary education net enrolment
rate of poor children stood at 89.4% in 2010, almost equal to the target of 90%. Lower
secondary enrollment rate among the poor increased from 43.1% in 1998 to 72.8% in 2010,
marginally short of the 2010 target of 75%. The upper secondary net enrollment rate for the
poor increased between 1998 and 2010 from 9.3% to 41.9% (substantially above the target of
33%).

4.35 Regarding the inclusion of ethnic minorities, success was partial. The ratio of ethnic
minority to Kinh majority enrolment rate in public schools as Minority to Majority ratio
(M2M) varies across population groups. Except for primary and secondary education, ethnic
minorities started out with low levels of M2M. There was a steady rise of school enrolment
rates among ethnic minorities and the M2M increased steadily between 1998 and 2010,
although significant gaps remain (Figure 4.2). With regard to the education of children with
disabilities, no data were reported in the ICR, and the evaluation mission was not able to
obtain recent information.

4.36 The second PRSC series supported three complementary policy actions to improve
the quality of schooling (prior actions a, d and e above). Evidenced-based assessments of
teachers’ performance against transparent standards, and regular assessment of student
learning achievement are established good practices. Full-day primary schooling reform was
expected to bring applications of modern teaching and learning methodologies by extending
the length of daily attendance.

4.37 The PRSC ICR reported a small decline in basic learning skills of Grade 5 students at
the completion of the series, driven in part by the aforementioned rapid increase in
attendance. The reliability of these data is doubtful due to comparability issue and the use of
                                             74


2001 data as baseline, sometime before the start of the second series of PRSCs. These data
incidentally are indicating that the vast majority of Grade 5 students are functionally literate
and numerate. In fact, the preponderant evidence is that Vietnam’s education system is
succeeding in imparting key basic skills for the majority of students to succeed in the
workforce. This is the conclusion of the 2014 VDR about the performance of the country’s
education system, which is well grounded in analysis of Vietnam and comparisons with other
countries.

4.38 Recent evidence from the OECD’s latest Programme for International Student
Assessment.111 (PISA) further confirms the above assessment. Vietnam scores higher than
Britain, the United States, and the average OECD country. Nevertheless, stakeholders of
Vietnam’s education system are aware of the need to bring education reforms to the next
level for Vietnam to be able to successfully compete with more advanced middle-income
countries.

4.39 Discussions with the Ministry of Education and Training’s (MOET’s) senior officials
during the mission reveals that the Government is now rapidly expanding nationwide full-day
schooling. In 2009, 36% of primary school students were in full-day study program; by 2013
the figure went up to 53%. The PPAR mission was informed that of the 17 percentage point
increase, 10 percentage points were attributable to the financial support of the government
and the World Bank. The rest (7%) was due to household contributions. The plan is for full-
day study to reach all primary students by 2020.

4.40 Finally, in regard to, No data are available regarding the accreditation of universities
that meet international quality standards. There was one non-prior policy action under the
program – to facilitate establishment of empowered Boards with academic and business
participation to increase autonomy of universities. This was taken-up by the Higher
Education DPO (measures are listed in Annex B.9).

Health

4.41 According to the 2007 VDR, the main issue facing the health sector was a widening
gap in the use of health facilities and in health outcomes between the richer and poorer
segments of the population and regions. The Government’s strategy was based on extending
health insurance, with a view to making it universal. Specific elements of the approach
included greater competition amongst providers and a series of measures to provide sufficient
and good quality care while limiting costs. This would have required an expansion of the
voluntary health insurance program and public financing of reformed payment mechanisms
for subsidies targeting the poor.

4.42 The program’s expected results in health policy area included reducing the child
malnutrition rate, increasing the number of poor with free health insurance, and increasing
the use of modern health facilities by the poor. Prior actions in consecutive PRSCs (except
PRSC 8) were the following:112

         Adopting the HIV/AIDS law and preparing action plans to scale up harm reduction,
          fighting stigma and discrimination.
         Submitting the health insurance law which better pools risks and allows improved
          incentives in payment to service providers.
         Adopting a law establishing a framework for national standards and a unified
          licensing system for all health care practitioners.
         Issuing a regulation to establish a centralized database as a step towards unifying the
          national licensing system of healthcare professionals.

4.43 Measures implemented as benchmarks aimed to improve intra-sectoral allocations,
raise subsidies to the poor and the near poor, regulate the disposal and treatment of medical
waste, and prepare a financial report on health insurance. Two other measures listed as
medium term priorities not explicitly included under the PRSC program related to safe
motherhood and regulation of the pharmaceutical industry. The former relates to an MDG
that appears attainable (Annex B.1).

4.44 Regarding malnutrition (which was listed in the PDs for the first four operations, but
dropped in the last one), the PRSC’s ICR reports an apparent decline in child malnutrition
rates in recent years. The indicator, which was based the percentage of underweight children,
shows a reduction from 25% in 2005 to 19%, slightly better than the 20% target. Stunting
declined a little, but wasting (underweight) decreased from 25% in 2005 to 18.7 in 2011.
However, these outcomes cannot be attributed to any PRSC-supported policy actions. They


112
      There were none under PRSC 8.
                                              76


may be explained more by general economic progress in income and non-income living
standards, and specific targeted programs.

4.45 The coverage of the poor by health insurance was addressed through two prior actions
(b and c above). They built on previous reforms undertaken since the 1990s, including the
establishment, in 1998, of the national health insurance fund and several policies aimed at
providing coverage for the poor (such as fee exemption but without counterpart subsidies to
facilities). The most noteworthy policy change came with the introduction of the Health Care
Fund for the Poor (including ethnic minorities) in 2002. Under this policy, either the poor
would be enrolled in health insurance or providers would be reimbursed for providing them
with free health services. The latter option led to administrative difficulties, and in some
cases adverse selection, since providers included the very sick among the poor. In 2005, the
direct exemption policy was abandoned in favor of a compulsory health insurance, with the
government fully subsidizing the premium.

4.46 The passage, in 2009, of the Law on Health Insurance, brought together the various
health insurance funds under one umbrella and clarified the eligibility criteria for full or
partial subsidization of beneficiaries (i.e., all children under six years of age, students, the
elderly, the poor, and the near-poor). The Law, moreover, provides a roadmap towards
universal coverage with the enrolment of other groups. The ICR reported that free health
insurance coverage reached 100% in 2012, up from 42% in 2004 and 72% in 2010.

4.47 However, the expansion of health insurance coverage of the poor did not improve
their hospital contact. The average annualized contacts with hospitals for the poorest quintile
declined from 0.15 in 2004 to 0.12 in 2010. Moreover, according to the World Bank’s
(2012a) poverty report, out-of-pocket costs persist 113 despite the improvement in health
insurance coverage.

4.48 This observation is echoed by Somanathan et al. (2013) in a recent health insurance
study. One explanation for the modest impact of health insurance coverage on reducing out-
of-pocket cost and relative frequency of hospital contacts could be that the supply of modern
hospital and other health services might be inelastic. And, therefore, the expansion of health
coverage might have led to excess demand and medical care rationing. This, as is often the
case, might be biased against the poor. In short, the lack of supply responsiveness might have
had a dampening effect on actual utilization of the above services by the poor. This
explanation was reiterated by some health experts interviewed during the PPAR mission.

4.49 The ratio of births attended by skilled medical staff rose to 96.7% in 2011 from
92.7% in 2006. The ratio of pregnant women having at least 3 check-ups during their
pregnancy decreased, but the decline is insignificant.

4.50 The remaining PRSC health policy actions complemented the health insurance law by
facilitating the development of an efficient health provision system. The adoption of a law

113
   “… [The new 2008/9 Law on Health Insurance] provides fully subsidized health insurance
premiums ………. However, health insurance has had a modest impact on reducing out-of-pocket
health payments …, including catastrophic health costs.” (p. 30).
                                                  77


establishing a framework for national standards and a unified licensing system for all
healthcare providers was expected to improve social protection against medical malpractices.
The issuance by the Ministry of Health (MOH) of a regulation establishing a centralized
database partially implemented a trigger aimed at unification of national licensing system of
health care professionals.

4.51 The adoption of the HIV/AIDS law, and preparation of related action plans, was an
important first step. However, there is no clear articulation of its strategic relevance to the
program’s goals and results – even though the 2007 VDR114 provides additional context that
clarifies these linkages. Nevertheless, according to some Vietnamese health specialists
interviewed during the PPAR mission, the passage of the HIV/AIDS law has had a
transformative effect institutionally and behaviorally. The leadership responsibility is now
more clearly defined. The Law has empowered the MOH and has strengthened the
effectiveness and coordination of the fight against HIV/AIDS. It has also weakened stigma
and discrimination and enhanced harm reduction. The law has also enabled some progress
towards the HIV/AIDs MDG, although it remains unlikely to be attained.

Social Protection

4.52 By 2005, Vietnam’s society enjoyed reduced poverty thanks to rapid growth, but a
social problem remained in that poverty was concentrated amongst ethnic minorities. The
Government implemented targeted programs for this population, notably P135, and other
insurance programs to counteract the impact of natural disasters (notably in agriculture).
Following the experience of health insurance, discussed above, social insurance came under
consideration. It was decided to revise existing pensions schemes to ensure they provide
sufficient benefits to justify participation by workers (civil servants and in the formal sector).
The participation of the poor would be ensured through public subsidies.

4.53 The program’s two broad goals -- reducing poverty among the population at large and
among ethnic minorities -- were not targeted by specific policy actions. The two prior actions
in this area directly supported a third goal – to increase the number of retirement pension
contributors. The development of an expanded and sustainable pension system is becoming
an increasingly important long term social protection issue in light of the steadily ageing
Vietnamese population.115



114
      P.97
115
    The poverty assessment report of the World Bank (2012a) makes the following observation: “As a
result of family planning policies initiated in the early 1990s, most households now have only one or
two children, and many of the adult children from the erstwhile large families in the 1990s are
helping to support their parents and siblings. Aging is a new demographic risk; Vietnam’s population
is aging and our analysis suggests that the elderly, particularly those who live alone, may be
increasingly at risk of future poverty. Although targeting is good, existing poverty and social
protection programs provide only partial coverage and limited benefits to poor and at-risk individuals.
In 2010, only half of the extreme poor reported that they were eligible to receive benefits from the
Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) poverty reduction programs.”
                                             78


4.54 The PRSC supported the introduction of a voluntary pension program for farmers and
informal sector workers, and the preparation of a strategic plan to ensure prudential and
effective investment of social security funds. However, the program did not address the
structure of benefits provided and their relationship with contributions collected, which are
critical considerations affecting sustainability. The percentage of contributors in the labor
force grew only slightly from 15% in 2006 to 19% in 2012, significantly below the target of
30%. Moreover, benefits are defined independently of contributions. An ILO study in 2012
forecast that the social security system (VSS) would go into deficit unless the relationship
between contributions and benefits is changed, either by reducing benefits (for example,
raising the retirement age) or increasing contributions. Specifically, “based on the
conservative assumption of the coverage rate of the VSS to be more or less constant for the
projection period, it is estimated that the reserves of the fund will be depleted in the year of
2027.” (ILO 2012, p. 6). Parametric reforms to address this issue might profitably have been
included within the PRSC program.

Gender Equality

4.55 Vietnam has achieved much greater gender equality since the mid-1990s (World
Bank 2012a). In basic education, the enrolment rate of girls now surpasses that of boys.
Gender disparities nevertheless remain, particularly in higher education. Moreover, data
show fewer women in financially rewarding wage employment than men. In political
decision making, there is a concern that women are under-represented in leadership positions
(GoV 2013). Another issue concerns women’s legal rights on household property.

4.56 Expected goals in the gender equality policy area included increasing the number of
leadership positions held by woman, increasing asset ownership and wage employment
among women. Three policy actions were supported by the second series of PRSCs: (i)
unification of the legal framework to address gender disparities and increase women’s
participation in decision making; (ii) determination of institutional responsibilities for the
implementation of the Gender Equality Law and monitoring of gender equality; and (iii)
adoption by the Prime Minister’s office of a set of national gender development indicators
and criteria for sex-disaggregation in the national statistics. The latter was initially
formulated as a trigger for PRSC 9, but was postponed to PRSC 10.

4.57 Benchmarks were: (i) adoption and implementation of a legal framework for
domestic violence prevention and control; and (ii) issuance of regulations to assign
institutional responsibilities and to allocate a budget for implementing measures to enhance
gender equality, including the establishment of monitoring and support services;

4.58 The percentage of land use certificates held in the name of either spouse or a female
person increased from 30% in 2008 to 38% in 2012, compared to a target of 45%. The
Vietnam Living Standards Survey (VLSS) 2012 indicates that women’s participation in wage
employment rose faster than men’s from 2002 to 2006 and continued to do so between 2006
and 2012 (Table 4.4). It reached 28%, above the PRSC target of 25%.
                                                                  79

4.59     Improvements in women’s participation in leadership positions at various levels
coupled with country’s progress in gender equality in education would suggest that the long-
term trend would be in the direction of greater gender equality. Feedback, however, from
focus group discussions during the mission with dozens of rural women from ethnic
minorities in a northern province of Vietnam raises some challenges. The women essentially
said that they took traditional roles and that gender equality was not a priority issue for them.
Therefore, they did not care whether or not a wife’s name appears in the certificate of land
ownership together with the husband’s name. This example suggests that there are barriers
arising from voluntary choices of women that affect gender equality. To illustrate the point
further, part of the reason for the gender disparity in jobs is that many women often choose
self-employment or employment in family businesses over more gainful jobs outside the
home.

PILLAR 3 – NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
Land and Forests

4.60 Prior to the second PRSC series, distribution of agricultural land to rural households
was followed by the titling of most of it. But there was less progress in the issuance of Land
Use Certificates (LUCs), which would begin to offer alternatives to customary practice
among ethnic minorities. Issues to be addressed included completion of cadastral maps,
increased transparency in land policy execution and reduced corruption. Effective guidelines
were needed for the use and disposal of land, and the recording of transactions. State Forestry
Enterprises (SFEs) needed to become more efficient, with unused forest land allocated to
households, local communities and the private sector.

4.61 Reforms supported by the PRSC program aimed at (a) improving the management of
forests, which were still largely under the control of State Forestry Enterprises (SFEs); and
(b) increasing land conversion, reclamation and resettlement in the context of rapid
urbanization. There were two prior actions under the first two operations of the series: (i)
issue a strategy to strengthen linkages between protective and economic functions of forests,
and promote local ownership; and (ii) issue guidelines for forest development based on
participatory land-use planning and independent monitoring. Two complementary
benchmarks were related to the clarification of settlement compensation and the transfer of
                                                80


SFE land to local authorities for allocation to households, minorities and others. A number of
other triggers proposed in earlier operations were postponed or dropped, although one
concerning nationwide management of forests was partially implemented.

4.62 There were three original performance indicators: (i) percentage of users highly
satisfied with the services provided by the land administration offices; (ii) proportion of
forest land allocated to local people and communities, for all of Vietnam and for the Central
Highlands; and (iii) proportion of land area under forest with a closed canopy, multi-story
age profile and species diversity, abundance and distribution. The first and third indicators
were dropped in PRSC 10,116 and a new one was added: share of Land Use Right and House
and Land Attached Ownership Certificates (LURHOCs) issued. With respect to the actual
outcomes, the percentage of forest land allocated to local community was 60% compared to a
target of 45% and a baseline of 27%. However, there had been no quantifiable progress in
terms of protection of biodiversity, and there had been “mixed results or deterioration” with
respect to forest quality.

Water and Sanitation

4.63 By the mid-2000s, despite good water endowment, there was a need to balance the
often conflicting demands of urban and rural areas. Pollution from untreated water and solid
wastes in fast growing industrial and human settlement centers also affected the quality of
water sources. Water-related risks, from typhoons to droughts, were taking a heavy toll on
the poor. Addressing these challenges required: (a) adequate pricing of water use and
wastewater disposal to reflect cost; (b) coordination across administrative boundaries for
effective river basin management; (c) adoption of specific plans, reconciling protection and
development, for the most important river basins and the most endangered water sources; and
(d) formulation of an appropriate strategy to handle natural disasters and support the
development of market-based risk management instruments, such as flood insurance.

4.64 The following two polices were supported by the PRSC: (i) Allocate institutional
responsibilities for integrated river basin management; and (ii) develop a proposal to
continue the current National Target Program for rural water supply and sanitation, which
focuses on promotion of rural sanitation and addresses personal hygiene. In addition the
benchmarks supported the following policies:

         Adopt natural disaster mitigation strategy with attention to non-structural measures
          and guidelines for provincial and ministerial action plans.
         Issue regulations to ensure financial sustainability of irrigation services and provide
          financial relief for poor farmers.
         Allocate institutional responsibilities to develop a unified national sanitation strategy
         Adopt a national action plan for information, education and communication for
          personal hygiene, safe water and environment sanitation.



116
   As noted in chapter 3, this pillar was substantially affected by dropped/modified actions (triggers
and benchmarks).
                                                81


         Introduce a regular and transparent nation-wide monitoring system for urban
          sanitation to deliver information on state and development of the sector.

4.65 Further reforms in this area were undertaken under the climate change DPO series
(two partially met prior actions under the second operation). Three original performance
indicators were specified at the outset of the program: (i) percentage of the urban and rural
population with access to improved or clean water; (ii) percentage to the urban and rural
population with access to properly designed and installed sanitation (dropped under PRSC
10); and (iii) number of river basins with inter-provincial water allocation procedures
established and operational.

4.66 With respect to the actual outcomes, the target for access to clean water by the rural
population was attained (75% compared to a baseline of 48%) while that for the urban
population was not (57% compared to a baseline of 85% and target of 95%). The target for
percentage of population with hygienic sanitation (75%) was reached (32% baseline).

Environment and Climate Change

4.67 Addressing the deterioration of the quality of surface water, air, marine and forest
resources witnessed in the early 2000s required an effort on three fronts: (a) mainstreaming
environmental issues in planning processes, through strategic environmental assessments
(SEAs); (b) developing economic and administrative tools for pollution control; (c)
expanding protected areas to maintain biodiversity. The manner in which these policies are
implemented (timing and scope, and effective enforcement) is also of importance.

4.68 Reforms were supported through three prior actions: (a) approving national target
program on adaptation to climate change and allocate institutional responsibilities for its
implementation; (b) issuing technical guidelines for efficient use of water resources to
complement the irrigation services fee waiver policy; and (c) issuing of technical guidelines
by the Ministry of Public Investment for the application of strategic environmental
assessments in the process of socioeconomic development planning. The reforms117 were
complemented through the following benchmarks:

         Mandating of public consultations on environmental impact assessments at commune
          level with public feedback incorporated in reports to relevant authorities.
         Strengthening incentives for solid waste management using economic instruments.
         Adopting regulations for performance contracts for sewerage and drainage at local
          levels.
         Adopting a legal framework for biodiversity protection to clearly delineate and better
          administer protected areas, and to improve the community consultation process.
         Issuing regulations on national environmental data collection, and collecting the data.

4.69 There were three original performance indicators related to PRSC reforms: (a) quality
of surface water in key areas as measured by MONRE; (b) quality of air in key areas as

117
   These initial reforms were deepened and sustained through the climate change DPO series
(through six prior actions).
                                                  82


measured by MONRE/Vietnam Environment Protection Agency (VEPA); and (c) number of
wetlands of international importance included in the protected area system as designated
Ramsar sites.118 The first indicator was modified prior to PRSC 10, as follows: quality of
surface water Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in major river basins (Nhue-Day, Cau, and
Dong Nai). The third indicator was dropped by the last operation119.

4.70 No data were reported at completion for the remaining indicators. Issues encountered
included poorly defined initial indicators, for example concerning surface water and air
quality. It was subsequently determined that, for the air quality indicator, the use of
continuous monitoring data of total suspended particulates (TSP) from Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh City would be suitable. The collection of these data was reportedly underway, although
the target value was not set. It proved difficult to determine what might constitute a good
indicator for surface water quality, and use of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) from major
rivers was being considered.

PILLAR 4 – PUBLIC GOVERNANCE

Planning

4.71 Planning reforms aimed to support the continued transition from a command to a
market economy. The focus was on improving planning processes at provincial level, and
mainstreaming of key principles such as broad-based consultations, poverty orientation, and
use of indicators to monitor development outcomes. The expected results included improved
provincial screening of public investments, introduction of modern planning principles in
provinces, and adoption of integrated regional planning. The design of the planning policy
included several weak policy actions, and many of those actions that might have achieved
results were dropped from the program as the series evolved.

4.72 During implementation the main focus shifted to public investments. There were
major shortcomings in Vietnam’s public investment program, largely stemming from
inefficiencies in planning and implementation at provincial level. The first (under PRSC 6)
prior action was to allocate state capital expenditure transparently, using criteria such as
population, poverty and ethnicity. The second (under PRSC 7) was to establish criteria for
selecting public investment projects and mechanisms to monitor their financing and
implementation. This was a partial implementation of the initially proposed trigger. It did not
build on previous policy actions, but constituted an initial step towards objectives
subsequently supported by the PIR series.

4.73 Additional reforms implemented as benchmarks were related to the monitoring of the
SEDP. A strengthening of urban planning was associated with an indicator - screening of

    The Ramsar Convention (formally, the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance,
especially as Waterfowl Habitat) is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable
utilization of wetlands, recognizing the fundamental ecological functions of wetlands and their
economic, cultural, scientific, and recreational value. It is named after the city of Ramsar in Iran,
where the Convention was signed in 1971.
119
      This also relate to the modification and dropping of triggers and benchmarks noted in chapter 3.
                                               83


public investments by provinces including the use of the use of sound cost benefit analysis–
which was not achieved. By the time PRSC8 was designed (2008-2009), there was
recognition that public investments reforms needed to be accelerated. The reforms were
transferred to the new, more focused program of PIR that combined the objective of
supporting Vietnam’s fiscal stimulus together with public investment reforms. The PRSC
covered most of the agenda laid-out in the 2007 VDR.

4.74 The virtual removal of public investment reforms from the PRSC program was not
accompanied by a re-focusing on other possible outcomes of this policy area. Only one
trigger was proposed for PRSC 10 -- enhancing the management of transport infrastructure
assets through decentralization. This did not become a prior action. The indicator on the
proportion of provinces adopting participatory approach to planning in the preparation of
annual plans and adopts a results-based monitoring approach was achieved. However, this
area was not directly supported by policy actions under the program and cannot be attributed
to it. The third indicator on the number of provinces with cross-sectoral and integrated
regional planning was dropped in PRSC 10 and was not monitored or reported – it should be
noted that the PRSC target of 2 provinces out of 58 was quite modest. There is no evidence
that the regions have moved to a modern planning process as envisaged under the program.

Public Financial Management120

4.75 PFM reforms built on the landmark adoption in 2002 of a revised Law on Budget,
moves towards greater transparency for all agencies being funded by the budget (including
SOEs), and the establishment of the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV). The agenda of the
second PRSC series was to build on these achievements by reducing off-budget expenditures,
strengthening internal controls, improving reporting and disclosure of budget execution,
upgrading the oversight capacity of SAV and the National Assembly, and enhancing the
efficiency of public expenditures. Additional new measures included the overhaul of the tax
code, increased reliance on progressive taxes (such as on property), and the management of
public debt and contingent liabilities.

4.76 The focus of the program was on independent audits, internal auditing, modernization
of budgetary management systems, and external debt. There were prior actions under each
operation of the series:

         Disclosing results of audits conducted by the SAV and its annual audit plan.
         Issuing regulations on content and timing of disclosure of SAV reports including
          audit reports of individual entities.
         Formulation of a public debt management law consolidating the management of
          domestic and external debt.
         Formulation of a regulation for internal audit development and implementation, and
          defining organizational responsibilities.



  The PPAR’s assessment of this policy area benefited from the 2013 PEFA120 and the ICR of the
120

Vietnam Public Financial Management Reform Project.
                                                84


          Annual publishing by the MOF of the synthesis report based on financial statements
           of State-owned Economic Groups and General Corporations.

4.77 These actions were to be complemented by the implementation of the following
benchmarks:

          Publish annually a report on budget execution for the current year and a budget plan
           for forthcoming year.
          Issue regulations for periodic disclosure of external public debt and its composition.
          Implement regulations to guide the establishment and issuance of benchmark
           government bonds.
          Consolidate administrative procedures for all taxes into a single law, modernizing
           assessment and enforcement methods
          Revise the investment laws to improve efficiency in state capital expenditures and
           strengthen the management of public investment projects.
          Conduct mid-term reviews of the SEDP and strengthen a result-based approach in the
           M&E framework for planning.
          Conduct public financial management reforms including commitment accounting,
           vendor management and a new chart of accounts.
          Adopt procedures for the annual audit plan ensuring sufficient frequency and
           adequate provincial coverage.
          Strengthen the legal framework for taxing the use of non-agricultural land and the
           capital gains to increase efficiency and equity, and dissuade speculation.

4.78 A number of important measures that were initially planned for support by the series -
- such as integration of MTEF into the budgeting process, reducing off-budget expenditures,
and introduction of international standards in financial statements -- were dropped from
subsequent PRSC operations mainly because of lack of consensus. Although there were two
prior actions on strengthening of external audit, there were no results indicators in this area.
Two additional indicators, on internal audit and the extent of unreported public expenditures
that were part of the initial design, were dropped in PRSC 10 as part of the restructuring of
indicators.

4.79 Results were reported on the use if the Treasury and Budget Management Information
System (TABMIS) and on the level of public debt. There was substantially expanded use of
TABMIS in provinces documented by PEFA and by the PPAR mission.121 All provinces had
moved to TABMIS as of mid-2014. The results indicator of the series, from the perspective
of coverage has thus been achieved. However, attribution of TABMIS expansion to PRSC is
difficult as there were no policy actions directly supporting modern budgetary systems, and
most of the Bank’s assistance to Vietnam in this area relied on a specific Public Financial
Management Reform Project. Moreover, the system’s functionality remained below
expectations at the time of the PPAR mission. It was expected that it would (a) provide for all
commitments to be registered at the time purchase orders are made, or contracts entered into;
(b) monitor the progress of contracts; and (c) ensure that sufficient budgetary provision is

121
      Interviews with Budget Department of Ministry of Finance
                                               85


made for payments due after the initial year in which commitments are made. But there is as
yet no system of controls over commitments, and the information on budgetary expenditure
is captured only at the payment stage. This affects the system’s functionality, although
TABMIS makes it possible to generate monthly reports of aggregate revenue and expenditure
of all levels of government.

4.80 According to the PEFA, the inconsistent reporting of the expenditure carried over
from the previous year, and expenditure charged against the current year’s appropriations
makes it difficult to compare execution reports with the original budget. Although TABMIS,
which records the information about every transaction at central, provincial and district level,
should record the administrative, locational, functional and economic nature of each
transaction, current reporting arrangements do not provide for the consolidation of any of this
detailed information into carried over expenditure which is estimated to amount about 25%
of total expenditures in recent years.122

4.81 The PRSC supported the law on public debt management through PRSC8. It was
approved by the Parliament in 2009 and helped established a comprehensive framework. The
World Bank’s CPIA reported no change in the ratings of debt management in Vietnam in
2006-2012. Based on the 2014 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA),123 Vietnam has a low
risk of external debt distress. However, public debt indicators are significantly higher than in
previous DSAs, and are projected to worsen in the medium-term. As of 2014 the debt was
approaching 55% of GDP due to the pro-cyclical fiscal expansion of 2012-2013 and it is
expected to rise to around 60% of GDP in 2017. The results indicator was to maintain public
debt below 55% of GDP. The DSA indicates that the alternative would lead to an
unsustainable debt to GDP level. There are also concerns over contingent liabilities
associated with SOEs and the financial sector and their possible impact on public debt. The
deteriorating outlook for debt-sustainability is the main factor explaining the unchanged
CPIA rating in spite of improvements in the institutional framework of debt management.

4.82 In the area of internal auditing there were two prior actions – (i) formulating a
regulation for the development and implementation of internal audits of public sector
agencies and defining organizational responsibilities, and (ii) starting an annual exercise of
publishing the synthesis report based on financial statements of state-owned Economic
Groups and General Corporations. Both prior actions were weakly implemented. Regarding
the first, the draft decree that was expected to be submitted to the Government by May 2010
was not approved as of mid-2014 because the proposed internal audit organizations in public
agencies were in conflict with existing inspection divisions whose functions partially
overlapped with those of the internal auditors. According to SAV senior staff interviewed
during the PPAR mission, reorganization of inspection divisions into internal audit units
would be costly because of training needs. The indicator on internal auditing was dropped
from the M&E framework in PRSC 10, thereby impeding evaluation. The PEFA rating of the
effectiveness of internal audit (D+) indicates low capacity. Reforms in internal audit did not
go beyond introduction of internal audit mechanisms in the Ministry of Finance and State

Bank of Vietnam. Currently there are no mechanisms to enforce internal auditing in public
agencies.

4.83 The publication of a synthesis report of state owned enterprises on the MOF website
was not systematically implemented beyond 2011 and the action was therefore immaterial for
enhancing internal audit functions in those enterprises.

4.84 The major issue of unreported expenditures, amounting to about 8% of GDP124 did
not benefit from any supporting RSC policy actions. The results indicator was, moreover,
dropped in PRSC 10.

4.85 The State Audit of Vietnam has strengthened its capacity. According to SAV officials
interviewed by the mission, the annual audit plans are being disseminated to public agencies
every year in the first quarter. SAV prepares annual audit reports that are submitted to the
National Assembly. These reports are important inputs into budget discussions and they
become public after approval by the Parliament. According to Government Decree, the
audited public agencies are responsible for disseminating the results. SAV itself holds press
conferences to present the results of high profile agency audits. SAV carries out regular
audits of provincial authorities, covering around 60% of provinces every year. SAV also
audits 50% of communes every year. SAV audits have not focused on public debt
transactions though this remains a strategic priority for the medium term.

4.86 Summarizing, during implementation of PRSC there were some important
achievements in PFM, including establishment of a modern treasury management system
(TABMIS), strengthening of external audit functions, and a PEFA exercise conducted in
2012/13. However, achievements in internal auditing and reporting of expenditures were less
noteworthy. PFM in Vietnam continues to suffer from long-standing problems such as non-
conformity of financial reporting with international standards, lack of multi-year fiscal
projections, carry-over of expenditures to following years (these expenditures also lack of
economic and functional classification), and lack of reporting at the commitment stage that
limits the efficiency of TABMIS. The CPIA sub-rating for the quality of budget and financial
management was lower in 2012 than 2006.

Public Administration Reforms (PAR)

4.87 The civil service reform agenda aimed to achieve the following: (a) improved inter-
ministerial and agency coordination; (b) introduction of common information technology
(IT) standards; (c) quality certification for government agencies; (d) civil service pay reform;
and (e) user feedback to improve service delivery.

4.88 The PRSC series had three expected results indicators: user satisfaction with
governance services, number of provinces with e-governance services, and provincial
departments with a One Stop Shop (OSS). There were two prior actions - developing draft
pilot schemes to strengthen competition, merit-orientation, and transparency in the
recruitment, appointment, and promotion of civil servants as part of PRSC 9; and adoption of

                                               87


the new Public Administration Reform Master Program for 2011-2020 in 2011 as part of
PRSC 10. Other reforms to be implemented through benchmarks were the following:

         Extend the One-Stop Shops (OSS) to all ministries and agencies and introduce inter-
          linkage between Shops to simplify administrative procedures further.
         Adopt principles of competition, merit-orientation and transparency in the
          recruitment, appointment, promotion and dismissal of civil servants.
         Dissociate the civil service pay structure from minimum wage setting and widening
          the range of minimum wages.
         Formulate common standards for IT applications and e-government interfaces at
          central and provincial levels.
         Develop indicators for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of PAR and
          provision of public administrative services.

4.89 Planned user surveys were not implemented; consequently, there are no measures of
user satisfaction with public services. This results indicator was subsequently dropped.
Regarding e-governance, the program included one policy benchmark to develop common
standards for e-governance. However, the province level e-governance indicator was dropped
from PRSC 10 as part of the rationalization of indicators. According to a Government
report125 provided to the mission, all provinces had web-sites and portals, and around 90% of
official PCs in provinces had internet connection by 2013. Growing internet usage by the
population (around 20% of households were connected to the internet as of 2013, more than
doubling since 2006) also facilitates the use of e-governance services. However, there were
few high level e-services available as of late 2014, and IT systems remain isolated. It is not
possible to establish the extent to which businesses benefit from high level e-services,
although this was the primary focus of the PRSC program in this area. In 2010, the
Government adopted a National Program on e-governance to “provide online information
and public services at high level, making operations of state agencies more transparent to
better serve people and business.”126 The ICR’s report that all provincial departments had
OSSs was confirmed by PPAR mission.

4.90 A number of other recent developments in public administration reform are relevant
to the program. The general Civil Service Law was approved in 2008. To facilitate its
implementation, the Government adopted a decree in March 2010 on recruitment and
management of civil servants based on the principles of transparency and merit. Adoption of
a new civil service master plan followed the review of implementation of the previous master
plan for 2001-2010. It was also expected that the related result oriented M&E system would
be approved in 2012 after implementation of a pilot. However, there is no evidence that the
Authorities have approved the M&E system.

4.91 It was important that public administration reforms are mainstreamed into the agenda
of public agencies and provinces. In 2013, with support from development partners, the

Government launched the Public Administration Performance Index to track progress among
public agencies and provinces in key areas of service delivery. This index assesses the
quality of public administration across six dimensions: (i) the extent of participation at local
levels; (ii) transparency; (iii) vertical accountability; (iv) control of corruption; (v) public
administrative procedures; and (vi) public service delivery. The 2013 report127 found that
there were some improvements between 2011 and 2013 in provinces in all areas except
participation and public administration procedures. The report also found variation across
regions. The World Bank CPIA sub-rating, a broader measure of the quality of public
administration, did not change during the period 2006-2012.

Fighting Corruption

4.92 The Government approach to fighting corruption was to rely on a series of technical
measures aimed at strengthening systems, reducing opportunities for corruption, and
increasing transparency. Fighting corruption was a critical dimension of the PRSC’s
Governance pillar. There were prior actions in all operations except PRSC 8. There were
three results indicators in the initial policy matrix – the proportion of enterprises reporting
paying bribes when dealing with tax administration officers or in relation to government
regulations, the percentage of households reporting paying bribes when dealing with
government agencies (as specified in the diagnostic study on corruption), and the proportion
of entrepreneurs that see corruption as a binding constraint to business. The first two
indicators were dropped from the policy matrix of PRSC 10, while two more appropriate
indicators were added - the number of provinces and central level ministries in full
compliance with asset declaration regulations and the number of declarations verified.

4.93      The prior actions were:

         Operationalization of the Steering Committee against corruption with power to
          suspend high-level officials if suspected.
         Implementation of the asset declaration requirements in regard to senior officials and
          their immediate families with penalties for non-compliance.
         Undertaking annual procurement compliance and performance audits of projects
          funded by state budget, publishing the findings of selected audits and adopting a pilot
          procurement code of ethics for participants, and launching an open access electronic
          bidding system.
         Develop a framework for monitoring progress on the implementation and results of
          efforts to prevent and combat corruption.

4.94 The anti-corruption policy area saw the largest relative number of dropped triggers
among all PRSC policy areas. Two important triggers that were critical for the anti-
corruption strategy were dropped from the program - the revision of the Press Law (PRSC 8)
and enhancing access to information by the public (PRSC9) as part of the flexible approach
pursued under the operation. In case of PRSC 9, the dropped triggers were substituted by a

policy action on procurement that aimed to address a corruption issue in procurement in
some projects financed by a particular development partner.

4.95 Benchmarks complementing the prior actions consisted of: (a) disclosing results of
anti-corruption investigations; (b) establishing a legal framework to protect and reward
whistle blowing; (c) introducing mandatory rotation for key position and payment of salaries
through bank accounts; (d) issuing an anti-corruption strategy; and (e) strengthening the
procedures for declaring assets.

4.96 Among four above-listed results indicators in this area the ICR reported only one - the
proportion of entrepreneurs that see corruption as a major obstacle, which in was 5.1% in
2009. More recent data is not available as the 2012 survey128 did not pose the same question.
However, according to the 2012 survey, 34% of households and 39% of firms listed
corruption among the top three issues facing them. The survey also indicated that while
households’ experience with various manifestations of corruption has improved compared to
2005, the situation was less encouraging with regard to firms’ experience. 63% of firms in
2012 reported deliberate delays by public officials, an increase from 57% in 2005.
Intentionally citing wrong regulations was observed by 15% of firms in 2012 versus 11% in
2005. This information partially fills the gap of non-reporting of the two corruption related
results indicators in the initial design of PRSCs.

4.97 The Bank supported implementation of asset declaration through Government
Inspectorate (GI) directives. The ICR did not provide a value for the results indicator that
was added during preparation of PRSC 10 and according to which it was expected that, as of
the end of 2012, 27 provinces and 42 central level ministries would be in full compliance
with asset declaration regulation and there would be 1000 verified asset declarations. Data
could not be obtained during the mission, which was informed that many stakeholders remain
concerned about the current system of asset declaration. In particular, according to the
current law, 600,000 thousand public officials are required to submit declarations. This
coverage is too broad to allow detailed inspection and verification of the declarations. In
addition, declarations are not disclosed except within the agencies where civil servants work.
This substantially limits their usefulness.

4.98 Through a policy action under PRSC 6, the Bank supported operationalization of the
Central Anti-Corruption Steering Committee with the power to suspend suspected high-level
officials. The Committee, however, was abolished in November 2012 and a new Committee
was created directly under the Communist Party in 2013.129 According to the Authorities, the
transfer of the anti-corruption Committee to the Politburo would strengthen Vietnam’s anti-
corruption efforts as the new Committee is expected to be more independent than the
previous one which was under the Prime Minister. However, as of 2014, there was no
evidence that the Committee functioned better under the new arrangements.130

4.99 The National Assembly in Vietnam passed the revised law on anti-corruption in
December 2012 as a prior action under EMCC1. In its initial stages, this action was
supported by the PRSC program as a policy benchmark. The law on denunciation (to protect
the confidentiality of whistle-blowers and protect witnesses) was approved in 2011 and
became effective in 2012.

4.100 Corruption remains a major challenge for Vietnam and improvements in this area
during the 2007-2014 period were relatively modest. The World Bank’s CPIA shows no
improvement in transparency, accountability, or corruption in the public sector since 2006.
The Control of Corruption indicator of the World Bank Governance Indicators also remained
largely unchanged in recent years. According to the 2012 sociological survey supported by
the World Bank more than 80% of individuals surveyed considered that corruption remains
prevalent in Vietnam.

Legal developments

4.101 Legal development needs covered areas such an enabling framework for Civil Society
Organizations, strengthening the lawmaking process, capacity development combined with
adequate funding of the judiciary and of legal aid, and increased transparency.

4.102 The program expected to achieve results in increasing consultations with stakeholders
in the formulation of laws, improving the enforcements of legal judgments and increasing the
number of legally registered civil society organizations (CSO). There were two prior actions
– establishment of separate legal, judicial, economic, and budget committees in the National
Assembly to strengthen its supervisory role, and establishment of a National Bar Association.
A third action, concerning access to information by the civil society and others, had been
considered as a trigger for PRSC 10 but was not met and dropped.

4.103 Legal development was also supported by a number of benchmark policy actions on
legal access, establishment of CSOs, strengthened consumer rights and consumer protection,
improved monitoring of complaints on civil judgment executions, improve access to court
judgment. At program completion, data only for one indicator were available, showing that
all draft laws are posted on Government websites. The other two indicators on legal
judgments and registered civil were not monitored or no data were available at completion.
Furthermore, additional information was not available on progress in the area of increased
enforcements of civil judgments, or in a number of registered civil society organizations.

Public Investment Reform (PIR) DPO Series
4.104 The PIR series was underpinned by 21 prior actions distributed between two
operations – see Table 4.5. Most policy areas covered by the PIR operations were originally
subsumed within the governance pillar of the PRSC.131 Two others were related to the
growth pillar. Aside from providing Vietnam with financial support for the counter-cyclical
stimulus at the time of the financial crisis, the PIR program aimed to accelerate and deepen
reforms in an important area where progress had been quite limited. The operations aimed to

      Some of the measures were related to environment and also affected the third pillar.

support measures to strengthen the selection, preparation, implementation and supervision of
public investment projects – which constituted the program’s four thematic areas. These in
turn contributed to the ultimate goal of increasing the efficiency and relevance of public
investment.

4.105 The policy areas did not explicitly cover the general issue of segmentation of the
budget and better integration between the development and recurrent budgets, each of which
is managed by a different ministry (the Ministry of Planning and Investment -- MPI -- and
the Ministry of Finance -- MOF -- respectively). Information collected during the mission
indicates that the two Ministries in charge work together but that some coordination issues

remain – for instance, taking into account the implications of public investments for future
recurrent expenditures.

4.106 Unlike the PRSC, the PIR did not include complementary policies or benchmarks.
There were significant modifications to seven triggers envisaged for the second operation.
Table 4.6 summarizes the changes and their impact on the program supported by PIR.

4.107 As noted above, one of the changes was quite minor and another expanded the scope
of the reform. The remaining modifications substantially reduced the program’s
ambitiousness and its potential contribution to the achievement of its objectives. The most
important change concerned the relinquishment of the presentation of the Investment Law to
the National Assembly. This measure aimed to put in place a common framework for all
public projects, and ultimately to improve the efficiency of public investment. Dropping this
trigger, due to lack of consensus over its content, resulted in a weakening in the quality and
depth of the reforms under PIR. This was considered by the Bank to be such a critical area
                                                93


that it was again included in the program subsequently supported by EMCC series.132
Another important change concerned the dilution of the reform aimed at clarifying the role of
Government in PPPs. The lack of an appropriate PPP framework still remains a significant
constraint to greater private sector involvement in infrastructure,133 which is essential in
order to meet a projected US$150 billion financing gap over the next 10 years. The last prior
action under the second operation – production of a circular on template for project
monitoring with a different trigger which supported a policy action on approval of the
charter establishing the association of independent evaluators. Finally, two triggers were
modified. The first prior action under the second PIR, the incorporation of SEA in
development master plans, initially targeted two regions and two sectors, as opposed to four
regions and one sector. The initial action had broader scope. Similarly, the eighth prior action
above on funding of SEAs, excluded an important implementation complement related
issuance of technical guidelines.

4.108 The PIR included a single prior action related to SOE reform: issued decisions to
transfer, from the Ministry of Construction (MOC), the right to exercise state ownership in
two economic groups specialized in civil works, namely the Housing and Urban
Development Group and Industrial Construction Group.134 This focused action, also
separately supported by another development partner, was completed. This has contributed to
a more even playing field in competition for civil works contracts by avoiding a potential
conflict of interest between the Ministries as both overseeing the investment and being a
service provider competing with others. Progress in this area is reflected in the outcome
indicator whereby less than 15% of civil works companies remained under MOC
management, from a starting point of 90% (and exceeding the 20% target). This constitutes
an important result, especially if procurement were to become more transparent and
competitive as a result of technical assistance provided earlier.135

4.109 The first operation supported issuing a law to allow a five year period for FDI to
register under the enterprise law. This measure was implemented in substance, but through a
different more immediate and simpler approach. It made the original reform redundant by
unilaterally extending the scope of investors’ original licenses to operate in Vietnam. The
original objective of 100% registration was thus achieved, but with weak attribution to the
program. The indicator was dropped from the second operation.

4.110 The remainder of this Section describes progress in various thematic areas aligned
with the project sub-objectives.

4.111 Project selection. The indicator was: proportion of approved regional and sectoral
master plans whose preparation was informed by a comprehensive SEA. The original target

was 1/3rd of regional master plans and 1/5th for key economic sectors 136 and was closely
linked and attributable to the first prior action listed in Table 4.5. The second operation
included revised targets of 66%, for draft (as opposed to actual) master plans and only one
key economic sector. The former was exceeded as 100% of draft master plans were informed
by an SEA. However, according to mission interviews, decreasing the number of key
economic sectors covered further lessened the impact of this reform. It was important to
develop sector specific approaches whereas master plans are at a more general level
(ultimately an investment associated with a sector).

4.112 Project Implementation. There were four indicators associated with this area: (i)
number of agencies using e-procurement; (ii) proportion of civil works companies under
MOC management; (iii) adequate compensation (as per decree) of people displaced by
projects; and (iv) timely completion of EIA as part of project preparation. These indicators,
which did not change throughout the program, were closely associated with prior actions on
e-procurement, transfer of civil works companies out of MOC, preparation of EIA, and
decree on compensation (see Table 4.5). The first indicator was met and the second slightly
exceeded (MOC only controlled 15% of the construction market compared to a target of
20%). However, no information, other than anecdotal, was provided in the ICR on the last
two137 and the mission was unable to obtain information demonstrating progress. In
particular, the absence of EIAs, as an integral part of formulating public investments projects,
remain an issue. Furthermore, the recently approved investment law does not cover this area.
Technical reasons have been advanced for this segmented approach (the law originally
envisaged under PIR would have covered EIAs this area).

4.113 Financial Management. There were three indicators to measure progress in this area:
(i) time to record ODA projects; (ii) adequate funding of EIA; and (iii) proportion of ODA
with audits conducted by SAV, or with independent audits received by SAV. These
indicators remained unchanged throughout the program. The ICR reports that all indicators
were either met or exceeded. However, two issues warrant attention. First, even though SAV
may not have been receiving the audits, most externally financed projects are likely138 to
have been reviewed by independent auditors in a timely manner – in the case of the World
Bank this is mandatory for all operations. Therefore, the issue addressed was more
integration of ODA audits into national systems than lack of accountability. The quantitative
indicator for adequate funding of EIA (0.5% of project costs) is meaningless, since it depends
on overall project size and its complexity – depending on the circumstances, 0.5% may be
too high or too low. The prior action under the first operation stated that the percentage was
for reference and not a cap. In many ways, the preparation of timely EIAs (the second
indicator) is probably the more relevant issue (assuming the EIAs meet quality norms).

4.114 Project Implementation. There was one indicator associated with this area: projects
reviewed by independent project evaluators. This target was not met because the main trigger

related to this policy area was dropped in the second operation because delays in establishing
an association of independent evaluators – it is unclear why the indicator was not modified.

4.115 Fiscal Stimulus. Even though the PIR supported the fiscal stimulus, it did not include
indicators related to this objective, and this omission constituted a significant design
weakness. The stimulus program, while encouraging economic activity, also increased
Vietnam’s vulnerability as it led to overheating and strong pressure on international reserves.
The Government switched policy back to stabilization in November 2009, after it had
become clear that the stimulus was unsustainable. This, however, was only partially
implemented as policy makers were reluctant to sacrifice economic growth ahead of January
2011 Party Congress. After the Congress, the Government approved Resolution 11, to pursue
“tight and prudent monetary and fiscal policy.”139 By 2012, Vietnam‘s economy had returned
to a relatively stable macroeconomic environment after the unstable stop/go period of 2007-
11. The economy, however, remains vulnerable to internal and external shocks. The fiscal
position deteriorated after the consolidation in 2011 and became pro-cyclical in 2012-
2013.140 The IMF estimates that a debt to GDP ratio of no more than 40 to 45% should be the
medium-term benchmark for Vietnam rather than the 55% obtaining at the end of 2014.141
Substantial improvements in fiscal management and institutional transformation in the SOE
and banking sectors are required to reduce the risks to more manageable levels.

P135 Phase 2 DPO Series
Objective 1: Strengthened Poverty Targeting
4.116 Commune, Village and Household Selection. The Government and the development
partners collaborated fruitfully on beneficiary selection and fund allocation methodology.
DPO-1 supported improved pro-poor targeting, the enforcement of which was then tracked
through DPO-2 and DPO-3. The adopted criteria were transparent and verifiable, based on a
methodology for identifying the poor, which was agreed jointly between government and
development partners, and which was a prior action of the first operation. By the end of the
program 46 out of 50 provinces were applying the improved targeting criteria. As agreed
under a DPO-3 benchmark, the list of beneficiaries was posted at the commune and village
offices, as was information about infrastructure investments (the latter also at the
construction sites). The Impact Evaluation completed in 2012 indicated that the targeting
both of the communes selected for inclusion into the P135 program as well as the designation
of the most disadvantaged groups within them was good.

4.117 Program Resource Allocation. Forty one out of 50 provinces have issued criteria for
budget allocation requiring that higher allocations be provided to the more disadvantaged
communities and villages. This resulted in allocations being “pro-poor” at the commune and
village level. The 2010 MTR raised a concern over whether commune/village officials
tended to distribute the funds allocated under P135 to the commune/village equally across the

population. The Impact Evaluation does not support that view: “While the program impact
on income and poverty of the Kinh & Hoa ethnic groups is neither large nor statistically
significant, it has large and statistically significant impacts on the income and poverty
rates of ethnic minority groups” (IE report p.12). This indicates that targeting was
successful. The same report, however, showed that while the communes covered by P135
received more funds than communes not covered by the program, they also received
substantially less non-P135 support (which is an indication of substitution between the two
sources of funds).

4.118 Enhancing Sustainability of Program Investment. The main action to achieve this was
to be an allocation of 6.3% (based on estimates of needs by CEM) of infrastructure
investment funds to Operations and Maintenance (O&M). A central budget line was created
to that effect. However, the funds tended to be used for upgrading and major rehabilitation
rather than routine maintenance, essential for sustaining infrastructure investments over time.

4.119 Pro-Poor Orientation of Production/Livelihoods Support. The outcome in the policy
matrix was that “poor upland communities increase incomes and diversify livelihoods in a
sustainable market-responsive manner as verified by baseline and end of project survey
indicators of changes in crop agricultural income and increased share of non-rice income”. In
practice the program continued to subsidize agricultural production inputs for the poor which
suggested that the old model142 of promoting self-sufficiency as means to achieve food
security still held sway.

4.120 The outcome indicator in this area changed over time and ended up being that
“average income per capita per year would be greater than 3.5 million VND (about US$160)
for at least 70% of the population”. In 2007-2012 the percentage of the population that had
earned more than VND 3.5 million had risen from 31% to only 41%, missing the target by a
wide margin (this may be because the target was too ambitious). It is not clear from the end-
line survey what contributed to the increase. Productivity of the traditional crops (rice, corn
and cassava) had not increased significantly. The available evidence indicates that the
program did not succeed in moving a substantial proportion of farmers from a subsistence to
a more market-oriented agricultural model, although there were exceptions such as the Ra
Ban commune discussed in Box 4.2 below. The improvement in incomes from agricultural
activities seemed to be derived more from subsidized inputs. The mid-term review (late
2008) found implementation manuals for this policy area had not yet been issued by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). A corrective prior action (prior
action in third operation) was therefore introduced, but it was too late to improve the
outcome.

 Box 4-2 The Tale of Two Communes supported by P135
 The mission went on a two day visit to Bac Kan, a relatively poor province in the Northern Mountains,
 with a poverty rate that remains twice the national average.
 The first visit was to the Ra Ban commune that graduated from the P135 program as the poverty rate
 declined from 50.3% in 2006 to 4.6% in 2010 based on MOLISA poverty line that is not adjusted by
 inflation and thus overestimate the extent of poverty reduction. The key to its success was a rapid
 expansion of orange and mandarin orchards, with any household that had the land and manpower
 receiving subsidized seedlings. Some years earlier a technical institute in the provincial capital had
 determined that Ra Ban had a good microclimate for oranges. Villagers that had the land suitable for
 oranges went from 90% of their production being rice in 2006 to 10% by 2012. Those who had less
 suitable land were able to reduce their acreage under rice to only 60%. Many turned to raising pigs.
 Several villagers were using credit to boost production. A typical amount was $1,500 per year at
 interest rates varying between 0.65 and 0.9% per month. Many could use more if they could get it (but
 did not seem to be willing to put up collateral for it). In general there was a high level of satisfaction
 with the infrastructure put in place (local roads, irrigation). They were connected to electricity under a
 different NTP.
 The second visit was to the Luong Bang commune. This commune was in the same district as the Ra
 Ban commune but in a more remote area and at a considerably higher elevation. It was also much more
 heavily forested. While poorer than the Ra Ba commune, the rate of improvement was almost as rapid,
 despite not having a star crop like oranges and a visibly harder terrain to work with. There were major
 increases in the production of rice and corn, and strong expansion in animal husbandry and forestry.
 Almost all hamlets now have access to a road (although some are not all-weather and there are many
 landslides during the rainy season). Many more households now have latrines. There has been an
 expansion in irrigated land. Average incomes have doubled in real terms between 2006 and 2010


Objective 2: Decentralization, Participation and Empowerment

4.121 Informed Public Participation in Program Planning and Management. Based on the
beneficiary analysis survey, 143 levels of participation by households in project selection
meetings has increased from 49% in 2007 to 74% in 2012 (target was 70%). Satisfaction with
the selection of projects stood at 92% by 2012 (target 85%). There was an increase in the
percentage of households who reported that they had voiced their opinion at project
selections meetings (37% compared to a baseline 14%) and 26% felt that their opinion had
been considered (baseline 8%). The qualitative outcome in this area is hard to assess.
Participation was inclusive, but this says little about the quality of participation (information
about which would have required assessments by independent monitors present in meetings).
The 2010 MTR states that people’s participation “could be described as consultation at best”.
The Government’s final report says that the quality of participation was not always high and
that the principles of openness and democracy have only been exercised superficially. On the
other hand, these are new activities for most of these people and to participate may be
intimidating if one does not possess specialized knowledge. On balance, there would appear
to be a gathering momentum in this process of improving participation and decision-making
processes at the local level.

4.122 Devolution of Investment Ownership. For a commune to assume investment
ownership it had to form a Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU would then hold the
legal authority to administer the activities and financial transactions of the commune
projects. The PMU would then hold the legal authority to administer the activities and
financial transactions of the commune projects. By 2010, 94% of all communes had PMUs.
Of those, 94% involved local households in participatory planning, 74% had a training plan
for commune officials, 90% had a communication plan, and 87% were organizing
participatory M&E activities. These numbers reflect broad participation by households in the
prioritization and implementation of the choses projects, even if their contributions would
depend on how effectively the training and communication plans were implemented.


 Box 4-3. Stakeholders’ feedback based on visit to Bac Kan region
 Ra Ban. The six women in the women’s focus group reported being satisfied with the selection of
 projects to be implemented. They typically got to a decision in two or three meetings. They
 reported no bias between men and women in decisions making. They felt that the targeting was
 fair. The households determined to be poor were voted through village meetings. Afterwards,
 district officials would visit the households to check on their assets and confirm income
 information. The process was annual with a fair amount of transitioning out of poverty, but also
 some back into poverty. The women reported satisfactory progress in material well-being. Incomes
 had risen. Electricity gave them access to information via the radio and TV as well as being able to
 acquire electrical appliances. All the women in the focus group had cell phones. Most households
 now had access to a motorcycle (and would now like their roads to be paved). Good progress was
 also reported in non-material areas. They had access to a health clinic. They reported that they had
 received useful training in orange tree planting, rice production and pig-raising. They still spoke
 Tay (a local dialect) at home, although increasingly their children communicated in Kinh (the
 national lingua franca). They placed great emphasis on education and could point to young people
 who had gotten through school and were getting jobs in nearby towns. One was even studying in a
 university in Hanoi.
 Luong Bang. The five women in the women’s focus group agreed that there has been substantial
 progress but had hoped for more. They felt that access to electricity was the greatest change in their
 lives. They agreed that road access has greatly improved and there was strong progress in irrigation
 (but would now like the dams and canals to be done in concrete to reduce maintenance). They said
 that they would plant many more trees under the replanting schemes but needed long-term credits
 because the potential benefits from logging were too far away. They had received training in tree
 planting. They agreed that they were materially better off. They all had cell phones and most
 households had a motorbike. They also agreed that non-material aspects of life such as access to
 health and education had improved. Some worried that the children once educated will leave and
 may not support them in their old age.


4.123 By program completion, there was a gap between the desire for Community
Investment Ownership (CIO) in principle and carrying it out in practice. 97% of commune
staff interviewed in 2007 wanted communes to become investment owners. But taking up the
responsibilities that go with ownership was not easy. The commune staff had to prepare
designs for each selected project, estimate the needed resources, organize bidding and
selection of the contractor and then supervise implementation. All this involved capacity
building of both institutions and individuals, which takes time. While the number of CIOs
                                              99


more than doubled during the program, only 46% of the communes were infrastructure
investment owners by 2010, well below the ambitious initial target of 100% (revised to 70%
in DPO-3).

4.124 Local Institutional Capacity Building Support. The program was based on the
understanding that decentralization could not take root without intensive training of
commune cadres and local people for their various functions. Local authorities organized
training on administration, financial and project management skills for nearly 180,000
commune and village staffs. Training was delivered in the form of short 5-6 day courses
(Impact Evaluation (IE) report p.79). Virtually all staff on Commune Supervisory Boards and
in the Project Management Units received some training. By the end of the period, 82% of
the officials thought the training to have been relevant, 60% thought the duration of training
was sufficient and 90% were satisfied with the quality of the trainers. However, fewer than
20% of the trained officials were women (there was no target set for this aspect of the
program). Officials do not appear to have been fully qualified. Data indicate that only 40% of
the households were satisfied with the qualifications of the members of the supervision board
and only 30% felt that the project management board was sufficiently qualified.

Objective 3: Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability

4.125 Procurement of Small-Scale Infrastructure. End-of program indicators regarding
procurement of small-scale Infrastructure were that 80% of contracts would be awarded
through open and competitive bidding and/or other non-direct contracting methods and that
they would be verified by State Audit of Vietnam’s (SAV) annual audit reports. In addition,
in selected provinces, at least 70% of works below the relevant threshold would follow
community contracting. To promote competitive contracting, second operation supported the
issuing of a manual on procurement according to stipulated guidelines, including elements
regarding transparency and procurement planning. The manual was issued but the
enforcement of procedures was weak. Competitive bidding for contracts over VND 1 billion
(about US$50,000) has increased over time, but the majority of contracts between VND 300
million(about US$15 million) and VND 1 billion were procured by direct contracting.
Community Participation Procurement (amounts below VND 300 million) has been
attempted in only a few provinces. However, according to the 2010 World Bank Country
Economic Memorandum, reporting and auditing of procurement performance was
insufficient and inadequate.

4.126 Public Financial Management. The program was to be audited by SAV in a selected
number of provinces, with this number increasing over time. By the end of the program all
provinces had been audited and some had been audited twice. The quality of the audits was
deemed acceptable by Government and development partners. The DG of SAV confirmed to
the PPAR mission that P135 audits now cover the entire budget, including the donor
contributions. The audits are annual. The sample to be audited in any one year is not entirely
random since at least some projects have to be picked from each province. The results are
immediately sent to the relevant development partner.

4.127 However, full public disclosure of financial information was not achieved by the time
P135 closed as the semi-annual financial reports were not published regularly on the MOF
                                           100


website (an agreed outcome) and the results of the audits were published on the SAV website
only in summary form (rather than by individual province). By 2010 there was an increase in
the number of projects with financial information made public at the commune level to 75%
(from 51% in 2007), but only 21% of the households were aware of the available
information.

4.128 Community contributions. One of the measures to promote public accountability and
future sustainability of the projects was for communities to contribute cash or labor. It was
hoped that this would lead to better maintenance of the projects in the future. To some extent
this was happening, although it may well have been limited by the fact that these communes
are by definition relatively poor households contributing to the construction of the projects
increased from 22% to 36%, and average contribution in cash rose from 12 to 135 thousand
VND. Almost all of the work done by the households was unpaid.

Objective 4: Monitoring and Evaluation

4.129 Process Monitoring. The Government retailored the Aligned Monitoring Tool/
Program Monitoring Tool (AMT/PMT) system144 used at the central level to the needs of
P135. However, the resulting MIS was fully operational in only 11 of the 50 provinces by the
end of the program. There were also issues with the unfamiliarity of its information
requirements at the lower levels of government accustomed to a different reporting format.
Citizen Report Cards which were supposed to be produced annually, were produced only
once in 2008 as an initial pilot and there was no follow-up.

4.130 Impact Evaluation. While there were delays with both the baseline and end-line
surveys, by completion a good quality data set was available for analysis. It was analyzed in
some detail by a team assisted by external consultants. The MIS system now exists (although
it is fully operational for only a fifth of the provinces) and the outcomes of the end-line
survey showed progress across a series of indicators.

5. Summary Performance Evaluation
   A. Clustered Approach
373. This chapter evaluates the outcomes of the three completed DPO series (second PRSC,
PIR and P135), as well as Bank and Borrower performance. The presentation may differ from
that of other PPARs since commonalities between the operations allow for clustering of some
of the analysis. Given the in-depth analysis of various dimensions of the three series presented
in the previous four chapters, this Chapter summarizes the resulting performance ratings.
374. A specific issue facing the evaluators concerned the deterioration of the quality of
PRSC reforms over time (the first operation was approved in 2007, the fifth and last in 2012).
This weakening took place at the same time as the international financial crisis of the late 2000s
early 2010s. Care has been taken care that the evaluation takes into account exogenous factors
where warranted.
375. It should be noted that, as more than two years had passed between the first and second
operation, two ICRs were prepared for P135, one covering the first operation and the other the
last two. The review below is for the whole series.
Program Development Objective (PDO)
376.   The development objectives were as follows:
a. PRSC. The main objective of the proposed series of operations was to help Vietnam
   develop the economic policies and institutions needed to become a middle-income
   country (PD PRSC 6 para. 38). This formulation did not change throughout the series,
   even though it was omitted from latter documents (e.g., from the PD for PRSC 10). This
   broad objective is distilled into a series of specific objectives according to SEDP/PRSC
   policy pillar:
      Promotion of growth and transition to a market economy that will foster the
       development of businesses in an environment crucial to the sustained growth of the
       country’s economy.
      Poverty reduction and social inclusion, enabling all players and stakeholders to
       participate and to enjoy the benefits of development and growth.
      Sustainable management of the environment and natural resources as the country
       seeks to harness the benefits of natural resources and the environment for
       development and growth while ensuring their sustainability.
      Building institutions that can support the country’s development strategy through
       improving governance.

5.1     PIR. The overarching objective of the proposed program is to “support modern
governance,” one of the four main “pillars” of Vietnam’s Socio Economic Development
Plan, and the fourth objective of the PRSC series. Specifically, and according to the project
documents, the program aimed to raise the productivity of investment through four specific
improvements in:

      project selection (environmental screening);
                                                102


         project implementation (cost estimates, bidding rules, bidding transparency, conflict
          of interest, dispute resolution, land acquisition, environmental management);
         financial management (reporting and control, administrative costs, environmental
          budgets, subsidies and guarantees); and
         project oversight (project documentation, monitoring and evaluation). The text of the
          PDs145 imply another objective: supporting the Government’s fiscal stimulus.

This report includes this objective in its evaluation of the program.146
         P135. The PD for the first operation defines the following objectives: support policy
          and institutional actions to improve the results of one of Vietnam’s principal National
          Target Programs for poverty reduction, known as “Program 135, Phase 2” (P135; and
          referred to as P135 throughout this report). This formulation was not changed during
          the series. However, the second operation defined the following policy areas, which
          may be treated as specific objectives :
          poverty targeting;
         decentralization, participation and empowerment;
         fiduciary transparency and accountability; and
         monitoring and evaluation.

Relevance of Objectives
5.2      The DPOs founded upon the SEDPs, complemented by a specific targeted program in
the case of P135, which in the case of the 2006-11 SEDP was operationalized primarily
through the 2007 VDR as well as numerous other analytical works. That SEDP and the
current one are fully consistent with one-another, even if their perspective changes somewhat
from attaining middle-income status to dealing with this challenges associated with that
status, as well as exogenous issues, notably the international financial crisis. Both applicable
Bank CPSs in place since 2007 (see Chapter 2) supported the SEDPs were closely aligned
with it. Furthermore, the PIR, notwithstanding design flaws, was an important part of the
Bank’s response to the international financial crisis.

5.3    All three DPOs were relevant to Bank Strategy at the time they were approved, even
though in the case of the PIR the series was introduced in an ad-hoc way and additionality to
PRSC was modest. Increased budget support could have been achieved through a further
increase in the PRSC envelope and the measures PIR support could have been integrated into
the PRSC matrix as they were related to previous actions. The objectives of these DPOs
remained highly relevant to the CPS, in place at their closure. In view of these



145
   The stimulus is the center of the whole operation described in PDs. It is discussed as an integral part
of the operation throughout these reports and is cited explicitly as a main policy area (e.g., in Loan and
Program Summary).
146
   This approach is slightly different from that proposed in the ICRR, which treats the stimulus as a
separate objective to that of supporting modern governance, whereas it is seen as a part of modern
governance.
                                               103


considerations, the following ratings apply to their strategic relevance: (a) PRSC and P135
High; and (b) PIR Substantial.

Relevance of Design
5.4     Choice of Instrument. All three series included a significant policy reform agenda,
which made the choice of a DPO instrument suitable. However, there was some concern as to
whether P135 would not have been better supported through an investment lending
instrument (such as a SWAP). This PPAR concludes that in such a case the required policy
reforms would have been delayed. As it was, the Government effectively earmarked the
necessary resources, thus ensuring full funding of the program. However, effective reliance
on Government’s fiduciary and safeguards systems and policies may have resulted in some
issues being overlooked.

5.5     Macro. Greater attention would advantageously have been paid to macroeconomic
and fiscal issues. This applies both to the PRSC series, which should have played a more
significant role in promoting sustainable policy options, and to the PIR series, which was part
of the response to a macroeconomic crisis. These two programs, however, contained no
macroeconomic actions. Moreover, there was inconsistency in the Bank’s approach. While
the second operation in the PIR series was delayed in 2010 because of concerns over the
country’s macro and fiscal framework, PRSC 9 went ahead as planned in the same year,
resulting in fragmentation of macro-policy dialogue.

5.6    It is questionable whether there was sufficient justification for proceeding to
implement the later operations in the both the PRSC and PIR series. This PPAR finds that,
once PRSC actions became vague and reversible, and two critical measures were dropped
from the PIR, neither of the subsequent operations (the second in the PIR series, and PRSC
10) should have proceeded. In contrast, when issues emerged in P135, external support was
put on hold until a mid-term review could take place and the program could thereafter
continue on a better footing.

5.7     Chain of logic. The following paragraphs examine the quality of the results
framework for each operation. Each series is underpinned by a separate framework and is
therefore discussed individually.

PRSC

5.8    The program encompassed 17 policy areas across four pillars of the SEDP. Its
ambition was to serve as a vehicle to mobilize and deliver General Budget Support147 to
Vietnam by the donor community. The breadth of the program and the choice of policy areas
was thus relevant.



147
   Funding allocated to the Government consolidated fiscal account, whereas for some other
development partners sector budget support resources once disbursed remain earmarked for the
sector.
                                            104


5.9      The program’s result framework suffered from weaknesses detailed in Chapter III. In
a comprehensive program such as this, the relevance, significance and institutional depth of
each prior action is very important. Although the program supported many important actions,
it suffered from weakening quality of prior actions with the progression of the series. In
particular, 30 out of 53 prior actions are assessed to have had various shortcomings, of which
seven prior actions were found as not relevant for the results, 14 prior actions had insufficient
institutional depth and criticality, while 13 prior actions had problems with measurability of
their contribution to the results. A clear trend of weakening of quality was observed from one
operation to another.

5.10 Declining policy content is explained in part by the strong emphasis placed on
predictability of disbursements. Flexibility may have helped maintain good working relations
between the Bank and the Authorities, and facilitated development partner coordination,
thereby reinforcing predictability. However, predictability delivered limited benefits to
Vietnam. Unlike some other PRSC recipients, external support to Vietnam constituted a
small part of available resources for public expenditures. While the flexibility accompanying
predictability weakened the program by postponing key reforms.

5.11 The indicators at the outset were relatively closely related to objectives. However,
many indicators were only partially attributable to actions supported by the PRSC, and some
outcomes depended on exogenous factors.

PIR

5.12 The primary design logic of the PIR was to put in place a set of reforms that would,
with a lag, result in improved efficiency of public investments. This objective was supported
by 21 actions over two operations. The primary drivers of this result in terms of policy areas
were the proposed law on public investments and PPP framework that defined the
government’s roles. By the time the second operation was in 2011 neither could be realized
within the series’ time frame due to lack of consensus. Yet, the results framework and indeed
objectives were left unchanged. Although the expected results were closely linked to prior
actions and largely attributable to the program. They were largely outputs that were not
immediately connected to objectives. The program did not include actions to support sound
implementation of Government’s fiscal stimulus, which was a major design weakness
affecting the quality of Bank’s engagement in macro and fiscal policies.

P135

5.13 The program consisted of four main policy areas and 13 sub-areas. The first DPO
included 11 prior actions, the second 8, and the last 4. As explained in earlier chapters, the
prior actions in the first two DPOs were strong, those in DPO-3 were less convincing.
Furthermore, some actions did not apply to the program’s whole geographical area. The
initially proposed reforms were complemented by the 46 future actions (some of which were
triggers for the next operation) envisaged in the first operation’s PD. Subsequently, this list
was reduced to 18 benchmarks under the last two operations. As detailed in Chapter III, the
relevance of actions was generally robust, especially after the programs mid-term review
prior to the second operation. Overall, the actions were relevant to the objectives sought.
                                             105


Similarly, indicators, as revised after the mid-term review, provided an improved chain of
logic. The most important one concerned poverty reduction in targeted zones.

5.14 In view of the above analysis, the rating for relevance of design for each series is:
modest for PRSC and PIR and substantial for P135.

Implementation
5.15 All DPOs were fully disbursed at effectiveness. Table 5.1 below summarizes the key
dates. It should be noted that all operations closed on schedule.

5.16 An important change in approach from the Bank’s perspective was the “branching”
of DPOs, where the Bank approved sectoral DPOs in parallel with the PRSC. Under the first
PRSC series, this instrument was seen as the sole means for policy dialogue and support
between the Government, and the World Bank and development partners. This approach was
justified by the breadth of issues covered by the first PRSC series and the desire then to
consolidate policy dialogue within the purview of a single instrument. It was substantially
modified with the approval of five new DPO series after 2007. The reasons given for the
branching varied: (a) supporting an anti-poverty sector expenditure program (P135); (b)
accelerating sector reform (Power, Higher Education, Climate Change, and PIR); and (c)
addressing the macroeconomic crisis by financing part of the stimulus package (PIR). It
should be noted that the current CPS envisages a much narrower approach with a single DPO
series covering only what are seen as the most critical issues, some long left unaddressed,
facing Vietnam.

Achievements of Objectives
5.17 All DPOs include an implicit objective whereby the macroeconomic situation has to
be satisfactory throughout their implementation. While this situation may have prevailed for
                                            106


PRSC 6 and 7 and the first P135, there were weaknesses in the macroeconomic framework
after (and including) 2009. There was also a progressive deterioration over time of the
quality of the reforms supported by the PRSC and PIR series, and improvements in those
supported by P135.

5.18 Achievement of objectives for each operation and by objective is discussed below.
This draws on the detailed analysis of results presented in Chapter IV.

Poverty Reduction Support Credit

5.19 The program initially had 51 results indicators; 10 more indicators were added in
PRSC 10, while 27 indicators were dropped during the preparation of PRSC 10. The ICR,
however, provides data for those indicators that were dropped. During the mission attempts
were also made to update the data for the indicators, including those that were dropped –
with mixed success due to imperfect availability of information. In total, out of 61 results
indicators the ICR provided data on 40, of which 25 indicators were met or exceeded, 3 were
partially attained (result between target and baseline) and there were no data for another 7.
The update of data with more recent observations did not substantially change the overall
picture of achievement of target values. This relatively low number of indicators that were
monitored and/or were reported to have reached the target is explained by shortcomings in
program achievements in some areas only, but it also reflects weaknesses in M&E design and
implementation.

Objective 1: Promotion of growth and transition to a market economy that will foster the
development of businesses in a business environment crucial to the sustained growth of
the country’s economy - Substantial

5.20 Assessment of achievement of this objective was based on assessment of results
under five underpinning policy areas -- global integration, private sector development,
reforms in SOEs, reforms in the financial sector, and infrastructure. In policy areas related to
global integration, private sector development and infrastructure the program achieved
important results in supporting Vietnam’s growth agenda and implementing reforms.
Following the accession to WTO, the country deepened its integration with the global
economy and exports boomed. Sustainability is likely as FDIs recovered quickly after the
slowdown during the international crisis. Vietnam remains an attractive destination for FDIs
thanks to factors such as geographic location, positive policy “bias” toward the so called
“external sector”, investments in infrastructure, completion of WTO-related reforms under
the program, and a comparatively advantageous cost structure in the economy.

5.21 The growth of MSMEs and foreign investments diminished the importance of SOEs
in the economy. This is evidenced by credit to the SOE sector, which remained constant in
nominal terms between 2009 and 2013, and fell from 29.4% of total credit to 16.5% during
the same period.148 Furthermore, as of 2011, it was estimated that about 400,000 SMEs
operated in Vietnam (about 60,000 were established during the 2006-2011 period) and
employed 77% of the workforce. The PRSC included a number of benchmarks aimed at

148
      IMF 2014 op. cit.
                                              107


improving the investment climate for MSMEs, which contributed to their growth. Similarly,
regarding infrastructure, the separation of power transmission and generation assets was a
fundamental reform that allowed the subsequent introduction of competition in electricity.
Similarly, the decentralization of investment ownership in the transport sector improved the
integration of capital and recurrent expenditures (and ultimately efficiency of investments in
the sector). Finally, clarification of treatment of unsolicited bids improved transparency and
was an important action in the absence of a more comprehensive PPP law.

5.22 The results were less impressive regarding State Owned Enterprises and the financial
sector. The program focus in SOE reforms was in divestiture efforts to limit the direct role of
the state in the economy. The reform agenda in this area has performed below expectations.
Financial sector reforms have been progressing slowly. The Central Bank is now more
independent and capable, which is a necessary condition to ensure the presence of a sound
financial system. Nevertheless, the quality of the banking sector portfolio has not improved
under the program, while no state owned bank complied with the international standards of
loan classification as of mid-2014. While recognizing limited progress in two policy areas,
overall progress in other areas explain the substantial rating for this objective.

Objective 2: Poverty reduction and social inclusion, enabling all players and stakeholders
to participate and to enjoy the benefits of development and growth - Substantial

5.23 Assessment of achievements is based on the results of four policy areas – education,
health, social protection and gender. There were important achievements in health insurance,
maternal mortality, and poverty reduction. Although the data suggest that some results in
education and gender equality were less than expected, this may reflect M&E weaknesses.
Supporting data collected by the mission suggest substantial improvement in many
dimensions of education and gender inequality as well as achievement in areas such as health
insurance, maternal mortality and poverty reduction. The results were less encouraging in
promoting social insurance among various groups, while sustainability of pension system
remains a challenge. On balance, the efficacy of the second sub-objective was substantial.

Objective 3: Sustainable management of the environment and natural resources as the
country seeks to harness the benefits of natural resources and the environment for
development and growth while ensuring their sustainability - Modest

5.24 Assessment of achievements in this sub-objective is based on the results of three
policy areas – land and forest, water, and environment. Prior actions in this policy area aimed
to increase the land allocated to local communities; increasing the issuance of land-use
certificates; improve the population’s access to clean water; increase the number of river
basins managed with inter-provincial water allocation procedures; improve the quality of
surface water, and increase the number of wetlands of international importance in the
protected area system. This objective was supported only by a small number of supporting
actions, even though more might have been justified by the complexity. Quantifying results
in these three policy areas was also hindered by lack of data – values were not reported by
the ICR in seven out of ten indicators. On balance, the program’s achievements were partial
at best.
                                                 108


Objective 4: Building institutions that can support the country’s development strategy
through improving governance - Modest

5.25 Assessment of achievements in this sub-objective is based on the results of five
policy areas consisting of planning, public financial management, public administration
reforms, legal developments and anti-corruption. With the exception of public administration
reforms, the progress was below expectations. In the policy area of planning, no substantial
progress was achieved in public investment management and integration of modern planning
in provinces. In PFM, in spite of some achievements in external audit and introduction of a
modern treasury management system, the overall progress in PFM in 2007-2012 was below
expectations. Specifically, the issues of off-budget expenditures, conformity of the budget
classification with international standards, and lack of progress in internal audit remain are
significant shortcomings.

5.26 In the area of anti-corruption, some of the institutions supported by PRSC, including
the steering committee and asset declaration, did not perform in line with the initial
expectations and Vietnam’s CPIA rating in control of corruption has not improved since the
mid-2000s. In the policy area of legal developments, design included insufficiently
ambitious. Consequently, the only relevant result recorded was the posting of draft laws on
the Government’s website.

5.27 Public administration reforms were more tangible and better sustained. The list of
important achieved results include institutionalization of the one-stop shop, adoption of the
Civil Service Law and subsequent government decrees, the Master Plan for Public
administration reforms, introduction of public administration performance index for
assessing performances of the provinces. That said, the CPIA rating of the quality of public
administration has remained unchanged since 2006, and is yet to reflect the reforms.

Public Investment Reform

5.28 There is almost no quantitative evidence that the efficiency of public investments
improved on the basis of reforms supported by PIR, which was an ultimate but not specific
objective of the operation that might have been visible at time of writing, two years later. The
only indicators suggesting such progress is the falling public investment to GDP ratio. If this
reduction had been through the elimination of projects with lowest rates of return and/or
reduced cost for a specific project, then efficiency would likely have risen. However, it is
unknown149 how this reduction was achieved (for example it could have been across-the-
board or by postponing new, potentially more efficient, investments).

Objective 1 – Enhancing Project Selection - Modest

5.29 The sole step in the process concerned environmental screening. There were two
significant changes in the formulation of one of two prior actions, compared to the original
trigger, concerning incorporation of SEAs in development master plans. The main one was
that the condition was relaxed (as detailed in Table 4.6) to encompass only the draft of such

149
      The Bank is currently undertaking such a study.
                                               109


plans. The second is that the action concerned one sector rather than the original two. The
second prior action (a review of experience) was process-oriented and equivalent to a study
rather than a reform with negligible evidence of impact.

5.30 This area originally contained another action related to re-registration of FDI firms,
which would simplify entry and enhance competition within the economy, including that
with public investments in productive sectors. This result was achieved, through other means,
which were not attributable to this part of the program, but could be considered part of post
WTO accession reforms supported by the PRSC. However, the relevant indicator was
dropped from the second operation, and the sub-objective was only partially met.

Objective 2 – Improving Project Implementation - Negligible

5.31 The five areas consisted of: (i) project approval; (ii) capacity building; (iii) conflict of
interest; (iv) dispute resolution; and (v) environmental management. The key action
consisting of the submission of an investment law was dropped altogether due to lack of
political consensus and internal resistance – its importance is reflected in the fact it was taken
up again under the EMCC. The measure on conflict of interest was also partial. Furthermore,
two indicators related to the last two areas could not be measured. There were thus major
shortcomings in meeting objectives.

Objective 3 – Enhancing Financial Management - Modest

5.32 All the actions under this pillar were implemented. There were significant
modifications to two triggers for the second operation. The decision on the PPP framework
no longer contained any language on provisions on the scope of Government participation in
PPPs – an area where there has been limited progress to-date. In the case of environmental
budget, the action no longer included language on preparation of SEAs. The indicators, while
met, suffered from shortcomings which renders them only partially meaningful – as
discussed previously in Chapter IV.

Objective 4 – Improving Project oversight - Negligible

5.33 The sole policy action concerned improved M&E of projects through, as trigger, the
establishment of the Association of Independent Evaluators. This reform was relaxed under
the revised prior action, which called for establishing the criteria for individuals and
institutions to carry out investment evaluation. The indicator related to this action showed no
progress was achieved with regards to public projects being reviewed by independent
evaluators.

Objective 5 – Supporting Fiscal Stimulus - Modest

5.34 The shortcomings of the fiscal stimulus and the stop-go policies it reflected were
detailed in the earlier macroeconomic discussions in Chapter II and III. Overall, the attempt
to finance the stimulus while supporting stabilization efforts -- without a macroeconomic
framework -- proved too challenging: the DPL series did not effectively contribute to a well-
calibrated, well-timed countercyclical policy program.

Program P135 Phase 2 Support Program

Objective 1: Strengthened Poverty Targeting - Substantial

5.35 Commune, Village and Household Selection. The Government and the development
partners collaborated on beneficiary selection and fund allocation methodology. DPO-1
supported improved pro-poor targeting, the enforcement of which was then tracked through
the last two DPOs. The IE agreed that the targeting both of the communes and villages
selected for inclusion into the P135 program as well as the designation of the most
disadvantaged groups within them was good.

5.36 Program Resource Allocation. The criteria for budget allocation requiring that higher
norms be applied to the more disadvantaged communities and villages has been issued by 41
out of 50 provinces. This resulted in allocations being “pro-poor” at the commune and village
level. Targeting appears to have been successful.

5.37 Enhancing Sustainability of Program Investment. The key to achieving this goal was
to be an allocation of 6.3% of infrastructure investment funds to Operations and Maintenance
(O&M). A central budget line was created to that effect. However, the funds tended to be
used for upgrading and major rehabilitation rather than routine maintenance.

5.38 Pro-Poor Orientation of Production/Livelihoods Support. The agreed outcome in the
policy matrix was that “poor upland communities increase incomes and diversify livelihoods
in a sustainable market-responsive manner as verified by baseline and end of project survey
indicators of changes in crop agricultural income and increased share of non-rice income”. In
practice, the program continued to subsidize agricultural production inputs for the poor.

5.39 The outcome indicator in this area changed over time and ended up being the
“average income per capita per year for at least 70% of the population”. The indicator rose
from 31% to only 41%, missing the target by a wide margin (although the target was too
ambitious). In any case, the Program’s approach in agriculture does not seem to have been
successful in moving a substantial proportion of the farmers from subsistence to a more
market-oriented agricultural model.

Objective 2: Decentralization, Participation and Empowerment - Substantial

5.40 Informed Public Participation in Program Planning and Management. Levels of
participation by households in project selection meetings has increased from 49% in 2007 to
74% in 2012 (target was 70%). Satisfaction with the selection of projects stood at 92% by
2012 (target 85%), 37% of households reported that they had voiced their opinion at project
selections meetings (baseline 14%) and 26% felt that their opinion had been considered
(baseline 8%). The qualitative outcome is, however, hard to assess.

5.41 Devolution of Investment Ownership. By 2010, 94% of all communes had PMUs. Of
those 94% involved local households in participatory planning, 74% had a training plan for
commune officials, 90% had a communication plan, and 87% were organizing participatory
M&E activities. Efforts for communities to become investment owners were serious. While
                                             111


the number of CIOs more than doubled during the Program, only 46% of the communes were
investment owners by 2010 (versus an overly ambitious target of 70%).

5.42 Local Institutional Capacity Building Support. A substantial training effort was made
under the Program. By the end of the period, 82% of the officials thought the training to have
been relevant, 60% thought the duration of training was sufficient and 90% were satisfied
with the quality of the trainers. However, fewer than 20% of the trained officials were
women.

Objective 3: Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability - Modest

5.43 Procurement of Small-Scale Infrastructure. Competitive bidding for contracts over
about US$50,000 has increased over time, but the majority of contracts over value continued
to be procured by direct contracting. Community Participation Procurement has been tried in
only a few provinces. Reporting and auditing has been insufficient.

5.44 Public Financial Management. By the end of the program all provinces had been
audited and some had been audited twice. The quality of the audits was deemed acceptable to
the Government and development partners. However, full public disclosure of financial
information was not achieved by the time P135 closed. By 2010 there was an increase in the
number of projects with financial information made public at the commune level to 75%
(from 51% in 2007), but only 21% of the households are aware of the available information.

5.45 Community contributions. Households contributing to the construction of the projects
increased from 22% to 36%, and average contribution in cash rose from 12 to 135 thousand
VND. Almost all of the work done by the households was unpaid.

Objective 4: Monitoring and Evaluation - Modest

5.46 Process Monitoring. The MIS was fully operational in only 11 of the 50 provinces by
the end of the program. There were also issues with the unfamiliarity of its information
requirements at the lower levels of government which were used to a different reporting
format. Citizen Report Cards were produced only once (2008) as an initial pilot and there
was no follow-up.

5.47 Impact Evaluation. While there were delays with both the baseline and end-line
surveys, in the end a good quality dataset was available for analysis and was analyzed in
some detail by a team under the auspices of consultants. The results of the analysis made a
crucial contribution to assessing the impact of P135.

Outcome Ratings
Poverty Reduction Support Credit

5.48 The overall outcome rating is assessed as moderately satisfactory that reflects high
relevance of objectives, modest relevance of design, substantial achievements in business
development and social inclusion objectives, and modest achievements in environmental and
governance objectives. The rating reflects Vietnam’s impressive economic performance
                                            112


driven by global integration, as well as accompanying improvements in poverty and social
inclusion. Although attribution is in general challenging, this evaluation finds that through
the program the Bank helped Vietnam to maintain the focus on growth and poverty reduction
agendas and address many impediments important for improving short-term economic
performance. The program, however, did not achieve many of its intended results in
environmental and governance, which are the areas where economic growth does not
necessarily guarantee a positive change, and a transformative push is often needed which was
not present in the program.

Public Investment Reform

5.49 The outcome rating is assessed as unsatisfactory. This reflects substantial relevance
of objectives and modest relevance of design. There were major shortcomings in the
achievement of objectives, with three thematic areas rated modest and the other two
negligible. There was little evidence indicating that the measures taken attained their
intended results or contributed significantly to the longer term goal of promoted greater
efficiency in public investments. The lack of measures supporting the attainment of an
adequate macroeconomic framework was a major weakness, especially given that this series
aimed to address, in part, the macroeconomic consequences of the international financial
crisis. The program should have included macroeconomic measures.

Program P135 Phase 2 Support Program

5.50 The overall outcome rating is assessed as moderately satisfactory. This rating
reflects high relevance of objectives and modest relevance of design. Overall, many of the
objectives in the four policy areas of the DPO series were achieved. The efficacy of two out
of four specific objectives is rated substantial, while that of the other two is rated modest.
Overall, targeting of poor households was good, and funds for operations and maintenance
were allocated at the agreed level, although they were, at times, spent on rehabilitation rather
than routine maintenance. Public participation in program planning and management
increased substantially. Ownership of infrastructure investments by communes increased.
Community contracting improved, although there is a long way to go before competitive
bidding replaces direct contracting. There was progress in public financial management,
although public disclosure could have been more comprehensive and timely. Accounting of
community contributions improved over time. Monitoring of processes was a case of too
little too late, but the impact evaluations proved valuable in assessing the final outcome of
the program.

Risks to Development Outcome
5.51 All three series face similar risks such as macroeconomic and policy reversal. These
are likely to be manageable in terms of maintaining achievements to-date. A specific
assessment of risks for each series is provided below.
                                                 113


Poverty Reduction Support Credit

5.52 As Vietnam’s GDP has been growing at a satisfactory, albeit slowing, rate while
poverty has simultaneously been reduced, some of the risks have become less relevant. The
potential for the economy to grow faster and become more complex driven by fundamental
factors is apparent. Nevertheless, some new risks have emerged with Vietnam’s middle
income status. As the economy becomes more sophisticated, public sector performance and
governance have to improve. Macroeconomic risks, including reduced fiscal space, are
serious and may affect growth and poverty reduction through increased volatility. However,
more focused reforms are being implemented under the EMCC program, while continued
policy dialogue helps sustain reform and discourage policy reversal. The Risks to
Development Outcome was Moderate.

Public Investment Reform

5.53 There were limited achievements under this series. Policy reversal is still possible
where actions were largely at the level of commitments in the form of expression of
intension. Nevertheless, the Government seems to be aware of the need to improve the
efficiency of public investments and the recently approved Public Investment Law under
EMCC is an important step forward. It remains to be seen whether the country will put in
place a transparent and competitive enabling framework for PPPs that attracts qualified
international operators. If so, in-country capacity to oversee PPPs, evaluate their risks and
manage contingent liabilities will require strengthening. The Risks to Development Outcome
was Moderate

Program P135 Phase 2 Support Program

P135 - Moderate
373.   Achievements in poverty reduction are unlikely to be reversed. However, unless the
momentum is maintained, the gap between the poor and less poor communities may increase.
Elements of risk include:
         Funding for the follow-up program P135-3 may decrease. After several years of year-
          to-year extensions, the development partner backing has fallen off substantially.
          CEMA in a field interview noted the drop-off in funding and the difficulty of keeping
          up the skills of its staff due to high staff turn-over. An erosion of skills gained under
          the Program is likely.
         External cooperation modalities may change. The World Bank has moved away from
          budget support and returned to project funding for remote areas that may lead to a
          slower disbursements observed in other parts of the portfolio.
         The Bank is piloting an entirely different approach to social assistance, more in line
          with the needs and capabilities of a middle income economy (Social Assistance
          System Strengthening Project150 approved in 2014). This may however temporarily
          restrict resources going to the very poor while new channels are established.

      The new P135 program may not have the backing that P135 had and there are
       questions concerning what will remain over time of the institutional and individual
       capabilities that have been built. On the other hand, different programs may address
       the need of communities previously covered by P135.
      The livelihoods component was unsuccessful and the effectiveness of a new rural
       approach especially for the remote and mountainous areas still needs to be
       demonstrated (New Rural Development in Vietnam – From Field to Policy).
      It is not clear that the O&M approach that was introduced under P135 will remain in
       place.
      Process Monitoring is unlikely to be sustained except perhaps in the few provinces
       where it had been successfully implemented.

   The Risks to Development Outcome was Moderate

Bank Performance
5.54 There are cross-cutting features for both aspects of Bank performance (Quality at
Entry and Quality of Supervision) and across series that affect the performance rating. It also
should be noted that for annual DPOs the difference between Quality at Entry and Quality of
Supervision Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision may be blurred. The depth and
breadth of knowledge products underpinning the DPOs were impressive, as was the quality
of poverty and social assessment. Bank-led donor harmonization was also of a high standard,
at least until PRSC9. This allowed timely identification of technical assistance needs and
provision. The dialogue with Government appears to have been deep and built on a
relationship of trust, even if this resulted in too much “flexibility” after 2009, at a time when
there were changes to the composition of the Bank teams and new relationships had to be
established. Lessons learned were well integrated in project design, even if other than for
P135 there might have been more attention to lessons from outside Vietnam. However, the
treatment of the macroeconomic situation was inadequate, especially after 2008. Also, the
environmental underpinning of DPOs could have been stronger from the outset of the series.
Finally, M&E was generally weak, a shortcoming widely spread among World Bank DPOs.

Poverty Reduction Support Credit

Quality at Entry – Moderately Satisfactory

5.55 Strengths in Bank performance at entry included strong linkages between program
design of PRSC 6 and 7 and analytical work, leading the complex development partner
coordination process, and increasing the size of the financial envelope to provide counter-
cyclical assistance in the wake of 2008-2009 financial and economic crisis.

5.56 Shortcomings include a gradual softening of proposed policy actions for subsequent
operations over time, de-linking of the operations from the initial design in PRSC 9 and 10,
weak macro dialogue, and no incorporation of necessary macro actions in the program. The
design of monitoring and evaluation also suffered from weaknesses that are attributable to
the choice of the indicators that sometimes were too general to effectively measure
program’s results that the Bank attempted to improve with mixed results at PRSC 10. Finally,
                                             115


the effectiveness of collaboration with development partners was both a strength, as it
improved harmonization and lowered transactions costs faced by Government, and a
weakness, since there was a large number of policy actions over 17 policy areas.

Quality of Supervision – Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.57 The Bank established clear mechanisms of program supervision that allowed
combining an effective integration of various stakeholders into the monitoring of the
program’s implementation. Supervision benefited from the leadership of sector staff in the
country office. However, the quality of supervision appears to have declined over time. One
noteworthy shortcoming was the lack of response to emerging problems in M&E in timely
manner. The revision of the M&E framework was done at the end of the program with
shortcomings, such as introducing some new results indicators that were not linked to policy
actions supported by the Bank, Also, declining quality of reforms can be attributable in part
to “flexibility” during supervision. Bank dialogue with the Authorities suffered from
insufficient attention to macroeconomic risks. The Bank could have been more candid in
identifying the shortcomings inherent in PRSC 10 and recommended the early closure of the
series, as the weakening of prior actions resulted in marginal contributions to the completion
of the original program.

On the basis of the above, and taking into account the outcome rating, the overall Bank
performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

Public Investment Reform

Bank performance – Unsatisfactory

5.58 Given the difficulty of separating the role of the Bank at entry and during
implementation, because of the reorientation of the program between the first and second
operation, and given that no supervision reports were produced, a combined assessment of
Bank performance is appropriate. Program preparation was ad-hoc, as reflected in
weaknesses such as lack of readiness of certain reforms, an inadequate results framework and
limited participation from other development partners. There may have also been a
disconnect between the identified need to support the macro-program and to provide budget
support, while at the same time trying to accelerate reforms in the Governance pillar in areas
with limited traction. In any event, the design of the series was substantially undermined
when key triggers were dropped as prior actions. Indeed, it is not evident why the Bank
proceeded with the second operation, since the program was by then much weakened.
Government officials interviewed during the PPAR mission stated that, from their
perspective, the program was premature, since policy dialogue underpinning key reforms had
not matured by the time the decision was taken to proceed with it. Some counterparts
expressed the view that the draft investment law prepared with the help of the Bank could
have been improved.

Program P135 Phase 2 Support Program

Quality at Entry – Moderately Satisfactory
                                           116


374. The first PD of this series presented a good summary of the experience and lessons
learned in CDD operations in East and Southeast Asia. In particular, that significant training
of key personnel would be needed up front, and a process monitoring system should be in place
at the start of the operation. The need for technical assistance was identified upfront, and a
large technical assistance package accompanied the implementation of the series and covers
those requirements in parallel (even though sequencing issues resulted in implementation
problems noted elsewhere).

5.59 The choice of instrument seemed risky, even though policy reforms were correctly
identified. A SWAP, for example would have required up front rather than parallel TA in the
flagged areas. The need to accelerate certain policy reforms, which is hard to achieve under
investment lending, may have driven this choice, which with the benefit of hindsight appears
to have been justified.

5.60 It may also have been driven by the wish of development partners to coordinate aid as
much as possible through budget support in accordance with the resolutions of the Paris
Declaration and the Hanoi Statement. The PRSC series’ track record and that of other
operations encouraged expectations that a budget support operation to reduce poverty in the
lagging mountainous and remote regions would be timely.

5.61 The original design and the first operation had shortcomings in terms of both program
content and M&E, revealed at the mid-term review, and the treatment of safeguards was
incomplete. However, shortcomings were addressed in the second and third operations
(which are also part of quality at entry).

Quality of Supervision – Moderately Satisfactory

5.62 For the first two years of the Programmatic series (during which only one operation
was approved) the Bank, the other development partners and the government addressed
emerging issues. Early supervision identified various problems such as need for capacity
building and improving M&E. The in-depth mid-term review (MTR) in late 2008 was
fundamental in improving project design and performance. It confirmed that the delays in
mobilizing technical assistance in the areas of training and process monitoring had to be
overcome, and that the intermediate monitoring and outcome indicators should be made more
precise. This meant that additional prior actions had to be carried out before the approval of
the second operation to strengthen the program and help ensure its success. Given the
difficulties being experienced, it would have been helpful to Bank management had
supervision reports been filed.

5.63 The MTR proposed 10 medium-term actions that were implemented and improved
the quality of the program. This resulted in rapid progress during the second and third
operations, and paved the way for success, as evidenced in this evaluation. This vindicated
the view at entry that the programmatic series was the way forward, even if the expectations
of timely TA interventions were optimistic.

On the basis of the above and taking into account the outcome rating, the overall Bank
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
Poverty Reduction Support Credit

Government Performance – Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.64 Government’s ownership of the PRSP agenda was uneven across reform areas and
appears to have diminished over time. Transition to middle income country status was the
Authorities’ main objective. However, the focus on structural reforms to make such a
transition sustainable and pave the way for long-term balanced growth was weaker.
Vietnam’s performance in attracting foreign direct investment, in integrating into the global
economy and in overall growth performance, was satisfactory. Performance was also good in
poverty reduction and social inclusion. These developments have, nonetheless, taken place
against the background of structural deficiencies in SoEs and financial sector, and challenges
in PFM and anti-corruption that the PRSC series could not address because of lack of reform
momentum. The period under review was also characterized by increased risks associated
with macroeconomic management.

Implementing Agency – Moderately Satisfactory

5.65 The Central Bank (SBV) was the focal point in the PSRC series. It’s special PRSC
Coordination Unit reported to the Steering Committee, which brought together and gave a
voice to key line Ministries. Given that most of the policy actions were sector specific, the
SBV satisfactorily coordinated PRSC activities and consulted with stakeholders on selecting
the policy actions. Timely implementation was one of the key criteria in identifying the
actions for the program. However, this also reflected the prioritization of timely
disbursements over the depth of reform.

On balance, Borrower performance, taking into account the outcome rating, is assessed as
Moderately Satisfactory.

Public Investment Reform

Government Performance - Unsatisfactory

5.66 In the absence of a Steering Committee, there was no practical distinction between
Government and Implementing Agency performance. The program was implemented directly
by Government agencies, notably the State Bank of Vietnam, and the Ministries of Finance
and of Planning and Investment. The significant weakening of the reform agenda in the
second operation was akin to a policy reversal as it undermined objectives. Furthermore, the
mission found that the consensus around the program was weak. As fiscal space diminished,
contingent liabilities in the banking and SOE sectors were rising, and the macroeconomic
situation was becoming more fragile. However, this did not motivate the Government to
undertake transformative changes, such as facilitating PPPs, rationalizing public investment
and reducing investments with low viability. Borrower performance is rated Unsatisfactory.
                                            118


Program P135 Phase 2 Support Program

Government Performance - Moderately Satisfactory

5.67 Government’s commitment to, and ownership of, the program was strong. It had
started the P135 Program itself in 2001 and had long experience in alleviating poverty and
hunger in the remote and mountainous regions of Vietnam. However, a policy framework in
this area was an innovation, so it took time to resolve a number of issues. The decentralized
nature of the program added to its complexity. The dominant modality at the start was still
one of issuing guidelines and regulations from the center which, at times, were not attuned to
practical needs at the local level. These difficulties were addressed as the key agencies at the
center (MOF, SAV, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, MPI) played an
active role in the supervision and in implementing the follow-up actions.

Implementing Agencies Performance - Moderately Satisfactory

5.68 There was a large number of implementing agencies at various levels of the
administration. Cross-sectoral coordination was achieved through a steering committee
structure, which operated under the Prime Minister’s Office at the central level, and Peoples
Committees at the province and district levels. Day-to-day coordination was carried out by
the Standing Members of these committees - Committee for Ethnic Minorities (CEM) at the
national level, the Province Board of Ethnic Affairs (PCEA) or Department of Planning and
Investment (DPI) at province level and Peoples Committee Offices at the district level.

5.69 There was some difficulty surrounding CEM’s role in the hierarchy. Neither the CEM
at the central level nor the PCEM at the province level had the executive powers of similar
level bodies of the regular Ministries, with the appropriate staffing capacity to manage and
implement projects. It remained more of a coordinating body. Effective implementation of
P135 thus depended on local government leadership, typically the Office of the District
Peoples Committee, which performed well. Over time these coordination problems were
ironed out, notably following MTR, and implementation agencies became effective.

In view of the above ratings, overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
Poverty Reduction Support Credit

5.70 Design. The design of M&E was based on the SEDP monitoring framework from
which indicators were selected for the first PRSC operation. The Bank’s focus was on
quantitative indicators collected routinely. Many indicators were, nonetheless, too broad to
be attributed to the specific interventions that the program was supporting (poverty reduction,
export and FDI performance, for example). Another weakness was a reliance on indicators
for which data collection was not guaranteed because they were not part of core statistics
used by Government. Out of a total of 61 indicators, values for 21 were still unavailable at
completion and at the time of the PPAR mission. Moreover, data were not available even for
                                              119


two of the ten indicators added to the program during preparation of the last operation.
Ascribing a similar number of indicators for all policy areas did not take account of the fact
that some areas were more demanding in terms of data than others.

5.71 Implementation. M&E implementation was carried out by a special unit in the State
Bank of Vietnam in coordination with relevant sectoral ministries. Although the weakening
of pace and depth of the reform program had become apparent by PRSC 8, the M&E
framework was not significantly revised until the preparation of PRSC 10. This could
advantageously have been done sooner.

5.72 Utilization. The Steering Committee was responsible for monitoring the program and
was thus in theory the main user of M&E results. No evidence is provided concerning
utilization in the ICR or other documents.

The quality of M&E is rated Modest.
Public Investment Reform

5.73 Design. Some indicators were over-specific, others were only partially attributable to
the program, a few were unclear, and, as a whole, they lacked a clear logical link to the
development objectives. Conceptually, they were closer to intermediate outcome indicators.
At the time of the second operation, some indicators were dropped following modification to
prior actions, but the same issues remained. The framework was not designed to determine
whether or not public investments were becoming more efficient. This reflected the fact that
the measures actually supported by the program could not have been expected to yield such a
result.

5.74 Implementation. The fact that three indicators out of nine were not measured, and
another showed no progress (from a baseline of zero) reflects shortcomings in M&E
implementation. The ICR mentions data limitation as an issue. This seems to be also related
to the low priority given to implementing M&E and collecting data, even for a sample of
projects.

5.75 Utilization. An appropriate M&E should have been able to provide evidence of the
program’s contributions to increase efficiency of public investment. This would have
constituted is greatest use. No information is provided in documents concerning utilization
of the M&E framework. M&E is rated Negligible.

Program P135 Phase 2 Support Program

5.76 Design. Overall the revised indicators, which were revised and improved from one
operation to the next, provided an adequate basis for measuring attainment of objectives. In
the area of process monitoring, the original design involved the retailoring of the AMT/PMT
system used by the government at the central level to the needs of provinces, districts and
communes. It also improved the ability to follow the money from the center to the commune,
as well as to aggregate the information from the commune to the higher administrative levels.
The resulting MIS was not fully operational until the end of the program and even then only
                                           120


in 11 out of 50 provinces. Citizen Report Cards which were supposed to be produced
annually, were produced only once (2008) as an initial pilot and there was no follow-up.

5.77 Implementation. The AMT/PTM tool was adequate at the central level for which it
had been designed but was difficult to implement at lower administrative levels. The tool
itself and the many indicators it contained were unfamiliar to the staff at local levels.
Although training was increased substantially following the mid-term review, and a number
of provinces were selected as pilots for testing the entire system, delays and design
deficiencies impeded effective use of the framework during program implementation. A
baseline survey was carried out in 2008 and helped in the development of better monitoring
indicators in DPOs 2 and 3. An end of the program survey was carried out in 2011/12. Both
used a randomized survey approach with designated treatment and control groups of
communes and villages. The results were essential in evaluating the program.

5.78 Utilization. There is no discussion of M&E utilization in the ICR, although there is
evidence that M&E results were used to implement the program, notably with respect to
targeting the poor.

The overall rating for M&E is Substantial.

6. Conclusions and Lessons Learnt
Conclusions
6.1     This review presented an overview of Vietnam’s economic and social performance. It
assessed the extent to which World Bank DPOs during 2007-12 contributed to its
achievements and their sustainability. The main conclusion that emerges from the historical
overview is that the country’s growth performance during the 1990s and until the mid-2000s
was very strong. Effective poverty alleviation also took place during that period, and has
been sustained since. This was thanks to transformative measures (especially land reform,
enterprise reform and WTO accession) that were taken by Government during the first half of
the 2000s (in turn building on earlier reforms) with substantial development partner advice
and support, which was generally led by the Bank.

6.2     However, during the period under review (2006-2013) the next generation of
transformative reforms (notably as highlighted in the 2007 and 2009 VDRs) were either
postponed or diluted, and were thus less effective. Areas such as SOE and financial sector
reform, more efficient public investments, anti-corruption, and more effective environmental
policies, received insufficient attention. Over the same period, Vietnam departed from the
prudent macro-fiscal stance that characterized it in the 1990s early 2000s.

6.3      Past reforms continue to drive strong FDI and buoyant exports. Vietnam can build on
these strengths to avoid further loss of growth momentum. This could be based on the
implementation select transformative reforms aimed at strengthening the role of the private
sector, facilitating the emergence of medium- to large domestic enterprises, and sustainably
expanding infrastructure in an efficient manner. The progressive elimination of the stock of
contingent liabilities and reducing other risks to the sustainability of fiscal policy would
create a more stable macroeconomic environment. One of Vietnam’s strengths lies in its
social compact, the main elements of which should be maintained, while progressively
evolving towards a less paternalistic approach based on stakeholder empowerment.

6.4      The Bank and other development partners can help the country address these
priorities through more selective budget support instruments. This is indeed envisaged in the
Country Partnership Strategy (2012-16). The 2016-2020 SEDP also provides an opportunity
to generate political consensus around these issues in the context of an increasingly complex
economy.

6.5     The Bank should be more willing to cease supporting programs should they become
so weakened as to make it likely that key objectives would not be achieved. Technical and
policy dialogue would be maintained. In this context, high caliber knowledge products will
need to continue being prepared, and the relationship of trust that supports frank dialogue
with Government needs to be reinforced. Harmonization with all key stakeholders, external
and internal, will be important. Strong commitment to deeper reforms would help to sustain
Vietnam’s economic performance while addressing the challenges of an increasingly
complex, middle-income economy, and deepening global integration.
                                            122


Lessons from the Bank’s macroeconomic engagement through DPOs.
6.6     The model of the Bank’s engagement in macroeconomic and fiscal policies
through DPOs in Vietnam since 2007 has not been effective. An important finding
emerging from this PPAR is that, while diagnosis of macroeconomic risks was adequate, this
was not reflected in program design, despite a highly volatile environment exacerbated by
sub-optimal policy choices. This situation was, moreover, aggravated by the lack of an IMF
program and the relative weakness of macroeconomic policy dialogue between the
Government and the Bretton Woods Institutions. The Bank may have been exposed to
reputational risks if its policy lending had been seen as a de-facto endorsement of
controversial macro policies. DPOs following those reviewed in this PPAR are still not
underpinned by relevant macro policy content, although macroeconomic risks persist. This
indicates that the lessons learned during the 2007-2013 period do not appear to have been
fully learned.

6.7     Macroeconomic dialogue could advantageously be consolidated in a presence of
multiple parallel DPOs. The fragmentation of policy lending into multiple DPOs
implemented in parallel in Vietnam during the period of increased macro risks might have
weakened Bank’s focus on macro framework and even resulted in inconsistencies in policy
dialogue. The Bank should have avoided situations when preparation of one operation is held
back for concerns over the macro-framework while a parallel DPO is approved and disbursed
in the same macro environment. To avoid the repetition of such a situation, there should be a
unique and consistent approach towards assessing the adequacy of macroeconomic
underpinning of DPOs. When substantial risks are present, policies underpinning the most
suitable, in terms of scope and objectives, budget support operation should be reoriented to
alleviate them.

6.8     Combining the objectives of external financing for crisis response and promotion of
long-standing institutional reforms may not be effective in cases where risks to non-
implementation of reforms are high. The Bank’s experience with the Vietnam PIR series
indicates that, when financing needs are urgent, it will find itself under pressure to go ahead
with disbursements even if the reform implementation is not satisfactory. Crisis response
operations should first of all focus on ensuring the sustainability of macro and fiscal
framework, and should be underpinned by critical macro, fiscal and structural actions,
especially in cases when the IMF is not present operationally.

Lessons Learnt – Results and M&E Framework

6.9      Wide-ranging DPOs need to be based on stronger and better quality actions.
The importance of each individual prior action increases in multi-sectoral operations with
many policy areas because of the implicit limit on the number of total prior actions for
operational purposes. If in a series of five operations, for example, each policy area can have
a maximum of two or three prior actions in the course of five to six years it is important to
ensure that those prior actions have sufficient institutional depth, relevance and criticality.
Related to this, in multi-sectoral complex operations there might be no substitutability
between the prior actions of unrelated policy areas, which means that weaknesses of prior
actions in one sector cannot be offset by relevant and critical prior actions in another sector.
                                                 123


6.10 Lack of focus on and delays in implement essential triggers can weaken the
program. In terms of indicative triggers, the Bank has flexibility and discretion in its
treatment of the triggers. The transition from Bank’s former conditionality framework to the
model applied in the series reviewed in this PPAR puts a high premium on sequencing the
reforms and ensuring continuity, thus giving considerable significance to the role of triggers
for the operations and the overall reform program. Dropping a trigger should be considered
as an exceptional event, rather than a regular occurrence, permissible only if the risks to non-
implementation of reforms are duly addressed.

6.11 Partially met triggers require greater attention. Sometimes “partially met” triggers
become prior actions even though they may be less relevant and critical than the originally
proposed action. The dilution of content may be to such an extent that these actions would
probably not have been considered as prior actions if proposed at the outset. The Bank should
pay special attention to possible risks in adopting partially met triggers as prior actions,
especially when there is not any realistic expectation that the full original reform will not
implemented in a reasonable timetable thereafter.

6.12 It is crucial to have a strong knowledge base for upstream design of reforms and
parallel technical assistance (TA) to support their implementation. Development partners
were willing to put significant resources in these areas, in order to complement Bank
financing and dialogue (Vietnam, prefers not to borrow, even on concessional terms, for TA).
Selectivity is therefore needed to ensure that the most pressing needs are addressed. Should
unmet demand remain, this may be tackled through complementary Bank TA operations, for
instance in support of reform teams.151 However, these operations need to be carefully
designed in order to match the timing and sequencing needs of DPOs (an issue that arose in
the case of P135), and to ensure that the bulk of resources is allocated to meet specific
implementation requirements, as opposed to general capacity building (such as purchase of
vehicles and equipment, and training). Furthermore, this approach calls for outsourcing
knowledge generation and advice to an appropriate mix of experts, both national and
international, who can accompany the reforms in medium-term.152

6.13     The design and implementation of M&E for DPOs remains a challenge, and
needs to be reconsidered each time a new operation is considered within a series. The
PD.153 for the second PIR mentions a lesson learnt elsewhere, whereby an effective M&E
mechanism should not just be based on administrative reporting. However, both the PIR and
the PRSC suffer from this issue as M&E is not used as a mechanism for feedback and
readjustment of activities to improve impact. The P135 is more successful in this area

151
   FIAS 2008: Reform Teams - How the Most Successful Reformers Organized Themselves Reform
teams consist of a small group of national experts who together with world-class expertise help
Governments implement ambitious reforms.
152
   In order to achieve such continuity, the experts’ contracts may be based on a retainer model.
Sorter procurement may also be achieved through framework contracts, whereby a short-list of
competitively prequalified consortia/firms expected activities are called upon to provide experts
within short delays of 2-4 weeks. The EU has successfully implemented this approach.

because the mid-term review provided a venue for reassessing the implementation of the
program. Even there, the change in PRSC indicators took place only for the last operation,
although it had become clear much earlier that the relaxation of policy actions required an
adjustment in indicators and goals. In both the PRSC and the PIR series there is a disconnect
between development objectives, actions and indicators. In the case of the PRSC, there was a
logical chain between objectives and indicators, but it is hard to see how some of the reforms
would lead to the intended results (the attribution issue). The issue with the PIR is that while
there is strong relationship between the reforms and results, their logical link to the
development objectives is weak, especially after key reforms were dropped.

Lessons Learnt – Bank Approach

6.14 There is a need to reexamine how the Bank approaches sectoral DPOs and how
this instrument is differentiated from investment lending. In Vietnam, the distinction
between DPOs and investment loans has become blurred, especially with the practice of
earmarking funding for the sector the programs support. It can be argued that the four
sectoral DPOs might have been best supported by SWAPs and investment lending. The
advantage of DPOs is that they disburse rapidly, support to the consolidate budget, and in
practice promotes the use of national fiduciary and safeguards systems. However, this
approach limits Bank inputs (say on a key study) on the ultimate use of the resources and
their underlying processes. To avoid sharp trade-offs that may discourage the use of the most
appropriate lending instrument, it seems that in the case of investment lending, it may be
desirable to experiment, at least on pilot basis, with further harmonization/convergence
between Bank fiduciary and safeguard procedures and national ones.

6.15 The Bank and other development partners should be willing to “walk away”
from an unproductive policy dialogue and withdraw their support of low impact
reforms. The delays in P135 (second operation), the second PIR operation and PRSC 10
appear to have been caused by concerns with the quality of the program. In the case of P135,
the mid-term review largely addressed the main concerns. However, the last operations in
both PIR and PRSC series cannot be readily justified by the contribution to objectives of the
weak reform they supported.

6.16 The Bank’s recent guideline that suggest to limit the number of operations in a
series to three constitutes an appropriate measure. Long-term DPO series need to be kept
relevant by maintaining a high level of ambition with respect to the reforms they support. As
evidenced by the second PRSC series, a longer-term approach may be hard to sustain.

6.17 Knowledge generated and/or embodied in Bank operations should be properly
documented and made public. Bank disclosure policy call for documents it produces being
made public, unless classified as confidential. Furthermore, to the extent possible, documents
on which policies are based should be easily identifiable and retrieved. In order to preserve
knowledge and improve transparency, PDs should properly refer to studies (in some cases the
title cited was incorrect) and provide URL links. There is also a question whether disclosure
policy is strictly respected (e.g., some energy studies do not appear to have been made
public).
                                                 125


6.18 It is difficult to evaluate the performance of DPOs in Vietnam without the
benefit of a clear reference on what constitutes the norm. This review identifies strengths
and weaknesses in the Vietnam DPOs by referencing their own internal logic. However, it is
unable to systematically address questions such as how did the Vietnam second PRSC series
compared to other PRSCs in terms of ambition, design, results etc. This may result in
inconsistency in ratings across countries and projects (ratings contain a subjective element
based on the skills, experience and perception of the evaluation team, as well other factors).
This issue seems to argue in favor of a new meta-evaluation154 of completed PPARs on
similar DPOs, with lessons learnt and recommendations on a more consistent cross-country
approach to be reflected in future individual operation evaluations and/or PPARs.

Specific Lessons Learnt from P135

6.19 Budget support may not be the best instrument for financing a sector investment
program. While a budgetary support operation for a CDD-type program turned out to be
moderately satisfactory in the case of Vietnam, the Bank and other development partners had
taken a considerable risk. For most countries, it would be highly advisable that the training,
at least of the critical personnel (which in a highly decentralized program means a very large
number of people), would be done in advance and that an M&E system were in place at the
start of the program. There was much retro-fitting under the P135 series that could have been
avoided.

6.20 The state of decentralization needs to be fully factored into the design and
implementation of targeted poverty programs. Decentralization of government institutions
and introducing greater participation at the commune and village levels was an objective of
the program as a tool to empower the targeted communities. Various monitoring indicators
were used to measure progress on this front. But they did not provide an idea of what would
have been “good practice” in terms of an optimal level of decentralization and participation
given the stage of development. An alternative approach could have been to select a control
group of provinces that had been decentralizing on their own and could serve as a
comparison group for the provinces attempting to develop decentralized structures under
P135. That could have enabled the selection of a group of indicators to be used for
measuring success before the start of the operation

6.21 Production support to poor communities needs to be tailor-made and well
thought through. Much was made of expanding the production component of the program.
But the targeted communities were seriously underdeveloped for good reasons. They were
remote, mostly mountainous, often forested, and inhabited by people who have eked out
livings in these places for centuries. Such places are notoriously difficult to develop and there
are few success stories around the world to give guidance. Packages that had worked in other
parts of Vietnam (typically used in the more hospitable lowlands) were not likely to be
relevant, and subsidies are not sustainable in the long run. This portion of the program could
have been better thought through and explored through a series of pilot projects rather than
being a part of a budget support operation.

                                              126


6.22 Good analytical work, economic and other, contributes to success. Populous
countries with large externally financed programs, such as Vietnam, are likely to benefit
from an amount and variety of analytical work, typically using standard economic tools.
Smaller countries with more modest analytical programs can probably learn useful things
from a selective reading of the analytical work performed in more abundantly staffed
countries. But Vietnam also profits from relevant non-economic analytical work that
illuminates the likely behavior of the people involved both at the highest levels as well as at
the village level in a way that informs the design of the programs. This sort of work is
important but by its nature country specific.155

6.23 Well-designed impact evaluations are a valuable dimension of M&E. The impact
evaluation turned out to be very important in assessing the impact of P135, not only
regarding poverty but also non-income components of welfare, participation, decentralization
and empowerment. This has direct relevance to other National Targeted Programs in
Vietnam and elsewhere. It is important that funding of such activities be included in the
original project design as their late inclusion may lead to implementation difficulties.

6.24 Vietnam’s social compact was instrumental in supporting certain achievements,
but may not be readily replicable elsewhere. Vietnam’s reforms have relied on a top-down
approach, which nevertheless draws in various stakeholders into the program and strengthens
their ownership and voice. This is notably the case for targeted programs such as P135.
While the country’s history and social compact are quite specific, there are generic elements,
such as effective engagement of local political authorities and communities that may be
useful elsewhere.

behavioral implications at the village level the best example would be Edwin Shanks et al “CDD in
Vietnam” (2003).

Noteworthy aspects of Implementation arrangements

         Three economic agencies, in addition to line Ministries, are involved in
          administration of DPOs. SBV is the implementing agency for PRSC, PIR and Climate
          Change DPOs, and MOF and MPI take the primary lead on the reforms. In the case of
          P135, CEM implements it in cooperation with four other ministries. Line Ministries
          are responsible for implementing the other two sectoral DPOs. The role played by
          SBV in 3 DPO series is unusual and appears to contribute to the complexity of
          implementation arrangements (a point that was made by some those interviewed
          during the mission).
         PDs for PIR and PRSC generally provide minimal explanation on the role of line
          Ministries. Those listed are responsible for a reform. Arrangements under P135 are
          more detailed.
         Under PRSC, line Ministries are mentioned as being members of the Steering
          Committee under the chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister158, which plays a
          significant in overseeing reforms. IEG’s review159 of the first PRSC series concluded
          that the Steering Committee is an effective vehicle to draw attention to coordination
          issues that need to be resolved by higher authorities. However, this effectiveness
          appears to have declined during the latter part of the PRSC series. This may have
          contributed to the diminished ambitions of reforms over time. P135 also relied on a
          similar Steering Committee, with slightly different participation by line ministries. No
          specific Steering Committee was established for PIR.
         The institutional setting for the other sectoral DPOs was somewhat more streamlined.
          The steering Committee for the Power DPO was chaired by the line Ministry (MOTI).
          The MOET was responsible for implementation of the Higher Education operation.
          Finally, MONRE was the main counterpart for the Climate Change operation.
         Civil society involvement in the PRSC appears to be mainly through consultations
          with apex organizations and highly structured, as part of a growingly inclusive

158
    Perhaps the role of this committee was already well established and additional explanation was not
needed.

            process.160 In the case of the PIR, civil society participation was indirect, through the
            PRSC. Given close links to the PRSC, overlapping institutions and ambition of
            reform, it is unclear why the PIR was not overseen by the PRSC steering committee.
           All DPOs benefitted from significant development partner involvement in terms of
            financing and/or participation in the dialogue. Reflecting Vietnam’s emerging
            middle-income country status, the number of development partners involved in the
            PRSC decreased over time (from 12 to 8), which in principle should have facilitated
            harmonization.

         Góp ý Báo cáo của IEG về các chương trình hỗ trợ ngân sách

-   Đề nghị bỏ đánh giá về khó khăn trong việc cho vay lại nguồn vốn các
    chương trình PDO đối với EVN nên việc sử dụng nguồn vốn này là
    không xác định được. NHNN thấy cần thực hiện các đánh giá cụ thể
    trước khi đưa ra nhận định này.

-   Mục 3.3, 3.52, 5,12 nhận định mặc dù PDOs được thực hiện trong giai
    đoạn khủng hoảng để hỗ trợ chống lại những rủi ro vĩ mô nhưng các
    chương trình này lại không có các hành động chính sách về tài khóa và
    vĩ mô để hỗ trợ Chính phủ thực hiện các gói kích thích kinh tế. Đây là
    khoản vay hỗ trợ cải cách chính sách về đầu tư công nên các hành động
    chính sách trong Chương trình tập trung vào các hành động chính sách
    cải thiện chất lượng và hiệu quả của đầu tư công (như: các quy định về
    hợp đồng, đánh giá tác động môi trường, đánh giá môi trường chiến lược
    của các dự án đầu tư; lập Báo cáo đầu tư, đánh giá các dự án đầu tư, định
    mức chi cho các hoạt động thực hiện dự án đầu tư ….). Do vậy, việc đưa
    các hành động chính sách về tài khóa và vĩ mô vào khung chính sách của
    Chương trình này là không phù hợp. Mặc dù vậy, trong thời gian này,
    Chính phủ đã các hành động chính sách về ổn định vĩ mô không được
    đưa vào khung chính sách nhưng trong thực tế Chính phủ đã thực hiện
    nhiều biện pháp kinh tế vĩ mô nhằm kiềm chế lạm phát, ổn định kinh
    tế vĩ mô, bảo đảm an sinh xã hội như (thực hiện chính sách tiền tệ
    chặt chẽ, thận trọng; thực hiện chính sách tài khó thặt chặt, cắt giảm
    đầu tư công, giảm bôi chi nhân sách nhà nước; thúc đẩy sản xuất,
    kinh doanh, khuyến khích xuất khẩu, kiềm chế nhập siêu, sử dụng
    tiết kiệm năng lượng; tăng cường đảm bảo an sinh xã hội…). Những
    biện pháp này đã được thực hiện hiệu quả và tác động tích cực đến
ANNEX D                              184


    ổn định vĩ mô và duy trì đà tăng trưởng. Do vậy, đề nghị điều chỉnh
    lại nội dung đánh giá liên quan đến vấn đề này tại báo cáo.

-   Mục 3.8 đánh giá về việc các PD không có đủ các thông tin liên quan
    đến báo cáo hiện trạng thực hiện các hành động. Điều này cần xem xét
    lại do Chương trình PRSC có thành lập Ban Điều phối để hỗ trợ quá trình
    triển khai. Ban điều phối có trách nhiệm thu thập thông tin cần thiết phục
    vụ cho việc xây dựng, thực hiện, và đánh giá Chương trình. Theo đánh
    giá của các nhà tài trợ Ban điều phối hoạt động rất hiệu quả, đảm bảo
    đầy đủ thông tin cần thiết trong quá trình thực hiện. Ngoài ra, cơ chế chia
    sẻ thông tin của các giữa các cơ quan là rất hiệu quả. Do vậy, cần xem
    xét lại việc PD thiếu các thông tin cần thiết.

-   Mục 4.107 đánh giá về việc bỏ hành động chính sách liên quan đến ban
    hành Luật đầu tư công ra khỏi Chương trình PIR 2 là do Chính phủ có
    nhiệm vụ xây dựng và trình Quốc Hội dự thảo Luật. Thẩm quyền ban
    hành Luật là của Quốc Hội. Do vậy, việc đạt được sự đồng thuận của
    Quốc Hội nằm ngoài phạm vi và thẩm quyền của Chính phủ.

-   Mục 4.17: đề nghị trích nguồn số liệu 8,8% để tham chiếu.

-   Trong Báo cáo không có điểm nào nhận định quá trình cải cách của Việt
    Nam giảm mạnh là do gia nhập WTO. Tại mục 4.2 nêu chỉ số đánh giá
    thể chế và chính sách quốc gia (CPIA) của Việt Nam giảm nhẹ do chất
    lượng quản lý kinh tế vĩ mô và quản lý tài chính công. Do vậy, đề nghị
    xem lại nội dung thảo luận thứ 4 tại Box 4-1 của Mục 4.4.

-   Đề nghị bỏ đề xuất tại mục 6.5 về đề xuất WB nên dừng các chương trình
    hỗ trợ trong trường hợp các mục tiêu chính không đạt được, nhưng vẫn
    tiếp tục đối thoại chính sách. NHNN thấy rằng trong trường hợp này,
    WB cần phối hợp với các bên liên quan để đánh giá về nguyên nhân và
    những yếu tố tác động gây ảnh hưởng đến việc đạt mục tiêu chương trình
    để có những biện pháp khắc phục hoặc điều chỉnh cho phù hợp. Việc
    quyết định dừng chương trình cần được xem xét trên cơ sở phù hợp với
    từng trường hợp cụ thể.

Translation version of the Borrower comments

Comments on IEG’s report on budget support programs

-   It is suggested to remove the assessment on the difficulty of on-lending
    the funding of DPO programs so the uses of funding have not been
    defined. The State Bank of Vietnam found necessary to conduct specific
    assessments before making the judgment.

-   Section 3.3, 3.52 and 5.12 stated although DPOs were implemented in
    the crisis periods to prevent macro risks, the programs did not have fiscal
    macro action plans to help the Government to execute economic stimulus
    packages. This is an assistance loan for public investment policy reforms
    so the policy actions in the Programs focused on the actions of improving
    the quality and performance of public investments (e.g., the regulations
    on contracts, environmental impact assessment, strategic environmental
    assessment of investment projects; investment report design, evaluation
    of investment projects, expenditure norms for activities in investment
    projects, etc.). Thus, the incorporation of macro fiscal policy actions into
    the program framework is not appropriate. In fact, the Government has
    implemented macro- economic measures to curb inflation, macro-
    economic stability, social security assurance (e.g., executing tight and
    cautious monetary policy, tight fiscal policy; cutting public investments;
    reducing state budget deficit; boosting business and production
    activities; promoting exports; controlling net import; saving energy;
    strengthening social security assurance, etc.). The measures have been
    implemented effectively with positive impacts on macro stability and
    sustained growth momentum. In conclusion, it is suggested to refine the
    assessment in the report.

-   Section 3.8 assessed that PDs did not provide sufficient information
    relating to the current performance review report of actions. The
    assessment should be considered because PRSI program established the
    Coordination Committee to support execution. The Coordination
    Committee is responsible for collecting necessary information to
    develop, execute and evaluate the Program. According to the assessment
    of the sponsors, the Coordination Committee performs very effectively,
    ensuring to provide sufficient necessary information during execution
    process. In addition, the information sharing mechanism among agencies
    is very effective. Thus, the lack of necessary information in PD should
    be reviewed.
ANNEX D                              186



-   Section 4.107 assessed the removal of the policy action concerning the
    promulgation of the Public Investment Law out of the PIR 2 program is
    due to the fact that the Government has the task of developing and
    submitting to the National Assembly the draft law. The law promulgation
    is under the authority of the National Assembly so the approval of the
    National Assembly is beyond the scope and authority of the Government.

-   Section 4.17: it is suggested to indicate the source of the figure 8.8% for
    reference.

-   The report did not highlight that the reform process of Vietnam slowed
    dramatically due to WTO entry. The section 4.2 indicated that the
    Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) of Vietnam
    decreased slightly due to the quality of macro-economic management
    and public financial management. So it is suggested to review the
    discussion point No.4, Box 4-1 of Section 4.4.

-   It is suggested to remove the proposal in section 6.5 that WB should
    leverage support programs in case main objectives fail to achieve but
    policy dialogues still continue. The State Bank of Vietnam realized that
    in the case, WB should coordinate with stakeholders to assess reasons
    and factors affecting the achievement of program objectives for
    corrective measures or adjustment where appropriate. The decision of
    stopping the program is determined on case-by-case basis.
