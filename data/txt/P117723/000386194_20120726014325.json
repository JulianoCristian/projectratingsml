"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the First and Second Public\n            Investment Reform Development Policy Operation Project were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was low; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: an important\n            lesson learned is that it is difficult to achieve\n            significant institutional strengthening in the short time\n            frame of a development policy operation prepared for crisis\n            response. The Bank's decision to design the crisis\n            response as a thematic Development Policy Loan (DPL)\n            focusing on a high priority reform area was correct and paid\n            off in terms of garnering the attention of top policy makers\n            on this issue. There is plenty of evidence, as detailed\n            earlier, about the Government's commitment on making\n            progress on reforming the public investment system and\n            restructuring the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) sector. The\n            Bank will need to work effectively with a range of\n            stakeholders, especially in the public investment area,\n            given the decentralization of decision-making authority on\n            public investments and the challenge to Ministry of Planning\n            and Investment (MPI) in leading the reform process in this\n            decentralized environment. It was not feasible for the Bank\n            to engage more deeply with the other key stakeholders, in\n            particular the provinces, in the limited time frame of the\n            Public Investment Reform (PIR) series, but this engagement\n            will be necessary going forward with the successor Economic\n            Management and Competitiveness Credit (EMCC) operation. For\n            smooth implementation of DPLs, consideration of potential\n            time needed for the completion of triggers must take into\n            account the following factors: (i) borrower's\n            procedures for issuing legal documents and (ii) potential\n            coordination issues among borrower's agencies. The two\n            programmatic operations had a number of triggers that dealt\n            with issuance or preparation of legal documents that\n            required a considerable amount of time for the government to\n            complete the internal procedures not only within the cabinet\n            but also requires the interaction with the national assembly."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
