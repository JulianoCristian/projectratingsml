Borrower              The Socialist Republic Of Vietnam
Implementing Agency   State Bank of Vietnam (SBV)
Financing Data        IBRD Loan
                      Terms: IBRD standard terms for 25 year maturity including a 10 year
                      grace period
                      Amount: US$ 500 million
Operation Type        Single-tranche programmatic operation, the first in a series of two.
Main Policy Areas     This is a programmatic series prepared in response to a request made by
                      the government of Vietnam, in March, 2009, to provide more resources
                      to the budget in support of the stimulus package. Technical input on the
                      size and design of the stimulus was provided by the international
                      financial institutions.
                      The package has been effective in sustaining economic activity, but it
                      has also put pressure on the external balance. Since the request for
                      support was made, there was a substantial decline in the level of
                      international reserves, partly as a result of a portfolio shift towards
                      foreign currency by domestic residents.      In late October and early
                      November 2009, the government took appropriate fiscal and monetary
                      measures to address the imbalances. A less expansionary policy stance
                      can be expected going into 2010.
                      The stimulus package was partially financed through a drawdown of
                      government deposits in commercial banks, which will most probably be
                      replenished in 2010. The proposed loan will help reduce net credit to
                      government, and consequently net credit expansion, at a time when the
                      external position will still be vulnerable. The proposed loan should also
                      help boost the level of international reserves. Combined with the new,
                      less expansionary policy stance of the government, the loan should
                      contribute to market confidence.
                      The proposed program builds on the determination of the government to
                      strengthen the public investment cycle, an area where reform has lagged
                      behind. The policy matrix was prepared in consultation with the five
                      other development banks active in Vietnam. The Agence Française de
                      Développement (AFD) is expected to provide parallel finance to the
                      program based on the same policy matrix. Other development banks
                      could join for the second operation in this program.
                      The stimulus package is aimed at speeding up critically important

                         investments, but the management of public investments suffers from
                         important weaknesses, some of which became apparent during the
                         overheating phase of late 2007 and early 2008. Some of the same
                         weaknesses underlie the slow implementation of donor-funded projects,
                         including the World Bank's low disbursement rate.
                         The program is organized around four main areas which are essential to
                         strengthening the public investment project cycle:
                         ·   Project selection (competitive entry, environmental screening,
                             project approval).
                         ·   Project implementation (cost estimates, bidding rules, bidding
                             transparency, conflict of interest, dispute resolution, land
                             acquisition, environmental management).
                         ·   Financial management (reporting and control, administrative costs,
                             environmental budgets, subsidies and guarantees).
                         ·   Project oversight (project documentation, monitoring and evaluation
                             (M&E)).
                         Progress in these areas is expected to improve public investment
                         processes and strengthen country systems.
Key Outcome Indicators   A set of ten measurable indicators covering the four areas of the program
                         (project selection, project implementation, financial management and
                         project oversight) was identified. One of the main difficulties in
                         selecting appropriate indicators concerned the short time span for the
                         program, which makes it difficult to have measurable results on the
                         ground. Therefore, it is expected that progress towards meeting
                         development outcomes will be measured at completion. An effort will
                         be launched at the inception of the program to refine the baseline and the
                         targets.
Program Development      The main objective of the proposed program is to support modern
Objectives and           governance, one of the four main "pillars" of Vietnam's Socio-
Contribution to CPS      Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010.            The Country
                         Partnership Strategy (CPS) is aligned to the SEDP. Better planning
                         processes, more transparent procurement and stronger public financial
                         management, all areas covered by the proposed program, fall under the
                         modern governance pillar of SEDP.
                         Through its focus on the environmental screening and the environmental
                         management of projects, the proposed program is also expected to
                         contribute to the natural resources pillar of SEDP. Its attention to fair
                         compensation and livelihood support in the event of land acquisition
                         should also contribute to the social inclusion pillar.
                         The proposed program would be the first one to mobilize IBRD
                         resources for Vietnam. IBRD lending was not yet considered when the
                         CPS was prepared, given that all the lending program was on IDA terms
                         at the time. However, Vietnam's transition to the status of a blend
                         country is discussed in the recently completed Country Partnership
                         Strategy Progress Report.

                                               ii
Risks and Risk   Increased macroeconomic instability is one of the most important risks
Mitigation       facing the proposed program. So far, the government has successfully
                 navigated through both the massive capital inflows of late 2007-early
                 2008 and the current global crisis. The stimulus package has contributed
                 to a strong recovery in 2009. However, external vulnerability has
                 increased as imports grow again, whereas long-term inflows are still
                 below trend and residents have restructured their portfolios towards
                 foreign-denominated assets.
                 This risk is being addressed through a series of corrective measures
                 being adopted by the government since late October 2009. These
                 measures include the tightening of monetary policy, including a road
                 map to end the interest rate subsidy schemes adopted as part of the
                 stimulus package. In addition, the government is taking steps towards a
                 greater flexibility of the interest rate. The corrective measures also
                 include a smaller budget deficit in 2010 than in 2009. While the deficit
                 is higher than in the years preceding the global crisis, it is expected to
                 decline in subsequent years.
                 There is also a risk that the policy actions supported by the program will
                 not be sufficient to make a substantial difference in the quality of public
                 investments in Vietnam. The short time frame of the program,
                 associated with the need to support the stimulus package, conflicts with
                 the slowness of the consensual approach to economic reform underlying
                 policy making in Vietnam. In particular, it is difficult to introduce
                 fundamental changes in areas where substantive differences of views
                 remain, such as public procurement.
                 To address this risk, the proposed program builds on the lessons learned
                 from Vietnam's long-standing experience with policy lending. One of
                 those lessons is the importance of "lock-in reforms" around which other
                 actions fall in place. Building on that precedent, the program is
                 anchored around two critically important laws: on the amendment of
                 investment-related laws (a prior action under the first operation) and on
                 public investment (a trigger for the second operation). In addition, the
                 program is designed so as to achieve the desired outcomes through
                 measures that work around existing institutional obstacles.
                 Finally, there is a risk that measures will be adopted as agreed, but the
                 specifics will be such that the impact of those measures on the efficiency
                 and transparency of public investments could be diluted.
                 This risk is to some extent addressed by the quality of the ongoing
                 technical assistance work provided by the six development banks in
                 several of the areas covered by the proposed program, and by the World
                 Bank and other donors in relation to public financial management. This
                 long-term engagement predates the proposed program. In parallel, the
                 importance of the proposed program to sustain the economic recovery
                 has increased the attention of senior leadership to the reforms covered by
                 the proposed program.

                                    I.       INTRODUCTION


1.       The proposed public investment reform program is designed to assist the government of
Vietnam to strengthen the selection, preparation, implementation and supervision of public
investment projects. While much progress has been made over the last decade in the upgrading of
public financial management in relation to recurrent expenditures, there are still important weaknesses
in the management of investment projects. Those weaknesses take a toll on economic efficiency in a
country where total investment accounted for 41.3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in
2008, and consolidated public sector investment for 12.6 percent. An increased focus on the quality of
growth, in addition to its quantity, is warranted. The recent international macroeconomic turbulence
has dramatically exposed the weaknesses of public investment in Vietnam. Distorted price signals
resulted in capital expenditures going to sectors experiencing asset price bubbles, thus amplifying
macroeconomic fluctuations. Insufficiently developed monitoring mechanisms also made it difficult
for the government to adjust investment volumes so that they would play a more counter-cyclical role.
2.       The weaknesses of the public investment cycle are partly the result of inherited
institutional constraints. During the command and control period, investments by government but
also by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) used to be managed by the Ministry of Planning and
Investment (MPI). Earlier in the transition to a market economy, MPI used to compile proposals from
line ministries, provincial governments and SOEs and arbitrate among competing demands. This "ask
and give" mechanism resulted in economic inefficiency and fiduciary vulnerability. Gradually, the
separation between government and SOE investments became clearer, and responsibilities for public
investment projects were delegated to lower levels of government. The Law on the State Budget,
which became effective in 2004, pushed decentralization further by leading to the adoption of
progressive budget allocation norms, transferring more resources for public investments to poorer
provinces. However, the delegation of responsibilities to lower levels of government has not been
accompanied by a broader framework to ensure the coherence of public investment plans and the
quality of individual projects.
3.      The weaknesses of the public investment cycle underscore the need to upgrade country
systems to international standards. Important gaps remain in areas such as environmental screening
and environmental management, project preparation and appraisal, procurement, public financial
management, the regulatory framework for private participation in infrastructure, and monitoring and
evaluation. These gaps are well diagnosed by now, thanks to a long-term engagement of the World
Bank and other donors with government in relation to planning processes, public financial
management, project implementation and safeguards work. Substantial gaps between country systems
and international standards affect not only the efficiency of budget-funded public investments but also
the speed of implementation of donor-funded projects. The use of parallel systems by donors, for
instance in relation to procurement, results in considerable delays in project implementation. Officials
in line ministries, provincial governments and project management units (PMUs) are reluctant to
deviate from official procedures, for fear of sanctions. This cautious behavior is associated with
consistently low disbursement rates for the development banks operating in Vietnam, thus reducing
the benefits of Official Development Assistance (ODA) support.
4.     In spite of these shortcomings, public investments in Vietnam make an important
contribution towards development outcomes. An Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assessment
of 34 projects completed projects which had involved World Bank support rated all of them as

                                                   1
satisfactory or moderately satisfactory. The net disconnect between ratings in final Implementation
Summary Reports and the corresponding Implementation Completion Reports was zero. This
performance in terms of development outcomes remains unsurpassed in the Bank, but it is in sharp
contrast with the relatively poor performance in terms of project implementation and the low portfolio
disbursement rates. Impact on the ground could be further enhanced and achieved more quickly if
improvements were made to public investment processes in Vietnam.
5.      The proposed program supports a series of policy measures which are expected to
strengthen the public investment cycle in Vietnam. The program aims for improvement across all
public investment projects, regardless of their source of funding. The measures in it have been
extensively discussed with government and an agreement has been reached on their content and time
line. This policy dialogue builds on analytical work conducted by the World Bank and other donors in
relation to the efficiency and financing of capital accumulation in Vietnam (see Capital Matters,
Vietnam Development Report 2009, World Bank, 2008), public financial management (see Country
Financial Accountability Assessment, World Bank, 2009) and harmonization in the spirit of the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (see Mid-Term Review on Implementation of Paris Declaration and
Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness, PGAE's Report, 2008). Other development banks, and
especially the Agence Française de Développement, have been involved in the policy dialogue.
6.      The proposed operation, Public Investment Reform Development Policy Loan 1, is the first in
a programmatic series of two. Each operation is for US$ 500 million on IBRD terms. The Agence
Française de Développement is expected to co-finance the program, contributing 100 million Euro to
the proposed operation. Other development banks have expressed their willingness to provide parallel
financing for the proposed program, although the timing and amount of their support is yet to be
determined.
7.       The program is consistent with the objectives of the CPS for the period 2007-2011.
Under its first pillar (improved business environment) one of the objectives is the efficient and reliable
provision of infrastructure services. In Vietnam, infrastructure is still largely dependent on public
investment. Under the fourth pillar (strengthened governance) objectives include improved
effectiveness of public resources management and reduced corruption. Together with other
development policy operations already approved or in preparation, the proposed program
complements the series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) which is the primary vehicle
for the policy dialogue in Vietnam.
8.      An equally important benefit of this operation is that it will quickly provide resources to
the government to finance its ongoing stimulus package. This package was adopted in stages, with
a substantial increase in the budget plan for 2009 decided by the National Assembly in November
2008, and a series of additional measures approved in the early months of 2009. The budget plan for
2009 foresaw the issuance of a new sovereign bond, for roughly US$ 1 billion. So far, due to the
increase in country spreads as a result of the global financial crisis, the government has not resorted to
this source of finance. Meanwhile, the additional measures of early 2009 widened the financing gap
even further. The stimulus package was effective in supporting economic activity, even if its
implementation could have been better executed.
9.      With the provision of this loan, the financing gap for 2009 will be fully filled. It should be
noted, however, that financing the 2009 budget deficit will also involve a drawdown of government
deposits in the banking system. This drawdown is possible because the Vietnamese government has
unusually large cash holdings. In the absence of centralized cash management, however, those
holdings will need to be rebuilt. The IMF estimates the drawdown for the year as a whole to be in the
order of US$ 2.0 billion, or US$ 1.5 billion more than in 2008. The possibility for the government to
rely on this temporary source of finance means that even if the proposed program loan does not

                                                    2
disburse this calendar year, the government has adequate finance available to cover the deficit.
Provided that the loan (and associated co-financing by AFD) is approved, the government can rely on
its cash holdings to temporarily cover any delay in disbursement within prudent limits.
10.      Since the stimulus package was adopted, Vietnam's external position has weakened. The
economic slowdown of 2009 brought the external current account deficit down from around US$ 10.7
billion last year, to an expected US$ 7.4 billion this year, mainly through a dramatic contraction in
imports. However, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows and remittances declined, official
development aid has not increased enough to offset this decline, and short term private capital flows
have been volatile. International reserves, which had reached US$ 23.0 billion by end-2008, were
down to US$ 16.5 billion by August 2009, or less than three months of imports. Most of the decline
took place between May and July, when SBV intervened in the exchange rate market to stabilize the
currency. The most plausible explanation for the larger demand for dollars is that the market expects a
faster devaluation of the dong. Speculation in the domestic market for gold has also been a factor in
the recent pressure on the dong.
11.      To address the enhanced macroeconomic risk, the government has rapidly rebalanced its
policy stance. At the beginning of 2009, sustaining growth was the main objective, but as the end of
the year approaches, more prominence is being given to ensuring stability. Since late October 2009
the government has adopted a series of measures that should lead to a substantial tightening of
monetary policy and a more modest fiscal deficit in 2010. Steps are being taken towards increasing
interest rate flexibility, although it will take time for them to become effective as they involve
changing laws. Except for their greater emphasis on administrative tools and moral suasion over
market-based mechanisms, the measures adopted are roughly in line with the recommendations made
by the international financial institutions during October 2009. Those recommendations were
articulated in a letter sent by the World Bank to the Prime Minister and in the Concluding Statement of
a 2009 Staff Visit by the Fund.
12.      The assessment of Bank staff is that the macroeconomic policy framework is sustainable
over the medium term, hence adequate for the provision of Development Policy Lending. At the
beginning of 2009, Vietnam experienced a substantial decline in growth rates, resulting from the
combination of its own stabilization efforts in 2008 and the subsequent global financial crisis. A
timely policy response, under the form of a sizeable stimulus package, succeeded in reversing the
trend and leading to a recovery in economic activity (see Table 1 for key indicators). However, the
expansionary stance resulted in a widening of the current account deficit, whose impact on
international reserves was amplified by a portfolio restructuring by residents towards foreign-
denominated assets. Since late October 2009, the government has taken a series of measures to
address the emerging external vulnerabilities (the main measures are listed in Box 1). The growth
target for the year 2010 was set at 6.5, below the expected rate for the last quarter of 2009, whereas the
inflation rate should not exceed 7 percent. Consistent with these objectives, the budget plan for 2010
includes a significant fiscal adjustment. The official budget deficit was capped by the National
Assembly at 6.2 percent of GDP. Depending on the assumptions, this target is equivalent to a
reduction of the overall budget deficit (including off-budget outlays) ranging from 2.2 to 3.6
percentage points of GDP, compared to 2009. The National Assembly also instructed government to
aim for a lower deficit in outer years, and to ask for the guidance of its Standing Committee in case
revenue exceeds the current forecast, making it clear that saving any windfall was the preferred option.
Consistent with this fiscal adjustment, the government also adopted a tighter monetary stance. The
target for credit growth for the rest of 2009 is below 1 percent per month, in a season where money
demand surges. For 2010, credit growth should not exceed 25 percent, which is one of the lowest
targets in a decade (the government's commitment to these orientations is articulated in the Letter of
Development Policy). The interest rate subsidy scheme was extended, but with a reduction in its
scope and in the amount of the subsidy. World Bank staff do not expect this extension to result in

                                                    3
substantial credit growth. Steps were also undertaken to increase interest rate flexibility, but they will
take time to materialize as they involve changing laws. The less expansionary fiscal stance and the
tightening of liquidity should ease market pressures on the exchange rate. With the decline in
international reserves mainly reflecting a portfolio reallocation by residents, rather than genuine short-
term capital outflows, addressing the balance of payments deficit should be easier. A tighter monetary
stance should discourage residents from converting more of their dong-denominated portfolio holdings
into dollars and actually stimulate the sale of assets denominated in foreign currency. The World
Bank and the Fund concur in their diagnosis of the macroeconomic situation and the appropriate
policy response, as articulated in the Fund's Letter of Assessment for this operation, prepared before
the recent set of adjustment measures. Both the World Bank and the Fund recognize the less
expansionary stance implied by those measures. On the other hand, the Fund points out that the use of
administrative measures to tighten monetary policy in the absence of interest rate adjustments could
lead to growth disruption, and may fail to signal clearly enough the direction of monetary policy.



                                  II.      COUNTRY CONTEXT


INVESTMENT SCALE AND EFFICIENCY
13.      Vietnam's rapid economic growth has been partly sustained on massive capital
accumulation. By 2007, before the onset of macroeconomic turbulence, Vietnam was investing VND
532.1 trillion per year, more than three times as much as in 2001, when economic reforms accelerated.
Only a fraction of this increase can be attributed to capital goods being more expensive. The growth
in investment has been faster in the private sector than in the state sector, with the strongest
performance (both in absolute and in relative terms) corresponding to the domestic private sector. As
a result, the fraction of total investment contributed by different stakeholders has changed dramatically
since the acceleration of economic reforms. In 2001, the state sector accounted for almost 60 percent
of total capital accumulation in Vietnam, with the rest divided roughly equally between FDI
companies and the domestic private sector. By 2008, it was the private sector which accounted for 60
percent, with more than half of the amount contributed by domestic enterprises (Figure 1).
14.      In light of this unusually high level of capital accumulation, a critical question is whether
resources are being invested efficiently. Studies based on individual records from enterprise surveys
show that total factor productivity at the enterprise level is increasing rapidly, which means that not all
economic growth in Vietnam comes from increases in the volume of capital or the size of labor force
(see Business, Vietnam Development Report 2006, World Bank, 2005). But regardless of the
magnitude of total factor productivity gains, the question is whether the additional capital is being
allocated to the "right" sectors, activities and projects. Because market mechanisms are still being
developed in Vietnam, and public investment processes are only partially modernized, this is not a
hypothetical concern. The Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR), in spite of its well-known
limitations, provides some evidence in this respect. The ICOR has increased substantially in Vietnam
in recent years, from 4.5 in 2001 to 7.1 in 2008. Some increase in the ICOR can be expected as the
capital stock of the economy expands and the most urgent gaps are addressed. However, the increase
seems too high to be due to the mere effect of a relative abundance of capital; especially because
infrastructure needs remain substantial in Vietnam.

15.     Improving the efficiency of public investment has been a key objective in the reform
agenda of the government of Vietnam. This is partly due to the dominant view that the public sector
should be the "backbone of the economy", despite the acceptance that it is bound to account for a
declining share of total investment as the private sector develops. However, there is growing
awareness of the gap between this efficiency objective and reality on the ground. The Resolution
56/2006/QH11 of the National Assembly, approving the SEDP 2006-10, identified the strengthening
of public investment management as one of the key tasks for the five-year period. The SEDP 2006-10
noted that "investment from state budget and SOEs remained fragmented, with leakage and low
efficiency". In addition, it identified the slow implementation of the SOE reform agenda as one of the
main causes for low investment efficiency. The macroeconomic turbulence of the last two years
exposed even more clearly the weaknesses of public investment processes in Vietnam, giving new
impetus to the reform agenda supported by the proposed program.


RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
16.      The global financial crisis led to a sharp slowdown of economic growth in Vietnam. The
international prices of commodities were on a declining trend since the third quarter of 2008, export
orders for garments and other industrial products collapsed in the fourth quarter, and a slowdown in
manufacturing became noticeable. The impact was severe in the first quarter of 2009, when GDP
increased by 3.1 percent compared to the same period in 2008. This is more than 4 percentage points
below potential (the average for first quarter growth over the last few years has been 7.2 percent). The
World Bank forecasts a growth rate of 5.5 percent for the year 2009 as a whole, more than 2
percentage points below potential (Table 1).
17.      The global financial crisis was only the last stroke in a series of major external shocks.
In late 2007 and early 2008, in the aftermath of its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Vietnam had been confronted with massive capital inflows. Attempts to sterilize these inflows were
not able to prevent a boom in banking credit, an acceleration of inflation, a ballooning trade deficit and
asset price bubbles. The latter were amplified by sizeable infrastructure investments by central and
provincial governments. The investment decisions of large SOEs and state-owned Economic Groups,
which took advantage of their access to finance to diversify into booming sectors such as real estate


                                                                                               5
and securities, contributed to fanning the flames. The impact of overheating was further aggravated by
the international fuel and oil price crisis of early 2008.

18.      Assessing the social impact of the growth slowdown is difficult in the absence of a reliable
and timely labor force survey. But there is abundant evidence of increased hardship during the first
half of 2009, especially in industrial parks and in handicraft villages. Overall, it appears that
underemployment has been more common than open unemployment. There are also disparities across
various segments of the labor market and a clear heterogeneity of impacts across enterprises and
provinces. The market for semi-skilled and skilled workers recovered well after the Lunar New Year.
The overall picture is altogether different in the industrial parks that serve as the platform for a large
share of manufacturing exports, where the work force is generally less skilled. A survey of such parks
reveals that a significant minority of enterprises was adversely hit.


                                                         6
19.     The biggest diversity of social impacts was across individual workers and households. Rapid
impact assessments relying on structured focus group discussions with workers suggest that major
adverse effects, such as falling into poverty, facing food shortages, having to pull children out of
school, having to sell land, or becoming homeless, were relatively uncommon. But there were
numerous job losses, frequent reductions in working hours and wages, reduced remittances, and a shift
towards informality. While job losses were widespread in industrial parks in late 2008 and early 2009,
few took the form of open layoffs. Non-renewals of contracts and incentives for voluntary departures
were more common. Job losses were frequent among seasonal workers, and among those on short-
term contracts.


THE STIMULUS PACKAGE
20.      A determined policy reaction succeeded in stabilizing the economy in the aftermath of
the overheating and in sustaining economic activity more recently. In March 2008, the
government adopted the "eight groups of measures" to bring inflation down and reduce the trade
deficit to manageable levels. This package combined the tightening of banking credit, enhanced
supervision of vulnerable banks, a partial discontinuation of public investment projects, some (modest)
cuts in recurrent government expenditures, and a more active management of trade policy. The
package did not include abandoning the passive crawling peg characterizing exchange rate policy for
years, but rather broadening the flotation band. A much-feared balance of payments crisis did not take
place. By September 2008, it became clear that this policy response was working.
21.      Shortly after, the government had to change gears from stabilization to stimulus. The
prices of key commodities exported by Vietnam were rapidly falling by then, as were export orders for
manufactured products. In November 2008, "five groups of measures" aimed at supporting economic
activity were announced. This time the package included cuts and delays in tax payments, especially
for Corporate Income Tax and Value Added Tax, and for small and medium enterprises. It also
included cash transfers to poor households on the occasion of the Lunar New Year, when migrant
workers typically return to their hometowns. Other measures followed in February 2009, including a
short-term interest rate subsidy scheme that was used to re-finance enterprise debts contracted in very
onerous terms during the stabilization period. This scheme helped in keeping credit flowing to the
economy, and contained distress in the corporate sector. On the other hand, the continuation of this
scheme beyond the disinflation phase and its extension to capital investments lacks a sound economic
justification.
22.      More recently, in June 2009, a series of additional stimulus measures was approved by
the National Assembly. Their focus was to speed up critically important public investments,
especially in energy and transport. Infrastructure bottlenecks remain an important obstacle to the long-
term development of the Vietnamese economy. Stimulating domestic demand is also important to
offset, at least partially, the decline in world demand. Over the first ten months of 2009, Vietnamese
exports declined by 13.8 percent compared to 2008. This is less than in most other developing
countries, but could make 2009 the first year with negative export growth since the beginning of
Vietnam's economic reforms. And the decline would be larger if the sizeable gold exports of early
2009 are not included. An even more dramatic decline in imports, by 21.7 percent in the first ten
months of 2009, succeeded in reducing the trade deficit. As a result, the current account deficit is
projected to be about 7.9 percent of GDP in 2009, down from 11.9 percent in 2008. The actual level
could be higher if the economy consolidates its current recovery. The projected current account deficit
should be manageable, but international reserves are expected to decline in 2009 reversing the recent
trend of slow accumulation.

23.     The succession of policy announcements on stimulus measures raised concerns in the
market about the overall implications for the budget and the balance of payments. Concerns
were amplified by shortcomings in communication. Some gaps with international practice remain in
the presentation of budget data, and there are also important gaps between budget plans and budget
execution. The evolving nature of some of the stimulus measures, some of which were led by
ministries and agencies with relatively little coordination with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), also
added uncertainty regarding the actual cost of the measures, and who would bear it in the short term.
The cost of some of the measures was over-estimated, as was the share of the cost that would fall on
the budget. Together with some double counting this resulted in some implausibly large figures for
the overall size of the package. More recently, however, MOF has brought some clarity on the
implementation of some of the measures in the package, and has also specified which ones need to be
financed out of the budget plan of 2009 and for which ones additional resources will be mobilized. In
estimating the size of the stimulus package it is also important to take into account additional lending,
compared to previous years, by the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB) (Table 2).

24.      The stimulus package of 2009 came on top of an already expansionary budget, resulting
in an overall budget deficit substantially above those of previous years. In addition to the explicit
measures adopted to stimulate economic activity, the fall in oil prices and the slowdown in economic
activity resulted in a large decline in government revenue. This decline was partially offset in the
second half of the year, as both international commodity prices and domestic economic activity

                                                             8
became more buoyant. There is also a systematic bias towards underestimating government revenue.
However, in spite of these caveats, an overall budget deficit of 9.7 percent of GDP could be expected
for the year as a whole, raising concerns about available finance (Table 3). The section below
addresses this issue.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY AND THE FINANCING GAP
25.     Vietnam has fiscal space to accommodate the announced stimulus package. A debt
sustainability analysis completed after the announcement of the 2009 budget plan suggests that
Vietnam's external debt position is robust. The total public external debt is estimated to stand at 25
percent of GDP (30 percent including the private sector) at the end of 2008. With nearly two-thirds of
this debt contracted on highly concessional terms, the ratio of debt service to exports is projected to
remain at or below 5 percent in the coming years. The baseline scenario does not include the
increased fiscal deficit for financing the stimulus package, but the stress tests do consider a substantial
expansion of debt-creating flows and show that Vietnam's debt is largely sustainable in the long run.
A large increase in fiscal deficit financed by non-concessional loans and a large (30 percent) and
sustained depreciation of the dong were identified as main risks to debt sustainability. Both scenarios
are considered unlikely. Total public debt also remains manageable, as the bulk of domestic debt is
issued long-term. Before the latest announcements on the stimulus package, it was expected to reach a
maximum of 50.7 percent of GDP by 2012.



                                                    9
26.      The main constraint to financing the budget deficit stems from availability of debt
financing rather than from medium-term debt sustainability. The budget plan foresaw the
issuance of a second sovereign bond in international capital markets, which is now unlikely given the
current global context. Bond issuances in the domestic market are also facing difficulties, as the
interest rate offered by the authorities is below market expectations. On the positive side, donors
substantially scaled up their budget support operations. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
provided US$ 500 million in non-concessional terms and added US$ 75 million to its support to PRSC
operations. Japan also contributed US$ 500 million to finance the stimulus package and is actively
working towards a new budget support operation addressing climate change adaptation that could be
close to US$ 200 million. The World Bank has so far increased the size of its regular budget support
operations by US$ 250 million.
27.     In spite of the additional ODA resources, the financing of the 2009 budget deficit also
involves a substantial drawdown in government deposits in the banking system. Provided that the
proposed loan (and associated co-financing by AFD) is approved, the government can rely on its cash
holdings to temporarily cover any delay in disbursement within prudent limits. However, in the
absence of centralized cash management, government will most probably replenish its deposits. The
proposed loan would help ease macroeconomic risks in early 2010, by reducing net credit to
government and consequently total credit expansion, at a time when the external position will still be
vulnerable.


EXTERNAL VULNERABILITY AND THE BANKING SECTOR
28.      External vulnerability has also increased during 2009. The global crisis has led to
decrease in the volume of FDI inflows and remittances, whereas portfolio investment flows by
foreigners have been volatile over the last two years (Table 4). Portfolio decisions by residents also
have an impact on the balance of payments, because of the dollarization of the economy and the large
stock of foreign currency circulating outside the banking sector. In the first half of 2009, these
portfolio decisions have been affected by the expectation that the actual devaluation of the dong will
be slightly faster than announced by the government. A reallocation of the portfolio of domestic
investors towards assets denominated in foreign currency is presumably at the roots of the large
"errors and omissions" in the balance of payments during the first three quarters of 2009. For the year
as a whole, errors and omissions could reach US$ 9.4 billion (negative).
29.      The stimulus program, while effective at boosting economic activity, has contributed to
increased external vulnerability. Rapid credit growth (32 percent year-to-date in September),
together with an expansionary fiscal policy, contributed to the return of a large current account deficit.
The overvaluation of the Vietnamese dong appears to be minor. But partial information on the actual
level of the overall budget deficit and of international reserves, combined with a larger demand of
foreign exchange by importers, have added to the uncertainty. These developments have resulted in
significant depreciation pressures on the exchange rate, with the dong trading at the weaker end of the
band for an extended period and the spread between interbank and parallel exchange rates widening to
4 percent. Access to foreign exchange has been difficult, especially between May and July of this
year, imposing significant costs on enterprises. In the first nine months of 2009, gross international
reserves declined by US$ 6.5 billion, to US$ 16.5 billion.
30.     The succession of asset price bubbles, monetary tightening and growth slowdown had an
adverse impact on the banking sector. The real estate bubble of end-2007, and its subsequent
bursting in early 2008, made it difficult for several commercial banks to recover their loans. The rapid
deceleration of inflation in late 2008, at a time when interest rates were still very high, substantially
increased the debt service burden faced by enterprises. More recently, the loosening of monetary

                                                   10
policy as part of the stimulus program, combined with the weak orders faced by many enterprises,
might also have resulted in the deterioration of bank portfolios. Quantitative indicators (based on days
in arrears) suggest that the fraction of non-performing loans (NPLs) has increased as a result of all
these developments. Qualitative indicators, based on borrower risk, suggest a higher level of NPLs
but those indicators are highly sensitive to assumptions. The increase in the share of NPLs comes
after several years during which the efforts by SOCBs to clean up their portfolios in preparation for
equitization had resulted in an overall improvement in the quality of lending.

31.     Despite its increased vulnerability, the banking sector of Vietnam has navigated the
recent macroeconomic turbulence without facing crises. In 2008 the profitability of banks was
generally good, reflecting relatively low credit costs and a strong growth in the volume of lending.
Profitability was also boosted by sizeable capital gains on government bonds, which many banks
purchased when foreign investors fled Vietnam in the first half of 2008, at a time when interest rates
were high. These capital gains offset the low net interest rate margins, resulting from the current cap

                                                  11
on lending rates. So far, profit figures reported by listed banks for 2009 remain satisfactory. The
relatively good health of the banking system is partly the result of an active stance by monetary
authorities. During the stabilization phase, when the bursting of the real estate bubble and high
interest rates raised concerns about the situation of smaller banks, the SBV upgraded its supervision
efforts. Subsequently, the first phase of the interest rate subsidy scheme adopted as part of the
stimulus program supported a rapid refinancing of enterprise debts. In parallel, SBV raised minimum
capital requirements. By the end of 2008 all commercial banks, including the nine small joint stock
banks that seemed most vulnerable had met the new requirements. This process continues, with the
minimum charter capital set at 3 trillion dong by end 2010. Banks which fail to meet this requirement
will be forced to merge with other larger banks, or will have their business licenses revoked.


AN ADJUSTED MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
32.      These developments called for a rapid adjustment to the macroeconomic framework,
which the government did as the preparation of the proposed program was being completed.
The main elements of the new framework were decided by the Cabinet meeting of late October 2009,
and in the National Assembly Session of November 2009, and complemented by administrative
measures and moral suasion (see Box 1). The main components of the new framework can be grouped
in three areas. First, an approach to phase out the interest rate subsidy scheme has been articulated,
administrative measures are being adopted to tighten liquidity, and tighter targets for credit growth
have been set for 2010. Second, consistent with the need to allow an upward adjustment of interest
rates, concrete steps towards abolishing the current cap on lending rates have been undertaken. And
third, a tighter budgetary stance has been endorsed by the National Assembly. These policy decisions
and administrative measures are roughly in line with the recommendations of the international
financial institutions, except for their greater reliance on administrative measures.
33.     The new monetary stance was endorsed by the monthly cabinet meeting held at the end
of October 2009 and reflected in the monetary plan of early November. The resolution of the
Cabinet meeting authorized SBV to prepare a new monetary plan in line with the new orientations,
including the decision made by the National Assembly that the inflation rate should not exceed 7
percent in 2010. The plan includes a target of 35 to 36 percent for credit growth in 2009, and 25.5 to
26.5 percent for the growth of total liquidity. Meeting the former target will require that total banking
credit be kept roughly at its current level for the rest of 2009. The SBV had already announced a
tightening in liquidity available to commercial banks in end-October. Shortly after it banned bank
lending under negotiable interest rates for equity, real estate and financial investments in mid-
November. The monetary plan foresees a growth rate of about 25 percent for credit total liquidity in
2010. This target is among the lowest in a decade.
34.      The interest rate subsidy schemes are extended beyond their initial termination date, but
this extension will not add much to credit growth. The Cabinet meeting of late October 2009
instructed the SBV to review the scheme, with the objective of stabilizing the economy, narrowing the
number of beneficiaries, and reducing the subsidy component. The interest rate subsidy scheme for
investments will be extended until end-2010, but accumulated lending under this scheme since
inception represents only 2.8 percent of total credit. While the scheme is a potential source of
distortions, tight eligibility conditions limit its impact. The interest rate subsidy scheme for working
capital will be extended until March 2010. The subsidy component will be reduced from 4 percentage
points to 2, and only farmers and small and medium enterprises will be eligible to apply during the
additional three months. However, most of the borrowing under the interest rate schemes actually
took place between April and June 2009. Additional lending in recent months has come down to a
trickle (Figure 2). With the number of beneficiaries being reduced from January 2010 onwards, this
trend is unlikely to be reversed. The cost of the two subsidy schemes is expected to reach VND 9.8 by

                                                   12
end-2009. Based on current trends, the accumulated cost of the two schemes may reach VND 12.2
trillion by end-2010. Even if all subsidized loans for working capital where renewed when reaching
maturity, the accumulated cost may not reach the initial authorization of VND 17 trillion, in spite of
the extensions recently decided.




                                Box 1. A Tighter Fiscal and Monetary Stance

In parallel with the finalization of the proposed program, a series of policy actions and administrative measures
were taken by the government to tighten the monetary and fiscal stance, thus helping to mitigate the
macroeconomic risks faced by the Vietnamese economy:
   ·   October 24-26. The SBV convened meetings of all commercial banks, credit institutions and financial
       institutions operating in the South and the North of the country respectively. At these meetings, the
       Governor made the following announcements: i) until the end of 2009 the SBV will not inject liquidity
       through the interbank market "as normal", ii) banks in need of liquidity can sell foreign exchange to the
       SBV, iii) if small banks face a shortage of liquidity, SBV will provide it but will send a small team to
       supervise them, and iv) banks are not allowed to extend loans from funds borrowed in the interbank
       market. A summary of these announcements was posted on the SBV website.
   ·   November 6. The National Assembly passed the Resolution of Socio-Economic Development Plan for
       2010, setting a growth target of 6.5 percent for GDP (below the expected level for the fourth quarter of
       2009) and an inflation target of no more than 7 percent.
   ·   November 6. Following up on the Cabinet meeting of late October, 2009, the SBV approved an internal
       document on Solutions and Policy Measures to Conduct the Monetary and Credit Policy to 2010. The
       document sets the target for the growth rate of total liquidity in 2009 at about 25.5 to 26.5 percent, and
       for the growth rate of total credit at about 35 to 36 percent. The document also sets the target for both the
       growth rate of total liquidity and the growth rate of total credit in 2010 at about 25 percent.
   ·   November 9. An administrative request was sent by SBV to selected Economic Groups to report all
       their revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currency. The information is due to SBV in late
       November, 2009.
   ·   November 11. The National Assembly passed the Resolution on State Budget Bill for 2010, setting the
       limit for the official budget deficit in 2010 at 6.2 percent of GDP, compared to 6.5 percent proposed by
       the government.
   ·   November 11. The resolution of the Cabinet meeting of late October, 2009, ended most of the tax breaks
       and deferrals approved as part of the 2009 stimulus package. The only exception concerns a delay in
       payments of Corporate Income Tax for small and medium enterprises, labor-intensive and export-
       oriented companies, but only for the first quarter of 2010.
   ·   November 12. The SBV convened a high-level meeting with the directors of the five SOCBs to discuss
       credit growth targets, management of liquidity, and foreign exchange matters, consistent with the new
       monetary stance.
   ·   November 13. The SBV issued a decision stating that credit institutions are not allowed to provide loans
       with negotiable rates to invest in real estate, financial assets (gold, foreign currencies, securities and
       others) and operations related to production and business.
   ·   November 16. The official meeting of the National Assembly discussed the draft laws on the State Bank
       of Vietnam and on Credit Institutions, which both contain articles aimed at effectively removing the cap
       on lending rates.




                                                       13
35.      With a tighter monetary stance ahead, the government has indicated that the current
cap on lending rates will also be removed. The cap was introduced in 2008 as a tool to address the
overheating of the economy. The cap was set at 150 percent of the VND denominated base rate,
which was to be promulgated on a monthly basis by the SBV. This decision replaced the previous
practice on allowing negotiated interest rates for commercial lending activities. To a certain extent,
this mechanism was effective at containing the economic overheating of late 2007 and early 2008.
But as the economy entered a disinflation phase, and the policy rate was lowered to boost economic
activity, interest rate margins declined. The base rate had peaked at 14 percent in June 2008, at which
point the lending rate was capped at 21 percent. With the base rate at 7 percent at present, the cap is
10.5 percent and the interest rate margin is reduced by half compared to barely one year ago. From
this point of view, the interest rate subsidy scheme was only a second-best solution.

36.      To address this problem, the SBV has included appropriate provisions in the two key
banking laws to be passed in May 2010. Article 15 in the draft Law on the State Bank of Vietnam
and article 91 in the draft Law on Credit Institutions effectively abolish the cap on lending rates. The
SBV has already obtained legal opinion on this approach, and the response from Ministry of Justice
was favorable. In recent National Assembly discussions, the majority of the National Assembly
members were supportive of the drafts of these laws, which allow the SBV to use refinancing rate and
other rates, instead of the base rate, as monetary policy instruments. The draft Law on Credit
Institutions also includes a provision that in case of market disorders or disruptions, the SBV will have
the power to stipulate an interest rate management mechanism. However, these two laws would only
become effective in January 2011, implying that they would not have an immediate impact on
monetary policy. The tightening of liquidity implied by the adjusted macroeconomic framework may
therefore require an increase of the base rate.


                                                               14
37.      Consistent with the tighter monetary stance of SBV, several decisions were made
involving substantial fiscal consolidation in 2010. A resolution of the Cabinet meeting of late
October, 2009 effectively ended most of the tax breaks and deferrals approved as part of the 2009
stimulus package. The only exception concerns a delay in payments of Corporate Income Tax for
small and medium enterprises, labor-intensive and export-oriented companies, but only for the first
quarter of 2010. The National Assembly authorized a budget deficit not exceeding 6.2 percent of
GDP, compared to the 6.5 percent proposed by the executive. The calculation of the official budget
deficit in Vietnam deviates from standard international practice in three ways. First, debt amortization
is counted as expenditure, rather than as a financing item. In 2010, debt amortization is projected at
2.2 percent of GDP. Second, so called "off budget" expenditures managed by MOF need to be added
up. These expenditures are "off budget" only by name, as they are also approved by the National
Assembly and subject to the same financial management rules as "on budget expenditures". Finally,
for their estimate of Vietnam budget deficit, the international financial institutions also include as part
of government expenditures on-lending of ODA resources and lending by the Vietnam Development
Bank (VDB).
38.     The Bank and the IMF concur in their assessment that the fiscal stance in 2010 will be
tighter than in 2009. The expected budget deficit varies depending on assumptions about tax revenue
and off-budget expenditures. The two international financial institutions rely on slightly different
assumptions on the specifics, but the overall story line is the same in both cases. For 2010, the Bank
estimates an overall budget deficit of 6.2 percent of GDP, compared to 9.7 percent in 2009 (Table 3).
The corresponding figures in the case of the Fund are 6.6 and 8.9 percent. Fiscal adjustment could
therefore be in the range of 2.3 to 3.6 percentage points of GDP.
39.      Looking forward, it is expected that the budget deficit will be further consolidated, in
line with the traditional budgetary prudence of the government of Vietnam. Debt sustainability
assessments have consistently shown moderate indebtedness levels, especially taking into account the
fact that a large fraction of public debt is in concessional terms. The resolution of the National
Assembly capping the official budget deficit for 2010 at 6.2 percent of GDP also instructs the
government to aim at lower deficits in the coming years. It requires that budget advances be cleared
by fiscal year end or be deducted in the budget of the following year. In the case of an unexpected
increase in government revenue, and especially in oil-related revenue, the government is requested to
report to the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, which should give priority to reducing the
budget deficit. As preparation for the next operation in the proposed program starts, a preliminary
fiscal plan for the next five-year cycle will become available. This framework will allow a careful
assessment of the medium-term framework.


                            III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


OVERALL STRATEGY
40.     Enormous progress has been made in developing Vietnam's infrastructure over the last
few years, but with basic facilities largely in place by now the quality of investments becomes
more important. Over a relatively short period of time there have been significant increases in the
length of paved roads, the number of telephone lines, port capacity and power supply. There is also
commendable progress in access to infrastructure at local levels, even in mountainous and remote
areas. However, addressing existing infrastructure bottlenecks and meeting the rapidly growing
demand for infrastructure services raise important challenges. Resources are only part of the solution,
as there is also a need to substantially increase the efficiency of investments. Reallocating resources


                                                    15
across sub-sectors and projects, towards those which address most urgent bottlenecks, should lead to a
positive "composition" effect. Another important step is to strengthen the investment project cycle,
from planning to appraisal to implementation.
41.      Increasing the efficiency of public investments is an important objective of the
government strategy for 2006-2010. The SEDP states one of its goals as "creating a breakthrough in
infrastructure to [...] boost the economic growth rate" (p. 67). To attain this goal, the SEDP stresses
the need to steer "the management of investment resources in the direction of providing favorable
conditions to mobilize the most possible investment resources in the society. Also, tackle with
shortcomings and problems in the existing investment management to effectively utilize the
investments for essential purposes as planned to avoid loss and waste. Quickly establish a legal
framework for planning work to ensure that planning is one step ahead, serving as the basis for
implementation of investment projects" (p. 117).
42.     The proposed program is clearly aligned with the SEDP. In relation to the management of
project cycle, the SEDP states that the government "will continue to decentralize investment
management responsibilities to conform to requirements of administrative reforms, to increase the
efficiency of state management, and to simplify investment procedures. Besides the decentralization
of investment management, it is necessary to identify responsibilities of institutions and individuals to
increase their liability involved in investment activities. Other stated objectives of the SEDP are to
provide standards for consultant companies and entrepreneurs to ensure independence and
objectiveness of consultancy services, to remove the existing "closed" procedures in investment and
construction, to enhance the community supervision in regard to planning work, to ensure publicity of
plans, and to strengthen inspection and examination of construction management and land use plans in
selected provinces (p. 134).
43.      Ambitious objectives have been set by the government in relation to planning reform
over the five years of the current planning cycle. The SEDP considers decentralized planning as
part of the "perfect performance mechanism". But this is only provided that several key principles are
respected: "planning should have scientific bases, long-term vision, be widely commented and
consulted, and its implementation should be supervised by the whole public". The SEDP also
recognizes the need for concrete guidelines for planning at all levels. It instructs to "[q]uickly
establish a legal and institutional framework for clear assignment and decentralization, creating
standardization in planning process and planning time frames for all types of plans as well as unity and
coordination among plans" (p. 151). A stronger connection between planning and investment is also
foreseen, the objective being to "establish a legal framework for planning work to ensure that planning
is one step ahead, serving as the basis for implementation of investment projects" (p. 133).
44.     Strengthening the management of public expenditures has been a priority of the
Vietnamese government over the last decade. A benchmark in the reform process was the approval
of the Revised Law on the State Budget, which became effective in 2004. This Law empowered the
National Assembly and People's Councils at all levels to decide on budget appropriations and to hold
the government accountable for the use of public resources. Except for the largest national projects,
public investment decisions were decentralized to ministries and provinces. Other important
developments were the move towards increased transparency for all agencies using budget resources,
including SOEs and public investment projects, the establishment of SAV as a technically independent
unit under the National Assembly, and the gradual integration of capital and recurrent expenditures
through forward-looking budgets and resource allocation norms. The agenda over the current five-
year cycle is in line with this trend. The SEDP emphasizes the need to bring a medium-term
perspective into the budget process. Specifically, it aims to " [r]enovate the content, mode and process
of doing the estimations of the state budget in the direction of building the medium-term budgetary-


                                                   16
financial plan in close links with the implementation of the budgetary financial strategy" (p. 140). A
more detailed overview of public financial management in Vietnam is provided in Annex 4.
45.      The reform of the state sector focuses on changing the incentives faced by both SOEs
and their regulators. A combination of measures was used to improve SOE performance, including
increased competition in product markets, the removal of government subsidies and the adoption of
the corporate governance models of the private sector. The SEDP instructed to "[s]teadily speed up
the reorganization and renovation of State enterprises by diversifying the ownership to improve
efficiency and competitiveness" and to "[e]xpand the scope of equitization of State enterprises" (p.
136). The equitization process involved increasingly large enterprises during the current five-year
cycle, but has slowed down as a result of the macroeconomic turbulence and its impact on capital
markets. A new phase in state sector reform started with the transfer of state ownership rights in SOEs
managed by ministries and provinces to the for-profit State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC).
The SCIC is in the process of divesting the smaller ones and listing the large ones, so as to keep the
size of the portfolio manageable and to have an objective measure of its performance. The strategy is
clear in relation to the need to "[s]eparate state management functions from owners' management and
from business administration functions" (p. 139). The key to accomplish this separation in practice is
to "[g]radually narrow and eliminate the function of representatives of ministries, provincial and city
peoples' committees in the governance and management board of State enterprises" (p. 136).
46.      At the same time, this period saw the emergence of Economic Groups, reporting directly
to the Prime Minister, on a pilot basis. These are large holding companies whose subsidiaries have
all been equitized or restructured, "in such fields as petroleum, aviation, telecommunications,
electricity, etc., with financial and technological potentials to participate in regional and world
markets" (p. 136). Economic Groups clearly benefit from economies of scale and from their ability to
mobilize financial resources, but this is at the same time a potential source of systemic risk. In the
absence of sufficient competition, Economic Groups could become "too big to fail". Their venturing
into banking and finance, during the overheating phase, allowed them to invest in the booming sectors,
thus fueling the asset price bubble. During this five-year period, measures were taken to prevent them
from having controlling stakes in financial institutions, so as to minimize the risk of related-party
transactions. More recently, the Prime Minister has instructed that solutions be sought to separate the
ownership and regulation functions of the state in the case of Economic Groups.
47.      Vietnam has experienced a rapid financial deepening in recent years without suffering
any financial crisis so far. There has been a sustained monetization of economic transactions, a
parallel expansion of credit, a rapid growth of stock market capitalization, a gradual emergence of the
bond market and a boom in insurance. This progress is all the more remarkable considering that
barely more than a decade ago Vietnam's financial sector was simply a "window" to channel resources
to SOEs. However, important weaknesses remain, including a still rudimentary approach to monetary
policy, and an insufficiently developed capacity to monitor and supervise the financial sector. Aware
of these challenges, at the beginning of this five-year period the government launched a roadmap for
the reform of the banking sector, including the transformation of SBV into a modern central bank, and
the attraction of strategic investors to the SOCBs, so as to strengthen their commercial orientation and
improve their ability to assess credit risk. Additional commitments to market entry and capital
mobility were made in the context of WTO accession. The objectives of the government program in
this area are reflected in the SEDP, which instructs to "build and complete the legal framework in line
with the roadmap of integration and market opening commitments [and gradually abolish all
preferences enjoyed by SOCBs, while stop the interference of SBV into the business of commercial
banks" (p. 85).




                                                  17
INVESTMENT-RELATED POLICIES
48.     The basic institutional and legal framework for environmental protection has been
gradually laid out. The strategy is partly spelled out through the Amended Law on Environmental
Protection, which became effective in July 2006, and in the National Environmental Protection
Strategy until 2010 and vision toward 2020. In practice, the SEDP aims to "[m]ainstream
environmental protection into socio-economic development plans to achieve the sustainable
development goals of the country [and...] renew the planning work in regard to environmental
protection" (p. 95). Many policies, programs and plans have broad-reaching environmental
implications. These cannot be captured by simply conducting Environmental Impact Assessments
(EIAs) at the project level. The statement in the SEDP is consistent with the government's decision to
undertake Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs) to better integrate environmental protection
into planning processes. Such "upstream" reviews are especially important at a time of rapid
economic growth and massive public investment in infrastructure.
49.      The period leading to the finalization of the SEDP witnessed the issuance of important
strategic documents and policy measures related to the fight against corruption. Because the two
processes were running to some extent in parallel, the SEDP does not fully reflect the current
government strategy in this area. But it articulates important policy choices. Overall, it puts emphasis
on positive, systemic approaches to reduce the scope for corruption, in contrast with the almost
exclusively punitive measures that prevailed until not long ago. Fostering government transparency is
among those positive approaches. In this respect, the SEDP states the need to "[s]trengthen the
publicity and transparency in the use and management of the state budget and funds" (p. 140) and to
"[e]nsure openness and transparency in the organization's activities, such as: public procurement and
capital construction, management of construction investment projects, finance and state budget,
mobilization and utilization of people's contributions, use of grants and aids, management of land use
etc." (p. 152). In the specific case of investment projects, it instructs to "[i]mprove the openness and
transparency of state budget in all processes from policy-making, estimation, appraisal to approval,
implementation and clearance at all levels" (p. 141).
50.     Land management is singled out as one of the most vulnerable areas from the corruption
standpoint. In its more analytical part, the SEDP notes that "[i]nefficient land management and use
caused losses for the state budget and affected the integrity of many cadres" (p. 46). Specific
recommendations are made to address these concerns, especially in relation to investment projects
which dramatically modify the value of land. The SEDP emphasizes the need to "mak[e] land use
planning and land resource information publicly accessible and transparent" (p. 133), to "[r]emove the
existing "closed" procedures in investment and construction" (p. 134) and to "[a]pply a unified pricing
system for goods and services, land rent, compensations for site clearance to both domestic and
foreign investors" (p. 138).
51.      The weaknesses of the management of public investment were further highlighted in a
recent MPI report. Among the major remaining issues, the lack of a consistent legal framework was
identified as the most impact factor. At present, public investment is under the regulation of two
different sets of legal documents. Projects that do not involve construction work are regulated by a
series of decrees, whereas projects that do involve such work fall under the Construction Law and
another set of associated decrees. In addition, the State Budget Law, the Procurement Law, the Land
Law, the Environmental Protection Law and the relevant decrees apply. Furthermore, there are
important inconsistencies between these documents, especially in relation to the preparation, appraisal,
classification, and monitoring and evaluation of projects. And there are important gaps as well,
particularly in relation to assessing the economic and social impacts of projects.



                                                  18
52.     Recognizing those weaknesses, several important decisions were made by government as
the proposed program was being prepared. Through the Official Letter 6999/VPCP-TH, on
October 8, 2009 the Prime Minister asked MPI to prepare a program on restructuring the economy,
with the structure of investment as one of its focal areas. Directive 854/CT-TTg, issued on June 19,
2009, mandated that all remaining SOEs shall operate under the Enterprise Law by July 1, 2010. The
Official Letter 78/BKH-VP, issued by MPI on February 5, 2009, identified as key policy actions for
2009 the completion of the Law on Amendments, the drafting of a new Law on Public Investment, and
the issuance of several decrees related to investment processes. The drafting of the Law on Public
Investment was also included as a key step in the action plan for the implementation of the anti-
corruption strategy until 2020 in the Official Letter 3040/KH-BKH, dated May 4, 2009.
53.      The Law on Public Investment, to be submitted to the National Assembly in 2010, is a
cornerstone of the reform process in this area. The law is expected not only to overcome the
inconsistencies of the existing legal framework for public investment, but also to put economic
efficiency as the top priority. The law should also contribute to modernizing public expenditure
management. This will be accomplished by strengthening the Public Investment Plan and improving
its links to operational expenditure. Finally, the law will focus on the project cycle, from selection to
preparation to implementation.


CONSULTATION ON THE REFORM PROGRAM
54.      The preparation of the SEDP 2006-2010 had important strengths compared to its predecessors.
Applying the new regulations, the drafting process was characterized by serious efforts to collect
inputs from different groups of the Vietnamese society. In addition to internal discussions within
government, MPI organized consultation workshops with local officials, groups of academics, the
domestic business sector, international and local NGOs, people living with disabilities, overseas
Vietnamese, women and women's groups, and donors. A series of participatory research exercises
involving local experts and international NGOs also helped to gather feedback from poor communities
in 17 sites across the country. The draft SEDP was declassified for the first time ever. Among other
changes, these consultations led to shifts in emphases; for instance, in relation to the mainstreaming of
poverty issues beyond targeted programs.
55.       Several of the policy actions and triggers under the proposed program have been championed
by the National Assembly, which has become much more assertive during this five-year cycle. This
represents an important institutional transformation for Vietnam. National Assembly members have
been especially vocal on the efficiency of capital accumulation, on the regulation of Economic
Groups, and on the overall macroeconomic stance. All of these aspects affect the proposed program
either directly or through the framework in which public investment decisions are made. National
Assembly members were also a driving force in relation to the Law on Amendments, which underpins
the first operation in the proposed program
56.      Consultations on policy lending in Vietnam were conducted shortly before the preparation of
the proposed operation started (see Box 1). While those consultations focused mainly on the PRSC
process, they provided guidance on good principles that turned out to be relevant for the proposed
program, especially in relation to the need to customize the policy actions and triggers. As part of the
effort to monitor the results of the proposed program, a two-round survey of populations affected by
land reclamation is foreseen. As discussed in the section on social impacts, the most direct
consequences of the proposed program would be on resettlement. The ex-ante assessment suggests
that the proposed program will have a positive impact, by leading to more timely and adequate
compensation, and by introducing an independent monitoring mechanism. However, the proposed


                                                   19
two-round survey will provide a chance to assess impacts on the ground, and to adjust the program
along the way accordingly, if necessary.


               IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


LINK TO COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
57.      The CPS 2007-2011 articulates the support of the World Bank group to Vietnam around four
main pillars: improving the business environment, strengthening social inclusion, strengthening
natural resource and environmental management, and improving governance. The proposed program
is mainly related to the first and, especially, the fourth pillar. However, it also touches on the other
two pillars. In connection to the first pillar, the CPS focuses on more efficient and reliable provision
of infrastructure services. As for the fourth pillar, the stated objective is to improve public financial
management, information and transparency, with emphasis on anti-corruption. More specifically, the
CPS states that "to reduce the opportunities for corrupt behavior, it will also be important to continue
to strengthen key government systems", including public procurement systems (p. 13).
58.      The CPS also recognizes that "improving the efficiency and transparency of investments, and
strengthening governance remain important challenges. The continued rapid economic growth
envisaged in the SEDP is underpinned by high rates of investment. Some of the most important
recommendations [...] relate to the introduction of measures that protect the efficiency of investment
and the transparency of investment decision-making" (p. 14). More specifically, the CPS says that
"infrastructure projects must be delivered on time to produce the services when they are needed.
Accelerating the reform and equitization of infrastructure SOEs will greatly improve the efficiency of
infrastructure service provision and increase the overall competition of the economy. [...] Making
further progress in infrastructure development requires diversifying funding sources and improving
transparency in resource mobilization" (p. 25).
59.     A list of key issues in relation to infrastructure mentions that "greater use of private finance
would reduce the burden on public finance and could potentially release funds for use in other
sectors". It also emphasizes that "the planning process needs to adapt to achieve a more refined
assessment of investment priorities and to better integrate budgeting decisions with investment plans.
[...] Across all infrastructure sectors, there is room for efficiency improvement in project selection,
investment operations and maintenance" (p. 26). There is also reference to the need to "better
integrate environmental protection in planning, in particular expanding environmental tools to include
programmatic assessments such as SEAs for public investment plans, for sectoral master plans and for
regional development plans.
60.      These orientations are clearly reflected in the results framework of the CPS 2007-2011. Under
the improved business environment pillar, Objective 1.3 is "more efficient and reliable provision of
infrastructure services". Under the improved governance pillar, Objective 4.1 is the "improved
effectiveness of budget planning, execution, reporting and accountability", whereas Objective 4.3 is a
"reduced incidence of corruption" (p. 20). One of the milestones in this respect is "more transparent
and effective public procurement" (p. 22).
61.     These orientations are also linked by the CPS to the need to accelerate the implementation of
investment projects. "While the quality of portfolio implementation continues to be satisfactory,
challenges remain from slow disbursement against rapidly growing commitments, long project
preparation, and delays in implementing investment and technical assistance interventions". The CPS
concludes that "the most crucial task will be to improve and strengthen Vietnam's own process of

                                                   20
planning and financing investment projects, and safeguards. The key factors behind the delays in
processing are Vietnam's extensive internal control mechanisms for ODA implementation and
centralized decision-making, coupled with inconsistent regulations for government-funded investment
projects compared to ODA-financed projects" (p. 35).
62.      The proposed policy lending program to reform public investment processes had not been
foreseen when the CPS 2007-2010 was prepared. At that time, the policy dialogue was fully
centralized around PRSCs, whereas at present there is a clear recognition of the need to complement
PRSCs with more detailed sectoral policy lending operations. Moreover, when the CPS was drafted,
the use of IBRD resources had not been considered yet. These two developments are addressed in the
CPS Progress Report which is being submitted to the Board of Directors. The proposed program is
explicitly mentioned, and briefly described, in the CPS Progress Report.


COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
63.      The macroeconomic turbulence of the last two years has resulted in an even closer
collaboration with the IMF than previously. Monitoring short-term economic developments and
providing timely policy advice became more central in the World Bank program during these two
years, especially in light of the role of the Bank as the coordinator of donor support to Vietnam in
Consultative Group meetings and through PRSC operations. However, this role could not be played
without ensuring a commonality of views with the IMF. This was even more important because of the
relatively heterodox nature of some of the policy choices made by the government of Vietnam as it
strived to stabilize the economy first, and to support economic growth later. Maintaining a nominal
exchange anchor, actively using trade policy, and refinancing corporate debts through an interest rate
subsidy scheme, were among the controversial measures that required a close dialogue between the
World Bank and the IMF, in order to deliver consistent messages to the government.
64.      In preparation for this operation, a substantial amount of joint work was devoted to
assessing debt sustainability, the "size" of the proposed stimulus package, and the options to
finance it. These tasks were demanding, due to the remaining gaps with international practice in the
presentation of budget data. The ad hoc nature of some of the stimulus measures, some of which were
led by ministries and agencies with relatively little coordination with MOF also added uncertainty
regarding the actual cost of the measures, and who would bear it in the short term. The cost of some
of the measures was over-estimated, as was the share of the cost that would fall on the budget.
Together with some double counting, the result was an apparently unaffordable stimulus package. On
closer examination, however, Bank staff concluded that a fiscal stimulus was appropriate given the
international situation. It was also concluded that the stimulus package was not fully funded, but an
active mobilization of resources by the international community could narrow the financing gap to
manageable levels.
65.      More recently, the collaboration has focused on the potential external vulnerability of
Vietnam, and the reasons underlying the decline in the level of international reserves. The most
recent assessment of the macroeconomic situation by the IMF was conducted shortly before the
adjustment to the macroeconomic framework. In this assessment, the IMF notes that Vietnam is
weathering the global crisis better than many other countries, with growth picking up in the second
and third quarters as a result of the government stimulus program. The rest of 2009, economic activity
is likely to regain momentum gradually, projecting GDP growth for the year as a whole to be about 5
percent. Nevertheless, the external position has deteriorated, which it attributes to rapid credit growth,
contributing to a return to a large current account deficit in the second quarter. According to the IMF,
private net outflows (including net errors and omissions) increased sharply in Vietnam, more than
offsetting an increase in aid inflows.

                                                   21
66.      To address current vulnerabilities, in October 2009 the IMF recommended a set of
actions to maintain macroeconomic stability, including the tightening of monetary conditions.
This could be achieved through the combination of an increase in policy rates (which have been
unchanged since February 2009), further relaxation of the lending rate cap, and an early phase-out of
the interest rate subsidy scheme. The IMF also emphasized the need to develop a budget
consolidation plan to ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium term. An overall budget deficit
amounting to 6 percent of GDP was seen as appropriate for 2010 under the circumstances. This
amounts to an adjustment by 3 to 4 percentage points compared to 2009. The IMF also stressed that
safeguarding banking sector stability remained crucial and further improvements in data provision and
communication strategy would help bolster policy credibility. These recommendations were
articulated in the Concluding Statement of a Staff Visit. In consultation with the Fund, the World
Bank had made similar recommendations in a letter addressed to the Prime Minister.
67.     The World Bank worked closely with the other five development banks active in
Vietnam to select the set of policy actions under the proposed program. The other five
development banks are AFD, ADB, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the
Korean Development Bank, and the German Kreditanstalt Für Wiederaufbau (KfW). Together with
the World Bank, these agencies had been actively working in the implementation of the harmonization
agenda under the Paris Declaration. In particular, they have provided extensive technical assistance
aimed at narrowing the differences between the government systems used by the government of
Vietnam to implement public investment projects and international practice. This effort was seen as
essential to accelerate the disbursement of donor-funded projects. In the process, it led to a deep
understanding of current weaknesses in project preparation, selection, implementation and monitoring
in Vietnam.
68.      Active consultation with other donors and with non-government actors also took place as part
of analytical work underpinning this program. For instance, in the context of the report on
Improvement of ODA Programs and Projects' Payment and Disbursement Process, completed in 2009,
field visits were made to PMUs of ODA projects and expenditure control agencies (State Treasury,
Vietnam Development Bank) in some localities in Hanoi, Hai Phong, Ho Chi Minh City and Dong
Nai. Consultations also took place during the preparation of the CFAA, in relation to SEAs and EIAs,
and on issues related to land reclamation and compensation.


RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
69.     There is a close relationship between the proposed program and the PRSC process. The
time span of the proposed program will overlap with the last two operations in the PRSC cycle,
namely PRSCs 9 and 10. Until quite recently, PRSCs were one of the few vehicles for the policy
dialogue in Vietnam, bringing together a dozen donors around policy actions in 17 policy areas.
While the strong coordination of this dialogue contributed to effective harmonization, it also resulted
in operations that were demanding in their processing, given the multiple expectations of all the parties
involved. PRSCs in Vietnam consistently included more triggers and benchmarks than was
considered "good practice", stretching the capacity of the World Bank team leading the process to
handle them all with the same level of expertise and detail. Gradually, sectoral policy lending
operations started to emerge, to go into more detail into specific areas, such as poverty reduction,
higher education, power sector reform, or climate change. The proposed program to reform public
investment in Vietnam can be seen as one of those sectoral lending operations.
70.    Previous PRSCs included policy actions aimed at strengthening public investment
processes in Vietnam, but progress in this area was insufficient. Relevant prior actions included
enhancing the decentralization of public investment decisions to lower government levels (under

                                                   22
PRSC 4), facilitating community participation and supervision in local investment projects (also under
PRSC 4), establishing criteria for selecting public investment projects and mechanisms to monitor
their financing and implementation (PRSC 7) and revising the investment laws to improve efficiency
in state capital expenditures and strengthen the management of public investment projects (under
PRSC 8). The latter action actually paved the way for several of the actions covered by the proposed
program. In addition, the PRSC process supported the equitization of SOEs and the separation of
regulation and ownership roles within the State. PRSCs were also associated with strong progress in
planning processes and in public financial management. However, in spite of the specific measures
listed above and the sustained progress in broader policy areas, the gap between Vietnamese country
systems related to public investment and international practice remains substantive. Currently,
Vietnam is not considered as a pilot country for the use of procurement country systems in World
Bank operations.
71.      One of the main challenges from the proliferation of sectoral policy lending operations is
to maintain the overall coherence of the policy dialogue. During the preparation of this operation,
the question arose whether it should tackle the fight against corruption more broadly or the regulation
of large state-owned Economic Group? Other potentially relevant areas for engagement included the
need to improve coordination between spatial planning and sectoral master plans, across sectors and
levels in government and between MPI and MOF functions. However, the policy dialogue in these
areas has implications going beyond public investment. The proposed program was seen as better
suited to address the fight against corruption, the strengthening of planning and public financial
management process, or the reform of the state sector in aspects directly linked to the efficiency of
public investments. To maintain the coherence of the policy dialogue, it is preferable to keep "high-
level" policy actions under PRSCs, whereas more specific, "lower-level" measures can be handled
through the various sectoral policy lending programs.
72.      The triggers for the current operation in the PRSC cycle, are relevant for the proposed
public investment reform program. The completion of PRSC 9, which will take place in mid-2010,
requires that a series of indicative triggers be met. The government has committed to adopt
regulations on state-owned Economic Groups for better corporate governance, exercise of state
ownership rights, and supervision. It will also revise regulations to better assess the portfolio risks of
commercial banks, enhance the public disclosure of the results, and strengthen banking supervision.
Importantly, it will adopt annual procurement compliance and performance audits and make public the
results, adopt a procurement code of ethics, and launch an open access electronic bidding system
73.      In addition, the PRSC policy dialogue is focusing on a series of benchmarks that should
contribute to enhanced investment efficiency. Those benchmarks focus on supporting the
development of private investment, improving planning and public financial management processes
that do have an impact on public investment, and deepening the ongoing reform of the state sector. In
relation to private investments, it is expected that regulations on securities will be upgraded to foster
development of domestic capital market, whereas accounting standards and financial disclosure
requirements in enterprises and banks will be brought closer to international practice. On government
processes, regulations will be issued to institutionalize modern planning system at provincial and local
levels, a legal framework for strengthening urban planning and urban infrastructure management will
be approved, and the cash basis International Public Sector Accounting Standards for public
accounting will be adopted. As for reforming the state sector, PRSC 9 should see the separation of the
exercise of the ownership rights from the regulatory function in the unequitized SOEs and the
preparation of a roadmap for gas market reform.




                                                   23
LESSONS LEARNED
74.     The design of the proposed program has been informed by World Bank experience with
policy lending in Vietnam. It has followed the good practice principles for conditionality, which
were recently the focus on extensive consultations with the relevant stakeholders (Box 2). The design
of the operation draws on the lessons from the PRSC series in identifying an area in which the
leadership is keen to move, where the dialogue is well advanced and where capacity to develop and
implement policy is in place. Such a window currently exists in Vietnam, because the economic
turbulence of the last two years clearly exposed the weaknesses of public investment processes in
Vietnam. Growing concern by the public opinion about the environmental impacts of large public
investment projects adds to the momentum, as does the need for the government to secure resources to
finance its stimulus package.
75.      One important lesson from the PRSC process refers to the positive impact of active
engagement on decisive aspects of policy measures adopted by government. In many cases, the
ownership of the reform agenda by the Vietnamese government is such that regulations are likely to be
passed anyway, even in the absence of a policy dialogue around a lending operation. However, the
timing, coherence and content of those regulations can improve substantially if they receive the
enhanced attention of senior leadership that comes along with major lending operations, such as
PRSCs. In the absence of such enhanced attention, there is a tendency to continue doing business as
usual, which results in protracted iterations over draft regulations, often lacking the vision to address
the core issues, and instead adding layers of regulatory complexity. In the case of the proposed
program, the strong analytical work conducted by the World Bank and other donors in areas such as
planning and investment policy, public financial management, and harmonization, makes it possible to
identify what the critical issues are, on a regulation-by-regulation basis, and to request the attention of
senior leadership to their satisfactory resolution.
76.      Another important lesson refers to the contribution made by strategic, "lock-in"
measures to make other aspects of the reform program fall into place. In the case of the PRSC
process, the decision by the Party and the government to aim for WTO accession, shifting from a
"concessions" approach to the negotiation to a "development" approach, unlocked reforms in a range
of other policy areas, including legal development, the adoption of standards and competition in
services. Similarly, Party decisions on aiming for universal health insurance coverage or for banking
sector reform triggered a series of critically important policy measures by government in the following
years. When there is commitment around those "lock-in" measures, there is increased confidence that
the associated regulations will be adopted and the reform drive will not falter.
77.      In the case of the proposed program, this "lock-in" role is played by two laws, one
already approved under the first operation and the other to be prepared under the second one.
The former, passed in June 2009, is known as the Law on Amendments. It reforms key aspects of
several investment-related laws and instructs government to follow up with the necessary decrees and
circulars. The dialogue on this law had been part of the policy dialogue under PRSC 8. However,
several recommendations for additional changes were made when the preparation of the proposed
program started, in April 2009. The second law, tentatively known as the Law on Public Investment,
is expected to provide a more comprehensive overhaul of public investment processes in Vietnam.
This law still needs to be brought to the calendar of the National Assembly, but the Prime Minister's
office has already instructed MPI to prepare it. Building on the lessons from previous policy lending
operations in Vietnam, these two laws "anchor" a series of policy measures over an 18-month period,
ensuring a comprehensive approach and a rapid pace for the proposed program.

                               Box 2. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

Stakeholder consultations were held in February 2009 in Hanoi in the context of 2009 Development Policy
Lending Retrospective, conducted by the Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) Department of the
World Bank. The consultations involved representatives from government, donors, civil society and the
academic community. The discussion focused both on the general principles and on their application in Vietnam
in the context of PRSC operations. To the extent that the design of the proposed program builds on the PRSC
model, the outcome of these consultations is highly relevant.
Ownership. There was general agreement across all stakeholder groups that policy lending in Vietnam was
firmly rooted in the government's own reform agenda, as expressed first through the Comprehensive Poverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) and then the SEDP. In both the donor and civil society consultations,
participants mentioned that Vietnam's experience was "best practice." The proposed program follows in that
tradition, as it supports a priority area for the government, as is the efficiency of investment or, more broadly, the
"quality of growth". If anything, the urgency to make progress in this area has been heightened by the recent
macroeconomic turbulence, which exposed the vulnerabilities stemming from weak public investment processes.
Harmonization. Alignment to the CPRGS and the SEDP helped development partners work more coherently in
support of government outcomes. There was general acknowledgement that the preparation of policy lending
operations was complex, as it brings together multiple ministries and donors. Government participants were
particularly appreciative of donor efforts to coordinate assistance around the SEDP. There was still concern over
the frameworks for accountability, which tend to be similar, but not identical, to the SEDP monitoring
framework. There were views that donors should resist the temptation to use independent monitoring
mechanisms. The preparation of the proposed program builds on the ongoing harmonization work between
government and donors. In particular, all of the other development banks active in Vietnam were invited to
participate in the policy dialogue, and some of them did it actively. On the other hand, the SEDP monitoring
framework is weak in relation to public investment processes, which has required the development of a self-
standing set of outcome indicators.
Customization. The general sense was that policy lending in Vietnam has become increasingly tailored to the
country priorities. The need to balance the wish to promote desirable reforms and the respect for the country's
objectives, perhaps described as "the art of the possible," was recognized. A recurrent theme referred to building
analytical capacity so that government, rather than development partners, can lead the process of determining
which actions should be prioritized in the agreements. The proposed program builds on extensive analytical
work that is specific to Vietnam. It does not purport to mechanically replicate measures adopted in other
countries. The proposed policy actions and triggers all refer to specific laws, decrees and circulars on which
technical assistance has been provided, and substantive discussions have been held with government over a
period of several years.
Criticality. The consultations discussed the "size" of policy matrices and their consistency with an active policy
dialogue across all areas. It was recognized that operations involving a multiplicity of agencies are likely to
require a larger number of "benchmarks" than is considered best practice. Participants emphasized that the
World Bank and all co-financiers should use the same policy matrix to decide on their level of support, thereby
providing a single harmonized platform for the policy dialogue and disbursements. Because of its sectoral
emphasis, the proposed operation does not rely on an excessively large number of policy actions and triggers, so
that it does not conflict with best-practice principles.
Transparency and predictability. Both predictability and transparency have increased over recent years in
Vietnam's policy lending operations. Government participants emphasized the importance of making
commitments in time for the preparation, or the completion, of the budget plan for the year. Preparation starts in
July of every year, and completion takes place around November. The proposed program meets this requirement,
as there should be clarity on whether there is an agreement between the two sides before the critically important
fall session of the National Assembly comes to an end.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
78.      To diagnose the weaknesses of investment processes in Vietnam, the preparation of the
proposed program took a microeconomic approach. Aggregate analyses such as those based on
Vietnam's growing ICOR are intuitively appealing but they can be misleading. In particular,
dynamics and composition effects have to be taken into account when interpreting the level of the
ICOR. Dynamics matter for an economy whose investment rate is going through a sustained increase,
as is the case in Vietnam. Investment projects take time to mature; in the case of large-scale
infrastructure, their full payoff may only be felt many years after their completion. A surge of the
investment rate like the one experienced by Vietnam in recent years amounts to an increase in the
share of "young" projects, which are heavy in capital but for many years remain light in output. As
for composition effects, the surge of the ICOR in recent years is associated with the foreign-invested
sector; not because it is the most inefficient, but because it has grown the fastest. This is why an
analysis focusing on the distortions in the allocation of resources, all the way from the mechanisms
through which funding is raised to the way in which investment projects are implemented, can be
more revealing than an ICOR calculation.
79.      A key analytical input in the preparation of the proposed program was the Vietnam
Development Report 2009, entitled Capital Matters. The annual Vietnam Development Report is the
flagship series of the World Bank in Vietnam. At the beginning of each planning cycle, it provides a
"reading" of the government's strategy, an assessment of its relevance to address the main
development challenges in each area, and recommendations on the policy measures needed to
implement it. Subsequent issues analyze in more detail the issues faced in each of the "pillars" of the
reform agenda. The 2009 edition focused on the efficiency and financing of investments in Vietnam.
It examined the sources and uses of funds, quantified the gaps between investment and savings for
each of the main economic agents, and highlighted the mechanisms through which the agents who
save channel resources to those who invest. The report then explored in some detail the efficiency of
each of these mechanisms, including the raising of tax revenues by government, the issuance of debt,
the allocation of resources through the budget, the targeting of social policy lending, the mobilization
of banking credit, the raising of equity finance, the participation of the private sector in infrastructure
projects, and the mobilization of donor support. Inadequate criteria to select projects, the lack of an
adequate framework for private participation, and weaknesses in project implementation were
identified as the main constraints to efficient public investment in Vietnam.
80.      The selection of policy measures under the proposed program results from a combination of
analytical and institutional criteria. The long-standing analytical program of the World Bank and
other donors was used to select the actions deemed more strategic, or with the highest potential impact
on the actual implementation of public investment projects. The analytical inputs combine insights
from the work program on public financial management and financial accountability, from the joint
efforts of the six development banks to implement the Paris Declaration and the Hanoi Core Statement
on Aid Effectiveness, from the flagship Vietnam Development Report series, and from the technical
assistance work in support of planning reform at MPI, among others. The second criterion to select
the actions in the policy matrix was readiness. The proposed measures were extensively discussed
with the relevant line ministries and government agencies to identify which of them were feasible
since April 2009, within the time frame of the proposed program. Taking into account the technical
background work, the legal process and the consultation requirements in each case, a preliminary
agreement has been reached on the content and time line of each of the measures.
81.     A series of core diagnostics and specific studies have been undertaken since 1999 to provide
sound analytical underpinnings to the implementation of the government-led public financial
management reform program. The two most important assessments produced in recent years are the
best-practice Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA), completed

                                                    26
in 2005, and the 2007 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) which was just been
finalized. These two comprehensive diagnostics have helped identify areas in need of further
improvement, including the process of budget development, budget execution control, accessibility of
financial information, and accounting, reporting, auditing and oversight framework. The PER-IFA
and the CFAA reflect a trend towards analytical work being undertaken jointly by the government,
World Bank and interested donors, which has ultimately resulted in enhanced ownership of relevant
recommendations. With a strong endorsement from the Office of the Government (OOG), a number
of reforms recommended in the CFAA will be considered in the revision of the State Budget Law, and
a time-bound action plan to implement all its recommendations is now being developed. In the
meantime, the recommendations from PER-IFA 2004 and CFAA 2007 have formed the basis for
policy dialogue conducted through the PRSC series and the proposed program.
82.     Another important analytical underpinning for the design of this operation was the Diagnostic
Framework for Assessing Public Investment Management, produced in early 2009 by the Public Sector
and Governance Unit of the PREM anchor. This study provided a very useful starting point to design
the results framework, an area in which few precedents are available. Other studies serving as
analytical underpinnings for the proposed program included the Public Investment Management Case
Study for Vietnam conducted by the public sector group in the PREM anchor (PRMPS), in
collaboration with the country office in 2008, the 2006 Vietnam Infrastructure Strategy, the analysis of
land markets in the Business Vietnam Development Report, and the piloting process for Medium-
Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs).
83.      The Joint Portfolio Performance Reviews and Joint Action Plan of the six development banks
active in Vietnam contributed an in-depth understanding of the microeconomics of public investment
processes in Vietnam. The focus of the six banks' efforts was to identify ways to upgrade the
performance on the ODA-funded programs. However, the exercise led to a systematic identification
of gaps between Vietnamese laws and regulations on public investments and accepted international
practice. Several key areas where short-term actions could be taken were selected for what has
become known as the Joint Action Program (JAP). Each of the six banks subsequently agreed to assist
MPI to pursue options for improvements in specific areas of the JAP.
84.      Several of the actions pursued by the six banks feed directly into the preparation of the
proposed program. On procurement, an independent assessment of the Vietnamese system was
commissioned by MPI in 2007 using the OECD-DAC methodology. On the use of cost estimates as
bid price ceilings, the program included a program to review of the whole cost norm system to
determine whether a reform would be advantageous for Vietnam. On construction contracts, an
Institutional Development Facility (IDF) grant is about to be signed with the Ministry of Construction
(MOC) to support the review of a critically important decree and prepare for its replacement. Good
progress was also made by the six development banks on the common policy framework for
resettlement and the environment. Regulations on SEAs and EIAs were thoroughly reviewed, and
proposals were made to improve the management of the resettlement of illegal land users, which has
been one of the most controversial issues in the public debate recently. On payment procedures and
non-essential disbursement checks, the work of the six development banks included a survey of PMU
practices, leading to consultation and discussion with key stakeholders. Common guidelines for
feasibility studies were jointly prepared with government for use in all projects by the six development
banks. Finally, on establishing a consistent M&E framework, an Aligned Monitoring Tool was agreed
upon with government and is already been used in all projects by the six banks.
85.      The technical assistance provided to MPI in recent years is aimed at addressing remaining
weaknesses in planning and investment. This engagement has resulted in substantive learning about
project implementation in practice. The technical assistance program has supported reliance on broad-
based consultations in planning process, the introduction of a results-based M&E framework at the

                                                  27
central level, the adoption of forward-looking budgets better integrating capital and recurrent
expenditures, the adoption of the first ever legal document in support of spatial planning, and the
strengthening of provincial SEDPs. Some important lessons have been derived from this technical
assistance work. It has appeared clearly that the key impediment to further breakthroughs in planning
reform is the lack of a sound regulatory framework that clearly spells out requirements,
responsibilities processing, steps and resources needed for strategic planning. Under current
institutional settings, agencies and provinces simply compete for the allocation of resources through
their SEDPs and investment master plans, without much guidance on which investments are eligible
and which ones should not be selected. Another important lesson concerns the lack of an effective
M&E mechanism which would not just be based on administrative reporting.
86.      The World Bank has done extensive analytical work on compensation and resettlement issues
in Vietnam over the years. Because the scope for voluntary land transactions is severely constrained
in Vietnam, virtually every instance of land allocation requires use of government eminent domain
powers to acquire land involuntarily. A thematic group on the harmonization of resettlement policies
has analyzed the main gaps between government policies and international practice, and drawn an
action plan to close the gaps. A study conducted in 2008 provided an overview of current land policy-
related research, identifying key issues and suggesting areas for further work. Another study was done
in the same year on illegal land users, to serve as the basis for the policy dialogue with the
government. An ongoing study on land conflict management addresses issues related to compensation
and resettlement. Its goal is to identify constraints to effective land allocation and land use, to propose
better ways to provide incentives for private development, to improve performance in land
administration issues, and to preserve social equity.



                              V.      THE PROPOSED PROGRAM

OPERATION DESCRIPTION
87.      In preparing this program several alternatives were considered regarding the
appropriate lending instrument. One of the choices faced concerned policy lending versus
investment lending. It was felt that an investment operation would not be able to address the policy
distortions and institutional bottlenecks affecting the efficiency of capital accumulation more broadly.
In addition to the policy dimension, a budget support operation would also address the request by the
government to help finance the stimulus package. In fact, the need for additional resources to support
economic activity resulted in an enhanced attention of senior leadership to the content of the program,
providing a momentum that PRSC operations had not managed to elicit in relation to public
investment reform. The need to fill the financing gap was also the main reason to discard using a
Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO). It is clear that the government will use the resources as soon as
they are available. Another option concerned single-tranche versus multi-tranche operations. It was
also felt that a program involving two single-tranche operations linked by triggers provided more
flexibility to adjust and was more in accordance with good principles in policy conditionality. Finally,
using less concessional lending reflects a choice by the government of Vietnam, which wants to ensure
that the proposed program provides additional resources compared to the ongoing IDA program.
88.      The proposed program foresees two-single tranche operations providing general budget
support in recognition of strong progress towards strengthening public investment processes.
Each of the operations would mobilize US$ 500 million in IBRD terms. In addition, AFD is expected
to co-finance the first operation for EUR 100 million, and the second one for an additional EUR 50
million. Other donors may join the second operation. The policy actions under the first operation and

                                                    28
the triggers for the second one are organized around 17 main issues or problems to address. For
conceptual clarity, those 17 issues can be regrouped under four main headings: project selection,
project implementation, public financial management, and project oversight. All of the proposed
measures concern public investment projects in general, regardless of their source of funding. The 17
problems considered for this program are often complex, and solving some of them requires the
issuance of several legal documents. This potential multiplicity of measures underlies the organization
of the measures relating to each of the 17 issues under the form of a set of prior actions for the first
operation and a set of indicative triggers for the second one.


PROJECT SELECTION
89.      Competitive entry. Foreign companies established before the Enterprise Law of 2005 came
into effect can only invest in sectors listed in their FDI license. These companies also face restrictions
to bid for public investment contracts. These barriers imply that FDI companies which fail to re-
register under the new Enterprise Law are not fully subject to national treatment. According to the
Investment Law, foreign investors enjoy the same rights as domestic investors only provided that they
hold 49 percent or less of the capital. They also need to have an approved project in order to invest in
Vietnam. As these barriers are contrary to WTO commitments, FDI companies registered before the
unified Enterprise Law came into effect were given two years to re-register and enjoy the same
prerogatives as domestic investors. As this two-year period was coming to an end, a large number of
FDI companies had failed to do so. Lack of registration under the Enterprise Law crowds out private
investment and undermines the quality of public investment. In the proposed program, a prior action
under the first operation grants a five-year period for FDI enterprises to re-register.
90.     Environmental screening. Only investment projects consistent with master plans are eligible
for funding by the state budget. According to the Law on Environmental Protection of 2005, key
master plans need to be informed by SEAs. But to date no master plan has incorporated the
recommendations of an SEA in Vietnam. A new cycle for ten-year development strategies and five-
year development plans begins in 2011. Those strategies and plans will underlie the investment
master plans used to guide resource allocation. Continued lack of enforcement of the Law on
Environmental Protection would therefore undermine the environmental sustainability of public
investment in the coming years. One of objectives of the proposed program in this area is to have a
"demonstration effect", whereby hands-on technical assistance allows producing SEAs and
mainstreaming environmental concerns in the selected master plans. Hence, one of the triggers for the
second operation in the program is to incorporate SEAs in the master plans for two regions and two
key sectors. Another objective is to identify the main reasons why SEAs have not been conducted as
mandated by the Law on Environmental Protection. Hence the second trigger in this area, which is to
review the experience with SEAs and design policy actions to improve their preparation and use.
91.     Project approval. Increased decentralization has resulted in an incomplete and inconsistent
regulatory framework for public investments. Project preparation, appraisal, implementation and
monitoring are treated differently in various sectoral decrees. This heterogeneity creates confusion in
implementing agencies. Combined with the multiplicity of donor-specific guidelines in use, it leads to
unwarranted delays. The Law on Amendments passed in June 2009 instructs the government to
harmonize the language on planning for investment projects. But this will be insufficient to address
the current regulatory fragmentation. This is why the Prime Minister instructed MPI to prepare a Law
on Public Investment providing a common framework for all public projects. The preparation of this
law is considered a key trigger for the second operation in the proposed program.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
92.      Public procurement policies and practices are an important determinant of public resource
management effectiveness and performance. Vietnam's evolving public resource management
framework recognizes that sound and transparent public procurement policies are among the essential
elements of good governance. However, an assessment of Vietnam's public procurement system using
the OECD/DAC Baseline Information System benchmarking tool shows that the country meets the
rating requirements for only three out of 17 Core Sub-Indicators. Weak areas include eligible bidders,
opening of bids, evaluation criteria, contract negotiation, sole source and minimum time for bidding,
among others. Unfortunately, up to now no major breakthrough has been made in bringing the
Vietnamese legal framework for public procurement in line with international good practice. For
example, there is a need to control the over-reliance on direct contracting through clearly defined
conditions for use, rather than the current threshold method whereby all contracts under the threshold
may be awarded by direct contracting without limitation. In some cases, there are even setbacks, as
with the recent, substantial increase in the thresholds for direct contracting for consulting services,
works and goods
93.     Cost estimates. Preparing cost estimates is an integral part of investment planning. However,
in Vietnam the Procurement Law establishes that cost estimates also establish a ceiling for admissible
bids. This approach restricts competition, as bidders tend to get close to the cost estimate. Moreover,
price ceilings being usually low, they open the gate to re-negotiation between the winning bidder and
the investment owner, an "ask and give" process that is vulnerable to corruption. A newly issued
Decree on procurement provides guidance on how investment owners should deal with cases where
the evaluated bid prices exceed the approved cost estimates. However, the procedures in this decree
do not represent a move towards best international practice. On the other hand, a prior action under
the proposed program recognizes the move towards more realistic cost estimates, through their
decentralization to investment owners and the alignment of cost norms with the market. Looking to
the second operation in the program, the policy dialogue will focus on the amendment of the Law on
Procurement and the government has agreed to work in this direction. Because an amendment of the
Law would require the consent of the National Assembly, however, a trigger is not the appropriate
mechanism to frame this commitment.
94.      Bidding rules. To some extent, the absence of a breakthrough in procurement so far reflects a
difference in viewpoints between the Vietnamese government and international practice. The reform
process in Vietnam emphasizes the devolution of authority to implementing units, and that includes
allowing more discretion to investment owners. International practice, on the other hand, points out
that discretion reduces transparency, equal opportunity and competition in public procurement. In
light of this difference in viewpoints, the measures related to procurement under the first operation in
the proposed program do not aim to overhaul current practice, but rather to make progress when there
is an opening. In this spirit one of the prior actions in this program is to clarify that late bids in
procurement tenders for public investment projects shall be rejected.
95.      Bidding transparency. Direct interaction between investment owners and potential
contractors is a source of fiduciary risk. Impersonal, electronic interfaces, reducing discretion by all
parties, can in principle reduce processing times and increase transparency in procurement. The
government of Vietnam is taking important steps in this direction. Under the time frame of the
proposed operation, a regulation for the piloting of e-procurement in Hanoi and selected government
agencies was issued. Looking forward, the second operation in the program should see the preparation
of technical guidelines to actually conduct e-procurement in the pilot units. MPI will be in charge of
issuing such guidelines.


                                                  36
96.     Conflict of interest. The design and implementation of infrastructure projects is often
conducted by SOEs affiliated with investment owners. This is especially the case in MOC, which is in
charge of a large fraction of infrastructure spending in Vietnam. While many of the affiliated SOEs
have been equitized, the exercise of ownership rights on behalf of the state remains with the ministries
in most cases. The equitization process is expected to regain momentum, after the pause created by
the economic slowdown. However, in spite of the diversification of ownership the scope for conflict
of interest remains considerable. One way to solve this conflict of interest is to transfer state
ownership rights in construction companies out of MOC. The proposed trigger for the second
operation concerns MOC and aims to transfer the exercise of state ownership rights in civil works
companies outside the ministry. It is expected that the affiliated companies will be reorganized as two
Economic Groups. Meeting the trigger would imply ensuring that the representation of the state at the
board of these Economic Groups is not allocated to MOC.
97.      Dispute resolution. The legal obligations of the parties engaging in civil works contracts are
not clearly defined, with disagreements often slowing down project implementation. This problem
became apparent during the inflation outburst of 2008. Unambiguous templates for standard contracts
under the Law on Commerce are needed. Contracting rules are currently regulated in a circular under
a decree. However, one year into its implementation, it has become apparent that the circular does not
provide for adequate transparency, prompt settlement of disputes or removal of implementation
bottlenecks. This in turn results in excessively slow disbursements. In response to this situation,
MOC is preparing a new Decree on the Management of Construction Contracts. The issuance of this
decree constitutes a trigger for the second operation in the program. Its objective is to clarify the
rights and obligations of parties engaging in civil works contracts.
98.      Land acquisition. Land reclamation and compensation are affected by inconsistencies
between the various regulations governing land and real estate. Land is not always valued at market
prices, support for loss of livelihoods is not provided and illegal land users are discriminated against.
The prior action in this respect is the adoption of a decree that covers the management of land use
zoning, clearly identifies responsibilities and sets clear indicators in the case of land for wet rice
cultivation, specialized-use forests, and protective forests. To align land valuation with the market, the
decree also deals with the determination of relevant prices in a range of cases, and prescribes the same
terms for allocated land and land leased from the state. Assistance for those whose land is reclaimed
includes relocation support and resettlement support in the case of residential land. It includes
livelihood and production support, occupational training and job-seeking assistance in the case of
agricultural land. The decree establishes the obligation for the state to cover the difference between
the compensation received and the market value, if the former falls short of the latter. To reduce the
processing time by one half to one third, the new decree adjusts and combines steps in land acquisition,
allocation, and lease with existing construction and investment procedures.
99.     Environmental management. EIAs are often conducted at a late phase in project
preparation. Because of their poor quality, the associated EMPs tend to be weak. Delays and
technical weaknesses arise because of inconsistencies in the legal framework, allowing the submission
of EIAs at the same time as construction permits, despite the fact that this contradicts the Law on
Environmental Protection. According to the Law on Environmental Protection, the EIA should be an
integral part of the feasibility study for a public investment project. The independence of EIA
consultants and review authorities is supposedly guaranteed and public consultation is required.
However, inconsistencies in sub-law regulations and the lack of technical guidelines on the format and
content of EIAs and on public consultation procedures undermine the process. In particular,
consultations usually take place with local authorities and representatives of mass organizations, but
do not often spread to the population at large. To address these shortcomings, a trigger under the
second operation is to replace two contradictory decrees by a new one mandating the timely
preparation and review of EIAs and EMPs so that they inform feasibility studies.

                                                   37
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
100.     Reporting and control. Recording of budget revenue and spending is slower for ODA funds
than for state budget funds, due to the spending and reporting procedures of project implementing
agencies. ODA-funded projects are also subject to less frequent auditing by SAV, despite that fact
that it is already authorized to oversee ODA-funded projects as it would do with budget-funded
projects. However, in light of its growing responsibilities, SAV has been expanding its annual audit
plan in this direction only gradually. Addressing these shortcomings in public financial management
requires modifying several sub-laws. This is why one prior action and one trigger are considered in
this policy area. The prior action is to align the recording of ODA funds in government accounts with
the timing of actual receipts and expenditures for ODA-funded projects. Because many ODA-funded
projects are subject to independent audits, the trigger is to mandate the sharing of those audits with
MOF and SAV.
101.     Administrative costs. Caps applying to consultant fees, travel costs, translation services, the
organization of workshops and other ancillary expenses are increasingly misaligned with the market.
This results in an inadequate quality of project preparation and implementation. In addition, caps on
total preparation costs set in percent of total project costs are not flexible enough to accommodate the
diversity of projects. The caps applying to individual administrative cost items and to overall project
preparation costs are set by different ministries under different regulations. Following the mandate of
the Law on Amendments, MOF is revising a set of circulars to align cost norms related to project
preparation and implementation with the market. A first prior action and a trigger cover the revisions
for ODA-funded and budget-funded projects respectively. Meanwhile, MOC has clarified that norms
for cost estimates set in percentage of total project are to be used as reference only, and do not
establish a cap for budgeting purposes, which is the second prior action.
102.     Environmental budgets. In the case of environmental work, such as the preparation and
review of SEAs and EIAs the problem is not that cost norms are outdated, but rather that they were
never introduced. The absence of guidelines on admissible expenses has been one of the main
practical obstacles to compliance with the Law on Environmental Protection. To address this problem,
MOF and MONRE will joint define a list of admissible expenses. In parallel, MONRE will issue
technical guidelines on how to conduct environmental work, including EIAs. Satisfactory completion
of these two activities is proposed as a trigger for the second operation in the program.
103.    Payment and disbursement. The Law on Amendments mandated the review of circulars
dealing with payment and disbursement procedures applicable to budget-funded projects. ODA-
funded projects also include some areas in which disbursement checks can be improved to streamline
payment processes and simplify payment-supporting documents. The trigger in this case is to
streamline payment procedures and simplify payment-supporting documents for ODA-funded
projects.
104.      Subsidies and guarantees. Few public investment projects ensure full cost recovery. But
transparent mechanisms to bridge the viability gap in PPP projects are not available in Vietnam, which
results in insufficient private participation and the granting of financial support on a case-by-case
basis. Subsidies or guarantees can be used to bridge the gap, but coherence needs to be ensured across
projects. For that to happen, a PPP Framework needs to be introduced, articulating when and how the
viability gap is to be bridged by the state, and how to ensure that explicit costs and contingent
liabilities are minimized. MPI is currently working on this Financing Framework, together with MOF.
As part of this effort, the design of a Viability Gap Financing Mechanism (VGFM) is in progress.
VGFM support is expected to take the form of contributions to construction costs, to be channeled
through the budget in accordance with the State Budget Law. The trigger in this respect is to issue a
decision to pilot the use of the PPP Framework.

                                                  38
PROJECT OVERSIGHT
105.     Project documentation. The terminology used for pre-feasibility studies and feasibility
studies varies across budget- and ODA-funded projects. The gaps in terminology make it more
difficult for donors to rely on mainstream documents from Vietnamese systems, and require frequent
clarification. The Law on Amendments, approved in June 2009, instructs the government to
harmonize project-related terminology. To support the possibility for donors to rely more extensively
on country systems, and therefore to speed up project preparation and implementation, the prior action
in this area is to harmonize terminology on pre-feasibility and feasibility studies across budget- and
ODA-funded projects.
106.     Monitoring and evaluation. Discrepancies and inconsistencies in project reporting
mechanisms across sectors and PMUs weaken accountability. In spite of various efforts to improve
the M&E of public investment projects, there is a clear fragmentation of the legal framework, with
some regulations referring to the general evaluation of projects across all sectors, others to individual
sectors and projects, others to community-based monitoring, and yet others to ODA-funded
investments. In addition, the stabilization program of 2008 spelled out clear criteria to stop or defer
the implementation of non-critical public investment projects. Strictly speaking, no new M&E
framework was introduced at that point; but the stabilization program marked one of the first instances
in which selectivity needed to be applied across the board. To address these problems, project
management should be strengthened by broadening the use of standardized monitoring tools to all
projects regardless of their source of funding and by relying more extensively on independent
evaluation of projects. Building on joint work between MPI and the six development banks, the prior
action in this case is to establish a consistent M&E framework including standardized monitoring
tools. Improved M&E also requires greater reliance on independent professional experts. For this
reason, the trigger discussed with government in this policy area is to approve the Chart for the
establishment of an association of independent evaluators.


                           VI.     PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION


POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

Overall impact
107.     Public investment projects in infrastructure have made a substantive contribution to
poverty reduction in Vietnam. Not only is the volume of such investments very high, reaching or
exceeding 10 percent of GDP, but it also has a very strong poverty reduction focus. A case in point is
the rural electrification program, one of the most successful in the world. When the Bank started
working in Vietnam, only half of the households were connected to the electricity grid. Nowadays,
the share is close to 94 percent. Local infrastructure projects, such as those undertaken under the
second phase of Program 135, which is targeted to the most disadvantaged communes, have resulted
in improved access to markets and better social services, having a clear impact of the livelihoods of
some of the poorest population groups in the country. Large-scale infrastructure projects, while
having a more indirect impact on poverty, have enhanced the business environment thus contributing
to massive job creation. Poverty assessments in Vietnam recognize that the move from farming to
wage employment has been one of the main avenues for households to improve their living standards.
If anything, it is when public investment has faltered, as in the case with the supply of rural water and
sanitation, that Vietnam has found itself at risk of not meeting the Millennium Development Goals.

                                                   39
108.     While there is considerable scope for private participation in infrastructure, a
substantial fraction of public investments is bound to remain government-funded. Increasingly,
there are areas where total or partial cost recovery is possible, and the main constraint to take
advantage of that possibility is the lack of appropriate legal and institutional frameworks. By
supporting the adoption of a financing framework for PPP projects, the proposed program is expected
to contribute to a rising share of private investments in infrastructure. But many of the local
investments which have been so critical to poverty reduction are unlikely to secure sufficient cost
recovery. The government usually claims that the poverty reduction focus of its investment program
is one of the main reasons why the ICOR is high in Vietnam. Massive redistribution of budgetary
resources towards poorer provinces, thanks to targeted programs and especially to a system of fiscal
transfers established by the State Budget Law of 2002, support large investments programs in more
remote and disadvantaged areas. Investment costs in those areas are often higher, due to remoteness
and small scale, whereas returns in terms of additional output (as opposed to poverty reduction) are
presumably lower.
109.    From this perspective, the proposed program should have positive social impacts. That
is, given that public or private investment will contribute to poverty reduction, increasing the
efficiency of such investments should in principle be beneficial.
Land issues
110.     However, investments in large-scale infrastructure typically require land acquisition,
and the process of compensation and resettlement is typically a source of grievances in
developing countries. Recent experience suggests that Vietnam is not an exception in this respect.
There are no specific actions or investments supported by the project that would result in acquisitions
or resettlement but we investigated the theoretical possibility of an indirect impact of greater amounts
of resettlement taking place in the country as a result of the project.
111.     The proposed program is unlikely to lead to an increase in the overall volume of public
investment. Admittedly, the resources provided by the program will be used to finance the stimulus
package, and in particular to finance the implementation of critically important infrastructure projects.
However, the stimulus package basically aims at offsetting a decline in public investments, as a result
of a drop in revenue collection and the difficulties to issue more public debt on both domestic and
international markets. Total public investment, including both on budget and off-budget items, is
actually expected to decline from 12.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to 12.3 percent in 2009. In the absence
of the proposed program, the decline would be even larger.
112.     On the other hand, one measure under the program should lead to substantial
improvements in procedures for land acquisition and compensation. Such measure is the
adoption of Decree 69/2009/ND-CP, a prior action under the first operation in the proposed program.
This decree includes provisions on land-use planning, land prices, development of land funds, land
acquisition and compensation, and resettlement support. This decree includes the management of land
use zoning at four levels (national, provincial, district, and communal) requesting a clear
determination of land use indicators for wet rice cultivation, specialized-use forests, and protective
forests. To ensure that land valuation reflects market prices, the decree includes articles on the
relevant prices in the cases of land allocation, land lease, land reclamation, and SOE equitization.
Importantly, the decree prescribes the same valuation procedures for allocated land and land rented
from the state. This provision is expected to accelerate project implementation and to reduce the scope
for corruption.
113.   The most significant improvements introduced by this measure in relation to the social
impacts of investment concern compensation and assistance for affected populations. According

to the decree, those whose land is reclaimed are entitled to relocation and resettlement assistance in the
cases of residential land, and livelihood and production assistance, occupational training and job-
seeking assistance in the case of agricultural land. The decree clearly specifies the obligation of the
state to make up for any shortfall between the compensation received and the market value of the
property, allocating this responsibility to the relevant People's Committee. To speed up compensation
and assistance, the decree also adjusts and combines some requirements in the process of land acquisition,
allocation, and lease with existing construction and investment procedures. In doing so, it aims to reduce the
processing time by one half to one third.
114.     In summary, on land issues, based on a strong suite of analytical work carried out by the Bank,
no evidence that actual investments in infrastructure will increase under the project, and the policy
actions that will be actively reforming regulatory instruments in this area, it is concluded there are no
likely impacts in the area of land and resettlement.
Other Policies
115.    Other than the issue of potentially increasing land acquisition, a review of all the policy
actions and triggers under the proposed program was conducted to determine if there are other
potential social impacts. Those policy actions and triggers fall in one of two groups:

    ·   Group A - Socially positive policy actions to upgrade consultation with affected populations.
        In the proposed program, several actions and triggers aim at improving the framework and
        practices of carrying out SEAs and EIAs. These are primarily environmental tools, but their
        strengthening has social implications as well. The mainstreaming of SEAs in master plans
        should result in reduced environmental degradation, and the poor are among the most directly
        affected by pollution or the loss of natural habitats. A timely implementation of EIAs
        involves consultation with affected populations, and this tends to enhance the voice of
        vulnerable groups. Therefore, these actions should all result in markedly positive benefits.

    ·   Group B ­ Socially neutral actions. This group includes all the remaining policy actions
        included under the operation. None has been identified as being potentially socially
        detrimental.


ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

Overall impact
116.     The proposed program is likely to have an overall positive impact on the environment,
forests, and other natural resources. This is to a large extent because of the strong leverage
exercised through this operation to substantially advance the regulatory and legislative framework for
SEAs and EIAs. A number of environmental policy actions are included in the program precisely with
the objective of generating a significant positive environmental impact. Others, while not being
strictly environmental, are also expected to result in positive externalities. A more detailed analysis,
presented below, was carried out to determine whether the proposed set of prior actions and triggers
could have significant effects, defined as environmental changes of sufficient magnitude, duration, and
intensity as to have non-negligible impacts on the natural resource base and on human welfare. A
small number of policy actions had some theoretically negative environmental impacts but were found
to be neutral on further analysis. The bulk of actions supported through the project are
environmentally neutral.
117.    As argued in the section on social impacts, the proposed program aims at partially offsetting
the decline in government revenue as a result of the economic downturn, but it is unlikely to result in

                                                     41
an overall level of public investment (and thus environmental consequences) that would be different
from a baseline case. Even if this were to happen, the strong pro-environmental measures in the
proposed program should still ensure that the overall environmental impact remains positive.

Specific policies
118.     Environmentally, the proposed program of prior actions and policy triggers can be divided
into three groups as follows:

   ·   Group A ­ Environmentally positive policy actions to update or improve environmental
       legislation. Prior actions and triggers in the areas of environmental screening, environmental
       management and environmental costs are intended to fill identified gaps in the country's
       existing environmental legislation. As a result of the proposed policy interventions, it is
       expected that environmental management practices in Vietnam will be significantly improved.
       Regional and sectoral development strategies as well as specific investments can be expected
       to be more environmentally sustainable. Environmental impacts of future investment projects
       will be better assessed and addressed.
       To develop the proposed program, the Bank, in coordination with other international donors
       such as ADB and the Government of the Netherlands, provided technical and financial
       analytical support to improve environmental regulations and practices for impact assessments.
       Examples include the study on the Harmonization of EIAs for the Hanoi Core Statement on
       Aid Effectiveness (World Bank and ADB), the Pilot Strategic Environmental Assessment in
       the Hydropower Sub-sector in Vietnam (World Bank, the Netherlands Government and
       Birdlife), and the Strategic Environmental Assessment for the Development Master Plan of
       Red River Delta, 2011-2020 (World Bank). The Bank has also published a recent analysis of
       SEA in South-east Asia with a strong analytical section on Vietnam: Strategic Environmental
       Assessment in East and Southeast Asia: A Progress Review and Comparison of Country
       Systems and Cases.

   ·   Group B ­ Environmentally neutral policy actions. This group includes almost all of the
       policy actions and triggers in the proposed program.

   ·   Group C ­ Policy actions with potentially detrimental environmental impacts. Of interest in
       this respect is the prior action related to conflict of interest, involving the transfer of state
       ownership rights in civil works companies under MOT to the SCIC. It could be argued that
       greater profit orientation may result in diminished attention to environmental mitigation
       measures, thus resulting in increases in negative impacts from their operations. However,
       regulations on SEAs, EIAs and EMPs will remain the same, regardless of who the contractor
       is affiliated with, and there are no solid grounds to claim that SOEs are more environmentally
       friendly than profit-driven companies.
       The prior action on land compensation could conceivably be seen as a driving force for project
       investors to convert natural habitats such as forested land, rather than accepting compensation
       costs for acquiring agricultural land. This potential impact is mitigated however by article 3
       of Decree 69/2009-ND-CP which regulates that zoning of critical forested land (catchment
       protection forest, specialized forests and natural reserves) is determined in country-level
       master plans and production forest land is determined at provincial level. The impact is also
       mitigated by article 29 of the Law on Forest Protection and Development, which regulates that
       conversion must be in accordance with the Land Law, Forest Protection and Development
       Law, and that project proposals (including environmental impacts assessments) must be



                                                 42
        approved by the authorized agency. Taking this into account, the Bank thus considers that the
        proposed program entails no risk of increased conversion of natural habitats.


IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
119.    Designing an appropriate results framework for the proposed program is challenging, given
the shortage of relevant precedents to build upon. Previous lending related to public investment
management is quite limited. Operations are often embedded in public financial management reform
or concern a specific operation or sector (such as roads, for instance). The proposed program departs
from existing precedents by combining the macroeconomic angle characterizing policy lending
operations with the microeconomic focus that is typical of investment operations.
120.     As previous operations have different scopes and development objectives, their results
frameworks do not particularly fit to the one for the proposed program. Operations embedded in
public financial management reform typically rely on outcome indicators for the performance of
public investment management which are tied with measurement of efficiency, transparency and
accountability of the overall public financial management system. These indicators tend to focus on
strategic upstream public investment programming, on its alignment with budget processes, and on
enhancing the associated regulatory framework. But broad indicators of this sort tend to be
qualitative, and usually do not cover implementation and monitoring issues. On the other hand, in
operations with a sectoral focus, outcome indicators for public investment management tend to
emphasize project implementation. These programs are generally designed with sufficient time frames
to allow measuring the outcomes of investment spending.
121.     The proposed program combines the short time span of operations with a public financial
management focus with the project dimension of operations with a sectoral focus. This results in a
temporal mismatch between actions and triggers on the one hand, and development outcomes on the
other. The proposed program would be closed when some of the key policy actions it supports could
only become effective. The proposed monitoring framework (see Table 6) should therefore be seen as
work in progress, bound to be refined through economic and sector work in the coming weeks and
months. As hard numbers are available only for a few of the selected indicators so far, baselines and
targets are indicative for now. Ongoing discussions with experts in each area are being conducted to
ensure that the preliminary figures provided are realistic. Similar discussions are being held with
government officials in charge of the relevant policy actions and triggers. These tentative estimates
should provide a sense of the potential impact of the program. However, both baselines and triggers
will be revised through analytical work associated with the program.


FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
122.    Fiduciary arrangements. The fiduciary risks of the current public financial management
systems (budgeting, accounting, reporting, and auditing) are assessed as moderate (see Annex 4).
Since the IMF does not currently have a program in Vietnam, it is not possible to rely on its
assessment of the control environment of the SBV. However, the enactment of the Audit Law in 2005
helps address the issues related to audit and accounting arrangements. The Audit Law has established
the SAV as an independent institution reporting to the National Assembly with the Auditor General
being appointed and dismissed by the National Assembly. Audit reports were made public for the first
time in 2006. The SBV is subject to auditing by SAV on an annual basis but, under the current laws,
the audited financial statements and audit reports of SBV are not publicly disclosed.

123.     Deposit account (DA). To address fiduciary risks in the foreign exchange control
environment, the Borrower will open and maintain a dedicated DA in U.S. dollars for the Borrower's
use once the Credit is approved by the Board. The DA will form part of the country's official foreign
reserves. An equivalent amount will be credited to an account of the government available to finance
budgeted expenditures. The Bank may request the government provide written confirmation that this
has occurred. If after deposit in the DA the proceeds of the Credit or any part thereof are used for
ineligible purposes, as defined in the Financing Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to
either return that amount to the DA to be used for eligible purposes, or refund the amount directly to
IBRD.
124.     The Bank will retain the right to seek an independent audit of the DA established in SBV by
an auditor acceptable to the Bank to seek reassurance on the accuracy of the information relating to
transaction from this account that was provided by the Borrower, including accuracy of exchange rate
conversions; and that funds in this account were not used to finance expenditures excluded under the
Agreement. The Government will furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later
than six months after the deposit of the single tranche credit amount into the foreign currency DA, a
certified copy of the audit report, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably request.


DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS
125.     The Credit will follow IBRD disbursement procedures for development policy lending
operations, and the Credit proceeds will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated release
conditions. Various measures have been taken to ensure that the overall fiduciary policies and
institutions are adequate to proceed with support from IDA and other development partners.
Analytical underpinnings for the operation include the 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR), the 2005 PER-IFA and the CFAA (2007). Disbursement will not be linked to any specific
purchases and no procurement requirements will have to be satisfied.


RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
126.     Increased macroeconomic instability is one of the most important risks facing the proposed
program. So far, the government has successfully navigated through both the massive capital inflows
of late 2007-early 2008 and the current global crisis. The stimulus package has contributed to a strong
recovery in 2009. However, external vulnerability has increased as imports grow again, whereas long-
term inflows are still below trend and residents have restructured their portfolios towards foreign-
denominated assets.
127.    This risk is being addressed through a series of corrective measures being adopted by the
government since late October 2009. These measures include the tightening of monetary policy,
including a road map to end the interest rate subsidy schemes adopted as part of the stimulus package.
In addition, the government is taking steps towards a greater flexibility of the interest rate. The
corrective measures also include a smaller budget deficit in 2010 than in 2009. While the deficit is
higher than in the years preceding the global crisis, it is expected to decline in subsequent years.
128.     There is also a risk that the policy actions supported by the program will not be sufficient to
make a substantial difference in the quality of public investments in Vietnam. The short time frame of
the program, associated with the need to support the stimulus package, conflicts with the slowness of
the consensual approach to economic reform underlying policy making in Vietnam. In particular, it is
difficult to introduce fundamental changes in areas where substantive differences of views remain,
such as public procurement.

                                                   46
129.     To address this risk, the proposed program builds on the lessons learned from Vietnam's long-
standing experience with policy lending. One of those lessons is the importance of "lock-in reforms"
around which other actions fall in place. Building on that precedent, the program is anchored around
two critically important laws: on the amendment of investment-related laws (a prior action under the
first operation) and on public investment (a trigger for the second operation). In addition, the program
is designed so as to achieve the desired outcomes through measures that work around existing
institutional obstacles.
130.     Finally, there is a risk that measures will be adopted as agreed, but the specifics will be such
that the impact of those measures on the efficiency and transparency of public investments could be
diluted.
131.     This risk is to some extent addressed by the quality of the ongoing technical assistance work
provided by the six development banks in several of the areas covered by the proposed program, and
by the World Bank and other donors in relation to public financial management. This long-term
engagement predates the proposed program. In parallel, the importance of the proposed program to
sustain the economic recovery has increased the attention of senior leadership to the reforms covered
by the proposed program.

Recent Developments and Outlook
1. Economic activity is recovering, but the government stimulus program is posing risks to
macroeconomic stability. After a sharp slowdown in the first quarter, real GDP growth picked up in
the second and third quarters, and is now projected at 5.2 percent in 2009. However, the sharp increase
in credit growth (33 percent year-to-date in October), together with an expansionary fiscal policy, has
led to a return to large current account deficits, and short-term private capital outflows were significant
mainly due to a shift in resident portfolio holdings toward foreign currency assets. As a result, the
dong has been under sustained depreciation pressures, with parallel market exchange rates reported at
4­5 percent outside of the official band. Access to foreign exchange has been difficult, imposing
significant costs on enterprises and adversely affecting investor confidence. Gross international
reserves fell by $6½ billion in the first nine months of the year to $16½ billion (2½ months of imports
projected for 2010). Furthermore, while inflation dropped to 3 percent (y/y) in October, monthly
seasonally-adjusted inflation has increased steadily since May to an annualized rate of about 10
percent.
2. The outlook will depend on whether the government takes timely policy actions to tackle the
emerging risks to macroeconomic stability. Although an improvement in the global economy is
likely to ease external pressures, early policy actions discussed below are required to protect external
stability and secure a sustained recovery from the global crisis. Such actions would also help avoid the
need for more aggressive and potentially disruptive policy actions later.
Policy Challenges
3. Monetary policy needs to be tightened promptly to rein in credit growth and support the
dong. To this end, the authorities should phase out interest subsidy schemes, increase policy interest
rates, and further relax the lending rate cap. These steps will also help restore a functioning, liquid
foreign exchange market. If external pressures persist, however, greater exchange rate flexibility
accompanied by stronger monetary and fiscal policy actions may be required. While recognizing the
need to contain rapid credit growth, the authorities are concerned that these measures could adversely
affect economic activity. While details of the government policy are still being worked out, the
government recently announced that the interest subsidy schemes would be extended through the end
of the first quarter of 2010 for short-term loans and through end-2010 for long-term loans, while
reducing interest subsidies from 4 percent to 2 percent. In addition, the authorities would consider
absorbing liquidity through open market operations, raising reserve requirements, and using moral
suasion.
4. A sound and sustainable fiscal policy is warranted to support the proposed monetary
tightening. The immediate priority is to clarify the fiscal plan, including its financing, for the
remainder of 2009. With revenues performing stronger than expected, the overall fiscal deficit
(including off-budget expenditure and on-lending) in 2009 could be contained below 9 percent of
GDP, provided that expenditures are not augmented. This would not only ease monetary management
and external pressures, but also help boost fiscal policy credibility and confidence in the dong. For
2010, the authorities expect that the overall fiscal deficit would be lower. It will be important that the
overall fiscal deficit be reduced to 6 percent of GDP, a level consistent with available financing and a

fiscal adjustment path required to preserve public debt sustainability. The implied adjustment could be
achieved by allowing the stimulus measures to expire as originally planned and containing off-budget
investment expenditures. The authorities will also need to give priority to efficient public investment
projects and social safety net measures aimed at protecting vulnerable groups. Fiscal policy should be
implemented flexibly, especially if growth momentum weakens. Under such circumstances, a more
gradual fiscal adjustment may be appropriate provided that external and inflationary pressures are
clearly contained.
5. Safeguarding banking sector stability remains crucial. Vietnamese banks have so far
experienced limited direct effects from the global crisis, but risks are on the downside. The capital
base of a few large banks remains weak, the quality of banks' loan portfolios is uncertain, and
liquidity conditions have tightened, in particular for state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). The
recent rapid credit growth and narrowing profit margins resulting from the lending rate cap and higher
deposit rates could increase banking vulnerabilities. To address these concerns, the State Bank of
Vietnam (SBV) should eliminate the lending rate cap, further enhance bank supervision, encourage
banks (especially SOCBs) to continue to strengthen their capital base, and step up regulation on bank
capital and provisioning closer to international best practices. The SBV will also need to improve its
banking data reporting system and expedite legal reforms that will strengthen its operational autonomy
and effectiveness in safeguarding bank soundness. In this context, the authorities' interest in
participating in an FSAP is welcome.
6. Further improvements in data provision and the communication strategy will help bolster
policy credibility. The quality, frequency, and timeliness of data--especially in the fiscal, state-
owned enterprise, and banking sectors--still need to be substantially strengthened. The
communication strategy could be enhanced by regularly presenting to the public a clear assessment of
the economic situation and direction of policy, in order to manage market expectations more
effectively and improve business and consumer confidence.

                     ANNEX 4: PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IN VIETNAM



Background and Analytical Underpinnings
1.    This operation provides general budget support to the Vietnamese Government and will be
executed through the Government's public financial management (PFM) systems. This annex
summarizes the current state of these systems and the ongoing reforms with a view to assessing the
attendant fiduciary risks with respect to the proceeds of this development policy loan.
2.    Vietnam has set the goal of becoming a middle income country in 2010 with promoted
social inclusion and public governance. Public financial management reform is one of four focus
areas within the Government of Vietnam's Public Administration Reform (PAR) Master Program for
the period 2001-2010. Other focus areas include organizational restructuring, pay and employment
reform and institutional development. The Initiative includes five priorities, namely budget
management, revenue management, debt management, SOE fiscal risk management and public asset
management.
3.    Over the past decade Vietnam has made continuous efforts to establish a sound public
financial management system in the country. With the adoption of the first organic budget law in
1996 and its revision in 2002, a solid legal framework for public resource management has been put in
place. A centralized treasury system has been set up with branches extending from the center to all
provinces and districts to provide basic essential financial services to all government agencies. Steady
progress has been achieved in making the budget more predictable and pro-poor and the budgeting
process more transparent and participatory. Substantial efforts have also been made in recent years to
improve transparency in the use of public resources through provision to the public of increased
information on detailed government spending as well as wider disclosure of government expenditure
policies, regulations and procedures. Vietnam has been recognized for its relatively prudent fiscal
policy.
4.     Despite positive progress, considerable challenges remain. Although fiscal trends have been
positive, a number of threats to fiscal sustainability exist. These include government bonds issued off-
budget to finance infrastructure projects, education facilities and to recapitalize SOCBs, contingent
liabilities arising from the operations of the Vietnam Development Bank, banking sector and other
sub-national development funds as well as off-budget balance borrowing of provinces. In the absence
of a formal commitment control in public expenditure management, some provinces and ministries
made capital expenditure commitments off-budget resulting in balances in excess of their budget and
fund availability. That led to the built-up of considerable amount of capital expenditure arrears that are
not fully resolved yet. In addition, the re-lending from Government's borrowings can become
Government's obligations if they are not managed properly. This calls for an urgent need to put in
place legal and institutional frameworks to comprehensively manage public debt and monitor
government commitments and contingent liabilities.
5.     The composition of public expenditure remains imbalanced in favor of capital expenditure
that negatively affects the efficiency in the use of public resources. Processes for prioritizing
expenditures remain ineffective. The absence of a credible multi-year fiscal framework means that
expenditure planning is conducted without reference to medium-term resource constraints.
Prioritization is carried out separately for capital spending (by the Ministry/Department of Planning
and Investment) and for recurrent spending (by the Ministry/Departments of Finance), with significant
imbalances between the two.
6.   There are shortcomings in Vietnam's public financial management information systems
and public accounting regulations. The lack of a fully consolidated budget makes it difficult to

                                                   59
monitor total revenues and expenditures, as well as the true fiscal position. Extra-budgetary funds, on-
lent official development assistance are not consolidated into the budget. The lack of common
accounting structures results in numbers which are inconsistent and hard to compare. The lack of
integrated, electronic data recording and reporting results in laborious manual consolidation and
manipulation of data from multiple satellite databases, and in financial reporting which is neither
timely nor accurate. These deficiencies contribute to the poor flow of budgetary information between
government ministries, provinces, donors and the public. While progress has been made with regard to
adopting international private sector accounting standards with 26 Vietnamese accounting standards
consistent with international accounting standards having been developed and issued, these standards
have not been kept up to date, whilst public sector accounting standards are still lacking, existing
government accounting regimes are incomplete and accounting practices have yet to be aligned with
international standards.
7.    Although the country's public financial management system has a range of internal oversight
roles and mechanisms, the focus of the various internal oversight functions is on inspection rather
than systematic review to provide regular and timely feedbacks to management on internal control
systems and the use of public resources. Internal auditing is recognized as a key element of a sound
public financial management system which helps organization increase effectiveness and efficiency in
addition to improving financial controls and procedures. Effective internal auditing is yet to be
developed to provide regular timely review and feedback to management on internal controls in the
use and management of public resources.
8.     There are significant weaknesses in revenue administration. Vietnamese Customs are still
considered low, unresponsive, inconsistent and vulnerable to corruption. A long-term vision with clear
strategic goal is lacking. The Customs administration will need to change significantly, shifting its
mindset from a culture of domestic protection and control of all transactions to one that facilitates
foreign trade and promotes private sector development. The tax administration is presently
characterized by low compliance and vulnerability towards corruption. Five key areas of tax
administration have been identified to need special attention: (1) the fragmentation of the legal
framework related to tax administration; (2) the absence of effective coordination and information
sharing between the tax administration and other government agencies; (3) taxpayers' lack of
knowledge about the tax laws and compliance procedures; (4) inadequate professional skills and staff
training; and (5) ICT system lagging behind the requirements of a modern tax administration. Tax
laws and policies will need further reform to broaden the tax base, reduce the number of rates and
exemptions.
9.    Independent scrutiny of PFM has increased, with external oversight of budgetary affairs
by the National Assembly (NA) and the recently independent State Audit of Vietnam (SAV). The
NA, its functional committees and deputies have been given greater prominence in examining,
decision making and oversight of the state budget. Encouragingly, the SAV audit report has been
made public for the first time, triggering serious debates on the usage of state budgets. The capacity of
these institutions especially the SAV however is weak, which limits audit coverage and the scope of
audits and precludes reviews of value for money. It is difficult for the SAV to manage the increased
coverage and scope of works including compulsory audit for 100% of SOEs.
10. Price control mechanism has not been very effective in controlling price abuse or dumping
due to monopoly and collusion. Price valuation profession has only recently been established and is
finding it difficult to meet growing demands for valuation services. The legal framework for price
control is also new and still incomplete. Its implementation is being hampered by a lack of a strong
information base. Developing a complete legal framework for price management and building
sufficient valuation capabilities will clearly constitute a near to medium priority for the government.
11. Financial market supervision has been fragmented and government bond market is still
under-developed. At present, there are many agencies participating in supervision of the financial
                                                   60
market, leading to overlapping responsibilities and ineffective market management and supervision.
There is a need to clarify and consolidate market supervision function into one single agency and to
separate state management function from supervision function. Vietnam government bond market is
still of a small scale and characterizes by skewed maturity structure toward short-term one and low
liquidity. The number of market participants is relatively small and supporting infrastructure, such as
depository and clearing as well and information systems, is yet to be developed. Considerable efforts,
therefore, would be required to develop a full-fledged government bond market and coordinate it with
development of other related markets such as capital, security, money, real estate.
12. Governance and anti-corruption. Since the adoption of the Law on Anti-Corruption, several
detailed implementing guidelines have been issued, anti-corruption measures have started to be
implemented by ministries and provinces, and the detection and punishment of corruption cases has
been energized. The enforcement aspect of anti-corruption has been strengthened through the creation
of specialized units in all the key anti-corruption institutions, through improved coordination among
institutions, and their decentralized units at the provincial level.
13. Impacts from the PIR are expected to be amplified by the projects and activities
supporting PFM reform of the Bank. At the policy level, the series of Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (PRSCs) has been nurturing constant policy dialogue on the strategic elements of a broad and
cross-cutting reform agenda including PFM modernization. Meanwhile, these operations have been
strengthening coordination among line ministries and government agencies, and triggering chances to
reach endorsement on reforms at the highest decision-making level. At the technical level, there are
currently three active Bank-funded projects in PFM area, namely the Public Finance Management
Reform, Customs Modernization and Tax Administration Modernization projects. In addition, there
are two Multi-donor Trust Funds (MTDF) established to attack one of the main bottlenecks in the
implementation of reform in Vietnam -- limited government capacity -- which mainly finances the
needs of technical assistance and capacity building activities, and analytical and diagnostic work laid
out in the government strategy.
14. In addition, a series of AAA works have been undertaken to provide sound analytical
underpinnings to the implementation of the Government-led PFM reform program. These include the
joint IMF-World Bank study of 1999 "Towards Fiscal Transparency"; the joint 2000 Government-
donor Public Expenditure Review; the 2001 Country Financial Accountability Assessment; the 2002
Country Procurement Assessment Report, and mostly recently are the joint government-donor 2004
Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA) and the 2007 Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA). The CFAA 2007 proposes a set of recommendations to
help the government design and continue implementing reforms and capacity building programs to
modernize and strengthen public financial management and enhance transparency and accountability
arrangements in support of sound economic management and improved governance.


Key PFM Issues ­ Recent Developments and the Way Ahead
15. Vietnam is pursuing many initiatives to strengthen its financial management and
accountability arrangements, systems and controls. There has been substantial progress on budget
execution and treasury management (with the Treasury and Budgetary Management Information
System, TABMIS, being piloted and its associated reforms being undertaken), on budget development
and decentralization (greater coherence through the pilots of the forward-looking MTEFs and budget
allocation norms), on revenue management (with clearer allocation rules and decentralized
responsibilities, and with the productivity of some taxes now close to OECD levels), on debt
management (with the adoption of the first-ever Public Debt Management Law and the establishment
of the Debt Management Office consolidating the management of domestic and external debts), on
external auditing (annual audit report and selected individual audit reports of the State Audit of

                                                  61
Vietnam being disclosed publicly), and on accessibility of financial information (with legislation and
the environment established for greater financial accountability and transparency).
16. Steady progress is being made in establishing the legislative framework to support PFM
reforms; however the key challenge is to substantively implement the improvements and
enhancements that have been progressively introduced through legislative reforms and development
work in recent years. The cross cutting issues of strengthening strategies for decentralized PFM and
developing and implementing action plans to strengthen capacity and accountability for public
financial management in line ministries and agencies at all levels of government are also priority areas
for action in the short to medium term.
17. Key stakeholders to the budget process remain committed to further reform through an
evolving and pragmatic reform agenda. The focus of Government reform is on the (i) expansion of
budget coverage in line with internationally accepted norms and further unification of the budget, (ii)
roll-out the integrated financial and budgetary management system nationwide (with pilot at selected
ministries and spending units) with streamlined business processes, (iii) adoption of IPSAS for public
accounting and further improvement of the chart of accounts, (iv) scale up the MTEF and MTFF pilots
to other sectors and provinces and mainstream it into the annual budget cycle, (v) introduction of
Treasury Single Account (TSA) for more effective cash management, (vi) improvements to debt
management, asset management, and ODA management, (vii) improved management of capital
expenditures, (viii) expansion of external audit coverage and quality and legislative oversight, (ix)
improvements to internal control (with priorities given to internal audit), (x) more comprehensive
accounting and timely financial reporting based on internationally recognized standards and practices,
and (xi) increased transparency and accountability in the procurement process of public investment.
18. PFM Legal and Institutional Framework. New laws and implementing decrees and
instructions are replacing old ones and legislative gaps are being filled. Since 2004, implementation of
the 2002 State Budget Law and the 2005 Accounting Law has been in progress and a State Audit Law
has been enacted. As recommended in the 2004 PER-IFA, the State Audit Law has provided
independence for the stat auditing body and enhanced transparency by creating the legal basis for audit
reports to be made publicly available. Implementation of the State Audit Law is steadily proceeding.
However, some confusion and overlap in budget responsibilities remain in the budgeting system which
is limiting the participation of sectors in resource planning, budgeting and budget management and
confuses accountabilities between the national and sub-national levels. With the redevelopment of the
government accounting systems and regimes, the Accounting Law is no longer adequate and needs
revision, and the basis for accounting needs to be better defined. The State Budget Law and
Accounting Law should be comprehensively updated to provide a comprehensive and consistent basis
for modern PFM and to serve as the platform for continued PFM reforms, enhanced transparency and
accountabilities.
19. Budget Development. To be an effective instrument of policy, the budget should be as
comprehensive as possible. Vietnam's budget coverage is reasonably comprehensive but still
incomplete compared to international practices. The major expenditures of spending units of
government at central, province, district and commune level are reflected in the State Budget. Budget
gaps arise from the lack of clarity in the state budget coverage of user fees and charges of many
service delivery units, lack of integration or disclosure of the financial positions of public financial
funds, untimely and sometimes inadequate incorporation of donor financing, and off-budget
government bonds. Budget execution variations arise from such practices as revenue underestimation
particularly for crude oil revenues, keeping the state accounts open after year end with post year
expenditures recorded against previous year unused budgets, and over implementing construction and
development plans. Separate preparation of the recurrent and capital investment budgets hampers
effective management of resources and the composition of public expenditure remains unbalanced.
The introduction of forward looking budget plans through piloting a Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) in several sectors and provinces and adopting budget allocation norms has
                                                  62
supported greater coherence. The MTEF pilots should be scaled up and mainstreamed in the annual
budget cycle.
20. Budget Execution. In State Budget expenditure management, the legal framework for
decentralization of state budget expenditure is being implemented with decrees on autonomy and
accountability to budget spending units. Major public finance management systems are being
upgraded and replaced. A new integrated computerized financial management system called TABMIS
is being implemented with roll out starting in 2008 ­ TABMIS will provide the capability to record
and control commitments, improve cash flow management and arrears management, and strengthen
expenditure management and controls. An updated and improved Chart of Accounts is being
developed for implementation in 2008 which will provide consistency of classification of revenues
and expenditures in budgeting, accounting and reporting with expenditures classified on an
administrative, economical and functional basis. A roadmap for adoption of international public sector
accounting standards has been issued, which will provide the basis for preparation of whole of
government financial statements in line with international practices. Assignment of responsibility for
developing, controlling and overseeing public accounting, financial reporting and the operation of
TABMIS is needed to consolidate and lead the substantial improvements in budget execution
accounting and reporting and most importantly to maintain coordination and consistency in future
developments.
21. Reforms in the management of revenue are progressing with clearer allocation rules and
decentralized responsibilities; however classification of revenue in line with international standards
needs to be introduced and enhanced consultation on revenue targets is needed to improve the quality
of revenue budgets.
22. There are positive controls in the government payroll system with segregation of personnel and
payroll functions and maintenance of continuous employee records. However, with no standard
specialized payroll system operating within government the payroll is calculated manually and
processed in bulk by agency. Systematic and regular (monthly) reconciliations between personnel staff
records and payrolls need to be introduced to ensure validity of payroll changes and early detection of
errors and fraud. In the longer term, implementation of modern computerized personnel/payroll
systems is recommended to enhance the control of payroll expenditures which constitute a significant
proportion of the government recurrent budget expenditures.
23. Internal auditing as a key internal control of PFM has been recognized in the State Audit Law
but little progress and coordination to support its implementation in terms of law and implementation
guidance has yet emerged.
24. Asset Management. The Government's PFM reform program highlights that state assets budget
resources and human resources need to be managed in an integrated way for efficient and effective
service delivery, and reforms are being gradually introduced. The legal framework and market
principles in asset management and requirements for management reporting systems are being defined.
However, asset management reform has been slow. Initially attention is needed to develop consistent
and comprehensive asset accounting and asset management policies in line with international
standards and practices for future reforms. Further study is needed carried out to define the
government's accounting and asset management requirements to determine and implement the most
appropriate system solutions for fixed asset accounting and reporting and for asset management which
can be integrated as part of the government's financial management system. A comprehensive reform
program for asset management is needed starting with passing of the Law on State Asset Management.
25. Debt Management. The 2004 PER-IFA recommended that assignment of responsibility for
management of debt be clarified and arrangements for monitoring and managing other fiscal risks be
strengthened. Since 2004, the capacity of MOF to record and manage total government debt has been
strengthened, with a clear division of debt management functions across government agencies.

                                                  63
However much remains to be done. The draft Law on Public Debt Management needs to be introduced
to achieve a unified legal framework for debt management; a Debt Management Office in MOF should
be established to unify government debt management functions; systems and criteria for debt
recording should be developed in line with international standards; an early warning system to closely
monitor local government and SOE debts is needed; a domestic debt recording and information system
should be implemented; and a Treasury Single Account (TSA) should be introduced for more effective
government funds management. The priority is to establish a Debt Management Office. 2
26. ODA Management. Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) plays in important role in
Vietnam's poverty reduction and growth and ODA disbursements constitute an increasing portion of
the annual budget. The legal framework for financial management of ODA is fairly comprehensive
and a range of reforms have been introduced in recent years to enhance the effective use and
management of ODA. Harmonization of government and donor practices and requirements to reduce
transaction costs is a high priority. As ODA is part of the government revenue and expenditure,
budgeting, accounting, reporting and oversight follow the state budget management requirements.
Areas for improvement include better aligning government and donor budgeting approval cycles,
bringing on-budget all ODA (particularly on-lent ODA), revising the government COA to enable
ODA to be effectively recorded and reported through the government accounting system, more timely
accounting for ODA in the government accounts, and institutionalizing systematic M&E tools for use
by donors and government. Mechanisms need to be developed to encourage all donors to provide
timely information in line with the government budget approval calendar and to use the government
Development Assistance Information Database. Testing of the capability of the new TABMIS system
for budgeting, accounting and reporting ODA through government systems is a priority.
27. Financial Reporting and Transparency. Vietnam has increased levels of fiscal transparency.
Budget plans and budget execution accounts are being made available publicly, and there is increasing
compliance with reporting regulations. However there is still room for improvement, particularly in
relation to consistency in quality of reports and their timeliness. To enhance the quality of financial
reporting, consistency between budget and accounting classifications needs to be maintained. The
number of budget execution reports needs to be rationalized. Content and presentation of financial
information needs to be improved in line with existing government regulations in the publicly
available budget execution reports to make them more informative. The Government should start
producing and issuing annual financial statements in line with international practices. The State annual
accounts and financial statements need to be issued more timely than the current 18 months after year
end to enhance their relevance.
28. Accessibility of Financial Information. Good progress has been made in establishing
legislation and the environment for greater financial accountability and transparency of financial
information. Regulations on financial disclosures of the State Budget Law, Accounting Law and State
Audit Law have been issued increasing the scope and range of required disclosures by entities at all
levels of government. Information is being made available on public accessible websites. However,
implementation remains the challenge. To further increase transparency, the content of budget
documentation and the final accounts could be enhanced by including analysis, explanations and
information in line with international practices. Disclosure of financial information, particularly
spending at unit level should be actively monitoring to ensure compliance with the enhanced
disclosure requirements. Published financial reports should be timely and a calendar for disclosures
issued publicly.
29. Accounting and Auditing Framework. Given the importance of accounting and auditing, in
both the public and private sectors in the continued growth and development of Vietnam, the

2
  This recommendation has been implemented: the Government issued the Decree 118 dated 27/11/2008
regarding the function, organization and tasks of MOF, in which the Bureau of Debt Management and External
finance is established.
                                                   64
government plays a leading role in regulation of the accounting and auditing systems, regimes,
standards and professions. Accounting and auditing standards for enterprises have been issued but are
now out of date and incomplete when compared to international standards. Mechanisms for
maintaining up-to-date standards and consistency between the standards and regulated accounting
regimes need to be set up. Considerable reliance is placed on independent auditing to provide effective
review of financial information of enterprises, however there appears to be overlap in the regulation of
the auditing profession. Legislative support is needed for the regulation and oversight of the
accounting profession in Vietnam. A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes, reviewing the
accounting and auditing framework (including financial reporting standards) has been carried out to
determine divergence from international standards and practices. When published this study is
expected to provide policy recommendations to develop a comprehensive country action plan for the
long term development of high quality accounting and auditing in Vietnam.
30. External oversight. Since 2004, there has been steady strengthening of external oversight. The
State Audit Law 2005 established the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) as an independent supreme audit
institution reporting to the National Assembly with publication of summaries of the SAV annual audit
reports occurring, as recommended in the 2004 PER-IFA. Key challenges remain in implementation of
the state auditing function, with the need for SAV to update its organization and staffing requirements
and its audit strategies and methodologies more in line with international practices so as to be able to
provide effective audit coverage of the public sector. Greater attention needs to be given to assessment
of financial systems and functioning of internal controls as well as providing opinions on the
reliability of government financial statements. Audit reports on the State Accounts needs to be more
timely. Oversight by the National Assembly and Provincial People's Councils has continued to
strengthen. In line with the 2004 PER-IFA recommendation, a Finance and Budget Committee was
created in 2006 to improve the oversight of the budget estimates and final accounts. The time reserved
for scrutiny by the National Assembly (NA), PPCs and committees should be longer to provide
adequate time for quality scrutiny and discussion. The comprehensiveness and quality of budget
information and financial reports as well as the cooperation between committees and government
oversight bodies needs to improve to strengthen information sharing and quality of analysis and
decision making.
31. Financial Management Human Resource Capacities. Within the MOF, there is still a lack of
experienced technically qualified and experienced managerial staff to meet the reform challenges of
the Ministry. The MOF is moving towards developing a human resource management system which is
synchronized, fair and transparent. Financial management capacity constraints is a key cross cutting
issue within sectors and sub-national government and support is needed to implement decentralized
PFM accountabilities and reforms.
32. Monitoring Framework. Progress and impact of the PFM reforms and development initiatives
are difficult to measure as baseline performance measures have yet to be established. The Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Measurement Framework provides a recognized
measurement of the performance of the public financial management of government. Although the
Government has agreed in principle to introducing this measurement framework though a self
assessment process, no decision on timeframe and a firm commitment of resources for the assessment
has been made. It is strongly recommended that the government undertake PEFA measurement
framework as soon as possible to establish baseline measurements to provide the basis for soundly
based measurement of PFM performance and progress of the PFM reforms.
33. There is strong ownership in the Vietnam government of the PFM reform agenda. The
government actively engages with donors and demonstrates a strong commitment to PFM reform in
Vietnam. The "Single Document" issued in 2007 articulates the government's strategy for mobilizing
both national and international resources to advance reform in PFM. Support to the implementation of
reforms is coordinated through the PFM partnership group which overarches the activities of
government, donors, and working groups, meeting half yearly to discuss progress.
                                                  65
Conclusion
34. Since 2004, financial management and accountability systems of the Government have steadily
improved, and progress made has mitigated the risks associated with direct budget support. But that
there is not yet full compliance with the new laws and regulations, and new PFM systems (such as
TABMIS) and associated reforms still being prepared and await effective implementation. Although
the public accounting system and financial management arrangements are well documented and
regulated, financial management risks arise from gaps and overlaps in the systems, and more
particularly risks arise from weaknesses in implementation and compliance gaps. Therefore the
financial management risk to proper use, control and reporting of funds that are managed through the
Vietnam public financial management systems is assessed as moderate, particularly at the sector level
35. The quality and extent of independent audit oversight remains low given the financial audit
programs of SAV do not as yet accord with international standards and the development of an
effective internal audit function is only at an embryonic stage in Vietnam.
36. As assessment of the SBV internal controls is not available as, although the SBV has been
subject to audit by SAV, the results of these audits are not made public and there is currently no IMF
program in Vietnam to draw upon.
37. The overall financial management risk to proper use, control and reporting of funds is assessed
as moderate, in line with the outcome of the most recent CFAA. The Vietnam PFM systems are
therefore considered adequate to support this operation. Additional fiduciary arrangements are
proposed, including a dedicated foreign exchange account and the Bank retaining the right to subject
this account to audit.
