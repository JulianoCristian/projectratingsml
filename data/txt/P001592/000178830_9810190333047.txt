APPRAISAL OF THE DEVELOPEfENT PROGRAM
OF THE ELECTRICITY STJPPLY COI11SSION OF 1TMALAWI
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project which consists of the development
program of the power system of the Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi
(ESCCM) during the 3-year period 1970-1972. The project covers the installa-
tion of additional generation, transmission and distribution facilities at
a total cost of US$12.4 million equivalent, including contingencies.  The
Government of Malawi has requested assistance from the International Develop-
ment Association (IDA) and from the African Development Bank (ADB) in
financing the foreign exchange requirements of the project.
ii.       The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$8.25 million
equivalent, which would be financed by an IDA credit of US$5.25 million
for generating plant and substations, and an ADB loan of US$3 million for
transmission lines and distribution facilities. Local currency requirement
of US$h.10 million equivalent, representing 33% of the total project cost,
would be provided from internal cash generation.
iii.      This would be the first operation of the Bank Group in the power
sector in Malawi.
iv.       The load growth in Malawi has been very high, averaging more than
20% per annum since 1954.  The growth reached a peak of 34% in 1966, with
the sudden influx of foreign capital following independence, and fell in
the past two years, to 26% and 21%, respectively. The rate is expected to
decline further to 1% in 1969 and about lO" during subsequent years. New
sources of generation are required by the end of 1971 to supply the Southern
Region and the new capital at Lilongwe. The project provides for an inter-
connecting line to be constructed between these two load centers; a 3 MW
diesel unit to be installed at Lilongwe by that time; and for the first unit
of a hydroelectric station to be completed at Tedzani Falls on the Shire
River by the end of 1972, followed by a second unit two months later.
v.       11alawi has large reserves of hydroelectric potential along the
middle reaches of the Shire River. In order that future power development
can be planned to make the most effective utilization of this potential,
the Government has agreed during negotiations to undertake a study of the
potential usage of the water resources of Lake Malawi and Upper Shire River
and to allocate the available water between irrigation power production and
other requirements.  The Government has also undertaken to authorize ESCOM
to divert a quantity of 2,100 cusecs from the Shire River for a period of
50 years commencing on January 1, 1973 or such larger quantity as is required
for power generation from time to time up to the total amount allocated to
power following the aforementioned study.



- 11 -
vi.       The project represents the least cost solution for meeting the
estimated demand for power. The incremental rate of return is expected
to be at least 11%. Cost estimates and construction programs are based
on market trends and on the results obtained during construction in 1965/67,
of the 24 MW hydroelectric station at Nkula Falls, located 4.5 miles upstream
of Tedzani.
vii.      Contracts related to the proposed IDA Credit would be awarded in
accordance with the Association's procurement guidelines. Contracts related
to the proposed ADB loan would be awarded in accordance with ADB's pro-
curement procedures.
viii.     ESCOM is a semiautonomous government agency responsible for the
development of public electricity supplies in Malawi. The management and
practically all the professional staff are expatriates. The utility is
well managed and efficient. In addition to operating the power system, it
constructs wood-pole transmission lines and distribution facilities. For
design and construction of other works the help of consultants will be
provided.
ix.       ESCOM has earned between 6.7% and 7.8% return on average net fixed
assets in operaticn since 1965; however, its cash reserves and earnings are
insufficient to finance the local currency component of the project. A
development surcharge of 3% has been agreed upon during the negotiations to
enable ESCOM to generate sufficient cash and this has been taken into account
in the financing plan.  The return on net fixed assets ir o.eration is
estimated to be over 10% during the 1970/74 period.
x.        One of the existing loans from the Government has a repayment
term of eight years. This places a heavy strain on ESCOM's financing. As
part of the financing plan, the Government has rescheduled these repayments
over 25 years at a slightly higher interest rate and this has been taken
into account in the financial forecasts contained in this report.
xi.       The project would be suitable for an Association credit of
US$5.25 million equivalent, to be made to the Government of the Republic
of Malawi for re-lending to ESCOM on current Bank lending terms.



MALAWI
APPRAISAL OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
OF THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY CO1TISSION OF MALAWI
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Malawi has requested that the International
Development Association, along with the African Development Bank (ADB),
finance the foreign exchange requirements of a project comprising the
1970-1972 development program of the Electricity Supply Commission of
Malawi (ESCOM). The main items in the proposed project are:
(i) the installation of a 3 MW diesel unit at Lilongwe;
(ii) construction of a 16 MW hydroelectric station at
Tedzani Falls on the Shire River and related substations;
(iii) construction of 66 kv transmission lines from Tedzani
to Nkula Falls and to Blantyre and from Nkula Falls to
Lilongwe; and
(iv) construction of distribution extensions and improvements.
1.02      The project's total cost is expected to be 1445.2 million
(US$12.4 million), with the foreign exchange component amounting to
US$8.25 million equivalent. The Pissociation credit would meet the foreign
exchange costs of the first two items, estimated at IM2.2 million
(US$5.25 million). The ADB loan would meet the foreign exchange costs
of the other two items, estimated at P11.25 million (US$3 million).
1.03      The Borrower would be the Government of the Republic of Malawi,
which would re-lend the proceeds of the proposed credit to ESCOM at com-
mercial rates (see paragraph 6.02).
1.04      Neither the Association nor the Bank has made any previous credits
or loans for power to Malawi.
Genesis of the Project
1.05      The proposed project first came to the attention of the
Association, in June 1966, when the Government asked for advice in drafting
terms of reference for consultants it wished to engage to make a feasibility
study. Due to the need to investigate several alternative hydroelectric
possibilities and later,consideration of a proposal to defer the hydroelectric
project and to install peaking diesels instead, the feasibility report reached
the Association only in November 1967. In February 1968, the Government re-
quested financial assistance in executing the project.  At the request of
the Association, a supplementary memorandum to fill important gaps in the
feasibility report was prepared by the consultants, Messrs. Kennedy & Donkin
(Africa) of Uganda, in association with Messrs. Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold



- 2 -
and UIhlmann of United Kingdom. This memorandum was received at the end of
April 1968, and in May an appraisal mission comprised of Messrs. G. E. Wyatt
and A. A. M. Onslow visited Malawi. Thereafter consideration of the project
was postponed pending a clearer picture of developments in the general economic
and financial situation of Ilalawi. A Bank economic mission in July 1969 found
that the situation had improved sufficiently to justify renewed lending. Con-
sequently Messrs, Esref Erlmen and Ali Memon visited the country in August 1969
to make the appraisal that is covered in this report.



2. THE ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY OF MALAWI
2.01      Malawi is a landlocked country of about 48,000 square miles,
bordered by Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique. About one-quarter of the
country is covered by lakes, the largest being Lake Malawi with an area of
some 11,000 square miles. This lake is drained by the Shire River, which
flows through the southern part of the country to join the Zambesi about
40 miles beyond the border in Mozambique. Malawi's population is estimated
at 4 million, about 270,000 of whom are employed in neighboring countries.
Those having wage-earning employment in Malawi number only some 150,000.
2.02      The economy is based on agriculture.  The principal exports are
tobacco, tea, cotton, groundnuts and pulses, which together account for
almost all of the export revenue. There are few mineral resources other
than some undeveloped deposits of bauxite near Mlange. The only known coal
deposits of good quality are in a remote area of the Northern Region. There
is, however, a relatively large hydroelectric potential along the middle
reaches of the Shire River, close to the main development areas and popula-
tion centers.
2.03      Malawi's total installed generating capacity is 49 MW, of which
about 80% (39 MW) belongs to ESCOM and the remainder (10 MW) to power users
who are either out of reach of ESCOMts supply lines or who find it more
economical to use industrial by-products for steam generation. The low
total capacity reflects the agricultural nature of the economy and the
per capita Gross National Product which at about $60 is among the lowest
for members of the World Bank Group. There are no large secondary industries.
Existing Facilities of ESCOM
2.04      The low-lying Southern Region contains about 92% of ESCOM's
installed generating capacity, 84% of its 8,000 electricity consumers and
accounts for 95% of its sales. These figures reflect the distribution of
population and general economic activity. Compared with an average popula-
tion density of 48 per square mile in the mountainous Northern Region,
the Southern Region averages 169 persons to a square mile and in some rural
areas near Chola the density is as high as 381. The only large urban area
is the commercial capital of Blantyre, which now includes Limbe and has a
population of some 120,000. With the exception of Zomba (also in the \
Southern Region) and Lilongwe in the Central Region, there are no other
urban areas with a population exceeding 5,000.
2.05      ESCOM's total generating facilities amounting to about 39 MW
are made up of 25 MW of hydroelectric plant, 7 MW of steam plant and 7 MW
of diesel plant.
2.06      The hydroelectric plant consists of three 8 MW units at Nkula
Falls on the Shire River and two 0.3 MW units at Zomba. The Nkula Falls
station was commissioned in June 1966 with two 8 MW units, the third being
added in 1967.  This is a run-of-river development, utilizing about one-
third of the river's average flow, but the river flow is controlled at the



- 4 -
Liwonde Barrage (see map) built by ESCOM in 1965 about 20 miles below the
outlet from Lake Malombe and 50 miles upstream of Nkula. The Nkula site
is capable of development to an ultimate economic capacity of about 90 MW.
However, it is more costly than the proposed project (see Annex 1).
2.07      The steam plant consists of two 2.5 MW and two 1.0 MW coal-fired
turbo-alternator units, installed at Blantyre in 1954. Coal is purchased
from the Wankie coal field in Rhodesia. This station is now kept on a
standby basis for emergency use only.
2.o8      Of the diesel plant, 2.44 MW is at Blantyre where the units are
being used for standby purposes, but will later be needed for peaking
purposes. The remaining 4.22 MW - comprised of 15 units varying in size
from 20 kw to 1,100 kw - are installed at Lilongwe (2.66 MJW), Fort Johnston
(0.06 MW), Mzuzu (0.40 MW) and Zomba (1.10 MWAr).
2.09      ESCOM's transmission system and principal generating stations,
as well as the main centers supplied, are shown on the attached map. The
existing transmission system consists of 66 kv lines from Nkula Falls to
Blantyre and Sucoma, and 33 kv lines supplying Zomba and the tea-growing
areas around Mlange.

3. THE PROJECT
Description
3.01      The proposed project comprises the whole of ESCOM's development
program for the three-year period 1970 through 1972. The principal features
of the program and the project are:
(a) addition of a 3 MW diesel unit at Lilongwe which is
required by end of 1971 to avoid a power shortage in
1972 prior to commissioning of the Tedzani hydroelectric
station;
(b) constructlon of the -Nrst stage (16 MW) of a hydroelectric station
at Tedzani Fai,J_ on  as Shire River with related Substations;
(c) training of ESCOM pe;sonnel;
(d) construction of 66 kv lines - 4.5 miles from Tedzani
to Nkula Falls, 28 mi.es from Tedzani to Blantyre,
and 165 miles from Nkula Falls to Lilongwe;
(e) extensions and improvements to mains and substations;
and
(f) other items such as service line materials, meters,
special transport equipment, office machines, etc.,
which are required for general development and have
to be imported.
The site of the Tedzani Falls power station and the routes of the trans-
mission lines are shown in red on the map attached to this report.
3.02      The proposed Association credit would cover the foreign exchange
costs of the items in (a), (b) and tc) above. The proposed ADB loan would
cover the foreign exchange costs of the items in (d), (e) and (f).
3.03      The Tedzani Falls power station would be constructed on the Shire
River 4.5 miles downstream of the existing Nkula Falls station, and would
be capable of development to an ultimate capacity of between 90 MW and
125 MW. A weir across the river above the falls would divert water through
a conduit (which will have a settling tank) and a low pressure tunnel a
half-mile in length into a surge chamber, from whence twin penstocks would
conduct the water to two 11,000 hp Francis-type water turbines coupled to
8 MW generators. Power from the generators would be carried by underground
cable to an outdoor transformer station adjacent to the power station, from
whence it would be transmitted to Blantyre by 28 miles of single-circuit
66 kv line constructed on steel towers. A second 66 kv line of 4.5 miles
length and similar construction would connect the Tedzani station to the
existing Nkula Falls power stations' outdoor substation. The Tedzani
power station would normally be supervised and controlled from Blantyre,



but facilities would also be provided for local control. The earliest
date at which this station could be commissioned is the end of 1972 and
to avoid a power shortage in this year, it is proposed to install a 3 MW
diesel engine at Lilongwe for commissioning at the end of 1971 when
Nkula Falls - Lilongwe line will also be commissioned.
3.0o      There is a large reserve of hydroelectric potential on the Shire
River (see Annex 1) which, because of the natural storage provided by
Lake Malawi and the relatively high cost of fossil fuels, is likely to be
competitive with all forms of thermal power. However, above and below the
river's middle reaches where this potential lies, there are competing claims
to the lake water for domestic needs and irrigation projects. A rough
estimate of the future maximum irrigation area indicates that ultimate
losses from irrigation upstream could reduce the long-term average flow
at Liwonde from 8,300 cusocs to about 5,000 cusecs. In order that the next
stage of development at Tedzani or Nkula can be properly planned to in-
corporate the requirements of final development of those sites, it is
important that the river w¢ater be allocated as soon as possible between the
power needs, upstream irrigation, and domestic utilization. During nego-
tiations the Government has agreed that:
(a) a study will be made within the next three years of
the potential usage of the water resources of Lake
Malawi and Upper Shire River, and the available water
will be allocated between irrigation, power production
and other requirements; and
(b) ESCOM will be authorized, for purpose of power generation
at Nkula and Tedzani Falls commencing in January 1973, for
a period of 50 years, to divert water up to an amount equal
to 2,100 cusece,or such larger quantity as is required from
time to time up to the total amount allocated to power
following the study provided under (a) above. 2,100 cusecS
is the requirement for economic utilization of the existing
Nkula Falls station and is greater than the maximum flow
(1,600 cusecs)needed for the first stage of the Tedzani
Falls development.
It is understood that the Government intends to apply to UNDP
for financing the survey indicated in (a) above.
3.05      ESCOM has a training program which aims at giving technical
training to local recruits and raising the professional standard of existing
local employees (see 5.05). This program includes, among other activities
(such as arranging short courses at the Polytechnic), sponsoring candidates
who are to be trained abroad at public utilities and electrical manufactur-
ing establishments in order to broaden their experience or at universities
in order to work for professional degrees. The proposed credit will provide
the funds for the Commission to enlarge this activity and to undertake the
expenses of the trainees sent abroad under this program.



- 7 -
3.06      During negotiations, ESCOM has agreed to prepare in consultation
with the Government and the Association a special program of managerial,
administrative, professional and teclnical training for its staff and
furnish the Association copies of this program not later than June 30, 1970.
3.07      The 66 kv transmission line from Nkula Falls to Lilongwe would be
a single-circuit line on steel towers with 0.125 sq in steel reinforced
aluminum conductors. Passing mainly through undeveloped bush country, the
165-mile line would closely follow the route of the Blantyre/Lilongwe main
road so that both construction and maintenance may be facilitated. The
existing 1.1 MW diesel unit at Lilongwe would be retained for standby pur-
poses, but the smaller units would be transferred to smaller potential load
centers which are located at considerable distances from the interconnected
system.
Estimated Project Cost
3.08      The cost of the project is estitaated to be IM5.16 million (US$12.4
million equivalent) of which ,M3.34 million (US$8.25 million equivalent)
would be foreign exchange. The cost of the principal features is shown in
the table below; a more detailed cost breakdown is given in Annex 2.

3.09      The provision of about 8% for contingencies in the power station
and transmission line estimates is considered adequate in view of the recent
cost analysis available from the construction of the Nkula Falls hydroelectric
station, completed in July 1967. The estimates do not include duties on
imported materials, since the Government has indicated its intention to
waive duties for all goods and services financed by the IDA credit and ADB
loan. This has been confirmed during negotiations.
Status of Engineering and Procurement
3.10      For the design and supervision of the Tedzani Falls power station
and associated transmission and substation works, ESCOM has engaged as con-
sultants two engineering firms, Nfessrs. Kennedy & Donkin (Africa) of Uganda
for the electrical and mechanical works, and Messrs. WATatermeyer, Legge,
Piesold and Uhlmann of United Kingdom for the civil works. These firms
designed and supervised construction of the recently completed Nku2la Falls
hydroelectric project, and were jointly responsible for the Ranking Report
(see Annex 1) as well as the Tedzani Feasibility Report. They are acceptable
to the Association. Hydraulic model tests and engineering designs are already
completed. Bids are being invited, so that as soon as financing is arranged
the contracts may be awarded and work started.
3.11      Normal Bank/IDA procurement procedures would be followed in awarding
all contracts for equipment and services in the construction of the 3 W
diesel unit at Lilongwe and the Tedzani hydroelectric station and related
substations, the foreign exchange requirements of which would be met by the
proposed Association credit (see 3.02). ADB's procurement procedures which
require international competition open to all countries of the world except
Rhodesia and Republic of South Africa would be followed in awarding the
contracts for the remaining project works, the foreign exchange requirements
of which would be met by the proposed ADB loan (see 3.02). Specifically,
these provisions include all the transmission lines, the substations related
to the Lilongwe line, and the distribution extensions and improvements except
those to be accomplished by ESCOM's regular staff.
3.12      Statutory Bodies (Control of Contracts) Act Cap. 18:07 authorizes
the Minister of Trade and Industry to give directions to ESCOM with regard
to parties to, and terms of contracts for procuring materials and services.
In order to avoid any possible conflict that might arise over the use of
Association funds, during negotiations agreement was obtained from the
Government that it shall not take any action or issue any directionw under
this Act or any other existing or future legislation that would interfere
with the performance of the obligaticns of ESCOM related to the proposed
project.



-9-
Disbursement
3.13      No work on the project has been commenced other than engineering
design and model tests, and there have been no purchases to date. Disburse-
ment of the proposed credit would be made for the actual foreign exchange
cost of the equipment, materials and services procured under the credit, and
for the foreign exchange component of the erection costs as specified in the
contracts. It is recommended that any part of the Association credit not
required to meet the foreign exchange costs of the project be made available,
if the borrower so requires, to finance further investment related to the
project.
Construction Schedule
3.14      It will be necessary to commission the 3 MW diesel unit at Lilongwe
by the end of 1971 and the first machine at Tedzani by the end of 1972, if
the expected demand is to be met. To ensure that the commissioning date for
Tedzani's first unit can be achieved, the bidding documents for civil engineer-
ing works and equipment should be issued early in 1970, and the main contracts
placed by the middle of the year. Commissioning of the second unit would be
scheduled for the beginning of 1973. This schedule for the Tedzani power
station should be possible to achieve. It is six months longer than the time
taken to install the first two units at the similar power station at Nkula
Falls, 4.5 miles upstream of Tedzani, completed in 1967.
3.15      Tedzani-Nkula and Tedzani-Blantyre lines are scheduled to be
completed in 1972 to correspond with the construction program for Tedzani
Power Station. The Lilongwe line, however, will be completed by the end of
1971 and it is expected that hydroelectric power from Nkula Station can be
transmitted to Lilongwe at least during off-peak tours, and the power from the
3 MW diesel unit can be transmitted to Southern Region if needed during peak
hours until such time as Tedzani is completed.

4. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
The Power Market
4.01      Prior to Malawi's independence in 1965, sales of electricity
increased at an average rate of about 11.5% per annum in the six years
1959 through 1964. With the sudden influx of foreign capital following
independence, during the three years 1965 through 1967, sales increased
at an average rate of 25% per annum. The increase in 1968 was about 21%.
4.02      The market for power in Malawi can be divided into six categorices:
Industrial, residential, high density residential, commercial, miscellaneous
(sales under general purposes and street lighting tariffs) and special
agreements. Sales under these headings for the years 1963 through 1968
are shown in Annex 3. An analysis of the total sales in 1968 is as follows:
Average
Price in
Sales in    Percentages   Average Price   Southern Region

Miscellaneous             1,180       1.3            5.4             5.8

Total              93,930      100.00           2.4            2.2
The principal industrial loads are tea and sugar estates and factories for
manufacturing cigarettes, cement and textiles. The load in the special
agreements category is chiefly for irrigation of a tea plantation in the
Southern Region for which power is charged at a flat rate of 2.5 pence per
kwh sold.  The high density residential tariff is mainly for government
housing, for police and railway workers.
4.03      The forecast of sales for the five-year period 1970 through 1974
is shown in Annex 3. It is based on a detailed market survey conducted in
1967 by ESCOMI's consultants, Messrs. Kennedy & Donkin. The forecast has
since been revised by ESCOM and shows a slightly lower growth rate.
Estimated demands for 1969 and 1970 are based mainly on development projects
already under way and scheduled for completion in these years; those for
1971 through 1973 are based mainly on projects now in the planning stage,
while those for 1974 onwards are based entirely on trends. It will be
noted that the increase in sales forecast for 1969 is 14%, after which the
annual increase is expected to drop to about 10%. The latter estimate is a



conservative one for a newly independent African country in Malawits stage
of development. A list of the known development projects used in the fore-
cast of electricity sales is given in Annex 4.
4.A       Expansion of ESCOM's power system into new areas is not taken into
account in estimating the increase in future demand, inasmuch as the future
load growths in those areas is negligible. Supplies to the four small towns
of Dedza, Balaka, Chikwawa and Salima (see map) were considered at first,
but were deferred until after 1972 due to lack of funds and insufficient
demand to justify the capital expenditure.
4.o5      The relation between system maximum demand and installed plant
capacity in the Southern Region is shown in attached graph. It will be
seen that even without Lilongwe the system demand is expected to reach the
firm capacity of installed plant by the end of 1971. Since the system is
run of the river type and load factor is assumed to remain constant at 60%,
the same graph, with a change of scale, represents sales.
Tedzani Power Development
.06      To meet the need for additional generating capacity by the end
of 1971, ESCOM considered the alternatives of (a) importation of power from
neighboring countries, (b) thermal generation by steam, gas turbines and
diesel, and (c) six hydroelectric schemes. An outline of the power poten-
tial of Malawi and the investigations leading to the selection of Tedzani
as the best of the alternative hydro schemes is given in Annex 1.
4.07      Some 9g% of ESCOM's sales are in an area southeast of the line
Zomba-Blantyre-Chikwawa.  The area is bordered on three sides by Mozambique,
the nearest point to the Zambia and Rhodesia frontiers being about 200 miles
distant and to the nearest high voltage transmission lines of the Kariba
system even farther. Transmission over such distances of the quantities of
power needed by ESCOM would require a double-circuit transmission line of
132 kv or higher, the initial cost of which along with terminal substations
would be greater than the cost of building a hydroelectric station at
Tedzani Falls. To the construction cost wiould have to be added the cost of
purchased power, which would make the final cost considerably higher than
that of Tedzani power. An alternative source of imported power is expected
to become available at Cabora Bassa in Mozambique. This project, however,
is not expected to be completed before 1976 and it is unlikely that the
cost of importing the relatively small quantities of power needed in
Malawi up to 1996 wculd be cormpetitive with locLl hydro projects.
4.o8      ESCOM's consultants considered the possibility of deferring further
hydro development for same years by installing diesel plant to supplement
the output from the Nkula Falls power station. The consultants also con-
sidered the possibility of further hydro development now and the addition
of gas turbines at a later date for peaking purposes. Discounted cash
flows of these alternative programs over the period 1968 to 2018 show
that there is an appreciable advantage to be gained, at any discount rate



- 12- 
below 30%, fram the immediate development of the Tedzani Falls project
and the addition of 9 MW of peaking gas turbines in 1979 and 1982. A
comparison with steam generation would be even more favorable to hydro-
electric generation, because of the small size and consequent relatively
low efficiency of the steam units and the high cost of fuel.
4.09      From the above, it is apparent that the Tedzani Falls station
would generate power at a cost lower than that of any known alternative.
If construction is started in 1970 it would be able to meet the need
for additional generating capacity in 1973.
Lilongwe Transmission Line and Other Works
4.10      The justification for the proposed transmission line from Nkula
Falls power station to Lilongwe is (a) the growing demand for power in the
Central Region, and (b) the need to substitute relatively low-cost hydro
power from the Southern Region for the present high-cost diesel power at
Lilongwe.
4.11      The demand for power in the Lilongwe area has risen at an average
annual rate of about 9% over the five years 1962 through 1966. In 1967
and 1968 the demand rose by about 20% and is expected to go on increasing
at an average rate of 20% until 1972, after which the rate is expected to
slow down. The reason for the present high rate of increase is the Govern-
ment's recent decision to build a new capital city at Lilongwe. Moving
the capital from Zomba to Lilongwe is bound to attract a considerable amount
of trade not only to Lilongwe itself but also to the nearby town of Salima,
the railhead from the Indian Ocean port of Beira serving the central and
northern parts of Malawi and the eastern part of Zambia.  The development
of Lilongwe and Salima is also expected to give rise to increased business
activity in the adjacent lake shore area, which has great tourist attraction
and where there already are a number of hotels. The Association made a
credit available to Malawi in February 1968 for the purpose of reconstruc-
tion and bituminous paving of the road from Zomba to Lilongwe.
4.12      When the capital and recurrent costs of providing power to Lilongwe
by installing additional diesel units are compared with the costs of trans-
mitted power from the southern system, it is found that the present worths
of the discounted expenditures for the two alternatives over 30 years equalize
at a discount rate of 17%.  For interest rates above 175J the diesel U1ternL.tive
would be more econon-iic, but f6r interest rctes below 17/t, the tranor.iision
line  ltervati-ve would be m;iore economic.  Sinco the cost of money to ESCC1i
.nd the econoray is sub.-tLnti~ lly less th-n 1<,, tl.e Lilongue Line All provide
irportant savin X over diescl generation.
4.13      Moreover, the connection of Lilongwe to the southern system improves
the economics of Tedzani by loading the power station to its full capacity
more quickly. The connection would save increasing annual amounts of
foreign exchange for importation of fuel, commencing at about eM85,000 in
1972. It also would enable ESCOM to reduce tariffs in the Central Region and
extend electricity supply to Salima, Dedza and Balaka and other villages near
the transmission route at a later date.



13 -
4.14      The justification for the other works in the project is the need
to maintain and extend ESCOI,f's distribution facilities so that they can
keep pace with the development of generating capacity and meet the increas-
ing demand for power in Malawi.
Incremental iRate of Return
4.15      According to the assumptions made in Annex 5, wmihich are conserva-
tive the incremental rate of return (which measures the financial rate of
return on the incremental investment) on the Tedzani Falls power develop-
ment, complete with the trais.nission lines and the distribution extensions,
would be at least 11%.

5.  THE BENEFICIARY - ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION OF MALAWI
Legislation
5.01      ESCOM was established by Electricity Act Cap.73:01 on September 1,
1963, as a semiautonomous Government agency to generate and supply elec-
tricity. It took over the staff, assets and liabilities of its predecessor,
the Nyasaland Electricity Supply Commission.
5.02      The Board consists of a part-time chairman and five part-time
members, all of whom are appointed by the Minister to whom ESCOM is attached
(presently the Minister of Trade and Industry). Appointments are for an
indefinite period, but the Minister may terminate them at any time. The
present chairman is a leading businessman as well as a nominated Member of
Parliament. One of the members is a representative of the Commonwealth
Development Corporation, and another is a representative of the Ministry
of Trade and industry. The remaining three members are local businessmen.
5.03      Although ESCOM is a "body corporate" and in many respects has the
appearance of an autonomous agency, it is in fact dependent on the Minister's
approval for much of its activities and is also subject to the Minister's
directions. The most important limitations arise from the following provi-
sions in the Electricity Act Cap. 73:01 of the Laws of Malawi:
1.  The Commission has, at all times, to comply with the general
directions of the Minister without limitation.
2.  Any person failing to carry out any order or decision of the
Minister made under the provision of the Act is guilty of
an offense and is liable to a penalty of WM500 and/or
two years in jail.
3. The Minister has the power at any time and for any reason to
terminate the appointment of any member of the commission.
In practical terms the problem is not urgent because of good
working relations between the present Minister and the ESCOI management.
However, in order to safeguard the continuity of efficient operations,
during negotiations it was agreed with the representatives of the Govern-
ment that the Government shall exercise its powers under the Act or any other
legislation relating to the operation of ESCOM only to the extent necessary
to ensure the continued operation and development of ESCOM on sound commer-
cial lines.
Crganization and Management
5.04      ESCOM is well managed by competent and experienced officers.  All
34 posts at the managerial and professional levels are occupied by expatriate
personnel, as are 12 of the non-professional posts. Twenty of the expatriate
employees are on permanent pensionable employment terms; the others being on
contract for terms of 2.5 years.



- 15 -
5.o5      The Commission has a training program which aims at reducing the
number of expatriate employees. One candidate for a professional degree
is being sponsored at an overseas university. Part-time courses for
clerical and skilled workers are held at the Malawi Polytechnic. An expan-
sion of the training program is provided for in the proposed project
(see 3.05).
5.o6      The Commission employs consultants and contractors on all major
power station development. It also employs consultants to make studies for
major transmission lines and contractors to construct them. ESCOM's staff
are well qualified by training and experience to undertake the design of
wood-pole transmission lines and the design and construction of distribution
facilities.
5.07      The management and staff of the Commission is competent to carry
out the project with the assistance of consultants. During negotiations,
ESCOM agreed that:
(a) it shan not effect any change in the positions of the
General Manager, Chief Engineer and Secretary (chief
financial officer) of ESCOM or make any change which
would materially alter the responsibilities and functions
heretofore performed by said officers except after con-
sultation with the Association;
(b) in carrying out the project, it shall employ engineering
consultants acceptable to, and to the extent and upon
terms and conditions satisfactory to, ESCOM and the
Association.
Operational Efficiency
5.o8      The losses in ESCOM's southern power system, measured as the
difference between energy sent out of the generating stations and energy
sold. has been decreasing gradually from an already low 9.5% in 1966 to
8.6% in 1967 and 7.8% in 1968.
5.09      ESCOM's staffing - 838 in 1968 - seems to be on the high side
for a power system with a peak load of about 21 MW that provides service
to some 8,000 consumers. This staffing is justified, since the generation
is divided amongst 27 units of which 22 are diesel or steam at six different
locations. Moreover, the ESCOM staff is also responsible for the design
and construietion of all distribution facilities as well as the wood-pole
transmission lines, both of which have been parts of the effort to ensure that
the Commission's development program keep up with the very high demand growth
described in paragraph 4.01.

6. FINANCES
Present Financial Position
6.0o      The accounting system of ESCOM is sound and all work is current.
The accounts are audited by the Blantyre office of Deloitte, Plender,
Griffiths, Annan & Co., a British firm of Chartered Accountants, which is
acceptable to the Association. Assurance was obtained from, ESCOI during
negotiations that it will centinue to employ independent auditors
acceptable to the Association, and that within four months of the enci of
each fiscal year the auditors' reports and certified copies of the annual
financial statements will be sent to the Association.
6.02      ESCONts balance sheets for the years 1965 through 1968 are
shown in Annex 6. A summary of the balance sheet as at December 31, 1968,
is given below:

6.03      Long-term debt represents 96% of ESCOM's capitalization.  A loan
schedule is at Annex 7. As all debt is in WM, no exchange risk is incurred.
All the unsecured debt is due the Malawi Government and consists of the
following:
Outstanding as of December 31, 1968
(L12000)
14 Straight-line 2ioans7                 1,466
6 Annuity Loans-                           316

Total Long-term
Unsecured Debt                   2,3b6
6.o4      Made for purposes of general development, prior to Malawi's
independence in 1964, the straight-line loans are for 30 years at interest
rates varying from 4.5% to 6.75%, with an average of approximately 5.3%.
Their remaining life varies from 17 to 25 years. The annuity loans, also
for general development, are for 25 to 30 years at interest rates of between
;0% and 6.5%.
6.o5      One of the special project loans -- Loan No. 16 for the Nkula
Hydro Project Stage II -- has a repayment term of 8 years. Financial fore-
casts indicate that this would place a heavy strain on ESCOM's financing.
As part of the financing plan for the proposed project, the Government has
rescheduled these loan repayments over a 25-year period, which would be more
appropriate for a hydro project. The interest rate would increase from 6%
to 7% to conform to the Government rates on loans with similar maturity.

6.07      The debenture stock was issued in the 196h/66 period to finance
the Nkula Falls Hydroelectric and Sucoma Transmission Line Projects. The
terms range between 4 and 15 years, and interest between 6.75% to 8.25%7.
The stock is secured by a mortgage on all of ESCON's present and future
property except certain staff houses, which are mortgaged to the New Build-
ing Society and whose loans are for 15 years at 7.5%. Before incurring any
long-term debt, ESCOM must obtain consent of the lenders and trustees
(Barclays Bank D.C.O.) of the trust deed as stipulated in the loan agreement
between ESCOM on one hand and Commonwealth Development Corporation, Barclays
Overseas Development Corporation Ltd., Standard Bank Ltd. and Malawi Govern-
ment on the other hand. AU necessary consents have been obtained.
6.o8      Insurance coverage is carried against all normal risks, as required
by the debenture trust deed. During negotiations assurances were received
that ESCOM will continue to carry adequate insurance coverage.
Past Operating Results and Finances
6.og      Income statements for the years 1965 through 1968 are shown in
Annex 8. Average revenue per kwh has fallen from 3.56 pence in 1965 to
2.39 pence in 1968, due mainly to a tariff decrease in 1966 and a relatively
high rate of growth in industrial load on the lower tariff scales. Annual
revenue in the same period has increased from LM680,o00 to IM935,00 and
operating expenses from 1M553,0O0 to TM586,O00. Thus, net operating income
has increased from LM127,000 in 1965 to IM3h9,000 in 1968.  During this
period the return on average net fixed assets in operation varied between
6.7% and 7.8%. Under terms of the existing trust deed (para. 6.07), the
Government has agreed to exempt ESCCM from all taxes on its earnings as
long as any of the debentures are outstanding (through 1984).

6.io      ESCOM suffers from cash shortages due to the need to service a
large amount of debt. During the 4 years to December 31, 1968, the debt
service has approximated 85% of the internal cash generation. Consequently,
ESCOM had to finance most of its capital expenditures through loans, thus
further increasing the debt burden.
Tariffs
6.11      Under the Electricity Act of 1963, subject to approval by the
Minister of Trade and Industry, ESCOM can set its tariffs at a level suffi-
cient to yield enough revenue to cover all outgoing cash requirements
including depreciation or loan redcemption, whichever is greater. However,
this has not always provided sufficient internal cash generation and the
tariffs were increased by 10%, with effect from October 1968. During nego-
tiations ESCOM agreed to levy a development surcharge in the Southern Region,
excluding high density areas, no later than February 1, 1970 in order to
generate sufficient cash to meet the local currency requirements of the pro-
posed project. Assurance was also obtained that the tariffs including the
surcharge will not be reduced during the project construction period and
Vill be maintained thereafter at a level to allow a return of at least 9%
after taxes, if any, on ESCOM's realistically valued average net fixed assets
in operation.
Proposed Financing Plan
6.12      The forecast of sources and application of funds from 1969 through
1974 is shown in Annex 9. The projections are based on forecast income
statements presented in Annex 8 and on the estimated capital expenditure
for the project. Financing during the disbursement period can be summarized
as follows:

6.13      The borrowings assumed in the financing plan consist of:
(a) The proposed IDA credit of US$5.25 million equivalent for
financing generating plant and associated substations, with
assumed re-lending terms of 7% interest, a three-year mora-
torium on the interest payment and repayment after a four-
year grace period extending over 25 years.
(b) A loan of US$3 million equivalent from the ADB to the Government
for financing the Lilongwe Transmission Line and related works.
The lending terms would be 7% interest and 0.75% commitment
charge on the undisbursed amount, with repayment after a five-
year grace period extending over 15 years. The re-lending
terms to ESCOM would be the same except that there will be a
moratorium on interest for two years.
(c) Drawdown of US$2.89 million equivalent during the first
two years (1973 and 1974) from future loan for the next
stage of ESCOM's expansion. The terms assumed are the
same as the re-lending terms of the proposed IDA credit.
The interest during construction would be financed by adding it to the
principal amount of debt due the Government in case of (a) and (b) and
the lender in case of (c). Obtaining the ADB loan on terms substantially
similar to those mentioned in (b) would be a condition of the proposed
IDA credit effectiveness. Agreement on a draft of the subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government and ESCOM has been reached with the
Association.
6.14      Assurance was obtained from the Government during negotiations
that, in event of any shortfall of funds, it will make arrangements that
are satisfactory to the Association to provide ESCCO with sufficient funds
to complete the project.

Estimated Future Operating Results and Financial Position
6.15      Forecast income statements of ESCOM for the years 1969 through
1974 are shown in Annex 8. It has been assumed that the average tariff
in the Southern Region, excluding high density areas, will be increased by
3%. Total sales are estimated to increase by approximately 14iJ in
1969 and at an averaye annual rate of lC0 thereafter. The gross
operating revenues are estimated to increase by about 13% per year between
1969 and 1974. The operating expenses are estimated to increase by 8%
per year during the same period. Returns on net fixed assets in operation
are estimated at 10.0% in 1969, rising to 15.0% just before completion of
the new facilities in 1972 and dropping thereafter to 10.1% by 1974.
6.16      Internal cash generation would cover total debt service between
1.6 and 1.8 times during the 1969/74 period which is satisfactory.
6.17      Forecast balance sheets for 1969 through 1974 are shown in
Annex 6. It is estimated that ESCalls total net fixed assets would more
than double, from LM4.918 million at end of 1968 to LT10.650 million at
end of 1974. The balance sheets show a satisfactory position, although
the ratio of debt to equity will remain high for the foreseeable future
since equity accumulations are expected to rise only through earnings and
modest capital contributions from future consumers. It is estimated that
at the end of 1974 the debt equity ratio will be 78/22 as compared to 96/4
at the end of 1968.
6.18      In view of the high debt component in ESCOM's capitalization,
assurance was obtained during negotiations that ESCOM will not incur long-
term debt without the Associationts approval unless maximum future debt
service in any succeeding year is covered at least 1.5 times by cash
generation from operations at the time of incurrence of the new debt.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was obtained on the following
matters which are of special significance to the project:
(a) in the next three years the Government will carry out a
survey of future demands for water from Lake Malawi and
the Upper Shire River (3.04);
(b) the Government will permit ESCOM to divert water up to
an amount equal to 2,100 cusecs (3.04);
(c) the Government will exempt the purchase of goods and
services made with the Association funds from require-
ments of the Statutory Bodies (Control of Contracts) Act,
Cap. 18:07 (3.12);
(d) the Government shall exercise its powers under the
Electricity Act Cap. 73:01 only to the extent necessary
to ensure the continued operation and development of
ESCOM on sound commercial lines (5.03);
(e) a development surcharge equal to 3% of the basic tariffs
w^ill be levied in the Southern Region excluding high density
areas by February 1, 1970 (6.11); and
(f) tariffs including the development surcharge will not be
reduced during the project construction period and
maintained thereafter at a level to allow a return of
at least 9% (6.11).

ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION OF  AIALAWI
The Power Potential of Ialawi and the Comparison
of Alternative Schemes
The only known fossil fuels in Malawi suitable for thermal genera-
tion are coal deposits in a remote area of the Northern Region. The develop-
ment of these deposits is at present uneconomic due to their distance from,
the main centers of population and railhead...  Good quality coal is imported
free of duty from the Wankie coal field in Rhodesia at a cost delivered
of about 47 US cents per million Btus. Alternatively a high ash content coal
of lower calorific value is available from the I4oatize coal field in Mozam-
bique at a cost delivered of about 42 US cents per million Btus free of duty.
Fuel oil is not imported in bulk because there is at present no demand for it
but due to Malawils geographical situation (see map), and the limited demand
in the foreseeable future, the price is estimated to be not less than 70 US
cents per million Btus. Diesel fuel in Blantyre now costs US$1.22 per
million Btus.
The only known large potential source of power in Malawi is the
Shire River, which flows out of Lake Malawi and through Malawi to join
the Zambesi in Mozambique.  Lake Malawi is a large natural reservoir
situated in the great Rift Valley. It has an area of about 11,460 sq mi,
it is believed to be about 2.,400 feet deep and has a mean surface level of
1,550 feet above sea level. The Shire River which carries the overflow
from the southern tip of the lake falls about 1,260 feet in a distance
of about 50 miles between Matope and Hamilton Falls, in the neighborhood
of Blantyre (see map). The long-term average flow of the river at the
outlet from the lake is about 8,300 cusecs.
Immediately after the Liwonde Barrage was completed in August 1965
it was closed for a period of about five months to facilitate construction
of the power station at Nkula Falls and raise the lake level thus providing
a unique opportunity to carry out detailed geological and topographical
surveys of other potential hydroelectric sites on the river. This investi-
gation was carried out by the British Consultants, Messrs. Kennedy and
Donkin under U.K4technical assistance arrangements, and the results
embodied in a report issued ir. March 1966.
In late 1966 the Government of Malawi commissioned Messrs.
Kennedy and Donkin to prepare a Ranking Report indicating, with preliminary
costs, how the potential of the various sites could best be developed, in
order to ascertain whether it would be more economic to extend the recently
completed Nkula Falls station or to develop one of the alternative hydro-
electric sites.  The consultants were also required to reviLw the existing
hydrological data and consider whether future schemes on the river should
be designed fcr flows higher than 5,000 cusecs.
The Ranking Report, which was published in January 1967, did not
contain a complete review of the hydrological data because it became apparent



Y N E  1
Page 2 of 3 pages
early on in the comparison that there was no change in the ranking of
alternatives up to 7,500 cusecs. River flows above 7,500 cusecs were not
considered because the regime of the river even with the measure of flood
control provided by Liwonde Barrage, would not justify installations to use
flows in excess of this amount. In fact the measure of flood control
provided by the barrage is very limited because the lake level can not be
raised above 1,557 feet above sea levrel without causing international problems,
and because the barrage, which is only 13 feet high, is situated about 20
miles below the outlet from the lake. Because of the very shallow gradient
between the lake and the barrage, the discharge is greatly reduced by the
relatively small drop in lake level which occurs each year between the wet
and dry seasons.
The Government in 1966 had commissioned K.UIPSAX, the Danish consul-
tants, to investigate and report upon means of improving navigation on the
Upper Shire River and Lake Malawi. From an examination of the consultant's
report, which was published in February 1968, it was apparent that steps
such as dredging, recommended for improvement of navigation, would have a
beneficial effect on power projects downstream of Liwonde by making it
possible for the Liwonde barrage to provide almost complete regulation of the
flood, The power consultants were therefore asked to consider the effect
that a higher degree of regulation would have on the ranking of alternatives
and thetrultimate size. The results are embodied in a memorandum published
in April 1968. This shows that considering the records for a period of 40
years between 1916 and 1955, during which the recordings are considered to
be reliable, the long-term average flow at Liwonde is about 8,300 cusecs.
If the exceptionally high rainfall of the last ten years is taken into account
the estimated long-term average flow would be considerably higher. However
the ranking of the altern.atives considered would not be changed at these
higher flows and the effect would be to reduce the cost per kilowatt installed
and the cost of power produced. It is probable therefore that it would be
economic to dredge the channel between Lake I4alawi and Liwonde at some later
d.te to increase the output of hydroelectric installations in the middle reaches
of the Shire River, even if this is not required for navigation.
The Ranking Report showed that there are six sites in the middle
reaches of the river which could be economically developed as hydroelectric
sites. These sites are listed below with their heads and potential output
at river flows of 5,000 cusecs and 8,300 cusecs.

With the exception of Mpatamanga wlhich inv-olves construction of a 250-foot
high dam, all the above are run-of-river schemes with low barrages added
in the final stages to provide daily pondage.  Major storage for flood
water is provided by Lake Malawi and controlled by regulation of the gates
at Liwonde Barrage. The location of all these sites is sholn on the map
attached to this report.
Of the above six schemes the cheapest to develop are the three
higher-head schemes which do not require a dam.  These are Tedzani, 11-Mamilton
Falls and a second station adjacent to the existing station at Nkula. The
comparative initial costs (excluding interest during construction ) of
developing these three sites for an output of 16 154, and also the final cost
per kw installed, were estimated in the Ranking Report as follows:
Cost of     Final Instal-
Initial     lation Capa-   Cost

The estimated cost of power delivered to Blantyre from Stage I
of the Tedzani Project comprising 16 Mw of generating plant and including
transmission lines and substations, assumng interest at 10% and straight-
line depreciation at an average rate of 2.155 on the total investment, is
1.28 US cents per kwh sent out when working at a load fact-or of 60%, and 0.80
UScents per kwth sent out when working at the maximum feasible load factor of
about 93%0. The equivalent cost of diesel generated power in Blanty2e wiould
be about 2.50 US cernts per kwh sent out at 6X% load factor and about 2.42 US
cents per lwh sent out at the maximum feasi'Dle load factor of about 73%0.

Assumptions Made in Estimating Incremental Rate of Return On The Project
The incremental rate of return for the project is defined as
the discount rate at which the present worth of the capital cost and
operating expenses of the project equals the present worth of revenues
derived from the investment over its life.
Capital Costs
For the purposes of this calculation capital costs are assumed
to consist of costs estimated for the whole project, including those for
Tedzani hydroelectric station, the 3 NDW diesel unit, the 66 kv transmission
lines from Tedzani to Nkula and Blantyre,and from Nkula to Lilongwe, distri-
bution installations and all other miscellaneous items.  Yearly carital
outlays are included in the cost stream which is extended 80 years to cover
the life of civil engineering works. Other installations are assumed to be
reconstructed at the end of their useful lives, which are taken tobe equal
to depreciation periods used in accounting, i.e.:
for turbo-alternators and auxiliary equipment       40 years
transmission lines                                  30 years
substations                                         25 years
distribution installations                          20 years
Plant renewal phasing and costs are assumed to be equal to the original
phasing and costs. Renewals are not repeated after 60th and 70th years
of operation for transmission lines and substations.
Operating Expenses
Estimated annual operation and maintenance expenses for all
project components are included in the cost stream. These expenses
are assumed to remain constant from the first year on (1973).
Operation and maintenance expenses estimated for the Tedzani
Station are based on 1968 expenses incurred in Nkula Falls generating
station which has similar characteristics. Estimates of the operating
expenses for transmission and distribution facilities, and estimates of
administrative expenses are based on the Commission's 1968 results and
include total amounts prorated between the existing plant and the project.

Benefits
Benefits from the project are assumed to consist of that
portion of total revenues which could be attributed to the project.
In order to obtain this, it is assumed that generation, transmission
and distribution components of the project go into operation at the
beginning of 1973 and immediately take over the load at Lilongwe and
the load in the southern system above that corresponding to 24 14W peak
load (capability of Nkula Falls Station). This pattern of loading is
assumed to continue until the Tedzani units are loaded up to 16 lAW
peak, after which increases in load are taken care of by new construction.
3 MW diesel unit is assumed to serve standby requirements. Revenues
corresponding to the above loading pattern are evaluated by using average
sales price in Southern Region. The benefit stream is extended 80 years
in correspondence to cost stream.
