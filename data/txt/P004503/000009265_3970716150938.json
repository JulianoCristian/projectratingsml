the\n            Government's short-term economic stabilization program\n            and a medium-term program of agricultural policy and\n            institutional reform.  To support the stabilization program,\n            the Loan would make available US$149 million to finance the\n            importation of essential inputs (feedgrains, fertilizers,\n            pesticides, veterinary products, and agricultural machinery\n            and spare parts) required to meet the needs of the\n            agricultural sector during the crop year 1984-85.  The\n            program of sectoral policy and institutional reforms\n            supported under the proposed operation provides, for\n            specific actions concerning:  (a) management and\n            organization in the agricultural sector; (b) Government\n            controls on prices of animal feeds, pork, poultry and eggs;\n            and (c) private sector participation in the trade of\n            foodgrains and animal feeds.  In addition, this program\n            would provide action on; (d) rediscount rates on\n            agricultural credit; and (e) policy related studies to help\n            establish the base for future sectoral reforms.  To support\n            this program the Loan would make available US$0.6 million\n            equivalent for; (i) studies on the operations of the\n            National Food Authority, coconut, sugar, irrigation,\n            fertilizer and agricultural credit; and (ii) technical\n            assistance services."}, "docdt": "1984-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
