The\n            national and provincial primary road network consists of\n            137,000 km and carries about 36 percent of the total freight\n            traffic. Investment in primary roads during the last decade\n            has been substantial but the more systematic planning\n            introduced for the transport sector during the last two\n            years is expected to assist in ensuring a more rational use\n            of resources. Highway users at present amply pay for the\n            cost of the interurban highway system. In order to improve\n            transport coordination and planning further, the Argentine\n            authorities propose to strengthen Vialidad Nacional and the\n            Sectoral Development Office in the Secretariat of Public\n            Works and Transport. They also propose to review the present\n            system of allocating resources among the national and\n            various provincial road organizations."}, "docdt": "1971-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
