{"cdata!": "The Third Highway Project for Argentina\n            successfully met its objective of upgrading key sections of\n            Argentina's highway network despite cost overruns and\n            long delays in completing certain road sections. These\n            problems were mainly due to the country's difficult\n            political and economic circumstances experienced during\n            project implementation. The overall estimated economic rate\n            of return is less than that expected at appraisal (17\n            percent versus 24 percent). The difference is explained by\n            the extended construction period with consequent inflation,\n            and the thus far disappointing traffic growth on some of the\n            project roads. Although construction of the Campana-Rio Tala\n            expressway could be considered premature because of high\n            cost overruns, construction of the remaining road sections\n            proved to be justified. The project's biggest impact\n            has been through the construction of Route 14, the spine\n            road of Mesopotamia, which effectively contributed to the\n            development of this important region. The paving of nine\n            other earth and gravel roads helped to integrate various\n            regions with the major traffic corridors. Although traffic\n            development on the expressways was below appraisal\n            expectations in the initial year following construction,\n            this report expects these modern facilities to facilitate\n            the growth of major industrial and commercial centers.\n            Furthermore, the project contributed significantly toward\n            the development of local consultant capabilities. The report\n            concludes that, under difficult circumstances, Argentina\n            completed this major construction program successfully and\n            that the Borrower's capability to administer and\n            supervise large highway programs has now reached maturity,\n            having overcome the great difficulties encountered in the mid-1970s."}, "docdt": "1983-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
