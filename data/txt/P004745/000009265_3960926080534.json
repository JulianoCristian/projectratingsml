           of power demand and to prevent substantial shortages of\n            electric energy, this project seeks to (a) to expand and\n            strengthen the Electricity Generating Authority of\n            Thailand's (EGAT) transmission system; (b) to achieve a\n            better integration of the national power grid; (c) to deal\n            with demand and supply uncertainties; (d) to upgrade the\n            existing load dispatch centers; and (e) to promote\n            improvements in load forecasting methods and in the power\n            tariff structures.  Specifically, the proposed project\n            comprises the supply and construction of several items.\n            They include (a) 740 ckm of lines and associated substations\n            at 115 kV/230 kV; (b) national and regional System Control\n            Centers; (c) a Central-Southern transmission tie-line and\n            expansion of associated substations; and (d) a transmission\n            line for the Mae Moh unit no. 9.  Lastly, the project\n            provides (e) consultancy services for the 500 kV and System\n            Control Centers components."}, "docdt": "1988-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
