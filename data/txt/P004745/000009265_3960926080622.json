Specifically, the proposed project\n            comprises the supply and construction of several items.\n            They include (a) 740 ckm of lines and associated substations\n            at 115 kV/230 kV; (b) national and regional System Control\n            Centers; (c) a Central-Southern transmission tie-line and\n            expansion of associated substations; and (d) a transmission\n            line for the Mae Moh unit no. 9.  Lastly, the project\n            provides (e) consultancy services for the 500 kV and System\n            Control Centers components."}, "docdt": "1988-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
