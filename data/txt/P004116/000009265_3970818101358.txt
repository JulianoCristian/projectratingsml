SMALL AND MEDIUM IDUSIRY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:              Government of Korea
Beneficiaries:         Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation
(SMIPC), The Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMtB), and
The Citizens National Bank (CNB).
Amount:                US$111.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                 The proposed loan would be made at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate and would have a term of 15
years including 3 years of grace. US$1 million would
be allocated to SMIPC and would have a fixed amortiza-
tion schedule. US$110 million would be allocated to
SMIB and CNB and would have two separate adjustable
composite amortization schedules reflecting the
aggregate subloans made by SMIB and CNB respectively.
Relending Terms:       The Republic of Korea would relend the loan proceeds
earmarked for the credit component to SMIB and CNB on
the same terms as the Bank loan. The credit component
would be allocated to SMIB and CNB with respective
amounts of $70 million equivalent and $40 million
equivalent. SMIB and CNB would onlend the funds to
their subborrowers at the Bank standard variable
interest rate pLus 2Z for periods of up to 13 years
including reasonable grace periods. The subborrowers
would bear the foreign exchange risk as well as the
risk of interest rate fluctuations on the Bank loan.
The funds for technical assistance and training
component would be relent to SMIPC on the same terms as
the Bank loan and SMIPC would assume the foreign
exchange risk.
Project Description:   The project would offer a package of credit, ($110 mil-
lion), technical assistance and training ($1 million)
tailored to the needs of the Korean small and medium
industries. The technical assistance and training
component would enable SMIPC to expand its activities
of assisting private enterprises to all SKI subsectors.
These activities include upgrading skills and improving
the productivity of SMIs in using existing and new
technology at the plant level. This component of the
project would also support overseas training of
selected SMIPC and SMI staff. The credit component of
the proposed loan would help cover the foreign exchange
requirements of subprojects financed by SKIB and CNB
from mid-1985 to mid-1987 and would support the



-~~~~~~~~~~~
continued institutional development of SMIB and CNB.
The project would also promote the development of
improved subcontracting policies which is important to
SKI development in Korea where large companies have the
potential to play a major role in assisting smaller
firms.
The project is expected to generate approximately 550
new SKI subprojects, creating an estimated 6,000 new
jobs. Project benefits areexpectedto be comparable to
those of previous Bank loans to SIB and CNB where
-     financial and economic rates of return averaged 22Z and
37Z respectively. There are no major risks associated
with the project. Steps are being taken to ensure that
the loan disburses according to schedule. Possible
financial risks pertaining to the credit component and
the possible operational risks pertaining to the
technical assistance component have been substantially
mitigated by actions to be supported under the proposed
project.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY PROJECT
I . SECTORAL BACKGROUND
A. The Industrial Sector
1.01      Rapid industrialization has been the cornerstone of Korea's long-
term economic growth. With active government support for the sector, the
share of mining and manufacturing in GNP rose from 14% in 1961 to 29.4X in
1983, while the share in employment rose from 8.7% (1963) to 23.3%. Through-
out this period, the economic policies of Government were tailored to the
needs of the industrial sector and in particular exporters of manufactured
goods. Key policies included: ever more comprehensive export incentives; an
extensive system of guided and relatively low cost credit; a foreign exchange
regime designed to strengthen export competitiveness; and a concentration of
Government spending on basic infrastructure and technical education and train-
ing. In the early 1960s, the principal manufactured exports were wigs,
plywood and textiles. Today this list has been expanded to include steel
products, ships, electronics, chemical products, footwear, vehicles and parts,
and an increasingly diverse range of other manufactured goods.
1.02      While the drive to industrialization has met with great success, a
number of weaknesses of this approach have become increasingly apparent since
the late 1970s. Government support for investment in the heavy machinery and
chemical industries at that time led to a build-up of external indebtedness,
increasing energy intensity in production, excessive production capacity, and
excessive reliance on export markets for which Korea was barely competitive.
This combination was shown to be extremely vulnerable by the second oil shock
and the subsequent worldwide recession. From this experience emerged a
realization that the growing size and complexity of the industrial sector
precluded a continuation of the centrally-directed approach of the past, and
that a move to indirect incentives and controls and a greater reliance on
market mechanisms would be more appropriate for the future. This would be
particularly true as Korea moves beyond heavy industry into higher technology
products where greater flexibility is needed at the enterprise level.
1.03      A number of other weaknesses also emerged.  The system of directed
credit for priority industries had the consequence of crowding out a large
number of companies from the primary credit system towards less formal and
higher cost credit markets. Small and medium industries were particularly
affected. Moreover, the ready availability of debt financing held back the
use of equity financing, leading to financial inflexibility on the part of
major corporation-s while hampering new companies with lower credit worthiness
moving into higher technology or riskier activities.  Finally, despite the
continued emphasis on technology diffusion, technical training, and the



-2
ongoing strengthening of sectoral institutions, a wide gap emerged between the
capabilities of smaller companies and the larger corporate groups that were
the focus of much Government attention.
1.04      Under the Fifth-Five-Year Plan (1982-86), Government has adopted a
new approach to deal with these shortcomings, emphasizing the role of market
mechanisms and achievement of economic efficiency through increased competi-
tion. Government has reduced its direct role in the establishment of indus-
trial investment priorities by reducing resources for the National Investment
Fund while stressing alternative means of financing through the financial
system. To improve the allocation of industrial investment, Government has
begun a phased rationalization of trade policy to provide a more even balance
of incentives between activities, helping some companies gain access to inputs
on more competitive terms while exposing some previously protected industries
to sharper import competition. Fixed incentives, which previously favored
selected "key" industries, have also been made more generally available with
emphasis redirected from broadly capital-cheapening measures to measures
focussed on areas such as technology and technical advancement. An easing of
the restrictions on foreign investment has also been put in place, aimed
mainly at inducing an increased infusion of technology imports. Government
has also committed itself to a major reform of the financial system including
among its objectives the increased availability of financing for a wider range
of companies, especially those that have in the past been on the fringe of
organized credit markets. Government continues to stress technical education
and training as well as development of indigenous research, development and
engineering capabilities.
1.05      As a result of these initiatives, the prospects for further
industrial development are bright. Value added in manufacturing and manu-
factured exports are both expected to grow by 10Z annually in the coming
years, and a deepening and broadening of the industrial structure is antici-
pated as Korea extends its export markets in automobiles, electronics and
machinery. Much depends on the evolution of the global economy in determining
what will be achieved. But if recovery in the OECD countries can be
strengthened and Government is able, through trade diplomacy and the example
of its own trade liberalization policies, to counter protectionist trends in
these countries, the growing diversity of Korea's export products and markets
should enable the Plan targets to be met.
B. The Financial Sector
1.06      Korea's financial system consists of a highly regulated formal
sector made up of banks, nonbank financial institutions forming a second tier
market, an unregulated curb market for loans and deposits, and a regulated
stock exchange with more than 330 listed companies. Credit demands not met by
the formal sector, with its regulated interest rates, are satisfied at a
higher price by the curb market. The formal financial sector has historically
had highly segmented institutions specializing in particular fields demarcated
by an extensive regulatory framework which has had the effect of reducing
competition among institutions.



- 3 -
1.07      Banking System Institutions.  The formal financial sector is
dominated by the banking system which is composed of 7even nationwide commer-
cial banks, ten local banks, seven specialized banks' and 42 domestic
branches of foreign banks. In 1983, the banking system institutions accounted
for nearly two-thirds of the total domestic liabilities. Extensive branch
networks are maintained by the commercial and specialized banks. Foreign
banks do not generally have branch networks in Korea and are located mainly in
Seoul. Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) can be classified into four
categories: (a) savings institutions including mutual savings and finance
companies, trust companies, and credit unions; (b) investment companies
including investment and finance companies, merchant banks, and investment
trust companies; (c) development institutions including the Korea Development
Bank, the Export-Import Bank, the Korea Land Development Corporation, and the
Korea Long-Term Credit Bank; and (d) life insurance companies. NBFIs, which
offer higher yields on their financial instruments than those offered by
banks, increased their deposits by 46Z per annum during 1975-83 as compared to
28% for the banking system.
Second Tier Market
1.08      Bonds and commercial paper have increased from virtually nothing at
end-1975 to about W 6 trillion (US$7.5 billion) at end-1983. High yields on
corporate bonds, which averaged about 5% above the interest rate on time
deposits, made this dramatic growth possible.
Informal Financial Sector
1.09      The curb market supplies credit to borrowers who are not served by
the formal sector, particularly to smaller firms in need of working capital.
Recent estimates of its size range from W 1 to 1.5 trillion, approximately 6%
of total domestic credit to the private sector.
Regulatory Framework
1.10      The banking system has been subject to considerable supervision and
control by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Bank of Korea (BOK). BOK has
indirectly supported commercial banks by maintaining a high spread between the
lending rates of commercial banks and BOK's rediscount rate. At end-1984,
commercial bank lending rates ranged from 10Z to 11.5%, while the rediscount
rate for paper of preferred sectors was 5Z. (The ceiling on time deposit
rates was 10.5%.) The domestic inflation rate for 1984 is expected to be 3%;
domestic inflation rates of 3-6% are forecast for 1985-88. The Government has
1/   The specialized banks, all majority-owned by the Government, consist of:
the Korea Exchange Bank (KEB), established to handle all foreign exchange
and international trade transactions; the Citizens National Bank (CNB),
the Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB); the Korean Housing Bank,
providing housing loans to low income families; and the Agricultural,
Fisheries and Livestock Cooperative Banks, providing specialized lending
in these sectors.



4
also directed loans to certain sectors, or even specific firms, through a
number of instruments, including selective credit controls, creation of
special funds, rediscount policy and direct instructions.
Financial Sector Reform
1.11      In 1982, the Government divested itself of ownership of nationwide
commercial banks, and reduced its control over operational matters.  In
November 1984, the allowed interest rate range on loans was widened to 1.5%
(10% to 11.5%) to allow a risk assessment factor.  In the future, the
Government will gradually reduce the scope of directed lending schemes. Other
measures are expected to include: deregulation of the activities of various
classes of financial institutions to encourage greater competition, a gradual
reduction in interest rate controls, efforts to strengthen tne domestic
banking system, increased internationalization of the stock market, and fiscal
incentives to portfolio investors. These measures will be described in
greater detail in the documents for the second Industrial Finance Loan which
is expected to be presented to be Executive Directors later this year.
C. The Small and Medium Industry Sector
Size, Structure and Performance
1.12      A small and medium industry enterprise is defined in a number of
laws and Government decrees in terms of both employment size (generally less
than 500 employees) and assets (generally less than W4 billion). In 1982
there were over 36,000 enterprises in the SKI sector which made up 98% of
total establishments. The SMI sector has played a prominent role in Korea's
industrialization. Its role still remains substantial but has declined in
relation to large scale enterprise. Thus, while in 1963 SMIs employed 62% of
manufacturing workers and produced 50% of manufacturing value added, by 1982
SMIs had 54Z of employment and produced only 36% of value added (Annex 1,
Table 1). Two factors account for the decline: first, many successful SMIs
have grown into large scale firms taking advantage of economies of scale; and,
second, Government policies in the 1970s favored larger firms thereby hamper-
ing SMI access to credit, financial incentives and other needed resources.
With ready access to below market financing and other preferential treatment,
large enterprises were also encouraged to produce in-house made parts and
components which otherwise could have been subcontracted out to SMIs.
Finally, Korean SMIs faced with rising wage rates also face a considerable
challenge to maintain an advantage over their overseas competitors in tradi-
tional export products (such as textiles and clothing). In order to address
these problems, greater efforts are needed to upgrade technology, improve
efficiency, and seek out new products and markets. The Government has taken a
number of steus in this direction.
1.13      The broadening of markets resulting from Korea's success in rapid
export promotion in the 1970s allowed small manufacturers to greatly expand
operations while at the same time diversifying into the machinery and metal-
working subsectors. As shown in the following table, the share of machinery
industries in SMI manufacturing value added increased from 17% in 1975 to 22%
in 1982, eclipsing textile industries as the largest SMI subsector. In terms

of geographical distribution, SMIs remain relatively highly concentrated in
the Seoul and Busan areas. In 1982, 40Z of employment and 44Z of value added
of SMIs were generated in these major urban areas compared with 38% and 27%,
respectively, for all industries. However, the Government has taken several
measures, such as the establishment of new industrial estates and the provi-
sion of financial assistance, for the relocation of industries out of the
heavily congested Seoul and Busan areas.

1.14      Financing of SMIs.  Two specialized banks, the Small and Medium
Industry Bank (SMIB) and the Citizens National Bank (CNB), both majority owned
by the Government, provide most of the long-term lending to SMIs. SMIB serves
only small and medium enterprises while CNB serves small enterprises (less
than 100 employees) as well as household consumers. Approximately half of the
SMI long-term capital requirements are financed through SMIB and CNB with the
balance being sourced from internal cash generation or from private sources.
Commercial banks generally provide only short-term SMI financing; of the SMI
loans outstanding, commercial bank financing accounted for about 75% in
1984. Long term financing at present carries an average interest rate of 11%
for local currency and around 12% for most loans denominated in foreign
currency. A notable exception is the Small and Medium Industry Promotion Fund
(SMIPF) from which loans are channeled mainly through SMIB. SMIPF loans
are: denominated in won; have interest rates of 9%; can be utilized for
purchasing imported equipment; and finance mainly the metal working sector.



-6-
Current Government Policies in Support of the SMI Sector
1.15      The Government has initiated efforts to address the constraints of
SMIs with: the provision of special financing and financial guarantees; the
strengthening of technical assistance; and the improvement of subcontracting
relationships between small and large firms.
1.16      Financial Policies for SMIs.  Financial policies and mechanisms
favoring SMIs include:  (a) the two specialized SMI banks; (b) the creation of
a loan guarantee scheme through KCGF for SMIs; (c) the requirement that com-
mercial banks earmrk a specific share of their lending to SMIs; and (d) the
initiation of the SMIPF which provides loans to qualifying SMIs. A major con-
sideration in the establishment of the SMIPF was the Government's desire to
address the imbalance of access to long-term credit which had favored large-
scale enterprise during the 1970s. By 1984, the SMIPF accounted for 10% of
the total SMI capital investment financing.
1.17      Technical Assistance.  Recognizing the need for institutional
support for the technological upgrading of Korea's SHIs, the Government imple-
mented measures to strengthen the organizational aspects of SMI extension
services and technical assistance. The operations of S-IPC, the principal
Government agency responsible for extension services and training for SMIs,
have expanded very rapidly and will continue to be strengthened and augmented.
The Bank's recent Small and Medium Machinery Industry Project financed the use
of foreign consultants by SMIPC to assist small and medium machinery producers
upgrade their technological capabilities. In 1982, the Government took action
to rationalize the proliferation of agencies providing SMI extension services
by reducing the number of agencies from 19 to 4 (SMIPC, SMIB, CNB and KCGF)
and making SMIPC the prime agency responsible for coordinating these
activities.
1.18      Subcontracting Policies.  Subcontracting is critical for the
efficient development of manufacturing industries since competitiveness of the
large end-producers and the subsectors as a whole depend heavily on the deve-
lopmient of close working relationships with suppliers of parts and components.
This is especially true in Korea where large conglomerates control a substan-
tial part of manufacturing. Subcontracting in Korea is poorly developed, as
large firms tend to be vertically integrated and rely relatively little on
subcontractors. Many subcontractors are small in size, operate with inade-
quate facilities, lack sufficient managerial or technical skills and are often
subject to disadvantageous arrangements with the prime contractors. The
Government has enacted laws to promote subcontracting, including designating
various components to be manufacturing exclusively by subcontractors and
designating certain subcontracting subsectors to receive intensified technical
assistance and credit. Many of the Government subcontracting initiatives are
derived from similar Japanese measures which may have only limited applicabi-
lity to Korean practices. Despite the actions already taken or planned, the
Government recognized that not all subcontracting difficulties can be resolved
through legislative action. A Bank-sponsored study of subcontracting identi-
fied three problem areas: (a) the late payment of invoices; (b) insufficient
channels for the arbitration of disputes; and (c) inability of SI's to meet
quality standards required by larger firms. Under the proposed project,



-7-
specific steps will be taken to find satisfactory and practical solutions to
these problems (para. 3.05).
II. THE BANK'S INDUSTRIAL SECTOR LENDING STRATEGY
2.01      The Bank's DFC operations in Korea have helped to strengthen several
of the specialized financial intermediaries responsible for long-term lending
to industry. A total of US$1.4 billion has been lent to four Korean DFCs:
the Korea Long-Term Bank (KLB), the Korea Development Bank (KDB), SNIB and
CNB. In genera, implementation has been excellent:  the Project Completion
Reports (PCRss)' conclude in all cases that the Bank's objectives of resource
transfer and institution building were achieved satisfactorily. The project
Performance Audit Reports (PPAWs) for Loans 735-KR, 905-KO, 1095-KD and
1145-KO supported the PCR conclusions and praised the high standard of the
DFC's operations as well as their development record. The most recent PPAR
(June 30, 1983), Report No. 4577 for Loan 1175-KD (SMIB II) pointed out that
the original appraisal goals for the project which included employment crea-
tion, value added, increased sales and exports, were generally attained but
raised the question that technical assistance could have been more effectively
integrated with a specialized agency coordinating SMI assistance. Accordingly
the SK Machinery Industry Project, Loan 2215-KO, supported the Government's
strategy to consolidate the number of technical assistance agencies and to
designate SMIPC as the coordinating institution. Results to date on the
technical assistance component of the project have been very favorable.
However, the project's credit component had to be widened-in scope to encom-
pass all SMI activity in order to improve lagging disbursements as it was in
direct competition with the Government-funded SHIPF which offers local
currency funds with below market interest rates for the financing of imported
metal working machinery.
2.02      Lending Strategies in the 1980's.  In the past, the primary
objectives of Bank loans to the Korean DFC have been: (a) transfer of foreign
exchange resources needed to strengthen industrial investment; (b) improvement
in the institutional efficiency of financial intermediaries; and (c) support
of the industrial investment priorities of the government objectives such as
export promotion, regional development, employment generation and skill
development. In the 1980s, greater emphasis is being given to the overall
policy environment for industry and finance. In this regard, the Bank has
pursued a dialogue on policy through: (a) Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs)
which are heavily focused on the industrial sector giving particular attention
to trade and incentive policies; (b) Industrial Finance Projects which increa-
singly emphasize broad financial policies; and (c) sectorvide projects which
aim at supporting specific industrial sectors and at developing the country's
technological capabilities. Bank loans to the Korea Institute of Electronics
Technology (KIET), the Korea Technology Development Corporation (KTDC) and the
Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation (SHIPC) were all designed to
21   Lohns 735-KR, 905-KO and 1145-KO to KLB; Loan 1095-KO to KDB; and
Loan 1175 to SNIB.



-8-
finance the transfer of technology, upgrade skills and supply foreign currency
financing so that Korean industry would remain competitive in international
markets as its competitive advantage shifts from labor intensive to more
technology intensive industries. The proposed project is of this type.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Description
Project Scope and Objectives
3.01      The proposed project would support the Bank's new approach to
industrial lending in Korea while addressing the specific needs of the SMI
sector that, until recently, had inadequate access to credit. Within the over
context of the Bank financial sector dialogue with Korea, the project would
seek to achieve four specific objectives: (a) facilitate the financing of
high priority investments by providing part of the foreign exchange
requirements of SMIB and CNB in an amount of $70 million and $40 million
respectively; (b) support the continued institutionaL development of the two
main term lending institutions in the SMI sectors; (c) support further
expansion and improvements in the provision of technical assistance to SMIs;
and (d) support the improvement of subcontracting procedures. The importation
of foreign equipment and technology together with the strengthening of
technical assistance to enterprises and subcontracting, are expected to
upgrade their technical capability of small and medium enterprises which is
the critical factor in their ability to compete effectively.
Description
3.02      Credit Component.  The credit component would channel long-term
funds to SMIs through the two syecialized SMI lending institutions - SMIB and
CNB. SMIB, which serves SMIs,- would receive an allocation from the credit
31   Under the Small and Medium Industry Bank Act as amended on December 31,
1983, clients must have the following criteria:
Maximum no.
Sector                                   of employees
Manufacturing and mining                                      500
CoaL mining, ceramics                                         700
Transportation                                                500
WhoLesale, general merchandise                                300
Vehicle repair                                                200
Engineering & tech. services (incl. construction)             200
Communications & electrical                                   100
Processing & tabulation services                               50
In addition, assets of an SMI cannot exceed 4 billion won, except metallic
mining (W 6 billion) and some forms of manufacturing which may qualify with
assets of up to W 8 billion.



-9-
component of US$70 million, while CNB, which restricts itself to small
industries (less than 100 employees or with total assets of less than 300 mil-
lion won), would receive an allocation of US$40 million. The funds would be
used to finance the foreign currency term Loan commitments of these institu-
tions for the two-year period from mid-1985 to mid-1987. Both institutions
have extensive experience in SMI lending, have good branch networks (SMIB: 167
branches, CNB: 234 branches) throughout the country and together now provide
approximately 55Z of all term lending to the SMI sector.
3.03      The credit funds would be utilized to finance approximately 550
subprojects (200 SMIB, 350 CNB) covering all SMI subsectors and are forecast
to be committed at a rate of approximately $5 million per month during the 24-
month commitment period. Based on the actual results of subprojects financed
in the past by SMIB and CNB, the credit funds should yield an average
financial rate of return of 22% corresponding to an average economic rate of
return of 37%. Both lending institutions have ample loan processing capacity
to adequately evaluate and manage the forecast loan volume. Institutional
improvements agreed to under the project wouLd be in the case of SMIB, an
annual portfolio arrears reduction plan and a study of SMIB's role in a
liberalized financial sector. In the case of CNB, institutional improvements
would include a plan to rebuild its equity and the initiation of a staff
training program for foreign currency subproject appraisal and supervision.
Both SMIB and CUB have confirmed their foreign currency loan demand during
negotiations.
3.04      Technical Assistance and Training Component.  This component would
be executed by SMIPC and would represent an expansion of its successful tech-
nical assi stance and training programs being implemented under the SM
Machinery Industry Pro_ect (Loan 2215-KO). Under the proposed project, a
total of $1.0 million, including price contingencies, (Annex 5, Table 1) of
Bank financing would be supplied to SMIPC for foreign specialist technical
assistance and for overseas training of approximately 40 SMIPC and SKI
staff. SMIPC envisages utilizing the foreign specialists to conduct pre-
investment feasibility analysis of equipment requirements for SMI expansions.
There would be no restrictions on the type of expertise covered by this
component although SMIPC intends to provide experts in the non-metalworking
subsector, especially textiles, ceramics and plastics which are not now served
by the SM Machinery Industry Project. 35 subprojects would be analyzed under
the scope of this component for a total cost of $350,000. It is also planned
that approximately 30 subprojects would require foreign experts for technical
assistance covering the installation and start-up phases for a total cost of
$150,000. The training activities of the component would cost approximately
$329,000 and would consist of attendance by approximately 15 SMIPC staff in
technical courses with associated tours and visits of factories to study new
technologies and processes in developed countries; and visits by approximately
6 selected teams of SMI managers and technicians to mainly Japanese factories
to study quality and production control techniques. Under the project, cost
recovery from SMI clients for the domestic consultants would be at least 1OZ
in year end 1986 and for the foreign technical experts services it would
increase from the present 10% to 30% in 1986. SMIPC shall undertake a review
of its overall cost recovery levels for domestic and expatriate experts and
shlll, not later than November 30, 1986, inform the Bank of the findings of



- 10 -
such review and, in consultation with the Bank, determine the cost recovery
Levels to be achieved in the domestic and expatriate expert programs in
calendar year 1987 and thereafter.
3.05      Subcontracting.  In spite of an array of laws and policies
introduced by the Covernment in the 1970s and 1980s to strengthen subcontract-
ing procedures, there remain persistent problems (para. 1.18). The private
sector Korea Federation of Small Business (KFSB) has been asked, as the repre-
sentative body for small business, to implement a review of these problem
areas and come up with suggestions which would be reviewed by the Government.
Detailed terms of reference and an implementation schedule for the review
would be prepared by KFSB by October 30, 1985 and an understanding was reached
during negotiations that the Government would submit the study and the
Government's recomendations, to the Bank by October 30, 1986 and thereafter
implement the recommendations as agreed with the Bank and in accordance with a
timetable satisfactory to the Bank.
B. Project Cost and Financing
3.06      Total project cost is estimated at US$182.2 million, of which the
foreign exchange component would be US$111.0 million or 61Z.  A sumary of the
project cost is given in the following table:

ance component, which is eatirely in foreign exchange, based on expected
international inflation rate of 5X for 1985, 7.52 for 1986, and 81 per year
for later years. The foreign exchange content (611) of the subprojects
financed by the credit component is based on SMIB and CNB's previous
experience.
3.08      The Bank loan of $111.0 would finance:
(a)  the estimated foreign exchange cost ($110.0 million) of the credit
component in the form of subloans made by SMIB and CNB and
(b) the estimated foreign exchange cost ($1.0 million) of the technical
assistance component.
The estimated local costs ($71.2 million) of the credit component would be
financed by loans from the participating financial institutions (SMIB and CNB)
or from equity from the subloan borrowers.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AGENCIES
A. The Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation
4.01      SMIPC (Annex 2), established by the Government in 1979 as the
central agency for the development of the SMI sector, carries out a wide range
of financial and technical assistance programs. SMIPC is staffed with compe-
tent technicians and has an experienced management team. SMIPC's main acti-
vity is the provision of extension services to SMIs; its other activities
include: equipment leasing, the operation of a training institute for SMIs
and the administration of the Small and Medium Industry Promotion Fund
(SMIPF). The SMIPF is provided from the Government budget as a contribution
to SMIPC's equity. SMIPC's objectives for the future are to: further improve
the SMI technology level; increase extension and training services to SKI;
promote the internationalization of SMIs through joint ventures and overseas
technology transfer; sustain Government funding of SMIPC activities; increase
training of SMIPC staff; and continue to utilize foreign specialists only as
long as needed.
4.02      The chief operating office of SMIPC -s its President-Chairman, who
is assisted by four vice-presidents, each responsible for a major section of
SMIPC's operations. The division of responsibilities among vice-presidents
is: (a) management and administration; (b) projects; (c) extension services;
and (d) the Small Business Training Institution. General managers responsible
for planning and coordination, data processing and auditing report directly to
the Chairman. At present there are 291 staff in SMIPC, and their disposition
is shown in SMIPC's organization chart (Chart 1). SMIPC is operated on a
pragmatic, cost-effective basis by seasoned managers.
4.03      Under the Small and Medium Machinery Industry Project (Loan
2215-KO), SMIPC executes the 200 man-month per year expatriate extension
services program, results of which so far have been very satisfactory. SMIPC



- 12-
has worked out systems and procedures for the efficient acquisition, perfor-
mance and evaluation of expatriate technicians to include the provision of
adequate counterparts and logistical support. Over the first 18 months of the
program, 381 expatriate technicians were contracted for a total 286 man-months
of in-country, shop floor assistance to SKIs. SMIPC's expatriate extension
services have mainly been for solving metalworking problems in the fieLds of
metal cutting, casting, forging, heat treatment and plating. Lesser amounts
of assistance has been for process and quality control problems and in product
design. Evaluations of approximately 25Z of ShIPC's larger engagements (20
man-days or more) indicate that the ratio of annual client benefits to SKIPC's
actual (one-time) cost of providing the service avc:ages 18 to one. The
expatriate program makes up less than one-third of SMIPC's extension services;
the balance is provided from its own staff and from domestic experts. The
technical assistance has been mainly in the metalworking sector in line with
the emphasis of the Small and Medium Machinery Industry Pro,ect.
4.04      Training.  Training is provided under two categories.  The more
visible of these is carried out in the recently built small business training
center at Banwoul. This institute provides short duration residential courses
for SMI company staff in a wide variety of managerial and technical subjects.
The institute, whose building was financed by an ADB loan, has a planned capa-
city of.8,000 training places per year, and should be operating at this level
from 1985 onwards. A significant amount of training is also provided to
SKIPC's own staff and to members of SKI's through foreign visits.  Such
training activities are based in overseas management training, technical
institutes and industrial companies.
4.05      Although SMIPC is not unique in Korea in many of its services, it
provides a well-recognized "one stop" source directLy attuned to the SKI
sector. There are several other institutions providing extension services
(cNB, SMIB, KCGF, etc.), but these tend either to be specialized, or available
only to a limited clientele. Both SMIB and CNB call upon SMIPC for technical
assistance in evaLuating subprojects on an informal ad hoc basis. In the
trdining field, SMIPC has concentrated its efforts on short-duration courses
which are not generally provided by the technicaL colleges and universities.
SMIPC confirmed during negotiations that it had established, in February 1984,
representational offices in Pusan and in Kwangju city and that arrangements
are being made with 10 technology training institutes located in Canada,
Japan, W. Germany, Italy and USA to receive SMI staff and SMIPC extension
officers for short duration courses in selected advanced industrial
technologies during the period 1985 to 1988.
4.06      SMIPC's operating performance for 1983, the first complete year of
operation, showed a W 4.7 bilLion loss, largely due to a relatively low level
of initial operations. SMIPC's income from the SMIPF operations and equipment
leasing fees were not of sufficient volume to cover expenses. Funding for the
cash loss was made up by Government contributions. Operations for 1984 and
later years are expected to improve as the accumulated outstanding portfolio
of the SMIPF and the equipment leasing business volume increases. Rates
charged to SMI clients for extension services are deliberately maintained low
to encourage its use. For extension services provided by domestic consult-
ants, SMIPC's plan is to provide such services free of charge for the year



- 13 -
1983-85, and then to charge 10X of direct costs by the end of 1986. For
extension services provided by foreign experts, SMIPC's proposal is to charge
an average of 301 of direct costs by 1986. At the end of 1986, SMIPC and the
Bank will review the changing rates as described in para. 3.04. The earnings
from SMIPF and leasing operations provide the necessary cushion against
unrecovered costs of the extension services. Understandings with SMIPC on the
cost recovery percentages and review were reached during negotiations.
B. The Small and Medium Industry Bank
4.07      Institutional Aspects.  SMIB (Annex 3), was incorporated in 1961 as
a government-owned institution specializing in extending financial assistance
to small and medium industries. Eligible SMIs, as defined under the SMIB Bank
Act, are enterprises with generaLly less than 500 employees. As a bank, it
engages in commercial banking, including the mobilization of deposits, issu-
ance of letters of credit and short-term lending for working capital. As a
developmental institution, it provides long-term finance to its borrowers, the
SHI sector in Korea. Like other specialized banks and development institu-
tions, SMIB's operations, financial performance and management are subject to
the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. The General Banking Act-adminis-
tered by the Bank of Korea governs SMIB's commercial banking activities.
4.08      The SMIB Act provides for a Board of Policy and a Board of
Directors. The Board of Policy comprising government officials, representa-
tives of the SMI sector, and the President of SMIB, is appointed by the
Government and formulates lending policies and guidelines. The Board of
Directors is also appointed by the government and consists of the President of
SMIB, the Deputy President and the five Vice-Presidents. The Board of
Directors executes day to day operations. SMIB's dual board structure has
ade'quately served the institution and ensures participation of the Government
and the SMI sector in the policy formulation of SMIB and still allows SMIB's
management sufficient operational autonomy.
4.09      In 1969, SMIB adopted a Policy Statement to supplement the opera-
tional guidelines of the SMIB Act. The statement establishes SMIB's maximum
single borrower limits and defines in broad terms the types of enterprises and
industries to be served by SNIB. In 1984, SMIB formulated, in consultation
with the Bank, an outline of Development Strategy for 1985/86 which outlines
geographic (not more than 45Z of term loans in Seoul and Pusan) and sector
priority areas plus operational goals (such as reducing portfolio arrears).
4.10      Mr. Kwang Soo Lee, formerly Chairman and President of Korea Credit
Guarantee Fund, was appointed president in October 1984. The President is
assisted by a Deputy President and the five Senior Vice Presidents who are
each in charge of three to four departments. SMIB has 21 departments in its
head office in Seoul, 137 branches and 30 sub-branches distributed throughout
w,e country and three representative offices located abroad.  SMIB has aggres-
si-7ely expanded its branch and sub-branch network from 65 in 1977 to 116 in
1980 to 167 in 1983. Total staffing increased from 4,815 in 1980 to 7,189 in
1983. At year end 1983, its manning consisted of 1,528 professionals (21% of
tot-2) and 5,661 other staff, 15% or 1,100 of which were located at the head
office. Administrative expenses in the period 1980 to 1983 have remained at



- 14 -
3.32 of average total assets indicating that SMIB's expansion during this
period was carefulIly planned and efficiently executed. SMIB is a well-
managed institution.
4.11      SMIB's professional staff is mostly recruited among recent
graduates. Vacancies are typically entry-level positions and the training
needs are great and consist of external and in-house courses as well as a
system of rotational assignments within SMIB. In recent years, training has
been intensified partially as a result of programs agreed upon by the Bank in
the context of the ongoing loan (SMIB IV), as seen in 1979 where attendees at
courses totalled 1,035 staff, versus in 1983 where attendees totalled 8,353
staff. SMIB's present training program and strategy adequately serve its
needs.
4.12      Loan applications are processed by the branch offices with assis-
tance when necessary from the head office's Extension Services Department for
technical aspects and the Credit Analysis Department for credit checks.
Working capital loans take into account an elaborate point scoring system
which emphasizes the borrower's credit rating and collateral. Local currency
equipment loans require more detailed evaluation but basically are approved on
the basis of collateral and the borrower's credit rating. Appraisal proce-
dures for local currency equipment loans should be based on more than colla-
teral and borrower reputation and should include more analyses of marketing,
cash generation and other basic parameters. Foreign currency equipment loans
rectuire much more rigorous analysis with FRR and ERR required for subloans
above US$500,000. Branch managers have been delegated authority to sanction
foreign currency subloans up to US$200,000 utilizing a standard appraisal
format.
4.13      SMIB's supervision procedures are generally satisfactory although
foreign currency loans are given closer supervision. All loans are supervised
by the staff of the branch office involved, with assistance when required by
the head office. Projects are visited at least once a year for normal
projects and as often as necessary for problem projects. Projects requiring
technical input are referred to SMIB's own extension services or to SMIPC.
Projects encountering financial or operational difficulties are cLosely moni-
tored from the responsible branch office. SMIB branch managers have received
training in basic managerial and financial problem solving. Project supervi-
sion is also assisted by SMIB's applied research department (expanded as a
result of SMIB IV) which prepares practical periodic bulletins on solutions to
common SMI problems.
4.14      SMIBOs procurement procedures conform to government guidelines, to
Bank requirements, and to the special requirements of small firms. Procure-
ment is normally based on limited competitive bidding procedures with three or
four competitive quotations from potential suppliers. Bid evaluation for
foreign currency loans is done by staff of the Foreign Loan Department. In
general, SMIB's procurement procedures have been considerably strengthened as
a result of measures implemented on Loan 2004-KO (SMIB IV). SMIB's control
over disbursement is satisfactory and ensures that funds are disbursed for
approved purposes.

4.15      Operations.  SMIB offers a wide variety of services including
checking accounts, working capitaL and term loans, overdrafts, financing of
trade bills, bank guarantees and SMI extension services. In addition, it also
provides non-financial supporting services to SMIs, such as extension services
and applied research activities. Loan operations, SMIB's basic business, has
expanded at 35% per year (20Z per year real growth) in the last five years.
Working capital loans make up approximately 70% of SMIB's W 2.2 trillion ($2.8
billion) loan portfolio; the balance is made up of term loans mostly local
currency (23X) and foreign currency loans (7%). SMIB's foreign currency loan
commitments have declined from $71 million in 1979 to $45 million in 1983 due
to the increase in the SMIPF credit line which provides loans to SMI at rela-
tively low rates of interest and to the fact that the domestic capital goods
industry is increasingly able to meet the equipment needs of SMI. Enterprises
with less than 100 empLoyees now receive over half of SMIB's lending volume.
In addition, half of the term loan volume in 1983 went to borrowers with
assets of less than W 500 million ($625,000). Over 90% of SMIB loans approved
during the period January 1, 1979 and June 30, 1984, were for manufacturing.
Of this total, textile and fabricated metal products, account for about half.
4.16      SMIB's loan portfolio shows a heavy concentration (70%) in Seoul,
the Kyong-Gi province, which surrounds Seoul and in Pusan City. This pattern
has not changed significantly in the last four years in spite of efforts to
increase its lending outside these areas to 40X as outlined in SMIB's policy
statement. SMIB has managed to maintain a distribution of not more than 45%
of its lending to the Seoul and Pusan Metropolitan areas as mentioned in its
Development Strategy Statement for 1985-86.
4.17      Data on the employment impact of SMIB financing are only available
for projects which received foreign currency equipment loans. Selected econo-
mic indicators for foreign currency loans are shown in Annex 3, Table 2. It
is estimated that, over the period 1979-83, such projects directly created
20,000 jobs at an average fixed investment cost per job of US$21,400. The
average investment cost per job created has risen from US$22,600 in 1979 to
US$25,400 in 1983, an increase of 12% in nominal terms, but in real terms it
has in fact declined.   The average cost per job created through SMIB foreign
exchange loan operations is still less than one-third the cost of projects
financed by KLB and KDB at the other end of the industrial spectrum. Over the
period 1977 to 1983, the incremental exports of projects receiving foreign
currency loans was estimated at about 28% of sales. This ratio has remained
relatively steady during the period but with a high of 51% in 1981 and a low
of 12% in 1979. The degree of export orientation is lower than national
aggregates which show the SMI sector accounting for about 34% of exports;
national figures, however, include direct exports by manufacturers and indi-
rect exports under subcontracting arrangements. Rates of return calculated on
an ex-ante basis for 29 Bank financed SMIB subprojects showed an average
financial rate of return of 25%; an average economic rate of return of 46%.
4.18      Financial Position.  SMIB has a strong balance sheet with W 3 tril-
lion ($3.7 billion) in assets and a long term debt to equity ratio of 4.4:1,
well within the agreed limit of 10:1. SMIB agreed at negotiations to the
maintenance of a 10:1 long-term debt to equity ceiling. SMIB has had a long
history of profitable operations, but in June 1982, the Government reduced all



- 16 -
interest rates on new and existing loans to 10% while savings deposit rates
were held fixed until maturity. The resultant negative spread produced losses
in 1982 and 1983. In January and in November of 1984 the Government intro-
duced an improved interest rate structure which will enable SMIB to breakeven
for 1984 and remain profitable thereafter. Another factor accounting for
SMIB's narrow spread is that the SMI Promotion Fund funds are made available
by the Government to SMIB at 7.5% and on-lent at only 9%, which does not
permit an adequate spread.
4.19      Considering that SMIB serves the relatively high risk SMI sector,
with over 63,000 clients and 158,000 loan accounts, the quality of its loan
portfolio is remarkably good. Loan arrears now stand at 3.7% of total loans
with only 3.9Z of loans affected by arrears. Between December 31, 1982, and
June 30, 1984, SMIB's loans arrears ratio deteriorated slightly from 2.9% to
3.t%. SMIB agreed at negotiations to an arrears reduction program, featuring
stepped up collection efforts which would have the objective of maintaining
the arrears to a normal level of 3% from 1985 to 1989. SMIB's provisions for
bad debts of equivalent to 0.2% of loan outstanding are considered adequate by
its external auditors.
4.20      SMIB's accounts, since 1977 have been audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. Except for the 1979 accounts, about which
the public auditor's report expressed a number of qualifications, all other
years' accounts have been given unqualified opinions.
4.21      Resource Mobilization.  SMIB's efficiency in resource mobilization
has been satisfactory over the period 1979-83 with total resources (domestic
and foreign) increasing at an average rate of 31% per year, allowing the loan
portfolio to grow at approximately the same rate (Annex 3, Table 8). Domestic
resources have grown at a higher rate (33%) than foreign resources (22%) and
thus the mix of domestic to foreign resources has gradually shifted from 82:18
in 1979 to 86:14 in 1983, supporting a higher local currency content in SMIB's
portfolio. The share of long-term resources in total domestic currency
resources has remained stable at about 27% over the period 1979-83, reflecting
the high proportion of short-term deposits in SMIB's total resources. This
has restrained SMIB's ability to supply larger amounts of long-term equipment
loans.
4.22      Since the previous Bank appraisal of SMIB, this institution has
become increasingly dependent on the Government for a large part of its domes-
tic currency resources and represents one of SMIB's few financial weaknesses.
In 1979, SMIB's borrowings (both long-term and short-term) from various
Government funds such as the National Investment Fund (NIF) and others made up
13% of its local currency resources. In 1983, Government-provided borrowings
made up 27% of SMIB's local currency borrowings. The growth in term deposits
has been disappointing at only 8% per year during 1979-83. Short-term savings
has at least kept pace with SMIB's loan portfolio growth with a 30% average
increase. The real growth in resources has been from Government-provided
credit lines (40% annual average growth) and from BOK borrowings (92% annual
average growth) during the period 1979-83. The Bank advised SMIB in its
appraisal of Loan 2004-KO (SMIB IV) to seek out debentures as a means of
tapping alternative sources of domestic resources. SMIB has raised over W 120



- 17 -
bilLion'in 1982 and 1983 through the issuance of both long-term and short-term
debentures. Interest rates on the long-term debentures in 1983 averaged 12Z,
which did not permit positive spreads to be obtained on the invested funds.
4.23      At year-end 1983, SHIB had mobilized since 1965 a cumulative total
of approximately US$612 million in foreign currency resources. ADB (US$229
million) and the Bank (US$234 million) have supplied over 75% of the resources
with the Korea Foreign Exchange (KFX) scheme the next largest source supplying
US$75 million or approximately 12Z of the total. The KFX scheme is not active
now and was funded during 1976-80 with the foreign exchange reserves of the
Bank of Korea. In recent years (1979-83) SMIB has received more than 98% of
its foreign exchange resources from ADB (US$90 million) and from the Bank
(US$149 million). The balance was provided by KfW and from yen-denominated
loans.
4.24      Prospects and Resource Requirements.  SMIB estimates that SMI
investment will increase in nominal terms by 9.0% in 1984 and at 9.9%
thereafter, a modest increase in reaL terms in view of expected inflation.
Within the limits of expected resources, SMIB has prepared projections for the
period 1984-88 (Annex 3, Table 9 through 12). The assumptions used for the
projections are generally reasonable. SMIB's disbursements of equipment loans
for the five year period are forecast at 36Z of the requirements for SMI
investment, 3% higher than 1983 levels. SHIB's foreign currency equipment
loans have been estimated at approximately 13% of total equipment loans in
line with the average for the last three years (1982-84). Deposit resources
are expected to grow at a rate of 23% per year which is the average of the
period 1979-83.  Long-term deposits are assumed to remain at 16% of total
deposits. BOK borrowing is estimated to increase at 15% per year. Total
commitments (working capital net increase plus equipment loans) are expected
to reach W 4,690 billion over the five year period with foreign loan commit-
ments amounting to US$270 million, 6% of the total. The annual increase in
net working capital loans is projected at 24% and at 20% for equipment loans.
4.25      Resource Requirements.  SMIB's resource requirements for 1984-88 are
shown in Annex 3, Table 13. Cumulative domestic currency commitments over the
period are expected to reach W 4,448 billion, consisting of W 1,536 billion
for long-term loans (equipment loans) and W 2,912 billion for working capital
loans. In addition to its loan collections, SMIB expects to raise a total of
W 4,185.7 billion to meet these commitments. Long-term resources would amount
to W 1,448.6 billion with share capital increases accounting for 9%, govern-
ment funds for 59%, long-term deposits for 25% and cash generation from opera-
tions 9%. SMIB's foreign currency resource requirements for 1984-88 are
projected at $270 million on a loan commitment basis. In addition to the
uncommitted balance of $104.9 million under its foreign currency resources
available at year end 1983, SMIB plans to mobilize $210 million in foreign
currency over the period 1984-88.
4.26      Financial Forecasts.  SMIB's financial performance and structure are
expected to improve over the next five years. Net income is projected to grow
from essentially breakeven. in 1984 to W 41 billion in 1988. Earnings in 1988
would represent a 0.59% return on assets or a 13% return on equity. The inte-
rest spread is forecast to increase from 3.9% in 1984 to 4.7% in 1988. Inte-



- 18 -
rest income would increase W 243 billion in 1984 to W 564 billion in 1988. The
loan portfolio would retain a share of about 76Z of total assets throughout
the five years. The long-term debt to equity ratio would remain well within
the contractual limit of 10:1 with a maximum of 5.7:1 projected for 1985. The
current ratio would change from the 1983 level of 1:1 to 0.95:1 by 1988. Debt
coverage would improve from 1.9 in 1984 to 2.1 in 1988.
4.27      Future Role.  SMIB as it is now structured serves almost exclusively
SMI clients. There is a quesion as to the role of a specialized SMI bank in a
more liberal financial sytem and whether SMIB should develop alternative
sources of funding and broaden its clientele and financial services it
provides. The institution has had limited success in raising long-term local
currency resources from non-government sources. SMIB has agreed to conduct a
study, funded trom its own resources, of its roLe in a liberalized financial
sector. An outline for the terms of reference has been agreed upon. In
accordance with understandings reached during negotiations, the study, toge-
ther with SMIB's recommendations thereon, will be completed and submitted to
the Bank by June 30, 1986. SMIB will thereafter take all necessary steps to
implement such recommendations as agreed with the Bank.
C. The Citizens National Bank
4.28      Institutional Aspects.  CNB was established in December 1962 under
the CNB Act as a financial institution serving the general population and
small-scale enterprises (SSEs) defined as enterprises with less than 100
employees or with assets of less than W 300 million. CNB is 67% owned by the
Government; the balance of shares is held by five commercial banks (Annex 4,
Appendix 1). CNB offers its clients a full range of services including
savings deposits, checking accounts, short term business and consumer loans,
credit card services, overdrafts, long-term equipment loans and SSE extension
services. Overall, CNB is a competently managed financial institution known
in Korea for its high standards of efficiency and service to its clients.
4.29      Up to the end of 1983, CNB's Board of Directors consisted of the
President, Deputy President, Auditor and five Executive Directors. Except for
the President, the rest were appointed from within CNB. In June 1984, CNB's
Board of Directors was completely restructured. The new Board of Directors
consists of a Chairman and seven members. The new Chairman is the former
Minister of Commerce and Industry. The President of CNB is an ex-officio
member. Of the remaining six members, four come from the private sector, and
two represent the Ministry of Finace and the Economic Planning Board respec-
tively (Annex 4, Appendix 2). Under the new structure, the majority of the
Directors are selected from outside and they set the Bank's board policy lines
while the day-to-day business is run by the Executive Committee consisting of
the President, Deputy President, Auditor and five Executive Vice-Presidents
(Chart 3).
4.30      The present President of CNB, formerly a Director General of the
Domestic Finance Department of MOF, was appointed in October 1983. The
President is assisted by five Executive Vice-Presidents, each in charge of
three to four departments, grouped broadly on a functional basis. CNB has 18



- 19 -
departments in its Head Office. Its branch network has been expanded from 163
in 1980 to 234 in 1984. Total staff increased from around 7,000 in 1980 to
9,900 in 1984, of which 21% were professionals. Nearly 87% of the staff were
assigned to the branches, which are the focal poin1ts of client contacts.
Turnover of staff has declined from 5.5% in 19Pi to 3.9% in 1983 and to 2.3%
in 1984.
4.31      CNB is in the process of delegating responsibility for foreign
currency loan administration from the centrally-located Foreign Loan Depart-
ment (FLD) to selected branches. In order to effectively carry out these
-activities, CNB has agreed to conduct a comprehensive training program for its
staff handling foreign currency loans and a detailed training plan has been
reviewed during negotiations, and is considered satisfactory.
4.32      In 1979, CNB adopted a Policy Statement to supplement the opera-
tional guidelines of the CNB Act. Apart from establishing CNB's maximum expo-
sure limits in any single enterprise, this statement defines in broad terms,
the types of enterprises and industries to be financed by CNB. The Policy
Statement also outlines CNB's: (a) developmental policies (promote SHI's
which are labor intensive, produce exports, develop new products and are
technology orientated); (b) general operating principles; (c) financial guide-
lines to include that CNB should not be exposed to foreign exchange risks; and
Cd) policies on reserves (25% of net income) and provisions (adequate to cover
bad debts). In 1982, CNB drew up an "Outline of Development Strategy for
1982-86" (Annex 4, Appendix 3), in consultation with the Bank. This outline
spells out the development policy, geographic and sector priority areas and
directions in its efforts for resource mobilization. It also describes
CNB's: (a) role (a specialized bank for households and small business); (b)
objectives (advance small business, extend maturity of term lending, cut down
loan processing time, encourage subcontracting); and (c) resource mobiliza-
tion. CNB is planning to review this outline and make necessary revisions in
1986 and a revised outline will be submitted to the Bank for approval prior to
implementation.
4.33      Working capital loans are managed at the branch Level and are
evaluated based on the borrower's collateral, past credit record and reputa-
tion in the community. Local currency equipment loan applications are proces-
sed by the branches with assistance from the Credit Analysis Division and the
Extension Service Division in the Head Office. The branches have the autho-
rity to approve subloans below W 10 million. Foreign currency equipment loan
applications have been exclusively processed by FLD until November 1981, when
CNB began to designate some well-staffed branches as "subloan branches" to
handle such applications, with the authority to approve loans below $100,000.
Since the appraisal of almost all projects located outside Seoul and Cyeong Gi
Province was shifted to branch staff a year ago, the quality of CNB's
appraisal has been uneven. Economic evaluation is generally inadequate and
market analysis weak. While FLD's supervision and guidance is constantly
provided, the branch staff are not all well equipped to handle such type of
work. In a number of cases, the traditional commercial banking approach
(relying on collaterals and guarantees), instead of development banking
approach (focussing on assessing the long-term viability of projects) conti-
nued to have a dominating influence in the project evaluation. However, these



- 20 -
weaknesses would be addressed by the project under a training program for
staff handling foreign currency loans.
4.34      CNB's term loan supervision procedures spelled out in its Supervi-
sion Nanual, prepared in 1982, are satisfactory.  Since the branch staff are
in a better position to supervise the projects in their areas, the delegation
of this responsibility to branches is appropriate. However, branch staff
still lack experience in term loan supervision, and training in this field
would be accelerated and intensified under the proposed project. Apart from
routine supervision, FLD had introduced, at the time of the appraisal of Loan
2144-KG (CNB II), a "subproject monitoring system" for comparing the project's
performance with the original estimates made at the time of appraisal, after a
project has been in operation for three years. Results from the system have
been useful in comparing projected vs actual subproject benefits.
4.35      Following the Government's guidelines and conforming to the special
requirement of small firms, procurement is based on limited competitive
bidding, with at least three competitive quotations from potential sup-
pliers. The procedures for inviting quotations and awarding contracts are
satisfactory. CNB's disbursement procedures are adequate.
4.36      Operations. CNB provides a full range of banking services including
savings deposits, loans, guarantees, credit card business, overdrafts, bills
discounting, foreign exchange services and other banking services. CNB also
offers limited extension services for its smalL industries clients. Its
lending operations comprise business loans and general populace loans. Busi-
ness loans include short- and medium-term working capital loans, and local and
foreign currency equipment loans. CNB's overall loan approvals duving 1980-
June 1984 are shown in Annex 4, Table 1. During 1980-83, CNB's business loan
approvals increased 37Z per year, from W 304 billion in 1980 to W 773 billion
in 1983. In the first half of 1984, business Loan approvals amounted to W 412
billion, registering a lover rate of growth of 7Z on an annual basis. General
populace loans increased 66Z in 1981, 74% in 1982 but declined 12Z in 1983.
Overall, CNB's lending operations increased 15OZ during 1980 to mid-1984.
Total loan portfolio increased 170%, from V 839 billion at end-1980 to W 2,267
billion at end-1983. It reached W 2,365 billion ($2.95 billion) at June 30,
1984.
4.37      Short-term loans consisting of business and consumer financing make
up over 80% of CNB's loan portfolio. The balance is made up of long-term
loans, mostly local currency loans for equipment financing (18%) and foreign
currency term loans (1.5Z).
4.38      CNB in its term lending operations has been giving more emphasis to
the small-scale enterprises in the manufacturing sector. In 1980, the manu-
facturing sector accounted for 46.4% of all equipment loans. This ratio
increased to 53.2% in 1982 and 60% in the first half of 1984. Foreign cur-
rency equipment loans over the period 1980-83 have been heavily concentrated
(over 65Z) in the manufacturing sector. Within manufacturing, metal products
and machinery, textiles, paper and chemicals and plastics are the four domi-
nant subsectors absorbing respectively 16.5%, 8.6%, 8.5%, and 7.1% of the com-
bined local and foreign currency equipment loans for the period 1980 to mid-



- 21 -
1984. In the non-manufacturing sector, transportation (passenger buses and
trucks) and services (hospitals, computer services and repair shops) accounted
for 16.3% and 18.3Z respectively of total equipment loans. Loan analysis by
currency breakdown shows that local currency equipment loans have been mainly
distributed to firms in services (23.4%), transportation (22.5%) and machinery
manufacturing (17.4Z) subsectors, while foreign currency loans have focussed
on the following subsectors:  construction (18.1%), machinery manufacturing
(14.6%), textiles (14.2%), paper (12.7%), food (12.6%), and chemicals (8.9%).
4.39      In accordance with its development strategy, CNB has achieved
reasonable success in diversifying the geographical dispersion of its term
lending operations. The share of its local currency term lending to projects
in Seoul city and Kyung-Gi province has declined from 52% in 1981 to an
average of 47% in 1982-83. Its foreign currency term lending in Seoul also
declined, from 48% to 44X. During 1980 to mid-1984, 62Z of all local currency
term loans and 53% of alL foreign currency term loans were allocated to
projects outside Seoul. CNB shall make continuing efforts to increase the
proportions of its financing to small scale enterprises located in provincial
areas by taking advantage of its nationwide network as mentioned in its
Outline of Development Strategy for 1982-86.
4.40      CNB has consistently adhered to its policy not to ignore the smaller
enterprises whose credit standing is more difficult to assess and whose proj-
ects usually take a longer time to evaluate. During 1980 to mid-1984, appro-
ximately 57Z of CNB's local and foreign currency equipment loans have been
allocated to SSEs employing 5-20 workers, 30% to firms employing 21-50 workers
and only 13% to firms emplgying 51-100 workers. More than 77Z of foreign
currency equipoment loans - had been extended to SSEs with total assets below
-i 250 million. The trend has been to reach smaller enterprises as seen in
1980 when only 28Z of foreign currency loan approvals by amount went to enter-
prises with less than V 100 million in assets against 1983 where the same size
of enterprises made up 42% of loan approvals. Similar trends as far as reach-
ing enterprises with less than 50 employees are evident. CNB has satisfacto-
rily complied with the agreed requirement that a minimum of 50% the Bank loans
for financing subprojects be extended to smaller firms with less than 50
employees or total assets below W 250 million.
4.41      Partial economic indicators on a sample of 357 projects financed by
CNB in 1978-83 with equipment loans ($47.8 million) provide some quantifica-
tion of the economic benefits to be derived from these projects (Annex 4,
Table 2). Approximately 3,900 new jobs are expected to be created, at an
average cost-per-job of $21,000. Incremental annual sales generated by these
projects are estimated to be around W 187 billion, about three-and-a-half
times the size of the initial investment. These projects are expected to
generate foreign exchange earnings of $67.5 million. Incremental value added
is estimated at W 77.5 billion. The economic rates of return of the projects
which have sufficient data to enable such analysis ranged from 27.5% to 44.3%.
A general picture of the economic impact of the subprojects financed under
41   No data on local currency borrowers are available.

Bank Loans 1829-KO and 2144-KO, the latter based on a sample, is given in
Annex 4, Table 3. An ex-post evaluation of the subprojects under Bank loan
1829-KO shows a range of economic rates of return between 20.5Z and 63.2Z.
4.42      Financial Position.  During 1980 to mid-1984, CNB's total assets
more than doubled (from W 1.5 trillion to V 3.4 trillion) registering an
average annual growth of 31%. Growth has largely been financed by increased
demand and time deposits (approximately 80Z) with longer term borrowings and
equity increase playing a smaller role. Operating losses during 1982 and 1983
have eroded CNB's equity base to the point where its long-term debt to equity
(DIE) ratio at June 30, 1984, was 14:1 exceeding the covenanted 10:1 ratio
under Loan 2144-KO. The operating losses were due to a government adjustment
of interest rates as described in para. 4.18. As a result GCB lost W 18
billion and W 27 billion in 1983. In January and November of 1984, the
Government introduced a new, more favorable structure of interest rates, and
in the first half of 1984, CNB has showed a net income of W 1.3 billion.
Future operations are forecast to remain profitable. At negotiations, the
Government confirmed that W 10 billion had been included in the Government's
1985 budget for subscription to CNB's share capital and the funds would be
provided in its entirety to CNB by the end of 1985 in a manner consistent with
the target growth of monetary aggregates. It was also agreed that the private
shareholders of CNB should be asked to make a pari-passu contribution to its
equity during 1985, thus reducing the DIE ratio to a level below 10:1 by year-
end 1985. The Bank has thoroughly reviewed CNB's debt structure and agreed to
exclude from long term debt all deposits over one year against which CNB has
made loans to the same depositors under various schemes. However, the maximum
DIE ratio would remain 10:1. The quality of CNB's loan portfolio is excel-
lent. Arrears have consistently been close to 2% of loans outstanding;
collection rates are approximately 97Z.
4.43      At the end of 1983, CUB's provisions for doubtful accounts amounted
to U 16 billion, or 0.7% of its total loans outstanding, the sa.ne as 1982.
Given the overall soundness of its loan portfolio and good collection perfor-
mance, the level of provisions is considered adequate. Total reserves and
provisions at end-1983 amounted to W 22.2 billion, or around 1% of outstanding
loans, compared to 2.8Z in 1981.
4.44      In conformity with Korean practice, CNB reports its income on cash
basis and expenses on an accrual basis. CNB's accounts have been audited
annually by a private firm of external independent auditors, satisfactory to
the Bank. The accounts have always been certified without qualification and
the reports have met the Bank's requirements. CNB is also subject to the
audit of the Audit Board and BOK. CNB's accounting system, including its
internal auditing is satisfactory.
4.45      Resource Mobilization.  Over the years since its inception, CNB has
been very successful in mobilizing domestic resources through deposit taking,
increasing at an average annual rate of 34% (1977-83), reaching W 3,027 bil-
lion ($3.8 billion) at the end of 1983. Since 1979, CUB has been able to
mobilize foreign resources totalliug $150 million from international financial
institutions. More than 80% of CNB's deposits are short-term and even though
CNB has been gradually moving toward term-transformation of a higher oortion



- 23 -
of its short-term deposit resources, CNB's capability of providing long-term
local currency Loans is still very limited.
4.46      Prospects and Resource Requirements.  CNB's overall lending
operations are projected to increase from W 1,820 billion in 1984 to
w 4,558 billion in 1988, at an annual rate of growth of 26Z (Annex 4,
Table 10). LoCal currency and foreign currency equipment loans are projected
to grow at an annual rate of 3OZ, from W 76 billion in 1984 to W 218 billion
in 1988. The overall projections appear somewhat conservative, given the
erratic but impressive growth averaging 31Z p.a. achieved during the past
eight years. The projections of foreign currency loan approvals ($25.2 mil-
lion in 1984; $42 million in 1985; $50 million in 1986; and an average of
$66 million in 1987-88) while appearing to lean on the optimistic side for
1985-86 are achievable given the lower interest rate, compared to the previous
loan. The local currency equipment loan approvals are projected at: W 56
billion in 1984; W 73 billion in 1985; W 95 billion in 1986; and an average of
W 142 billion in 1987-88.
4.47      CNB projects that during 1984-88, its net local currency resource
needs would total around W 5 trillion, of which W 3.6 trillion, or 72% would
be used to finance short-term lending operations and the remaining U 1.4 tril-
lion or 28% for medium and long-term lending operations. The needed short-
term and long-term funds are expected to be mobilized from the following
sources: deposit money (84.9%), BOK and other banks (7.8%), earnings (5.6%),
shareholders (1.4%), government loans (0.3Z), and SMIPF (0.06%). CNB would
rely primarily on a portion of its total deposit money (20%), share capital
increases and earnings to finance its term loans. Funding by SMIPF totalling
W 2.8 billion would be insignificant. Some term transformation from short-
term deposits would be achieved so that CNB would be able to extend the matur-
ities of its local currency loans. CNB's resource position at the end of each
year during the projected period would remain strong, and it would be in a
position to cover temporary shortfalls in its borrowings (Annex 4, Table 14).
4.48      CNB had raised foreign currency funds totalling $110 million during
1979-83 from ADB and IBRD. In 1984, CNB obtained a new loan of $40 million
from ADB. At the end of 1984, CUB's uncommitted foreign currency resources
are projected to be around $48 million. During the next four-year period
(1985-88), CNB would need an additional $240 million to finance its expanding
foreign currency lending operations. The projected borrowings from ADB and
IBRD would account for 79%, with the remaining 21% ($50 million) to be raised
from foreign commercial or bilateral sources, starting in 1986. CNB intends
to make a special effort to mobilize such resources in line with its projec-
tions and its development strategy. The proposed Bank loan of $40 million
would be committed from the second half of 1985 to the first half of 1987.
4.49      Projected Financial Position and Performance.  CNB's financial
position would show further improvement over the next five years (Table 11).
Its total assets are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 21%, to
W 8,901.4 billion at the end of 1988. A large portion of the asset growth
(78%) would be financed by incremental deposits, 1.4% by share capital
increase, and the remaining 20% by new borrowings. Assuming continuous
increase in its share capital, CNB's long-term debt/equity ratio is expected



- 24 -
to decline from 13:1 at the end of 1984 to 8.4:1 at end-1985 and the ratio
would remain within the limit of 10:1 during the remaining projection period.
CNB's current ratio would remain approximately 1.1:1 during the period.
4.50      CNB's profitability is expected to improve considerably in the next
four years (Annex 4, Table 12). Net income would increase from W 5.4 billion
in 1984 to W 43 billion in 1986 and to W 131 billion in 1988. The projected
net income on average total assets is expected to increase from 0.14Z in 1984
to 1.6Z in 1988 and the return on average equity increasing from 9% to 40Z.
General.administrative expenses, as a percent of average total assets, would
drop from 3.5Z in 1984 to 2.4Z in 1988 during the same projection period.
V. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. Features of the Proposed Loan
5.01      Relending Arrangements.  The proposed Bank loan would be made to the
Republic of Korea as Borrower, which would relend the proceeds of the loan to
SMIPC and to the two development banks, SMIB and CNB, under terms of subsi-
diary loan agreements satisfactory to the Bank. Signing of the subsidiary
loan agreements would be a condition of the effectiveness of the proposed
loan. SMIPC would be allocated US$1.0million for the technical assistance
component and the US$110 million credit component would be allocated between
SMIB (US$70 million) and CNB (US$40 million). SHIPC would bear the foreign
exchange and variable interest risks of the technical assistance component,
while the subborrowers of SMIB and CNB would bear the foreign exchange and
variable interest risks of the credit component.
5.02      Amortization Schedule.  The technical assistance component of the
proposed loan would have a fixed amortization schedule and would be repaid by
SMIPC over a 15-year period including 3 years grace. The credit component
would have an adjustable composite amortization schedule reflecting the aggre-
gate amortization schedules of the subloans made by SMIB and CNB but not to
exceed &a amortization period of 15 years. Individual subloans would have a
maximum maturity of 13 years, including a reasonable grace period.
5.03      Relending Rate.  For the credit component, SMIB and CNB intend to
lend the proceeds of the proposed loan at a variable interest rate of 2% above
its own effective borrowing cost. This is in line with the MOF guidelines and
the general practice of the DFCs in Korea for relending the proceeds of
foreign exchange borrowings from international sources. Based on the Bank's
current lending rate of approximately 9.32, and the 2% spread, the nominal
onlending rate for subborrowers would be approximately 11.3%. In addition,
subborrowers would be charged a commitment fee of 0.75 of 1% p.a. on the
undisbursed portion of the subloan committed to them. The 2% interest spread
is adequate to cover the cost incurred by the DFC in processing subloan appli-
cations and supervising subprojects.
5.04      The interest rate to subborrovers is expected to be positive in real
terms, given the actual domestic infLation rate for 1984 (3%), and the projec-
ted domestic inflation rates of 3-6% during 1985-88. The lending rates under



- 25 -
the project would be comparable to the interest rate charged by commercial
banks (11.5Z), but higher than those charged under the SKI Promotion Fund (9%).
5.05      Subloan Ceiling.  Under the ongoing Bank projects (Ln. 2004-KO,
SMIB IV and Ln. 2144-KO, CNB II), SMIB has a subloan ceiling of US$2.0 million
while CNB has a ceiling of US$500,000. For the proposed project, SMIB's sub-
loan ceiling would be raised to US$3.0 million. While this new SMIB ceiling
is not expected to raise SMIB's average foreign currency subloan size, which
has not changed in real terms in the Last five years (US$261,000 in 1983
values), it will enable SMIB to continue to service a few repeat clients who
have expanded and have larger investment requirements. CNB (1983 average
foreign current subloan size: US$106,000), which is limited by its statutes
to firms with less than 100 employees, would have its subloan ceiling
increased to US$700,000 to allow it to service a limited number of high tech-
nology enterprises with capital intensive requirements.
5.06      Free Limit.  SMIB's present free limit for Ln. 2004-KO is US$500,000
which resuLts in over 35% of the loan commitments and 121 of the number of
subloans being classified as 'A' subloans, which require prior approval of the
Bank. Under the proposed project, SMIB would have a free limit of US$750,000
which, when allowing for projected inflation, would result in approximately
10 of all subloans and 30% of subloan comhitment being 'A' subloans. CNB
would, with the proposed project, have its subloan free limit increased from
the present US$300,000 to US$400,000. Under Ln. 2144-KO (CNB II), approxi-
mately 7% of the number of subloans and 22% of the amount committed are 'A'
subloans requiring prior bank approval. It is estimated that under the
proposed project with the recommended subloan ceiling and free limit for CNB,
the same percentage of 'A' subloans would be maintained. These levels of
review are considered appropriate given the quality of both institutions' loan
appraisal.
5.07      Eligible Enterprises under the Credit Component.  For CNB, eligible
subborrowers under the CNB Enforcement Decree are limited to small industrial,
mining and transportation firms with no more than 100 employees and construc-
tion and service firms with no more than 20 employees. For SMIB, the eligible
criteria are somewhat broader and would be in accordance with the SMIB act as
amended on December 31, 1983 (para. 4.07) which generally limits eligible
firms to those with less than 500 employees and with assets of less than
4 billion won.
5.08      Calculation of Economic Rate of Return.  Economic rates o' return
(ERR) would be calculated on all subprojects above the respective free limit
for the two DFCs. The threshold ERR for subproject rejection would be subject
to reasonable and prudent judgement.
5.09      Procurement   In the case of the proceeds of the Bank loan to be
channeled through SMIPC, agreement was reached during negotiations with the
Government and SMIPC that all consultants would be engaged in accordance with
Bank Guidelines, and in addition, all consultancy and training contracts above
US$100,000 would have consultant selection, terms of reference (TOR) and
contract terms subject to the Bank's prior approval. Due to the many short
term assignments, consultants and training contracts below US$100,000 would be



- 26 -
subject to post-approval review by Bank supervision missions. Standard TORs
and consultant contract forms have been prepared under Ln. 2215-KO and are
satisfactory. In the case of the credit component to be implemented by SMIB
and CNB, the procurement procedures would be those of each DFC. These proce-
dures, which are based on strict competitive bidding practices, requiring at
least three bids from potential suppliers, have been examined and found to be
satisfactory under previous Bank loans. These procedures conform to the
government's guidelines, which emphasize competitive bidding, and to the
special requirements of small and medium enterprises which follow efficient
commercial procurement practices and have few large contracts.
5.10      Disbursement.  Disbursements under the proposed Bank loan would be
for two purposes: (a) technical assistance and training, and (b) credit. The
technical assistance and training component would be disbursed against:
(a) 100Z of the total costs of internationally recruited consultancy services
retained by SMIPC; (b) 1002 of overseas training for both SMIPC stafi and for
small and medium industries management and staff. The credit component would
be used, as in previous Bank loans to SMIB and CNB, to finance: (a) up to
100% of the foreign exchange costs of goods and services directly imported by
their subborrowers; and (b) up to 60% of the cost in domestic currency (repre-
senting the estimated foreign exchange cost) of locally manufactured or pro-
cured machinery and equipment. The credit component of the proposed Bank loan
is expected to be fully committed in two years and the loan would be fully
disbursed in four years (Closing Date: June 30, 1989). The estimated quar-
terly disbursements are given in Annex 5, Table 2. The standard Industrial
Development and Finance (IDF) disbursement profile is not relevant for the
portion to be allocated to SHIPC, whereas the disbursement under the credit
component is expected to be completed within the disbursement profile for the
IDF sector in the region, which is complete disbursement within four years,
because of the efficiency of the SMIB and CNB lending operations. The last
date for receipt of subprojects from SMIB and CNB would be December 31, 1987.
5.11      Disbursement would be made against full documentation for subloans
in excess of the free limit (above US$750,000 for SHIB and US$400,000 for CNB)
and for contracts above US$100,000 for SMIPC. For SMIB and CNB subloans below
their respective free limits and for SMIPC project expenditures below
US$100,000, Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) would be used. Full supporting
documentation would be retained by the three institutions and made available
for Bank inspection during supervision missions. Revolving funds equal to
three month's estimated disbursement plus 20% would be established in the form
of Special Accounts with SMIB, CNB and SMIPC's banks from which they would
obtain reimbursement from all applicable expenditures. Based on the forecast
usage pattern for assuming quarterly replenisnment of the funds, the balance
of each revolving fund should not exceed $7.0 million in the case of SMIB;
$4 million in the case of CNB; and $100,000 for SHIPC. The SOEs, as well as
the special accounts would be subject to audit by auditors acceptable to the
Bank and supporting documentation would be available for inspection by Bank
supervision mission. SMIB and CNB would furnish the bank, from time to time,
with the usual information on all subloans approved under the SOE procedure;
assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations.



- 27 -
5.12      Auditing.  As required under existing Bank loans, SMIB, CNB and
SMIPC's accounts would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank. Previous audits received by the Bank have been comprehensive; have
conformed to the Bank's requirements; and have expressed unqualified opinions.
Each institution would submit audited statements utilizing separate project
accounts no later than five months after the close of their fiscal year.
B. Project Benefits and Risks
5.13      Benefits.  The proposed project with its foreign exchange financing
and technical assistance would provide SMI with the means to enter into new
high technology fields; and to upgrade product quality in order to maintain
competitiveness in an increasingly open Korean market place. Additionally,
the proposed project would make a significant contribution to increased
employment as it would finance an estimated total of 550 subprojects (200
SMIB, 350 CNB) which would create an estimated 6,000 new jobs. Data on job
creation is based on SMIB's (US$25,400 per job) and CNB's (US$21,100 per job)
current subproject cost per job adjusted for anticipated price increases.
Since individual subprojects to be financed under the loan have not yet been
identified, an ex ante quantification of their economic impact is not
possible. However, under the Bank's past SMI financing in Korea, the average
e2 p2lt financial rate of return was 22X and the economic rate of return was
37Z.' Rates of return under the proposed project are expected to be similar
to those of past Bank financed subprojects.
5.14      The technical assistance and training component would enable SMIPC
to continue its consultancy and overseas training activities. Based on
SMIPC's past accomplishments, the program for the proposed component would
assist a total of up to 65 enterprises in solving production technology
problems. In addition, a total of 15 SMIPC staff and 25 SKI management and
skilLed staff would receive overseas training. While it is difficult to
quantify the benefits of this component precisely, analysis of a limited
number of SMIPC assisted enterprises indicates that the returns are 'ary high.
5.15      Risks.  The potential risks in this project stem from three
factors: (a) an unlikely deterioration of SMIPC's services during project
implementation; (b) disbursement of the credit component lagging from
appraisal estimates; and (c) SMIB and CNB's loan portfolio and financial
performance not improving. Regarding SMIPC's services, the institution is
staffed with capable technicians and led by pragmatic experienced management.
SMIPC's staff salary levels are reviewed regularly to insure competitiveness
with the private sector. An efficient network of local operations and over-
seas representative offices has been established to cut the problem solving
response time. On the aspect of potential slow disbursement, the foreign
currency demand projections have been based on the estimates of SMIB and CNB
and are conservative. The credit component takes into consideration the
planned availability of parallel credit lines especially the SMI Promotion
5/   Based on a random sample of 65 subprojects.



- 28 -
Fund. At negotiations, CNB and SMIB reconfirmed their forecasts for foreign
currency loan commitments during the project period.  With respect to SMIB and
CNB's portfolio and institutional improvement, an action plan has been agreed
to by SMIB on portfolio performance and CNB and the Government has agreed to
bringing CNB's D/E ratio to within the covenanted 10:1 level by the end of
1985. On balance, the benefits of the project are likely to be substantiaL
and the risks involved manageable. No adverse environmental risk is foreseen.
Each subproject appraisal would analyze the environmental aspects of the
proposed investment highlighting the measures to be utilized to ensure worker
safety and protection from work hazards.

SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY PROJECT
The Small and Medium Industry Bank
Outline of Development Strategy for 1985-86
SMIB will endeavor to enhance its impact on the Small and Medium
Industry sector through the implementation of the deveiopmental objectives
outlined below:
(a) SMIB will continue to expand its financial assistance to an
increasing number of small and medium enterprises with special
emphasis placed on the need to improve the productivity and qua'lity
of output of the SMI sector in order to increase its competitive-
ness, particularly in export market.
(b) SMIB will endeavor to mobilize deposit resources with particular
emphasis on inducing household and storeholder deposits. In an
attempt to expand its resource mobiiizations, SMIB will continue to
issue Small and Medium Industry Debentures.
(c) In line with the Government policy to pursue more balanced regional
development and promote more even distributions of industry, SMIB
will continue to increase the proportion of its lending to areas
outside large metropolitan cities such as Seoul and Busan. SHIB
will ensure that not more than 45% of its term loan commitments will
be utilized to finance projects in Seoul and Busan.
(d)  Recognizing the need to deepen the industrial structure in Korea,
SMIB will, where appropriate, actively encourage and promote sub-
contracting agreements.
(e) SMIB will continue to strengthen its research activities to provide
the basic data and information needed for its efficient operation
and to assist in the Government's policy-making for SHIs. To this
end, SMIB will conduct surveys on the fixed asset investment of
SHIs, apart from monthly surveys or. the trends of production,
shipment, employment, etc.
(f) SMIB, in keeping with its continuing efforts to achieve its usual
good portfolio performance, has instituted an annual arrears
reduction program.
(g)  Recognizing that the financial sector in which SHIB operates will
undergo structural changes brought about by further liberalization
policies, SMIB would consider a study of its role in this changing
sector at an appropriate time.

THE CITIZENS NATIONAL BANK
Outline of Development Strategy for 1982-86 /1
Introduction
This statement is to clarify CNB's distinct role In the comunity
of Korean financial institutions and hov that role should evolve through
1986 and outlines operational objectives consistent with its underlying
developmental role, its plan for term transformation and for strengthening
its equity base, its Intention to tap foreign commercial funds, and its
program for building up its institutional (particularly branches) capabi-
lity for handling increased term lending operations.
CNB-s Role
CNB is a specialized bank operating for and in the household as
well as sm1ll-scale business sectors.  For raising its domestic currency
resources through mobilization of deposits from the general public, CUB has
been competing with commercial banks, regional city banks, SKID and mtal
finance companies. CNB offers all the commercial banking services for
housebold and small-scale business sectors; in this respect, CNB is a
commercial bank with the developmental role of promoting and serving
small-scale industry. During the five-year period (1982-1986), CNB plans
to play a more meaningful role as an allocator of resources consistent
with its underlying developmental role.
Operational Objectives
In an attempt to play a more meaningful role as an allocator of
resources, CNB shall further expand, apart from its normAl financing acti-
vity, its term lending activity particularly for the advancement of small-
scale enterprises. To this end, CNB shall endeavor to extend the average
maturity of its domestic currency equipment loans to about 5 years by 1986.
This would require CNB to undertake some degree of prudent term transforma-
tion while maintaining its financial viability. Also, this would require
CNB to upgrade its term lending capability especially at the branch level.
CNB, recognizing this need, shall continue to exert its efforts for training
its staff and streamlining its procedures.
/1 As adopted by the CNB Board of Directors on April 10, 1982.

CND shall make special efforts to assist an Increasing number of
small-scale enterprises and relatively labor-intensive projects In conformity
with the purposes as stipulated in the CNB Act, its Enforcement Decree and
the Goverument's policies. In addition, CNB will continue to provide finance
for modernization of small-scale enterprises In order to enhance their
competitiveness in export as well as In domestic markets.
In line with the Goverment-s policy toward geographical distri-
bution of small-scale industry to provincial areas, CNB shall make con-
tinuing efforts to Increase the proportion of its financing to SSI located
in provincial areas by taking advantage of Its nationwide branch network.
CNB shall actively assist the small-scale enterprises in the
machinery subsector, to the modernization of which the Government is giving
a high priority.
CNB shall, where necessary, actively encourage and promote
subcontracting arrangements with a view to contributing to deepening the
industrial structure In Korea.
In utilizing its surplus funds, CNB shall give due considerations
to the marketability and ezpected rate of return on Its securlties holdings.
Resource Mobilization
CNB shall make continuing efforts for the mobilization of house-
hold savings and for making ue of long-term local currency resources avail-
able from relevant institutions concerned. In addition, CNB shall endeavor
to increase its psid-in capital as scheduled. With a view to supplementing
foreign currency resources available from International finance institutions
and diversifying its long-term forelgn currency resources, CNB shall make
best efforts to tap commercial funds at appropriate terms suitable for
relending to small-scale enterprise during 1982-86.
Research
CNB shall continue to strengthen Its research capability and
activities, with particular emphasis given on subsector studies and market
studies for small-scale industry as a means of improving the data base
required for sound project evaluation and Identification of potential clients.
