medium industries.  The\n            technical assistance and training component will enable\n            SMIPC to expand its activities of assisting private\n            enterprises to all SMI subsectors.  These activities include\n            upgrading skills and improving the productivity of SMIs in\n            using existing and new technology at the plant level. This\n            component of the project will also support overseas training\n            of selected SMIPC and SMI staff.  The credit component of\n            the loan will help cover the foreign exchange requirements\n            of subprojects financed by SMIB and CNB from mid-1985 to\n            mid-1987 and will support the continued institutional\n            development of SMIB and CNB.  The project will also promote\n            the development of improved subcontracting policies, which\n            is important to SMI development in Korea where large\n            companies have the potential to play a major role in\n            assisting smaller firms."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
