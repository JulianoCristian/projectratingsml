The key lessons learned through the\n            project are the following: 1) A continuous long-term\n            partnership with the Government pays off. The Bank should\n            continue with this approach for future operations on\n            contractual savings which deepen already initiated reforms.\n            2) However, the Bank needs to be more realistic in the\n            assessment of the feasibility of certain policy measures.\n            For instance, the privatization program that was initially\n            foreseen as part of this project conditions was too\n            ambitious, probably because of insufficient financial and\n            institutional analysis and/or of an optimistic assessment of\n            the political constraints on privatization. A more rigorous\n            approach would require a careful assessment of the different\n            constraints and risks for each measure included in the loan."}, "docdt": "1999-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
