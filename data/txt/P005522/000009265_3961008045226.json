Development Loan\n            will support a program of reforms in the financial sector\n            and finance the temporary cost to the Moroccan Treasury of\n            implementing this program. Beyond a transitional period of\n            three years, the budgetary impact will remain limited to\n            about 0.17 percent of GDP per year and, therefore,\n            consistent with macrostabilization objectives. The specific\n            policy measures concern: 1) the reform of Treasury financing\n            including the removal of mandatory placement ratios for\n            banks in Treasury bonds at below market rates; 2) indirect\n            monetary control including the liberalization of lending\n            rates; 3) the development of capital markets; and 4) the\n            banking system, in particular the privatization of the\n            remaining state-owned banks and the establishment of an\n            interbank foreign exchange market together with related\n            prudential measures. A policy matrix details the specific\n            actions to be supported by the Loan and shows how they\n            complement those already implemented."}, "docdt": "1995-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
