In the early 1970s, the\n            decline in agricultural production of Mexico raised concerns\n            about the long-term ability to keep pace with the growth in\n            domestic consumption and the need to reduce income\n            disparities among the population. The project was envisaged\n            as an important step to bring agricultural production back\n            in line with domestic and foreign demand. The project, the\n            second Bank-financed irrigation project in the area, was to\n            rehabilitate the drainage and irrigation systems on about\n            280,000 ha, increase agricultural production through changes\n            in cropping patterns, and alleviate the disparity of income\n            levels among the rural population. The project impact is\n            difficult to measure at this stage, as all the investments\n            originally envisaged have only been completed in a small\n            area. Less crop diversification and shift towards high-value\n            crops than expected have taken place; yields of the main\n            crops (maize and sorghum) have increased (yet less than\n            anticipated), due to the strengthening of research and\n            extension services, better salinity control and the improved\n            road network. The project ERR is now estimated at 12.5\n            percent, lower than the 17 percent estimated at project reformulation."}, "docdt": "1986-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
