Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are rated as satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned included the following: The creation of the\n            Ukrainian State Company for Coal Sector Restructuring (UDKR)\n            has been a key to the success of this project. There have\n            been closures by mining companies but they were not finished\n            and normally these mines ended up with UDKR to complete the\n            task. The SECAL implementation also has shown that an agency\n            like UDKR needs to be protected. There have been attempts by\n            the coal industry and by local administrations to abolish or\n            weaken UDKR. Furthermore, the agency should have its own\n            fully secured budget. Another lesson is that an investment\n            operation is preferred over an adjustment operation since\n            restructuring depends critically on adequate financing.\n            Also, realistic goal-setting is important. The selection of\n            financial performance criteria for the restructuring of an\n            old industrial sector should be avoided. Instead, simple\n            physical criteria that can be achieved and easily monitored\n            should be preferred."}, "docdt": "2001-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
