Mitigation measures\n            include: the project will be implemented in roughly 20\n            Kecamatans by farmers and women groups, using block-grants,\n            and supported by both local government and consultants. The\n            emphasis will be to improve the livelihoods of poor rural\n            communities by providing technical assistance, capacity\n            building, and finance (through block grants) to allow\n            communities to identify and implement group-based income\n            generating activities. All sub-projects will be located in\n            the existing farming and plantation sites, and therefore,\n            land acquisition is expected to be insignificant.
