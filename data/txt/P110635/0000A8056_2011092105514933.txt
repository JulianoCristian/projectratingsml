                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although implementation is somewhat behind schedule, the project is making good progress and is expected to achieve its objectives. About 100 agricultural and women#s livelihood
                         groups, composed of up to 40 households per group, have been established at the community level to empower beneficiaries by strengthening capacity in the social, technical,
                         marketing, and financing aspects of livelihood development. These groups will both propose and be the beneficiaries of small, grant-financed investments in livelihood development,
                         training, and productive activities.
