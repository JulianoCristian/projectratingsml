Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Grantee performance was satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project implementation\n            duration was too short to assess the outcomes and\n            sustainability of the LEDP intervention. A continuous\n            monitoring of the impact and outcome is needed to be in\n            place for many years to assess the success of the new rubber\n            and cocoa crop, the proper management of the nurseries and\n            the sustainability of the enhanced agricultural practice. It\n            will be useful in future to provide space at the mid-term\n            review for a provisional International Development\n            Association (IDA) envelops to co-finance any innovative\n            pilot. LEDP activities should have, under ideal\n            circumstances, been implemented by the districts as part of\n            their mandate of providing agricultural extension services.\n            Outsourcing implementation was inevitable in such a low\n            capacity environment. Proposals like composting, biological\n            pesticides, pigs and hens' raising and vegetable\n            planting were genuine and proved to be economically\n            successful. They resulted in diversifying the livelihoods\n            options and improved Nias resilience in facing disasters and\n            capacity to achieve food security."}, "docdt": "2013-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
