Negative impacts and their mitigation\n            measures include: i) the local elite, though they come from\n            the same ethnic group, often dominate and exploit the\n            vulnerable and marginal groups; ii) women have very weak\n            positions in the society; have a very limited role in public\n            decision making and have no right to land ownership. Special\n            processes have to be built to make sure that women would get\n            equal benefit from the project. The project includes\n            creation of livelihood groups exclusive for women only; iii)\n            consultants ensure that planning process fully and\n            appropriately engage vulnerable groups, including the\n            indigenous peoples (IPs), women and low level sub-clan; iv)\n            consultants consult vulnerable individuals and groups in the\n            appropriate forum or meeting place. Results of these\n            discussions will be reported through the monthly report and\n            included in the project monitoring reports; and v) any\n            mitigation agreed by the IPs and vulnerable groups will be\n            as much as possible incorporated in the sub-project design\n            and its implementation is well monitored by the project\n            management unit (PMU) and village-based consultants."}, "docdt": "2010-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
