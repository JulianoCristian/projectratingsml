the\n            ability of the government to work with poor rural households\n            in Nias to identify, develop and sustain livelihood\n            opportunities. There are three components to the project.\n            Component one: livelihood groups and institutional\n            empowerment: The objective of this component is to empower\n            beneficiaries (livelihood groups and district government) to\n            improve their capacity to acquire the technical, social,\n            organizational, financial, management and marketing skills\n            for livelihoods development activities. Most of the\n            activities involve training and group facilitation, and\n            include: 1) training for agriculture livelihoods groups; 2)\n            training for women's livelihoods groups; and 3)\n            training and equipment for local government agriculture\n            services. Component two: agricultural and other livelihoods\n            improvement: component two will finance implementation of\n            program activities utilizing small group community support\n            grants and technical support services. This component has\n            two sub-components related to the implementation of: (i)\n            agriculture and women's livelihoods groups'\n            activities, and (ii) support to local government agriculture\n            services. Component three: management, monitoring and\n            evaluation: the objective of this component is to develop\n            management and technical capacity for implementation of\n            livelihood programs in Nias within the Kabupaten/Kota and\n            Kecamatans, as well as with Kementrian Negara Pembangunan\n            Daerah Tertinggal (KPDT).
