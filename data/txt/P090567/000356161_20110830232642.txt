SUMMARY
1.     This Restructuring Paper (RP) seeks your approval for the following proposals
under the Institutional Reform & Capacity Building Project (IRCBP) (Credit No. 4146-
KE) for the partial cancellation of undisbursed IDA resources of approximately XDR
9.75 million under the project. The aforementioned proposal is in response to the request
from the Government of Kenya (GoK).

2.      The project implementing entities are in full compliance with the Bank’s financial
management requirements, and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial
report from these entities.


PROJECT STATUS
3.      The original credit amount of XDR 17.3 million was approved by the Board on
January 24, 2006, and it became effective on July 19, 2006. As of August 29, 2011, the
project has commitments are estimated at about XDR 7.5 million which represents about
43% of the original credit amount. It is expected that all outstanding commitments will
be disbursed before the closing date of August 31, 2011.

4.      The objectives of the Project are to: (a) strengthen the Borrower’s public financial
management systems to enhance transparency; accountability and responsiveness to
public expenditure policy priorities, and (b) enhance public service delivery through
effective implementation of Results Based Management. The Project performance
ratings in the last Implementation Status and Results (ISR) report was Moderately
Satisfactory (MS), both in terms of probability of achieving Development Objectives and
Implementation Progress (IP).

5.      Progress of implementation was rated moderately satisfactory by the last
implementation support mission in June 2011 based on the status of the results indicators
whereby about 80% of the expected targets have been achieved. There has also been
satisfactory implementation progress of several key beneficiaries such as: (a) Kenya
Revenue Authority; (b) Teachers Service Commission; (c) Kenya National Audit Office;
(d) Pensions Department; (e) Internal Audit Department; (f) Debt Management
Department; and (g) the Parliament. The remaining targets are expected to be achieved
on or before closing date. Assessment of outcomes will be undertaken as part of the
preparation of the implementation completion report of the project.


PROPOSED CHANGES
Cancellation of Undisbursed Balance of IDA Resources
6.      The proposed cancellation of the undisbursed balance of XDR 9.75 million does
not involve any change in the original project development objectives and will not result
in significant changes to the Project’s description or associated outcome targets.

7.     The undisbursed balance in Categories 1 through 5 and the remaining balance of
Category 6 (Unallocated) will be cancelled and an amount equivalent to XDR 55,000.00
will be reallocated from Category 6 (Unallocated) to Category 5 (Operating Costs).
Relevant details pertaining to the various categories of Credit 4146-KE and resulting cost
savings are presented in the table below:

8.      The relatively large undisbursed balance was primarily due to the decision of the
government to use its own funds when IDA resources were immobilized by: (a) the post
election crisis in early 2008; (b) the putting on hold the procurement clearances during
the first half of 2009 due to fiduciary issues identified by the assessment undertaken in
early 2009 by the World Bank. It should be noted, however, that with respect to the
fiduciary issues, no fraud was identified but stronger internal controls were recommended
and were subsequently established. In addition, funds from other Donors were allocated
in an annual basis and government was often faced with the need to put higher priority to
utilizing donor funds.

9.      The undisbursed balance will be reallocated to a well performing regional project,
the Kenya Transparency and Communication Infrastructure Project (KTCIP, P094103),
to support the IFMIS Strategic Plan 2011-13 as requested by the government in its letter
of June 30, 2011. Among the activities to funded by the undisbursed balance are the
following: (a) levering industry-leading processes for financial management (aligned
with Oracle Financials) for the development of high-level end-to-end business processes;
(b) technical support to the IFMIS department for a further 24 months to facilitate full
roll out to the national and county government in line with the strategic plan; (c) develop

                                            8
and implement a capacity building program through the IFMIS Academy of an initial
2,000 officers (classroom based), thereafter to be extended to 4,000 officers via online
learning platforms; and (d) development of systems integrator for all the IFMIS modules.

10.     This restructuring of IRCBP is consistent with the Bank’s commitment to
continue to assist the Government’s development of a new comprehensive strategy to
reform public financial management in line with the requirements of the new Constitution,
and recognize that this effort is likely to include legislative and institutional changes, fiscal
decentralization, and as explained above, the implementation of the IFMIS Strategic Plan
for 2011-13. The Bank will also continue to support Kenya’s PFM reforms through various
analytical work and policy dialogue that covers three areas: (a) the budget and public
expenditure review process; (b) the fiscal decentralization process; and (c) social
accountability. In fact, the Bank’s public financial management team is actively
providing assistance at GOK’s request to several key processes that aims to bring aid
flows on-budget as well as prepare the new public financial management reform strategy
and the new public finance act and regulations.
