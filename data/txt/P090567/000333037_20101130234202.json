The main thrust of the\n            restructuring proposal would be to align the project with\n            the requirements of the new constitution (promulgated August\n            27, 2010) on public financial management and devolution, and\n            change some aspects of the project design and implementation\n            arrangement to reflect lessons learnt from over four years\n            of project implementation.
