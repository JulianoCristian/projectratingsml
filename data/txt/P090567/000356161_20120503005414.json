were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            political environment and public sector reform approach:\n            public sector reforms are inherently political and their\n            design and implementation has to be informed by a careful\n            and ongoing political economy (PE) analysis. Fiscal roles of\n            the branches of government and among different levels of\n            government are clearly defined in law and practice. Public\n            sector and governance reforms affect various interests and\n            often face resistance. The design, however, may have\n            underestimated the implementation challenges inherent in\n            managing such a complex program. While the project design\n            adequately identified high level leadership is key to\n            successful project implementation, effective leadership at\n            component and sub-component levels, is also equally important."}, "docdt": "2012-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
