                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since November 2012, progress has improved, though the slow rate of disbursements is a concern few months left before the last payments can be made under the ITF Grant.
                         Commitment stands at 99% of the total grant amount ($64.1m out of $65m). The works have all been implemented, and contract closings have been finalized as contractors have
                         submitted tax certificates. However, progress on the delivery of goods of the two major remaining goods contracts is still slow; shipment of the major remaining goods contract starts
