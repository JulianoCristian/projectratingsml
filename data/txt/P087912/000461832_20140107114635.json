Baghdad Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project for Iraq had a satisfactory outcome, with\n            the performances of both the Bank as well as the borrower\n            deemed to be

Significant\n            lessons learned during the course of implementing the\n            project were: 1) the Bank's tools to mitigate risks\n            were limited in Iraq, when the post-conflict environment did\n            not materialize; 2) trade-offs between risk mitigation\n            measures and speed of achievement of development outcomes\n            need to be examined; 3) the Bank should expand the role and\n            scope of the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) to respond\n            effectively to the ground realities; 4) capacity building\n            should not be bundled with technical assistance; 5) conflict\n            situations calls for thinking about monitoring and\n            evaluation differently; and 6) the cost of doing business in\n            conflict areas is high."}, "docdt": "2014-01-03T00:00:00Z"}
