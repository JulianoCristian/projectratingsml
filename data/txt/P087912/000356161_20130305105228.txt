  EMERGENCY BAGHDAD WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.      The proposed restructuring has been discussed and agreed upon with the
Mayoralty of Baghdad (MOB) during the last supervision mission of November 11-13,
2012. This restructuring paper aims to reallocate the trust fund proceeds to facilitate
project implementation. Indicators in the results framework will be revised to include the
sector core indicators to better reflect Project outcomes. A letter establishing a Grace
Period after Closing will be prepared as part of this restructuring package.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      Commitment stands at 99 percent of the total grant amount ($64.5 million out of
$65 million). The slow progress in the past months can be mainly attributed to three
factors: (i) nine works have been completed but contract closings are hindered by the
excessive period it takes contractors to submit tax certificates; (ii) one work remains
under implementation, but is close to completion; and (iii) progress on the delivery of the
remaining two goods contracts was lower than originally anticipated. The MOB-PMT
has taken steps to correct the situation and disbursements are to pick up in the next
months.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Results/indicators

3.      The current set of project indicators focuses mostly on infrastructure built rather
than benefits of this infrastructure on water users, and does not contain sector core
indicators. Indicators in the results framework will be revised as part of this restructuring
to include relevant core sector indicators, and to shift the focus from outputs to outcomes,
as described in Annex 1. There is no change in the Project Development Objectives.

Disbursement arrangements

4.     A letter establishing a Grace Period after Closing will be prepared to ensure that
the Project will operate under a grace period of 4 months.

Reallocation of proceeds

5.     As of December 2012, 79 percent of funds (about $52 million) have been
disbursed. A reallocation of proceeds is needed as the commitments in the works

                                             1
category exceeds the original allocation of $40.40 million. As a result, the proposed
reallocation is in the following manner:

Project Development Objective (PDO):
The principal objective of the Project is to assist in restoring basic water supply and sanitation services for the capital city of Baghdad through: (a) the reconstruction
and rehabilitation of existing priority networks and treatment facilities; and (b) providing capacity building support through training and technical assistance.
