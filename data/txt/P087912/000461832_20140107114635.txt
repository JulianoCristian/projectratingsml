I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

In the 1970s, large oil reserves and abundant human resources enabled Iraq to attain the status of a
middle income country, with developed infrastructure and well-performing education and health
systems. 1 Soon thereafter, ensuing wars, international sanctions and a repressive, state-dominated
economic system stifled economic growth and development, and debilitated basic infrastructure and
social services. International trade sanctions in 1991 took a toll on the economy. In addition, the
increasing concentration of economic and social activities in the main urban centers 2 was not
matched by the required expansion in the provision of services, resulting in proliferation of under-
serviced neighborhoods in major Iraqi cities. By 2001, despite the country's rich resource
endowment, human development indicators were among the lowest in the region, and income per
capita dropped to US$800, steadily declining to about US$500 by 2003.

Prior to the 1991 Gulf war, the population of Baghdad enjoyed a relatively high level of water
supply and sanitation services. Safe potable water was accessible to over 90% of the population of
Baghdad and average water supply was 330 lcd 3 . After 1991, the situation substantially
deteriorated, first due to international sanctions that hampered any efforts to import spare parts or
chemicals which were critical for efficient operation and maintenance, then as a result of direct
damage and looting that took place during and right after the 2003 war. At the time of appraisal, it
was estimated that water supply services were at 30% of 1990 levels (73% of the population had no
access), while the city’s three wastewater treatment plants (comprising 75% of the nation's
wastewater treatment capacity) were operating at 50% of installed capacity, hampered by lack of
maintenance, damage and looting, unreliable power supply, and inadequate water tariffs. Eight
water treatment plants served Baghdad with a production capacity of 2.15 million m3/day, whereas
the average demand was 3.3 million m3/day. Shortages of water led to numerous uncontrolled and
illicit connections that hindered any effort to maintain pressure in the system and exposed them to
contamination from leaking sewage networks and stagnant waters. It was estimated that
approximately 40% of the water distribution network in the city urgently needed to be rehabilitated
to reduce distribution losses (estimated at 50–60 %).

In 2004, at the time of appraisal, water production in Baghdad was 54% less than demand, 4 water
coverage was around 27% for safe potable water while 25% of Baghdad’s population,
approximately 1.5 million people, were still unconnected to the water network; and 30% of
Baghdad’s population was not connected to sewerage collection and treatment system. The
sanitation system in Baghdad was becoming a serious environmental and health concern as


1
  By early 1980s, income per capita was over US$3,600.
2
  At appraisal in 2004, close to 70% of the estimated Iraqi population of 26 million lived in cities, a quarter of which (6
million people) lived in Baghdad.
3
  This standard is substantially above actual water consumption in most of the rest of the world. The International
Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities documented in 2006 a median water production of 274 lcd
and a water consumption of 234 lcd.
4
  Eight water treatment plants served Baghdad where the demand for potable water was estimated to be 3.3 million
cubic meters per day whereas production capacity was only 2.15 million cubic meters per day.



                                                             1
untreated sewerage water discharged into rivers and waterways, as sewerage treatment plants were
operating at 50% of the installed capacity. This was further exacerbated by the illegal discharge of
septic sewage collected from houses into rivers or onto land. Leakage from sewer pipes was also
contaminating both the potable water networks and the underground water. In addition, it was
estimated that 1.5 million inhabitants had no access to piped water, and 1.2 million inhabitants had
no access to sanitation. The project focus therefore was on benefitting the total population of
Baghdad responding to emergency, and rehabilitation and reconstruction needs in the water sector.

In 2003, a Joint UN/WB Needs Assessment was undertaken, adopting a multilateral approach to the
reconstruction and development, which estimated that Iraq required about US$35.8 billion from
2004-2007. In response, the donors expressed support for the Needs Assessment and pledged about
US$32.0 billion for the four-year period. 5 To ensure swift, flexible and coordinated donor financing
for priority investments identified in the Needs Assessment, the World Bank and UN set up an
International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, which comprised of two trusts funds – a World
Bank Iraq Trust Fund (WB-ITF) and UNDG Iraq Trust Fund – each with its own internal
governance procedures and management structure, with mechanisms for close coordination to avoid
overlap.

The Bank’s involvement was regarded as critical as: (i) Bank financing could complement ongoing
infrastructure investments, especially the large financing gap for infrastructure rehabilitation, the
biggest obstacle to economic recovery; (ii) share international experience and best practices based
on the Bank’s considerable international experience with infrastructure reconstruction projects in
post conflict effected areas. In addition, it was conceived that Bank financing would be
implemented by the Iraqi institutions ensuring ownership and building institutional capacity, crucial
for country’s sustainable development; and Bank financing for rehabilitation would be coupled with
policy advice, thereby lay the ground for sector restructuring, essential for long term sustainability
of infrastructure investments.

The project was conceived as a part of the Iraq Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Program
which intended to cover five sectors: water supply and sanitation, electricity, urban rehabilitation,
transport, and telecommunications. However, in view of the limited availability of funds in WB-
ITF, and donors support already available for certain sectors, project were to focus only on urgent
water supply, sanitation, and municipal infrastructure needs in Baghdad. The project scope was the
urgent sectoral needs of urban communities in Baghdad in the following manner: rehabilitations of
water and sewer networks, pumping stations, small treatment plants, community roads, and other
urban facilities. It would also provide support in a post-conflict environment to the Mayoralty of
Baghdad (MOB) to better manage projects at design, supervision, operation, and maintenance
stages by building the capacity of its staff.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objective (PDO), as noted in the Grant Agreement (Schedule 2, p.10) and
the Technical Annex (p.6) was to: “restore basic water supply and sanitation services for the
capital city of Baghdad through: (i) the reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing priority


5
    At the International Donors' Conference for Iraq held in Madrid on October 23-24, 2003



                                                            2
networks and treatment facilities; and (ii) the provision of capacity building support through
training and technical assistance.”

According to the Technical Annex (p.6) the scope of the PDO would also include: creation of
vitally needed short-term employment and help build Iraq’s capacity to manage large-scale
reconstruction.

PDO Indicators. 6 These were: (i) improved the quality and increased the quantity of water produced
under the project; (ii) chlorine and chemical process at Al-Karakh Water Treatment Plant (WTP)
rehabilitated; (iii) 2B pumping station rehabilitated; (iv) Al-Rasheed WTP rehabilitated; (v) Abu
Nuwas raw water pumping station rehabilitated; (vi) old water network renewed and expanded in
Za’afrania district; (vii) about 8,000 house connections rehabilitated in Sadr City; and (viii) about
300 man month for training provided.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The Project Development Objectives were not revised, but changes were made to the results
framework target values under each restructuring adjusting for the changes made to the component
and funding allocation, impacting the target values or the indicators. In addition, during the course
of the 2010 restructuring: (i) indicator “increase in quantity of water produced and quantity of
sewage treated” was replaced with “increase in the quantity of water produced under the project”
with a target of 500,000 cubic meter of treated water per day; (ii) indicator “reduction in number of
citizens’ complaints” was dropped (iii) indicator “quantity of sewage collected and transported to
treatment plant (m3/day)” was added; and (iv) indicator “Al Rasheed WTP rehabilitated” dropped
as the component was being undertaken by GoI using its own funds. In the 2013 restructuring the
key indicators were revised and realigned, on the basis that the initial set of indicators focused
solely on infrastructure built rather than assessing benefits of this infrastructure on water users, and
did not contain sector core indicators. The revised results framework included relevant core sector
indicators, and shifted the focus from outputs to outcomes. The revised indicators, in addition to the
original indicators that were used through project implementation are being used for the assessment
of project achievements. The revised indicators are as follows:

PDO Indicators. These were: (i) number of direct project beneficiaries; (ii) number of direct project
beneficiaries who are female; (iii) number of people benefiting from sewerage extension or
rehabilitation works under the project; and (iv) number of households with access to rehabilitated
water distribution

Intermediate Outcome Indicators. These were: (i) water supply production capacity per hour
(m3/day); (ii) length of water supply network rehabilitated; (iii) number of new sewerage
connections; (iv) number of rehabilitated sewerage connections; (v) length of new sewerage


6
  As per the Grant Agreement (Schedule 5, p.20), but according to the Technical Annex (Annex 11, p.95) there were 9
indicators, the additional ones were: (i) increase in the quantity of water produced under the project; (ii) improvement in
the percentage of water samples meeting the WHO biological and chemical standards; and (iii) Sadr City sewerage
network rehabilitated was not included.



                                                            3
network installed; (vi) length of sewerage network rehabilitated; and (vii) no. of man-month
training provided through the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

At appraisal, around 23 percent of Iraq’s total population lived in the capital Baghdad, where the
population was estimated to be 6 million. The city had experienced intense urbanization due to
years of economic sanctions and key economic and social activities became concentrated in the
capital. Based on the investment focus the benefits were meant to accrue to the population of
Baghdad, directly or indirectly. Direct benefits accrued to the Za’afarania, a suburb of Baghdad, one
of the poorest districts in the Karrada Municipality of Baghdad Governorate; and 6 districts of Sadr
City. At closing even with component adjustments the beneficiary impact largely remained the
same.

Direct beneficiaries of the project are inhabitants of the areas or neighborhoods where rehabilitation
works occurred, whose water supply or sanitation services were improved or underwent urban
rehabilitation under the project. At appraisal, the number of direct beneficiaries was estimated to be
around 1 million inhabitants, a number that was progressively revised down to approximately
600,000 inhabitants when the scope of the project was reduced. At Project closing, it was estimated
that about 590,480 inhabitants directly benefitted from the Project investments through the
rehabilitation and renewal of water and sewer networks in Za’afraniya and Sadr City. While the
emergency works related to the installation of pumps, chlorinators and other equipment in water
treatment plants in Baghdad due to their large capacity will benefit – a large number of water end
users additionally upto 3.5 million people using water services from the MOB water infrastructure.

The Municipality of Baghdad (MOB) was designed to benefit from capacity-building activities to
ensure effective and sustainable implementation. The water and sanitation services are administered
centrally by the Baghdad Water Authority (BWA) and the Baghdad Sewerage Authority (BSA),
respectively. The planning and implementation of projects was the responsibility of the Mayoralty
of Baghdad. The Project was designed to provide support to the MOB to better manage projects at
the design, supervision, operation and maintenance stages by building the capacity of the staff
working in the water supply and sanitation sector, in the BWA, BSA and the local municipalities. It
also included the development of a Comprehensive City Development Plan (CCDP) to ensure that
future expansion of the water supply and sanitation networks are in line with the overall urban
development plan for the city.

1.5 Original Components

The PDOs, under the Emergency Recovery Lending (ERL), were to be achieved through eight (8)
main components.

Component 8: Development of a Comprehensive City Development Plan (CCDP) for Baghdad
(appraisal amount US$3.0 million; restructuring amount US$0.8 million; actual US$1.2 million). This
component would finance the development of a comprehensive urban city development plan for the city of
Baghdad, including analysis of the existing conditions and future trends related to land-use patterns, housing
conditions, population, roadways and other infrastructure.

1.6 Revised Components

The Project components were subject to several revisions, in price and scope, during implementation: (i) the
2010 restructuring canceled Component 3 (Extension and Rehabilitation of Al-Rasheed Water Treatment
Plant) as its implementation was taken over by the Government using their own funds; (ii) the 2010
restructuring also cancelled the phase II, III and IV of Component 8 (Comprehensive City Development
Plan (CCDP)) - due to the security situation resulting in the inability to field international staff to Baghdad
and hold serious consultation workshops, and the inability to carry out field surveys to deal with the lack of
data. The CCDP was therefore restricted to the preparation of phase I of the study and the review of the
existing conditions (mostly based on existing data) for the city of Baghdad, which included the land use,
socio economic conditions, housing, transportation infrastructure, utilities and community facilities; (iii) the
2011 restructuring changed one of the activities planned under Component 5 (Rehabilitation and Renewal of
Sadr City Sewerage Network) from works to goods contract, so equipment (vacuum, jetty and CCTV
system) could be procured to clean city’s sewers, eliminating the overflow of sewer on streets problem,
thereby improving the quality of life and reducing the risks to public health for the 2.7 million residents in
Sadr city.

1.7 Other significant changes

Projects Costs/Grant Financing/Borrower Contribution: The cost of the project was initially estimated to
be US$65.45 million grant funded from the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (WB-ITF) and contribution from
the Borrower. At closing, the actual project disbursement was US$61.7 million or 95% of planned
commitment of US$65.0 million. 9 About US$3.3 million remained undisbursed at closing At appraisal the
Borrower planned to contribute US$0.45 million; the actual contribution was at least US$0.45 million
equivalent (100% of planned), or maybe more. The MOB agreed to cover the cost of Iraqi staff seconded to
Project Management Team (PMT). The project did not actively document this contribution because it was in
kind contribution, and may very well have run over the appraisal amount as the project ran longer than
initially conceived and the staffing costs continued to be borne by the counterparts during that time. Project
attained effectiveness on the Grant Agreement signing (December 4, 2004).

Project Extension: The Project Grant closing date was extended four times during project implementation:
(i) extended for 23 months (legal amendment), establishing July 31, 2009 as the closing date to provide
sufficient time to complete all activities under the project; (ii) closing date extension on March 3, 2009
establishing June 30, 2010 as the closing date to accommodate for the difficult security situation; (iii) a
closing date extension granted for an additional 18 months (2010 restructuring), establishing December 31,
2011 as the closing date allowing additional time to fully implement the project and meet the PDO in full;
and (iv) granted for an additional 18 months (2011 restructuring), establishing June 30, 2013 as the closing

security situation that limited access of the consultants and contractors to work sites.

Funding Allocation: Funding allocations for the components were changed during restructuring. Details on
this are provided in Annex 2.

Reallocation of the Proceeds of the Grant: There were five reallocations of grant proceeds for the original
project, as follows:

Restructuring: The project underwent three level two restructuring during the course of implementation in
2010, 2011 and 2013, respectively.

Results Framework for the Project: Adjustments were made under all the three restructuring the project
went through (See Annex 2).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Design: The rationale for Bank involvement in the reconstruction and development of Iraq following
the 2003 war was sound. It would focus on infrastructure emergency response and rehabilitation, where there
were significant needs and demand as the other donors were focusing on other sectors or on new
investments. In addition, the Bank brought significant experience in post-conflict countries as well as strong
added value in infrastructure rehabilitation and capacity building. However, the background analysis of the
situation was hindered by significant difficulties getting access to reliable information on the ground, which
affected the quality of assessment of the rehabilitation needs at the outset. The PDO was carefully calibrated
to focus all investments and efforts on the urgent rehabilitation of infrastructure, while enshrining the need to
build capacity to implement and operate the infrastructure.

Project design was aimed mostly at rehabilitation works, both emergency and reconstruction, for networks
and production structures. The proposed components were in line with the development objective, and
consistent with the Project rationale. This consisted mostly of the supply of goods, installation and
rehabilitation works, and consultant services for supervision. All components were situated in or around
Baghdad, which limited geographic dispersion, a focus that made sense in view of ground reality and the
effect of conflict on the current infrastructure assets. Yet, the project carried a major source of risk as
Baghdad was the epicenter of violence for the duration of the post-2003 tension and war (it was estimated at
one point that 80 percent of violence during the war was concentrated in a radius of 50 miles around
Baghdad).




                                                         7
Implementation Arrangements were based on MOB having a clear mandate in the sector. A Project
Management Team (PMT) was created to ensure proper implementation and compliance with bank processes
and rules, with clear reporting and accountability mechanisms, including the water and sewerage directorates
and municipalities. Its effectiveness was foreseen to be hampered by: (i) low institutional capacity from the
start due to a general lack of experience of its staff further degraded by almost 20 years of neglect, which
would require significant efforts in training and institutional strengthening; (ii) staff were to be seconded
only part-time, which may result in often over-stretched staff and a lack of focus on supervision and
monitoring; and (iii) the lack of security was particularly acute in Baghdad and severely constrained any
supervision work, sometimes restricting access to place of work.

Lessons learnt as a result of Bank’s increased role in post-conflict reconstruction over the past decade and
guided by the World Bank Operational Policy (OP) 2.30, Development Cooperation and Conflict, in which
the reconstruction efforts put a premium on early but selective engagement, 10 flexibility in design and
implementation, capacity building, coordination with donors and other partners, and close monitoring and
evaluation coupled with Bank’s comparative advantage in rebuilding infrastructure. 11 In addition lessons
learnt from previous sector projects were adequately reflected in project design, mainly: (i) project kept
flexible to permit a quick response to changing circumstances; (ii) provide generic training in advance,
including project management, procurement, financial management, and environmental and social safeguards
for staff members associated with requisite ministries; (iii) planned capacity building to ensure client
readiness in project implementation; (iv) early and effective collaboration with donors, external partners, and
representatives of line ministries proved vital in previous emergency operations.

Risks: Risks were generally and adequately identified and mitigation measures were provided where
possible, including: (i) transition to a new Iraqi government – unknown outcomes that could affect project
implementation; (ii) administration changes in MOB – jeopardizing current commitment to project design
and inputs; (iii) sectoral priorities – difficult to establish in the current political setting – possible
disagreements between the MOB and other controlling agencies (MOPDC, MOF); and (iv) deterioration of
fiscal conditions – with sustainability problems for operations. In addition, goods lost or stolen, security
deterioration hampering project completion, difficulties hiring expatriate technical assistance consultants due
to unavailability of local capacity, inability to supervise on-site and a resulting reliance on intermediaries for
supervision, lack of familiarity or affinity with Bank procedures, which would most probably lead to
implementation delays, and difficulties with the flow of funds through the banking system. Most of these
risks asserted that the project implementation would happen in a post conflict environment. There was no
evidence of systematic and extensive contingency planning in the event this type of risk would materialize.
Once the risk of not moving to a post-conflict situation materialized, the toolkit for the Bank to respond to
these risks turned out to be rather modest in scope.

Quality at Entry (QEA): No QEA of the project was carried out by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG).

2.2 Implementation

Supervision: Project implementation, from effectiveness, spanned 8.5 years till grant closing and project
completion, with a regular trajectory of supervision missions (average of two to three missions annually).
Most of these missions took place outside Baghdad either in Jordan or Lebanon; missions to Baghdad were
very limited in time and did not include basic supervision. The task team leader (TTL) was HQ based, with

   The O.P 2.30 recognizes that countries even in conflict, the Bank should “continue efforts at poverty reduction and
maintenance of socioeconomic assets” and in developing a program for a country in transition from conflict may
become involved incrementally.

   OED. 1998. The World Bank’s experience with post-conflict reconstruction.

one country-level staff working in country on day to day issues. The project counted – despite its long
duration - only three TTL transitions. The Aide Memoires were detailed and focused on key implementation
issues. The project successfully dealt with several implementation hurdles.

The project implementation was significantly impacted by the three years of war (2006 to 2008) marked by
violence, sectarianism and political volatility in Iraq, particularly in Baghdad. The lack of security resulted
in: (i) hampering MOB’s implementation capacity; (ii) preventing the project design engineers from
accessing installations or performing field work generating significant tendering delays; (iii) being a
disincentive to contractors and consultants, local and international, from bidding for project activities; (iv)
making the implementation of the CDDP component extremely difficult; and (v) substantially impeding the
delivery of goods and the execution of works, and their supervision. In addition, due to the extraordinarily
difficult operating environment of project implementation delays were also experienced due to: (i) contract
prices showed that prices in Iraq where not only higher than the global prices, but higher than prices
originally anticipated at appraisal; and (ii) procurement delays due to weak capacity of the Iraqi counterparts
and the unfamiliarity with Bank procedures.

Supervision throughout implementation was in a response mode and proactively responded to ground
realities by taking the necessary actions to keep the project on course and to have the necessary
documentation to support it. As a result, the project was restructured a total of 3 times to extend the closing
date of the Project to allow for the completion of delayed components, cancellation, or modification of
components; changes in the results framework; and reallocation of proceeds following higher than expected
bidding outcomes (resulting from a significant increase in market prices in the time between appraisal and
the initial bidding processes). These restructurings responded to requests by the Government of Iraq (GOI) in
view of ground realities as they evolved.

Project implementation suffered systematic and significant implementation delays, both due to project level
and exogenous factors. Successive supervision missions systematically noted incredible difficulties in (i)
getting procurement packages ready and (ii) getting them executed properly, all the while proposing
adjustments in the Project design, ultimately leading to the cancellation of one component (Al Rasheed). In
addition, the Project closing date was extended 4 times, usually because activities remained stalled as the
closing date drew closer, and with little contingency planning (despite insistent requests from the Bank
team). Overall, the Project duration was extended from three years initially to an actual duration of more than
eight years.

Distinct allocation as made for capacity building funds but this was bundled with technical assistance – and
due to the ground realities more budget got allocated to technical assistance than capacity building, as a
result.

Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR mission took place July 29 – August 2, 2008 in Jordan. 12 The Bank
delayed the MTR to allow the PMT time for the preparation of the mid-term review report. The MTR
confirmed that the PDO as stated in the Grant Agreement were still valid. The MTR also acknowledged that
the project continues to experience delays in implementation due to security situation and relatively weak
implementation capacity. The MTR reached the following decision: (i) proceed with the restructuring as
planned in the March 2008 to accommodate general contracting price increases in Iraq; (ii) proceed with the
award of Al Za’farania. Al Sadr and CCDP contracts, left approximately US$7.0 million unallocated
allowing PMT to revisit proposed cancellation; 13 (iii) the Baghdad CCDP limited to Phase I and remaining
scope would be cancelled; and (iv) extension of closing date. At the time of the MTR total commitment made




12
  when actual MTR was planned for January 2006, was extended to January 2007, then April 2007, then to August
2007, and then again to November 2007.
13
  In March 2008 the PMT proposed the cancellation and restructure the project: (i) Component 1 and Component 3 due
to lack of sufficient funds; and (ii) cancellation of Package W02 under Component 2.



                                                                                                 10
were at US$ 56.6 million, while disbursement was US$11.7 million, which was approximately 18 percent of
the total value of the project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design: Granted that the project was an emergency operation and much was not known on the outset,
a basic monitoring and evaluation framework was included in project design, but with baselines to be
determined and targets to be refined during early stages of implementation by the MOB with consultant
support. The M&E design depended upon the use of project supervision reports, mid-term review reports and
annual implementation progress reports to monitor and evaluate progress of the Results Framework. The
design of the M&E framework largely focused on measuring progress of the component (percentage of
works completed per subcomponent). With two indicators focused on the quantity and quality of the water
supplied. Staffing to undertake project level M&E at the PMT was not defined but an “Independent
Monitoring Agent” would be appointed to assess compliance with the GA and the scope of monitoring
activities were not clearly delineated at appraisal (Technical Annex, p.15).

M&E Implementation: M&E during implementation of the project focused primarily on the physical
progress of works as outputs. Dedicated M&E staff was not available in the PMT team for most of the
duration of the project. The Bank was challenged on many fronts in regard to M&E, due to travel restrictions,
project uncertainties and changes due to security situation, but mostly because direct supervision was not
possible and basic data was not available. 14 The Bank team frequently reminded the PMT of its obligations
on M&E but without much effect. The physical progress was monitored as outputs; outcomes were not
accounted for during implementation.

The project restructuring of February 2013, focused on revising the indicators in the results framework to
include core sector indicators to better reflect project outcomes – a move in the right direction, but only four
months before project closing. In addition, the baseline and target value were left as “to be decided (TBD),”
or “blank.” Target values were established during the last supervision (April 2013), and at closing in the final
Implementation Supervision Report (ISR), it was partially incorporated (only included five of the
Intermediate indicators that the project delivered on).

M&E Utilization: M&E utilization was considered a compliance issue, as data was collected with the
objective to comply with World Bank requirement for monitoring the projects implementation progress and
PMT’s buy-in was limited.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

(a) Safeguards

Among the Bank’s Operational Policies (OP) for Safeguards, two policies were triggered. These were (i)
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), and (ii) International Waters (OP 7.50). No environmental or social
safeguard issue was identified during implementation, compliance with ESSAF was met

Environment: The project triggered OP 4.01 and was classified as Category B (Partial Assessment) at
appraisal since the investments were related to civil works without significant impact to the environment.
Under the project all sub-projects would be processed in accordance with the Environmental and Social



14
     The latest full census was conducted in Iraq in 1987, followed by a partial one in 1997.




                                                              11
Safeguards Assessment Framework (ESSAF) for Iraq (which was disclosed in English through the InfoShop
for EWSSURP in October 2004) was fairly detailed and comprehensive. In addition, it was planned under
the ESSAF that: (i) all sub-projects would be screened by the MOB through ESSAF checklist; (ii) code of
practice would be included as parts of civil work and purchase and installation of equipment contract; and
(iii) capacity building undertaken on environmental safeguards to enable MOB, and the Ministry of
Environment to address any potential aspects that may arise during the screening and implementation of the
components. 15 At design stage environmental safeguards were adequately addressed. During implementation,
EAs/EMPs were to be prepared for each component, most often by the resident engineer.

Throughout the project implementation period, Environmental Safeguard were mostly rated “Moderately
Satisfactory” as compliance with ESSAF was met on: (i) additional reporting information; (ii) improve the
compliance to workers, general public health, and safety measures; (iii) updating and upgrading standard
operating procedure of the Safeguard Focal Point. During implementation, EAs/EMPs were duly prepared
for Components 5 (Rehabilitation of Sadr City Sewerage Network) and 6 (Rehabilitation and Renewal of Old
Drinking Water Network with House Connection in Za’afarania), by teams from the University of Baghdad
and the University of Mustansiriya, respectively. EMP monitoring summary was a part of the Quarterly
Progress Report all throughout implementation, but from 2011 a more detailed reporting on each sub-project
EMP was included. Also, from 2011, the newly established Environmental Assessment Department (part of
the Solid Waste and Environment Directorate within the Mayoralty of Baghdad) has been responsible for the
follow-up and monitoring EMP post-construction within their recurrent budget, and for the preparation of
monthly and quarterly reports (previously completed by the Supervision Bureaus of the PMT during
subproject construction phase). The submitted inputs were reviewed by the PMT Safeguards Focal Point and
environmental consultant, the final product is an outcome of organizational collaboration. At completion the
MOB prepared and monitored relevant sub-projects EMP, while the EMP reporting was rudimentary but was
consistent throughout project implementation.

Social: At appraisal, Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) was not trigged. It was anticipated that land
acquisition and resettlement would be kept to a minimum and all land acquisition would be carried out in
accordance with the guidelines set forth in the ESSAF for Iraq. As per ESSAF guidelines, the project was not
allowed to finance any sub-projects on non-publicly owned land or allow for land acquisition as the
investment focus was rehabilitation of current assets. It was understood that all works would be on land
under Ministry of Finance ownership. Contract technical specifications included provisions to provide
unimpeded public access through diversions during project construction.

International Waters: The Bank’s policy on International Waterways (OP 7.50) was triggered as the project
was drawing intake water from both the Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries. At appraisal it was
determined that the project falls within the exception to notification requirement of the policy (Paragraph
7(a)) and a “no objection” was obtained from the Regional Vice President to this effect (cleared on
November 15, 2004). Compliance with this Bank’s policy was considered as Satisfactory as no issues were
raised during implementation. Before closing, the project also received a waiver for the riparian notification
that the project works had not led to an increase in water withdrawals.

(b) Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement: Procurement during early period was rated “Moderately Satisfactory” by 2008 and then to
“Satisfactory” rating from 2012 to closing. Procurement (mostly the preparation of bidding documents and
evaluation reports) was a major factor for implementation delays. Nationally in Iraq there were some non-


15
  The Technical Annex (p.15) also mentions: an EMP will be undertaken during Rustumiyah Wastewater Treatment
Plant (WWTP). This scope was omitted by appraisal so was not undertaken by the project.



                                                     12
Bank compliant procurement procedures and practices in place. These included: inadequate requirements for
registration of suppliers and contractors; insufficiently transparent and fair debarment procedures; continued
use of obsolete methods and procedures for procurement of goods and works and selection of consultants;
undue restrictions on access to bidding documents; absence of adequate national bidding documents;
insufficiently transparent bid submission; opening and evaluation procedures and contract award procedures;
lack of effective bid protest mechanisms on contract awards; and lack of effective contract management.
Additionally, the project provided substantial training in procurement and FM to build capacity to support
future implementation of projects. A review by the Bank Integrity Vice-Presidency identified that one of the
suppliers misrepresented the amount of commissions paid to an agent.

Financial Management: Throughout project implementation period, FM was generally rated “Moderately
Satisfactory” with some dips towards “Moderately Unsatisfactory” during 2007-09. The project’s overall
financial management arrangement was adequate, including staffing, financial reporting, and annual external
auditing requirements, sound internal controls and funds flow without major interruptions, with some delay
in fixed asset register reporting (but complied with before project closing). 16 Financial management was
outsourced to a private company as the Bank's Fiduciary Monitoring Agent for the ITF- and IDA-financed
projects. This was very helpful, as the contractor became familiar with Bank procedures and was able to
allocate the required resources when necessary. However, at the beginning, the project suffered from
frequent turnover of PMT staff with FM responsibilities which added to the lack of understanding of World
Bank guidelines causing ineligible expenditures, inaccurate accounting records, significant delays in
replenishing expenditures from the World Bank, and delays in reconciling project records with the World
Bank Client Connection. The overall performance of the financial management team improved during the
later stages of project implementation as PMT familiarity with Bank procedures increased.

Disbursement. The project suffered from payment delays, especially payments in Iraqi Dinars (IDQ), mainly
due to: (i) the weak banking system in Iraq, (ii) lack of familiarity of consultants and contractors with
internationally accepted business practices, especially the monthly submission of invoices and full
documentation of invoices, (iii) limited capacity within the PMT for management, and (iv) the reliance on
overly complicated Letters of Credit arrangements. Moreover, the project did not benefit from electronic
signature during most of the life of the project and had to send hard copies of documents to India and later
Europe. This heavy administrative process put an extra burden on the PMT and Bank staff.

Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA). The fiduciary monitoring agent (FMA) hired by the Bank for fiduciary
purposes, effectively operated within the scope of their terms of reference. FMA staff visited the PMTs two
to three times per month on average to: (i) review the PMTs’ IFRs and reconcile their records with the Bank
records; (ii) monitor unclaimed expenditures; (iii) verify disbursement plan updates; and (iv) provide on-the-
job training in FM matters. The FMA included the PMT-prepared IFRs in their quarterly reports, as well as
the adjusted IFRs (with their review comments and recommendations for the PMT IFRs). IFRs were
submitted in a timely manner. The FMA also conducted, on a sample basis, pre-screening and post-review of
withdrawal applications for direct payments and reimbursements. FMA technical staff visited all sites on a
regular basis to carry out physical verification with reporting and digital evidence of on-going works and
alerting the Bank on deficiencies in quality and complementation. The World Bank staff had the FMA staff
participating in all supervision missions.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

During the final stages of implementation, the PMT was regularly reminded that any works that were not
completed by Project closing would have to be financed and completed under the MOB’s direct
responsibility. According to the PMT, such arrangements have been put in place, and, most importantly,
funding was secured. Component 1 which was not fully completed, but all the good were supplied, some
installations were pending at closing. In addition, the Environmental Assessment Department, part of the
Solid Waste and Environment Directorate within the Mayoralty of Baghdad has agreed to follow-up and
undertake EMP post-construction monitoring within their recurrent budget in order to contribute to works
sustainability post project closure. A follow-up project is currently under discussion.

During implementation, the main focus was on dealing with the significant complexities of achieving results
in the difficult Iraqi circumstances, and little attention was given to institutional reform and capacity-building
as prerequisites to the sustainable operation and maintenance of the investments financed by the Project. Yet,
the significance of this has become increasingly clear to MOB management. In a recent training funded
through the World Bank Institute, 75 MOB staff participated in the “Leadership for Results” training that
aimed to solve water and sewer problems through teamwork and close collaboration with the local
population. In one of the pilots, the teams were able to increase collection efficiencies in a subsector of the
city. MOB management has also included several of the Bank procedures – such as procurement and
environmental monitoring – and integrated it in its own organization.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

The objective was highly relevant to Iraq’s reconstruction and development priorities as an emergency
project, and was clear on the reconstruction of physical assets, especially the water and sanitation
infrastructure and services, and capacity building. The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2013-
2016 also identified: poor public service delivery (including water) as a major source of discontent for the
Iraqi people and poor water quality and sanitation are also serious concerns in the key development
challenges facing Iraq. The project’s objectives remain consistent with the Bank’s CPS 2013-2016, and
directly respond to two out of the three broad result areas of engagement mainly: supporting economic
diversification for broadly-shared prosperity, and improving social inclusion and reducing poverty which
identifies: improved delivery of water supply services, and strengthened infrastructure services as clear CPS
outcomes.

The project’s objectives also align with the Government’s National Development Plan (2013- 2017), a
medium-term development strategy aimed at providing a framework for the country's sustainable
development. One of the goals of the Iraq National Development Plan is to reduce poverty through amongst
others the provision of basic services. The government’s policy is still to improve universal access to good
quality drinking water and also to improve sanitation, including improvement of wastewater collection and
treatment. The major focus is still on rehabilitation and optimization. The project focused mainly on
rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing systems as outlined in the National Development Plan.
Therefore, the objective, design and implementation remain highly relevant to the country and sector context.

The relevance of design and implementation was Substantial. The scope of design was focused, manageable
and well-targeted. The scope of project design was carefully calibrated to focus all investments and efforts on
the urgent rehabilitation of infrastructure, while enshrining the need to build capacity to implement and
operate the infrastructure. The project was fully consistent with the then Interim Strategy Note, which also


                                                       14
emphasized the need for rapid rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and services, short-term employment
generation and institutional capacity building as pre-requisite for long-term sustainable recovery (Technical
Annex p.3). The results framework accounted for all the components, and investment allocations were made
such that they focused on two poorer neighborhoods of Baghdad (Sadr city and Za’afarania), while other
investment accrued indirect benefits to all of Baghdad.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PDO essentially consists of one part and focused on: Restoring basic water supply and sanitation
services for the capital city of Baghdad to be implemented through a two prong approach: (i) the
reconstruction, rehabilitation, and upgrading of water and sewer infrastructure in the city of Baghdad; and (ii)
the provision of capacity building support through training and technical assistance. Substantial

The project successfully accomplished its PDO of restoring basic water supply and sanitation services
through emergency response as well rebuilding and rehabilitation, supported substantially through “on the
job” training. Infrastructure investments in the city of Baghdad assisted in rehabilitating and/or
reconstructing water and sewerage networks and benefitted almost 590,440 people directly – impacting their
quality of lives, well-being, and health. Of the total number of direct beneficiaries, 290,496 beneficiaries 17
were female.

Outputs:
• 18 chlorinators and ancillary equipment installed
• 6 pumps of varying sizes installed with a total capacity of 18,000 m3/hour for Abu Nuwas Raw Water
   Pumping Station
• 43.5 km of sewer network reconstructed in Sadr City
• 7,125 sewer connections replaced in Sadr City; with another 1,800 house connections benefiting from
   improvements on the transmission network
• 1.9 km of transmission network replaced in Sadr City
• 44 km of water supply network replaced in Za’afraniya
• 306 man-month training provided through the project – 102% of the target met

Outcomes:
• Targeting of primary beneficiaries was met 100% under the project, 590,440 benefited against a target of
   590,000. In sum, the project in all benefitted 5.8 million people, of which 590,440 people were primary
   beneficiary and 5.2 million people were secondary beneficiary.
• A total of 115,440 people directly benefiting in Sadr city which included 92,150 people from
   reconstruction of sewer network in Sadr City, and 23,290 from improvements to the transmission
   network;
• 475,000 people directly benefiting from water supply networks in Za’afraniya
• 1.7 million people benefiting from sewer maintenance equipment in Sadr City
• 1.2 million people benefiting from improvements to water supply system in Baghdad
• 2.3 million people benefiting from improvements to the water treatment plant of Shark Dijla (with
   funding from UNICEF and MOB; Bank only funded 2of the 6 pumps)




17
  According to the data of the Statistical Office, women make up about 49 percent of the total population. No specific
data could be found for Baghdad.




                                                         15
Beneficiary population – The project consisted of two types of interventions. The works in Sadr City and
Zafraniya were reconstruction works. The works in Sadr City – which also included work on the
transmission networks – have reduced sewer blockages in six sectors and in some sectors adjacent to the six
that were directly affected by the project. As the sectors are densely populated the number of people
indirectly benefiting from the project could be a significant addition to the 115,480 directly benefiting from
the project. In addition, the delivery of equipment to the two municipalities in Sadr City to maintain the
sewer networks is to benefit all of Sadr City’s population of 1.7 million 18 by reducing the number of sewer
blockages. The works in Zafarniaya benefited 475,000 people with access to improved water supply services.

The smaller project components were essentially emergency investments aimed at improving the quality of
water by supplying new equipment (pumps, chlorinators, chemical units, etc.). These emergency investments
have brought large benefits to the population of Baghdad – even when the benefits of component 1 which
were not fully installed by project closing – are excluded. It is estimated that 2.3 million people can benefit
from the works under Component 2 (Shark Dijla Water Treatment Plant) that were funded by the Bank,
UNICEF and MOB. The number of beneficiaries of Component 4 (Abu Nuwas Water Pumping Station) can
amount to 1.2 million people.
In addition, the capacity building component of the project achieved its goals. Yet, the funding for most
activities did not come through the project but through other means of funding, because (i) the capacity
building component was very small as it was combined with TA and operating costs; and (ii) with the delays
in implementation the TA and operating costs increased (as did the works that turned out to be more
expensive than originally anticipated) crowding out the funds for capacity building. The majority of the
capacity building efforts were linked to “on-the-job” training complemented with workshops, seminars,
technical training tours, and a leadership for results training that helped MOB staff to pilot the use of result-
based approaches in addressing urgent water and wastewater challenges in the city.

Household connected – 8,925 household sewerage connections were rehabilitated and restored under the
project.

Accrued health and other benefits – Between 2000 and 2011, UNICEF conducted three surveys in Iraq,
which amongst others looked into water and sanitation access and diarrhea incidence. According to these
surveys, diarrhea incidence decreased between 2000 and 2011. It also noted that the sharpest declines were
registered in Erbil, Salahaddin and Baghdad. In Baghdad, the incidence of diarrhea under five year old in the
past two weeks declined from 20.9 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2011. This is likely to have had a
positive impact on child mortality and morbidity.

Short –term employment – It is not quantifiable but the project did generate gains in short-term
employment as a result of the physical works undertaken during the project implementation.

3.3 Efficiency

The economic and financial benefits of this project were not quantified at appraisal (Technical Annex p.16),
as this was an emergency operation (as allowed under OP8.50). However, a case was made that the project
investment was economically viable as it will: (i) produce an improvement in the quality of life of about a
million people in Baghdad through the elimination of sewage backup in streets and homes; and (ii) reduce
the incidence of oral fecal diseases and the rate of mortality in children which are most affected by water-
borne diseases. In addition the project not only provides for the rehabilitation of water and sewerage facilities


18
  Data on access to sewer network was 63.1 percent in Baghdad Governorate. It tends to be lower in poorer
neighborhoods, but it is likely to be higher in the capital city of Baghdad. We have assumed that 63 percent of the
current population in Sadr City will benefit from improved sewer maintenance.



                                                        16
but compliments and enhances the effectiveness of other works underway in Baghdad by other donors,
notably the US. In addition to ensure sustainability, the project provided for capacity building in accounting,
financial management, information system, billing, collection and tariff. In addition, with a forecasted
investment of US$65 million and 1 million beneficiaries, the per capita project cost was estimated at US$65.
Therefore given the high positive externalities for investment of this type, the project was expected ex-ante to
be cost effective.

In the absence of an economic and financial analysis at project appraisal, the analysis made at project
completion can only be limited in scope as there is nothing to compare the results with. In addition access to
project sites was still not possible due to travel restrictions in Iraq at the time of project completion.

For the two main investment projects, we rapidly appraise the costs of the systems, assuming that the
operation and maintenance cost of the system would add to 5 percent of the investment costs. The number of
beneficiaries used in this rapid assessment is discussed in the previous Section 3.2 and Annex 2, while we
used the government standard of providing water of 350 lcd with a wastewater flow of 90 percent. 19 Project
delays are included in these calculations as actual work under either of these schemes did not start until 2008.
Under these assumptions, the following conclusions can be reached:

Za’afraniya:
• The net present value of the total cost per person served over the lifetime of the project of 25 years is
   US$9.07;
• The net present value of the cost of water supplied is US$0.07 per cubic meter;
• Consumers before rehabilitation were relying on tankers and were reportedly spending 20 percent of
   their family income on water. In such a context, the cost benefit ratio – even before taking into
   consideration any externalities – is positive;
• In a recent article on the cost of deficient water supplies in Baghdad, it was mentioned that where water
   quality is deficient, the incidence of waterborne diseases was markedly higher than where water quality
   was up to standard;
• In summary, this investment is a very cost-effective one if compared to an average price of water supply
   distribution network of US$0.75 20 as mentioned in the literature.

Sadr City:
• The net present value of the total cost per person served over the lifetime of the project of 25 years is
   US$103.00;
• The net present value of the cost of water supplied is US$0.90 per cubic meter of wastewater collected; 21

     likely to be positive;

     where the cost of wastewater collection is estimated at US$1.00 per cubic meter of wastewater collected.

In addition, the incidence of diarrheal diseases has decreased rapidly in Iraq in recent years. Data from the
Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys that were conducted in Iraq in 2000, 2006 and 2011, shows that in Baghdad
Governorate 22 the diarrhea incidence between 2000 and 2011 declined by almost 31 percent. A recent
article 23 on drinking water pollution in Baghdad confirmed the major health effects of pollution of especially
drinking water as measured in terms of infant and child mortality. So positive externality of health impacts
could be substantial; direct attribution of such impacts as a result of project investments remains a challenge.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The project successfully delivered on its project development objective to restore basic water supply,
sanitation and urban services for urban areas of the city of Baghdad under a very difficult context. Overall
the project benefitted almost directly 567,190 people while the emergency operations in the major water
treatment plants benefited a large part of the Baghdad population with improvements in water quality. In
addition, the sewer maintenance equipment for Sadr City is benefiting a population of 2.7 million in these
two municipalities. The project did suffer from some delays and increased costs for reasons explained above,
but stayed on course toward emergency rebuilding of infrastructure in Baghdad in a very difficult work
environment. The project proactively dealt with many unknowns in the ongoing conflict environment,
resulted in almost full disbursement, and a more than satisfactory completion of the works.

Relevance of the objectives is rated High, and design is rated Substantial. The objective “Restore basic water
supply and sanitation services for the capital city of Baghdad” is rated Substantial. Overall, efficiency is
rated as Substantial. As a result, the overall Project Outcome is rated as Satisfactory. As a result, the overall
Project Outcome is rated as Satisfactory.

Rating: Satisfactory

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project was focused on serving these areas where the poor were very well represented. Za’afraniaya was
classified as one of the poorest districts in the Karrada municipality bordering Baghdad city. Sadr City (or
Al-Thawra city) was built as a public housing project for Baghdad’s urban poor.

As also mentioned earlier Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), access to piped water through house or
yard connections of the poorest quintile in Iraq increased from 12.8 percent in 2000 to 41.6 percent in 2011.
A similar rapid increase was registered for access to toilets connected to the sewer network or a septic tank
that increased from 10.1 percent in 2000 to 36.2 percent in 2011. This is not fully attributable to the project

   Baghdad Governorate exceeds the boundaries of Baghdad, but about 60 percent of the households in the governorate
reside in Baghdad city.

investment as the Bank was not the only organization funding investments, but it is possible to conclude that
the Bank project investments contributed to these gains.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project included technical assistance and capacity building. As the allocation in the project budget for
training was limited, funding for training was mainly dependent on external funding and “on-the-job”
training. The funding came in the form of formal training in workshops funded by USAID, and other Bank
trust funds that help to organize workshops and study tours regarding asset management, non-revenue water,
wastewater reuse, and utility and water resource management. The Bank also provided support to MOB
through the Leadership for Results Program that helped MOB staff to use a result-based approach to urgent
water and sewer problems in the city within a timeframe of 90 days.

In addition, the Bank team in the first years provided training especially on contract management as a
standard part of supervision missions, adding additional time to train PMT staff, contractors and consultants
in contract management skills. The very close supervision of the project on a virtual daily basis provided
“on-the-job” training to the PMT on all aspects of Bank project management (procurement, financial
management, disbursement, contract management, etc.). In addition the FMA provided on-the-job training
and more formal training to MOB staff during the project implementation on a regular basis during project
implementation. “On-the-job” training was also provided to MOB staff at the final stages of project
implementation through suppliers training on use of equipment. MOB reported that the use of Bank
procurement procedures is now also used when MOB undertakes procurement with its own funds.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

In Baghdad, houses on plots under 200 m2 cannot legally connect to the sewer network. As population
pressures are high, especially in places like Sadr City, it is likely that more people will benefit from the
works albeit not all officially. As the population of Sadr City is divided in 80 sectors and a total population of
2.7 million is living here, and the sectors tend to be relatively even in setup, the average population per sector
in 2013 would be 33,750. This would translate in a total beneficiary population in the six sectors of about
202,500 people. For the estimation of the number of beneficiaries, we have used the estimate of 115,480
people benefitting directly from the project interventions. As a rapid survey in Sector 38 and 55A showed
that all households were connected, the number of people actually benefiting from the project may be
significantly more than the numbers of those legally connected.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not Applicable. A beneficiary survey was not conducted or programmed under implementation.
However, the PMT included a number of beneficiary random ad-hoc surveys while preparing its completion
report. The major outcome of these surveys is that in generally there is significant satisfaction with the
outcomes of the project. Satisfaction with the efficiency of the network in two sectors of Sadr City increased
significantly at the same time that the number of sewer blockages declined.

Another interesting feature from this survey was that the number of house connections increased rapidly once
rehabilitation of the sewer networks were completed from 84 to 100 percent in Sector 55A and from 72 to
100 percent in Sector 38. A similar survey in Za’afraniya found that 100percent of respondents were
connected to the reconstructed water supply network and that dependence on water vendors had ceased.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

The risk to development outcome is rated high as in the context of Iraq as the unknown outweigh the known,
especially in the case geopolitical safety and security at the local level. This would directly affect the
likelihood that completed works are not operated and maintained in a satisfactory manner, or that
improvements in water and sanitation services received by beneficiaries are not maintained, or vice versa.
This is due to: (i) inefficient sector governance, as institutional reform has not yet been initiated (CCDP
could not be completed) and the sector still struggles with technical and fiduciary capacity challenges; (ii) a
prevailing inefficient financial model where water tariffs are inadequate, in design as well as in levels,
capacity for proper financial management and asset management is limited (albeit that fiscal transfers to the
sector are large); and (iii) a persistently volatile context where political contestation, sectarianism and
violence still remain.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The Bank’s performance during preparation is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank adequately
responded to sector and country demands with the objective to help Iraq’s development and reconstruction
priorities. The scope of design was focused, manageable, well targeted, and was carefully calibrated to
respond to immediate needs, both with regard to investment and capacity, in order to restore basic water
supply and sanitation services for the capital city of Baghdad. The urgency with which the project was
prepared did not always allow the project team to focus on all elements of project preparation. As a result, in
an environment where much was not known due to years of isolation and conflict, the project was prepared
well within these constraints. The technical annex and ESSAF were fairly detailed. Lack of information
precluded full preparation for capacity building, financial and economic analysis, monitoring and evaluation
and contingency planning for a situation of security deterioration (despite a clear identification of these risks
at design).

In essence the project design hinged on the assumption that project implementation would happen in a post-
conflict environment, which did not materialize during the life of the project. The Bank did not have any
precedent in this context when the reality in Iraq, especially in Baghdad turned out to be that project
implementation continued in a conflict situation. At the outset the scope of the Third Party monitoring was
designed to palliate the inability of Bank teams to supervise the Project on the ground, but their terms of
reference had a limited scope that essentially did not compensate for the lack of Bank in-country supervision
(especially with regard to safeguard compliance and project monitoring).

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

(b) Quality of Supervision

The Bank’s performance during implementation is rated Satisfactory. The Bank essentially operated in an
environment where it did not have any precedent (conflict situation) and did not have access to many tools to
respond adequately. The Bank team supported the implementation of the Project during extraordinarily
difficult circumstances, which were only partially foreseen at appraisal.



                                                       20
The Bank was continually challenged on the implementation front; as a result it was constantly in a response
mode throughout the implementation period and grappled with many hurdles. The deterioration of the
security situation quickly prohibited any field missions and hindered the team’s capacity to perform direct
supervision of implementation progress. As a result the Bank team had to rely on third parties that were
working under a terms of reference of limited scope focusing on procurement, physical verification of works
and financial management. In spite of these circumstances, the team met regularly with counterparts and was
proactive in assessing the evolution of the situation and proposing adjustments as a result to deal with the
construction of the infrastructure. The Bank team invested significantly in supervision support to deal with
the capacity gaps and constantly provided on-the-job advice with field staff providing continuous support. It
also provided training wherever it could – in view of the small project budget and spent major efforts to
secure other funding sources to provide support for capacity building. The project was diligently and timely
restructured three times in response to project changes as they surfaced, and compliance with fiduciary and
safeguards was adequate. Monitoring of activities was mainly related to the on-going physical output
progress with little emphasis on outcomes but was revised at the end of project implementation.

Capacity building activities – apart from on-the-job training – were especially in the earlier years mostly
focused to familiarize PMT staff with Bank procedures and improve contract management. Investments were
made to build capacity in MOB staff by providing them with knowledge on improving water and wastewater
service delivery through workshops (on for instance asset management, and non-revenue water), study tours
and result-based management pilots.

The Bank proactively continued to operate implementation in a very difficult environment by being proactive
and results were achieved. In hindsight, there were some shortcomings which should be considered in the
extremely difficult environment in which the project was implemented as the “growing pains” or “learning
opportunity” of working in a conflict environment.

Rating: Satisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The project was a timely response to realities on the ground in Iraq for Baghdad. The urgency with which the
project was prepared did not enable the team – especially in an environment where much was not known – to
ensure that the project was fully ready to be implemented as it relied on the assumption that a post-conflict
environment would materialize once the project would be implemented. When this crucial assumption did
not materialize, the Bank was left with a very limited set of instruments to undertake project implementation.
The project did suffer delays during implementation, mostly a consequence of factors relating to security and
ongoing conflict. The Bank team responded proactively to issues that arose during implementation and
adapted to the unpredictable circumstances in Iraq. World Bank support to the Government of Iraq in
preparing and implementing the project is rated as Satisfactory as the Bank was able to perform and deliver
on the project outputs and outcomes. Most importantly, the project responded directly to the Borrower’s
rebuilding needs in a timely and responsive manner, despite the lack of enabling environment, directly and
indirectly benefitting around 4 million people in Baghdad alone as a result of emergency and reconstruction
works.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                                     21
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

At appraisal, the Mayoralty of Baghdad (MOB) was the Government counterpart agency for the project.
However, municipal services, such water, sanitation and solid waste collection, under each jurisdiction were
delegated to the respective nine municipalities in Baghdad. While water and sanitation services are
administered centrally by the Baghdad Water Authority (BWA) and Baghdad Sewerage Authority (BSA).
Overall, it was mired in the same difficulties faced by most public sector institutions. The Government
cannot be held responsible for the security concerns that impacted project implementation as it was due to
exogenous factor beyond the scope of jurisdiction. Although the Ministry strongly supported the project and
its objectives are aligned with the National Development Strategy, support wavered slightly during
implementation which resulted in implementation delays when the government refused to pay for taxes
incurred by contractors and consultants. A testimony that the Government supported the project till the end
was the provision of staff seconded to the PMT from existing technical units initially for three years but
which continued till project completion, for more than 8 years. In addition, it is using the Bank procedures in
the procurement of the turnkey contract for the Al Rasafa treatment plant.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Within the MOB, BWA, and BSA, the project implementation was undertaken by the Project Management
Team (PMT). Administrative and bureaucratic constraints at times impeded project progress, but it should be
taken into account that the PMT worked under extraordinarily difficult conditions in the context of country
that levitated from conflict to rebuilding. The PMT during implementation was stretched, as the staff
seconded to the PMT in reality was performing two jobs. Despite the dearth of such specialists, the PMT was
able to attract environmental and legal staff to assist in dealing with the issues that arose during project
implementation. Additional exogenous factors included continued lack of clarity with respect to tax
treatment and letter of credit hurdles, but the PMT was able to achieve the project outcomes in a cost-
effective manner, and should be commended for their dedication and ability to deliver the project outputs and
outcomes successfully.

Rating: Satisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

The overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the Government’s commitment
to achieve the Project Development’s Objective, their continued staffing of the PMT, the full achievement of
results, but also taking into account delays in project implementation, all this within the context of lack of a
proper enabling environment. It is important to consider that this project was not implemented under
ordinary circumstance but rather under extra ordinary circumstances, within an environment that was not
enabling, institutions that were also in rebuilding mode just like the country, while in parallel grappling with
many exogenous factors beyond the scope of this project – and reaching project completion should be
applauded.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned


                                                      22
Iraq significantly challenged the Bank’s ability to perform successfully in post conflict-states under O.P
8.50 . The Bank’s tools to mitigate risks were limited in Iraq, when the post-conflict environment did not
materialize. Even though the Bank had identified the risk of on-going conflict, it did not include sufficient
contingency planning as to how to operate in such an environment. The Bank’s experience and its
instruments to deal with such a situation were limited; the teams were mostly reliant on the FMA and on
restructuring (which is not a very flexible tool, is time consuming and requires a formal client request which
can be difficult to obtain in conflict-affected situations). The number of restructurings could have been
reduced if a more flexible approach in the definition of project components had been applied (with for
instance one investment component instead of each subproject defined into a project component).

Need to examine trade-off between risk mitigation measures and speed of implementation/achievement of
development outcomes. The Bank often has to make difficult trade-offs in conflict areas between risk
mitigation and implementation expediency. For example, the lack of a designated account (put in place as a
risk mitigation measure) meant that all payments were to be processed by the Bank team, and similarly
virtually all procurement was made under prior review procedures, and this added to the transaction costs of
implementation in terms of time needed to achieve project goals. Considering these trade-offs during
project preparation may result in a more realistic assessment of project implementation period.

The Bank should consider expanding the role and scope of the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) to
respond effectively to the ground realities. Under the project FMA scope was limited to physical verification,
procurement and financial management and did not include safeguard compliance and project monitoring or
technical supervision. Project experience confirms that in situations where the Bank cannot go on field visits,
and hence the accessibility to project implementation monitoring is limited, the scope of the FMA activities
should be expanded to encompass all aspects of project monitoring if possible. It should also be noted that in
conflict-affected countries such as Iraq, technical and managerial capacity may not be available in the local
consulting market to a degree sufficient to substitute for Bank team supervision. Nevertheless, in such an
environment, while the Bank regularly assessed the effectiveness of the FMA, it might have usefully
explored the possibility of expanding the scope of their Terms of Reference beyond fiduciary monitoring
alone.

Capacity building should not be bundled with technical assistance. In hindsight since the allocation for
capacity building under the project was bundled with technical assistance, the actual allocation of funds to
capacity building was limited especially as the implementation delays required more funds for technical
assistance. In future projects, the capacity building budget allocation should be independently dedicated.

Conflict situation calls for thinking about M&E differently. Project experience shows that M&E of an
emergency operation may not incorporate the necessary rigor at the preparation stage as the project
preparation is not based on a comprehensive sector review. In the case of Iraq, monitoring was further
complicated by the lack of reliable data. M&E should be given due priority for reassessment during
implementation. Additionally M&E should focus equally on outputs and outcomes, should be kept simple,
and target values should be established. Most importantly, the project should facilitate client capacity to
assume these responsibilities from the beginning of the project to foster a target- and results-driven mindset
for the project. A simple beneficiary assessment should be a standard part of Bank preparation and
implementation to validate project results.

The cost of doing business in conflict areas is high. Supervision in a conflict environment is costly, as is
reflected in the high cost of supervision and the dependence on FMA. Hence, in such an environment it is
important that the Bank is very selective in its operations and focuses its interventions on working with those
agencies that have implementation capacity.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Introduction
The project at appraisal was conceived very differently than the project that was eventually implemented.
Several factors have affected all project components as described below. They relate to a (i) radical change
in the macroeconomic climate between project appraisal and project implementation; (ii) the endurance of
the conflict and the ensuing lack of safety in many parts of the country; and (iii) a legal and regulatory
environment that was biased towards the private sector.
Changes in the macroeconomic environment. The project was prepared in 2004 in an environment with
scant and unreliable data that was dating back from an era in which prices were heavily controlled. After
2003, the economy started to liberalize all prices with the exception of energy and some food items. In
addition, the country suffered from supply bottlenecks and conflict that resulted in an acceleration of
inflation between 2003 and 2006, when inflation averaged about close to 40% annually. By end of 2007
inflation was brought under control, but the high inflation in the earlier project years resulted in a sharp
increase in overall price levels compared to the situation at project appraisal. The high inflation resulted in
most project components ending up significantly more expensive than originally planned.

The endurance of the conflict. The intensity of the conflict has varied over the years, and lack of security
has remained a major concern. The lack of safety had a profound impact on project implementation. The lack
of security has made it difficult to attract high quality contractors and consultants. International contractors
and consultants, especially in the project’s early years, proofed impossible to attract (with bidding process
not attracting any, or sufficient bidders). At the same time, in a country where the private sector is
underdeveloped, the capacity of local contractors to bid for works – especially larger ones – has been limited.
The lack of supply of high quality staff to implement projects resulted in extended time needed to award
contracts as often several rounds of bidding were necessary, resulting higher bid prices to account for the
lack of security in the country that exceed the budgets allocated at appraisal. To deal with the limited local
capacity and lack of interest of international bidders, solutions were introduced; such as splitting contracts


                                                      26
into a set of smaller contracts to attract local contractors; and the use of joint ventures. However, these
strategies were not without costs as the capacity of local contractors turned out to be highly variable (as is
shown in the relatively frequent use of early contract terminations and long implementation periods), while
the burden on project management to supervise a larger series of small contracts increased.

Note: 2013 data pertain the period from January 1 – September 15, 2013 from www.iraqbodycount.org

The lack of security was also reflected in the quality of engineering designs and implementation. As
consultants prepared the designs, the lack of security often did not make it possible to go to the sites. A
number of designs were made using remote sensing data, but the lack of ability to calibrate the satellite data
with the situation at the site – in combination with the long delays in awarding contracts – resulted in the
need to often significantly change the design while it was being implemented; resulting in higher costs and
implementation delays. During implementation, the lack of security resulted at work being interrupted at
times.

The regulatory environment is still not very favourable to the private sector. The limited capacity of local
contractors and consultants was further aggravated by regulation that often was not very conducive to doing
business. The Bank’s “Doing Business” report of 2013 ranked Iraq still as very low in the ease of doing
business. Contractors and consultants were operating in an environment of byzantine rules and regulations
and a government not at all familiar with international business practices.

Project Components

Component 1: Rehabilitation of Chlorine and Chemical Units at Al-Karkh Water Treatment Plant
(appraisal amount US$2.8 million; actual US$0.9 million) Al-Karkh Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was
constructed in 1985 and is one of the largest treatment plants in the world with a total capacity of 1,365
million liters per day (MLD). This plant is large enough to serve 3.9 million people according to the
government’s standard of serving people with 350 liters per capita per day. The source of raw water is the
River Tigris and water treated by the plant supplied for 65 percent of the total water demand of Baghdad.
Unavailability of spare parts, damaged equipment and chlorine leakages, over the last 14 years affected the
plant efficiency. This component aimed to improve the reliability and efficiency of the chlorination and
chemical processes and increase safety by installing new automatic chlorinators and by rehabilitating the



                                                      27
ventilation system. The component will improve the reliability and efficiency of the chlorination and
chemical processes and increase safety with the installation of the automatic controls.

Due price escalation, the bids for these works turned out to be much higher than planned for during project
appraisal. Therefore, it was decided to re-bid the process with a local supplier. Yet, the local supplier was not
able to get the supplies purchased and installed, and eventually the contract was terminated. The third bid
which was won by another local supplier in July 2011, which has been struggling with the purchase and
installation of the chlorinators, ancillary equipment and spare parts. The delivery of supplies has been
hindered by administrative issues, including the difficulties to use letters of credit in the country. By June 30,
2013, about 65 percent of the goods were installed under this component. The Mayoralty will pay for the
remaining equipment, including the automatic controls, to be installed. A payments are still pending under
this contract as the grace period was extended to December 31, 2013.

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Outputs:
A total of 18 chlorinators and ancillary equipment have been installed.
Outcome:
At completion, when only the project indirectly may have benefitted the population, but as not all
chlorinators have been installed yet, the full impact of the benefits has not yet been achieved.

Component 2: Rehabilitation of 2B pumping station in Shark Dijla Water Treatment Plant (appraisal
amount US$4.5 million; actual US$3.4 million). Baghdad is located on the two sides of the Tigris River. It
receives its potable water from two principal WTP, namely Al-Karkh WTP (mentioned above) on the west
side (Karkh district), and the Shark Dijla WTP (540 MLD), on the east side in the Rasafa District. In 1989, a
820 MLD (820,000 cubic meters per day) blending station, referred to as the 2B pumping station, was added
to the Shark Dijla WTP to receive potable water from Al Karkh WTP and pump it to the Rasafa district. This
pumping station has not been renovated since the 1990s and was in dire need of repair. The pumping station
could serve up to 2.3 million residents.

This component aimed to rehabilitate the 2B pumping station at the Shark Dijla WTP by overhauling the six
vertical pumps, replacing the valves and 3 chlorinators and install UPS systems and batteries. However, the
cost of the goods turned out to be significantly higher than originally anticipated, and eventually the project
only funded 2 vertical pumps and the valves. As the rehabilitation of the pumping station was very urgent in
2005, the Mayoralty stepped in with its own funds to replace 2 vertical pumps while UNICEF funded the
remaining two pumps. This contract was signed for US$3.4 million of which US$3.0 million was disbursed.

Rating: Satisfactory
Outputs:
   • Completed the installation of two vertical pumps with spare parts and valves
   • Supply of spare parts
   • Supply and installation of valves




                                                       28
Outcome:
At completion, the project directly benefitted a population of 2.3 million people 24 although the Bank
provided only one third of the pumps that needed to be installed so this result can only be partially be
attributed to the Bank.

Component 3: Extension and Rehabilitation of Al-Rasheed Karkh Water Treatment (appraisal amount
US$7.2 million; actual US$0 million). This is an old WTP with a design capacity of 68 MLD (68,000 cubic
meters per day), which was designed to supply potable water to the Za'afarania suburb (estimated to have
about 350,000 inhabitants in 2003) – it was in poor shape and unable to meet the demand of the community.
This component covered the expansion, rehabilitation and upgrading of the plant to treat the highly polluted
raw water of the Tigris water at this location. It also covered the rehabilitation and strengthening of the water
mains, storage tanks, pumping stations and chlorinators.
After the detailed design was undertaken, this component turned out to significantly more expensive than
conceived at project appraisal and was estimated at US$43.0 million – due to a sharp increase in prices and
the need to also extend the network more than originally envisaged. In view of its importance, MOB
contracted out the work through its own investment budget in 2008 and this component was cancelled under
the project in the 2010 restructuring.

Rating: Not Rated

Component 4: Rehabilitation of Abu Nuwas Raw Water Pumping Station (appraisal amount US$6.2
million; actual US$6.8 million). This pumping station was destroyed and vandalized in the 2003 conflict.
The Abu Nuwas pumping station contained four vertical pumps of a 3,600 m3/hr capacity and two vertical
pumps of 1,800 m3/hr capacity together with all related works. At appraisal, only two pumps of 3,600 m3/hr
were operational.

The proposed component aimed to completely rehabilitate the electrical and mechanical equipment in the
station to increase the pumping capacity back to 18,000 m3/hr (5 cubic meters per second). The pumping
station is currently fully functional and provides raw water that then is treated and distributed.

Rating: Satisfactory
Outputs:
Completed installation of six pumps with a total pumping capacity of 18,000 m3/hr, and 24 high pressure
valves, control equipment and SCADA system.
Outcome:
At completion, the project directly benefitted a population of 1.2 million people

Component 5: Rehabilitation and Renewal of Sadr City Sewerage Network (appraisal amount US$15.0
million; actual US$17.2 million for works only). Sadr City comprises 80 sectors with a population of about 2
million inhabitants in 2004 (at current urban population growth rates as estimated by the Department of

   The Government in its National Development Plan uses a standard of providing people with 350 lcd. Using this
standard, the theoretical number of people served is based on the capacity and this standard in the absence of any other
data available.

Statistics estimated at least about 2.7 million people by 2013 25). At appraisal, the city experienced frequent
back-ups resulting in overflow of sewage to streets and adjacent neighborhoods. This was due largely to
broken pipes, lack of maintenance and inadequate rehabilitation. This component aimed to rehabilitate
secondary sewers ranging in size between 200-400 mm in parts of Sadr City and its surrounding areas,
including the addition of house connections. Sewage would then flow through the pre-existing sewer mains
to the Rustumiya Wastewater Treatment Plant.
This design was adjusted as due to the severity of the wastewater problems, it was decided to renew the
secondary networks and house connections in these six sectors (instead of rehabilitating them). In addition, it
was also found that in three of the six sectors, sewer trunk lines needed to be replaced to address the sewer
back-up lines.
The total disbursement for the renewal of networks in Sadr City under this component was US$17.2 million
(excluding goods component, see below) – almost 15 percent higher than originally anticipated. The contract
was originally bid out as one single contract, but this contract garnered too few interested (international)
bidders. It was then decided to split the original contracts in six smaller contracts that were bid out to local
contractors (as price increases did not make it possible to include all original works as foreseen).
The results of the component are summarized in Table A2.3. The absence of up to date population data26 for
Baghdad in general and Sadr City in particular, has resulted in difficulties in estimating the number of direct
beneficiaries. The data on the number of beneficiaries provided by the PMT in its report is only 63,200 for
the six sectors (excluding beneficiaries from transmission rehabilitation works), which essentially uses the
average household size of the country in urban areas of 6.7. UN Habitat in its reports mentioned the large
housing deficit and the increasing likelihood of housing plots getting subdivided – meaning that the
likelihood that more than 1 household uses a connection is increasing. The PMT uses a factor 1.32 (for the
number of households per plot). This number is not consistent with several other sources of information as
collected by the Central Office for Statistics (CSO). In the CSO statistics, the number of households in
Baghdad in 2007 is provided as 665,000 with a population that was around 6.5 million that year, resulting in
about 10 people per household. Using this number and the crowding factor of 1.32 would provide 115,480
people with wastewater services. However, that number seems low when the population of Sadr City is
divided in 80 sectors and a total population of 2.7 million is living here. As the sectors tend to be relatively
even in setup, the average population per sector in 2013 would be 33,750. This would translate in a total
beneficiary population in the six sectors of about 202,500 people. For the estimation of the number of
beneficiaries, we have used the estimate of 115,480 people benefitting directly from the project interventions.
In addition, in Baghdad, plots under 200 m2 cannot legally connect to the sewer network. As population
pressures are high, especially in places like Sadr City, it is likely that more people will benefit from the
works albeit not all officially.

In three of the six sectors, sewer transmission lines needed to be replaced to address sewer backup problems.
The replacement of the sewer trunk lines did not only benefit the people in the six sectors, but also people in
adjacent sectors that were served by the same sewer transmission.
After the cancellation of the Al-Rasheed water treatment plant, it was decided to add an additional contract to
the project to supply the two municipalities in Sadr City with the equipment to maintain the sewer networks
– similar to sewer maintenance equipment that has recently become operational in other parts of Baghdad



25
  This number seems to be confirmed by an informal rapid assessment carried out by the PMT as the number of sewer
connections before and after rehabilitation has increased from 84 to 100 percent in Sector 55A, and from 72 to 100
percent in Sector 38.

  The last full population census in Iraq was undertaken in 1987 (a 1997 census excluded several governorates). The
2007 census has not yet been held.

City. This equipment was delivered just before the closing date of the ITF in June 2013. The total amount
disbursed for this equipment was US$ 6.0 million. This equipment will improve the quality of the sewer
network maintenance of the total population in Sadr City. The staff in the municipalities has been trained to
operate the new equipment.

Component 6: Rehabilitation and Renewal of Old Drinking Water Network with House Connections
in Za’afarania (appraisal amount US$15.4 million; actual US$22.2 million). Za’afarania was one of the
poorest districts in the Karrada Municipality of Baghdad Governorate. The area had a population of
approximately 350,000 in 2003 (which is equivalent to about 475,000 in 2013 at current population growth
rates), of which only about one third benefited from low-quality piped water supply. The population
depended on water tankers as their main source of water. They were provided with water of low quality,
resulting in high water expenditures typically comprising of 20 percent of the average family’s monthly
income in 2003. This component included the supply and installation of water pipes of varying diameters to
provide adequate water supplies for domestic and commercial use. This component also aimed to improve
the economic conditions of the population by reducing the purchase of water from unregulated tankers, and

component disbursed US$ 22.2 million. This contract was split up into four smaller contracts.

This component was aimed to supply and install 39.5 kilometer of water distribution network of varying
diameters from 250 to 1,400 mm.

Outputs:
The component completed installation of 43.50 km of water distribution network with a diameter of 1,400
mm to allow for future growth in this area. This was 11% more than what was conceived (39.5 km).

Outcome:
The new distribution network directly benefitted the total population of Za’afraniya – currently estimated at
475,000 people and an increasing number of commercial and industrial users

Component 7 Technical Assistance and Capacity Building. (appraisal amount US$3.9 million; actual
US$3.7 million). This component was essential to ensure the proper implementation of the project and to
train MOB staff on efficient utility practices and financing. It included the following activities:

•    Consulting services to complete final designs and tender documents. The project disbursed USD 1.4
     million for detailed designs. As not all designs could be funded under this project due to financing
     constraints, MOB is using them to implement them with other funding sources;
•    Consulting services for construction and implementation supervision. The project disbursed USD 1.3
     million for the supervision of the works in Sadr City and Al-Zafra’aniya.
•    Audits. Audits were completed and were submitted with an unqualified opinion. Total disbursement
     reached USD 0.1 million;
•    Individual consultants to support the Project Management Team (PMT). The project disbursed USD 0.1
     million for individual consultants to support the PMT for very specific tasks.
•    Office equipment, vehicles, furniture and operation costs for the Project. The project disbursed about
     USD 0.7 million for operating costs,

The small allocation for capacity building and technical assistance essentially meant that the amount of
funding for capacity building and training of about 40 MOB staff throughout was mainly dependent on
external funding and “on-the-job” training. The funding came in the form of formal training in workshops
funded by USAID, and other Bank trust funds to help to organize workshops and study tours regarding asset
management, non-revenue water, wastewater reuse, utility and water resource management. The Bank also
provided support to MOB through the Leadership for Results Program that helped 75 MOB staff to use a
result-based approach to urgent water and sewer problems in the city within a timeframe of 90 days.



                                                      32
In addition, the Bank team in the first years provided training especially on contract management as part of
the supervision missions, adding additional time to train PMT staff, contractors and consultants in contract
management skills. The very close supervision of the project on a virtual daily basis provided “on-the-job”
training to a PMT on all aspects of Bank project management (procurement, financial management,
disbursement, contract management, etc.). The FMA provided on-the-job training and more formal training
to MOB staff during the project implementation on a regular basis during the 8.5 years of implementation.

On-the-job” training was provided to Directorate staff at the final stages of project implementation when the
contractor handed works over to local staff and trained them in the use of the facilities. However, when the
different on-the job training is included from FMA staff, Bank staff, training by contractors and suppliers and
the formal training, the total man-months of training could add up to 306 months.

Rating: Satisfactory

Outputs:

•    The Bank staff organized a set of formal trainings to the PMT with a total of 109 months of formal
     training courses.
•    The different on-the job training estimated by the Bank includes on-the-job training from FMA staff,
     Bank staff, training by contractors and suppliers. The total man-months of training could add up to 197
     months (excluding more formal training).

Component 8: Development of a comprehensive urban master plan (city development plan) for Baghdad
(appraisal amount US$3.0 million; actual US$1.2 million). At appraisal in 2003, around 23 percent of Iraq’s
total population lived in the capital Baghdad, where the population was estimated to be 6 million. The city
had experienced intense urbanization due to years of economic sanctions where key economic and social
activities became concentrated in the capital. Baghdad had been developing in the absence of effective
planning and had grown well beyond its planned limits. Spontaneous informal settlements became
established in and around the city.

A Comprehensive City Development Plan 27 (CCDP) was therefore proposed to carry out the vision for the
future of Baghdad for the year 2030. This CCDP was to be prepared through a public process that produces
a modern, citizen-focused comprehensive plan for 2030. After the first phase of the CCDP (and a total
disbursement of US$ 1.2 million) the Bank did not extend the contract with the consultant as it was not
possible to implement the study through a public process, whereas the collection of new customer-based
information was seriously hindered by the difficult security situation in the city. The Bank formally
cancelled the remainder of this component during 2010 restructuring the phase II, III, and IV of the
“Development of a Comprehensive City Development Plan for the City of Baghdad”. The MOB decided to
continue the CCDP with its own funding. The study is currently still under implementation.

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Outputs:
Completed Phase 1 of the CCDP. Phase I reviewed past experience, current status and trends in municipal
services in the capital city of Baghdad.

  The latest attempt at formulating a Comprehensive City Development Plan (CCDP) for Baghdad was carried-out during the late
eighties but was not completed because of the Gulf War, while the MOB is still working on the 1967 city plan. The process was
highly centralized and failed to adequately incorporate social, economic and environmental considerations.

1.      Introduction

The City of Baghdad and its suburbs have an area of approximately 900 km2 that are administered by the MOB.
The City of Baghdad itself is divided into fourteen municipalities. Each municipality is responsible for the
municipal services under its jurisdiction such as water, sanitation and solid waste collection. The water and
sanitation services are administered centrally by the Baghdad Water Authority (BWA) and the Baghdad
Sewerage Authority (BSA), respectively. The BWA is responsible for the main water intakes, treatment plants,
transmission lines, storage reservoirs and water distribution networks. The BSA is responsible for the main
sewers, sewage treatment plants and sewage disposal. Both Authorities have departments for administration,
finance, procurement, operation and maintenance etc.
The Municipalities’ role is limited to install house connections and pipelines with diameter less than 250mm. The
planning and implementation of projects related to each municipality is the responsibility of the Mayoralty of
Baghdad. This includes project planning, funding, agreements with donors, design and execution. Funds from
international donors are coordinated with the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation.

2.      Project Description

Background: Large oil reserves and abundant natural and human resources enabled Iraq to attain the status of a
middle-income country in the 1970s. Income per capita rose to over US$3,600 in the early 1980s. Today, Iraq’s
human development indicators are now among the lowest in the region. Per capita income dropped to about
US$770-1,020 by 2001. Although there is a scarcity of reliable economic data, the gross domestic product (GDP)
for 2003 is estimated at about US$13-17 billion, or about US$480-630 per person.
Since the mid-1980s, years of conflicts, misdirected resources, and the effects of Iraq’s centralized command
economy have stifled economic growth and development, curtailing Iraq’s ability to invest in new infrastructure
and maintain existing facilities. Conflicts, looting, and sabotage have also resulted in direct damage to buildings,
pipelines, communication equipment, and transportation links. Billing systems and associated revenues that
maintain operations have collapsed. Today, most Iraqis have limited access to essential basic services, including
electricity, water supply, sanitation, and refuse collection. Serious environmental and health risks associated with
contaminated water supplies, inappropriate handling of solid waste, and disposal of sewage threaten to further
burden the already stressed health system. The concentration of economic and social activities in the main urban
centers of Iraq has also led to a proliferation of under-serviced neighborhoods in major Iraqi cities. The lack of
basic infrastructure services, particularly electricity, has contributed to the general lack of security in various
parts of the country.

Water and Sanitation Sectors in Baghdad: Prior to the 1991 Gulf War, the water supply system in Baghdad was
operating efficiently. Safe potable water was accessible to over 90% of the population in Baghdad with an
average water supply of 330 liters per capita per day (l/c/d). During the 1990–2000 periods, water supply in
Baghdad suffered from defects due to international sanctions that prevented the importation of spare parts and
chemicals. The situation further deteriorated as a result of the 2003 war due partly to direct damage, looting, lack
of maintenance and power outages. These factors have led to a reduction in the effectiveness of the water
treatment and supply systems with water supplies actually reaching consumers estimated at 30% of 1990 levels.

The main water source for Baghdad is the Tigris River. Water is supplied by direct pumping from different
points. Currently, the average water supply into the Mayoralty of Baghdad is 2.15 million m3/day, whereas the
average demand is 3.3 million m3/day. Eight water treatment plants serve Baghdad with a current production
capacity of 2.15 million m3/day compared to a total design capacity of 2.55 million m3/day. In addition there are
some 52 compact water treatment units supplied either directly from the River Tigris or from raw water pumping
systems that are used primarily for irrigation purposes.



                                                        40
The treatment plants are old, in need of rehabilitation, and are unable to meet the increased demand for water.
The shortages of water have led to numerous uncontrolled and illicit connections into the networks in order to
secure supplies. As a result, the pressure in the water networks is low and water cannot reach the elevated water
tanks in residential houses. This has also exposed the networks to contamination from damaged sewers, polluted
ground, and stagnant sewage. Approximately 40% of the water distribution networks in the city urgently need to
be rehabilitated to reduce distribution losses (estimated at 50–60%). In addition, improvements are needed to
ensure the network remains pressurized and thus improve the quality of the water delivered to consumers. This is
a substantial undertaking, as Baghdad’s primary and secondary distribution network consists of 12,500 km of
pipe with diameters ranging from 90 mm to 2,300 mm. The network consists of ductile iron, steel, asbestos
cement, polyvinylchloride (PVC) and cast iron pipe. Some of the cast iron pipes are over 40 years old and have
suffered from deterioration due to the aggressive ground conditions and lack of maintenance. All in all, currently
about 25% of Baghdad’s population, approximately 1.5 million inhabitants are still unconnected to the water
network.

Approximately 30% of Baghdad’s population is not connected to a sewage collection and treatment system. The
sanitation system in Baghdad is becoming a serious environmental and health concern. According to available
reports, sewage treatment plants are operating at 50% of the installed capacity, and untreated sewage is being
discharged into rivers and waterways. This problem is exacerbated by the illegal discharge of septic sewage
collected from houses into rivers or onto land. Leakage from sewer pipes is also contaminating both the potable
water networks and the underground water, which is further adding to the health and environmental problems.

Baghdad’s three sewage treatment plants combined comprise 75% of the nation's sewage treatment capacity. Due
to sanctions, war and looting incidents after the war, the plants’ performance efficiencies have dropped by 30-
50%. In addition, power cuts are frequent and the standby generators need continuous repairs. The three plants,
therefore, are not operating effectively allowing the wastewater to flow directly into the River Tigris. It is
estimated that more than 1.2 million people in Baghdad alone currently have no access to sanitation, and
according to CARE International, the US-based charity, 300,000 metric tons of raw sewage escape into the Tigris
River daily.

Project Components Description: The project addresses the urgent reconstruction needs of Baghdad including
water mains, distribution pipes, sewer collectors, pumping stations, small treatment plants, and auxiliary facilities.
It provides support to the MOB to better manage projects at the design, supervision, and operation and
maintenance stages by building the capacity of the staff working in the water supply and sanitation sector. It also
includes the development of a Comprehensive City Development Plan (CCDP) to ensure that future expansion of
the water supply and sanitation networks are in line with the overall urban development plan for the city. Project
components and their estimated costs are summarized below. The estimated total costs for components 1 through
6 exclude physical and price contingencies (estimated at 11%), as well as design and training costs .

Project Objectives: This project represents the first phase of the Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction
Program, described in the Project Information Document (PID) of April 21, 2004, which intended to cover five
sectors: water supply and sanitation, electricity, urban rehabilitation, transport, and telecommunications. In view
of the limited availability of funds in the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund, and the expressed interest of donors for
certain sectors, the project will focus on the urgent water supply and sanitation rehabilitation needs of the capital
city of Baghdad. Given the MOB’s independent status, its historical responsibility for most infrastructure services
within its boundary, and the severity of the physical and environmental damages to its facilities during the last
conflict, a similar project is also proposed for other urban areas outside Baghdad.

The principal objective of the Emergency Baghdad Water Supply and Sanitation Project is to assist in restoring
basic water supply and sanitation services for the capital city of Baghdad through (a) the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of existing priority networks and treatment facilities and (b) providing capacity building support
through training and technical assistance. The project will also create vitally needed short-term employment and
help build Iraq’s capacity to manage large-scale reconstruction.

The project addresses the urgent reconstruction needs of Baghdad including water mains, distribution pipes,
sewer collectors, pumping stations, small treatment plants, and auxiliary facilities. It provides support to the
MOB to better manage projects at the design, supervision, and operation and maintenance stages by building the
capacity of the staff working in the water supply and sanitation sector. It also includes the development of a
Comprehensive City Development Plan (CCDP) to ensure that future expansion of the water supply and
sanitation networks are in line with the overall urban development plan for the city. Project components and their
estimated costs are summarized below. The estimated total costs for components 1 through 6 exclude physical
and price contingencies (estimated at 11%), as well as design and training costs .

Component 1: Rehabilitation of chlorine and chemical units at Al-Karkh Water Treatment Plant.
(Estimated cost of US$3.92 million):

Al–Karkh Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was constructed in 1985 and is one of the largest treatment plants in the
world with a total capacity of 1,365 million liters per day (MLD). The source of raw water is the River Tigris and
water treated by the plant supplies 65% of the total water demand of Baghdad. Unavailability of spare parts,
damaged equipment and chlorine leakages, over the last 14 years has affected the plant efficiency. This
component will serve to both improve the reliability and efficiency of the chlorination and chemical processes
and increase safety by installing new automatic chlorinators and by rehabilitating the ventilation system. The
component includes supply and installation of chlorinators, chemical (Alum and Lime) equipment and ancillaries,
including rehabilitation of civil works and supply and installation of miscellaneous items.

Component 6 - Rehabilitation and renewal of Drinking Water Network in Za’afarania. (Estimated cost of
US$17.34 million)

Za’afarania is one of the poorest districts in the Karrada Municipality of Baghdad Governorate. The area has a
population of approximately 475,000 where the main source of drinking water for 350,000 of them is water
tankers of uncontrolled quality. Expenditure on water typically comprises 20% of the average family’s monthly
income.

This component includes the supply and installation of water pipes of varying diameters to provide adequate
water supplies for domestic and commercial use. This component will also improve the economic conditions of
the population by reducing the purchase of water from unregulated tankers, and contribute to the reduction in the
incidence of water borne diseases by providing safe potable water.

The objective of this component is to provide adequate water to approximately 500000 persons through the
implementation of a complete new pipe network (grid type) instead of the old randomly laid old main pipe lines
that feed only 1/3 of the Za'afaranya area inhabitants with inadequate quality and quantity of water that was built
more than 50 years ago. The new water distribution pipe network includes pipes of diameters ranging between
1400 to 250 mm and a whole length of 43.5 km that cover the whole present inhabited area and future extensions.

 Target was achieved when adequate water reached to 1/3 Za'farania area inhabitants as soon as the new network
put into operation and the rest of the population will benefit from the secondary network respectively.

The indicator for this component was to provide adequate water to the houses by taps without need to purchase
water from unregulated tankers

Activity: Design and implement main water pipe lines and a new network for the area

Implementation of this component was satisfactory

This component is implemented through six contracts four of them are work contracts and the res two contracts
are consultancy contracts with total amount 24 927 477 US$

Lesson learned:

By the implementation of this component the water supplied (quantity& quality) contribute to improve the
economic conditions of the population by reducing the purchase of water from unregulated tankers which take
20% of the average family’s monthly income, and contribute to the reduction in the incidence of water borne
diseases by providing safe potable water and to reduce water losses in the old network.
