          accountability in public resources use through public\n            financial management and procurement reforms; (b)\n            strengthening the public sector's human resource\n            management and employees' accountability; (c) improving\n            efficiency and transparency in public infrastructure\n            management; and (d) supporting governance reforms in the\n            education sector to promote accountability and transparency\n            in the use of public education funds. The operation also\n            supported efforts to help create a culture of public\n            participation in the monitoring of economic governance\n            reforms. This tranche release document summarizes progress\n            in the execution of the reform program and actions taken by\n            the Republic of Haiti to meet the conditions for the release\n            US$13 million floating tranche. This memorandum concludes\n            that five conditions for the release of the tranche have\n            been fully met and the remaining conditions have been\n            partially met. This memorandum requests waivers for those\n            conditions on the basis of: (i) the satisfactory progress\n            made by the Government in advancing the implementation of\n            those remaining conditions and the overall satisfactory\n            implementation of the reform program described in the\n            program document of EGRO II; (ii) the Government's\n            commitment to implement corrective actions to fully comply\n            with the remaining conditions; and (iii) its urgent need of\n            resources to fill the financing gap for FY2009."}, "docdt": "2009-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
