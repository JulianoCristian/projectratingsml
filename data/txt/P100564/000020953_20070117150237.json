"This is a two-tranche operation. The\n            proposed operation will support policy reforms aimed at: (a)\n            promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in\n            public resource use through public financial management and\n            procurement reforms; (b) strengthening the public\n            sector's human resource management and employees'\n            accountability; (c) improving efficiency and transparency in\n            public infrastructure management; and (d) supporting\n            governance reforms in the education sector to promote\n            accountability and transparency in the use of public\n            education funds. The operation will also support ongoing\n            efforts to help create a culture of public participation in\n            the monitoring of economic governance reforms. The proposed\n            operation is expected to have a significant positive\n            indirect impact on poverty reduction. These objectives would\n            be achieved by: (1) strengthening political governance and\n            promoting dialogue and reconciliation; (2) improving\n            economic governance and modernizing the State; (3) promoting\n            economic growth, including by maintaining a stable\n            macroeconomic framework; and (4) improving access to quality\n            basic services, particularly for the most vulnerable groups."}, "docdt": "2006-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
