SUMMARY
i.        NIB, a public development finance company established in 1963 for
financing and promoting of private and public enterprises in all productive
sectors, is the main Ghanaian institution for the term financing of industry.
Since inception, it has approved loans, equity investments and guarantees
totalling ¢91 million for 337 projects, of which 084 million were for 225
projects in all sectors of industry. With a minimum loan size of only
¢10,000, NIB is able to finance many small industrial projects. About half
of NIB's loans approved, since inception, have been for ¢50,000 or less.
ii.       NIB was burdened with a high level of arrears, which is not uncom-
mon for public financial institutions in Ghana. As at December 31, 1974, 80%
of its loan portfolio and 94% of its loan portfolio to private clients was
in arrears of more than 3 months. Among the causes of arrears were NIB's
own lack of pressure on defaulting borrowers and operating difficulties expe-
rienced by clients, which were often attributed by them to shortages of raw
materials and spare parts imposed by foreign exchange constraints in the
country. Though some clients actually suffered from such shortages, more
frequent causes of difficulties have been deficient project conception and
marketing and management problems, indicating deficiencies in some of NIB's
past appraisals.
iii.      Since March 1975, NIB has been pursuing a major effort to clear
arrears. This includes the in-depth reappraisal of delinquent projects, dis-
cussions with project managers and decisions to either reschedule, seek
immediate repayment, foreclose or write-off the loan. By the end of August
1975, NIB had taken firm decisions on about 100 projects (out of 220 projects
in arrears of more than 3 months), representing more than half the amount in
arrears and more than half the outstanding portfolio in arrears. This exercise
which will continue until all loans in arrears are reviewed, should ultimately
clear present arrears and will become part of NIB's regular follow-up proce-
dures.
iv.       NIB has made impressive progress over the last two years in its
appraisal capability, which is now very satisfactory. In particular, at the
Bank's suggestion, NIB introduced economic appraisal of projects in early
1973 and its staff is now familiar with such procedures. NIB's staff, of
whom two members recently received several months of training in the Bank,
is adequate in number and ability.
v.        NIB has been operating in a difficult environment, mainly because
of recurrent foreign exchange crises in the country and the failure of the
Government to clearly define priorities in industrial sub-sectors and to
set-up efficient machinery for the distribution of import licenses. It is
expected that foreign exchange shortages will continue during the next two
or three years, though this basically depends on future cocoa prices which
are difficult to predict. It is not feasible to fully insulate NIB's sub-
projects from future possible reductions in activity due to insufficient



- iv -
allocation of import licenses for raw materials and spare parts. But
Government has clearly shown, in particular through the composition of the
present import program, the high priority it attaches to industry; it is
also currently in the process of improving the import licensing system. The
Government has agreed to increase its coordination with NIB, particularly with
a view to ensuring that projects considered of priority by NIB on economic and
financial grounds would also be considered as priority projects by the Govern-
ment for future allocation of foreign exchange for their operation; careful
consideration will also be given by the government to the list of foreign
exchange needs of NIB's existing clients for the year 1976 which NIB has been
requested to prepare. On completion relative priorities of industries will
be discussed between the government and NIB. The close cooperation between
NIB and the Capital Investment Board (CIB) plus NIB's improved appraisal
capacity should result in an improvement of the management of investment in-
centives. Finally, the Bank's association with NIB should provide it with
opportunities in the future for discussing industrial policies with the
government.
vi.       Recent reassessment of provisions has increased NIB's debt-equity
ratio as at June 30, 1975 over the 3/1 limit specified in NIB's Act. The
government has corrected this in August 1975 through payment of 0 4.04 million
of subscribed but not paid-in participation in NIB's share capital.
vii.      A $10 million loan to NIB is recommended, with terms normally applied
to development finance companies. A free limit of $200,000 and an aggregate
free limit of $2.5 million are also recommended.
viii.     The objectives of the loan would be i) to provide much needed foreign
exchange for sound industrial, agro-industrial and tourism projects; ii) to
continue Bank assistance in the institutional growth of NIB, which has already
resulted in improvement of NIB's appraisal capacity, arrears recoveries and
financial situation; iii) to give to the Bank further opportunities to dis-
cuss policies and priorities with NIB, and industrial policy matters with
the government.



I. INTRuDUCTION
1.01      The National Investment Bank (NIB), which lias created by an Act of
Parliament in 1963, is the main Gha-aian institution for providing term-
finance to industry. Ninety five percent of its shares a-e held by the
public sector. Since inception, 70% of its investments nave been in the
private sector; about 94% of nts loan investments have been in the industrial
sector and 6% in the agriculture sector. The Bank Group reconnaissance mis-
sion, which visited NIB in November 1973 at the request of the Ghanaian
Government, made a number of recommendations to improve NIB's operations,
particularly with regard to the recovery of the arrears on its portfolio.
Following an appraisal mission in February 1975, a program was agreed between
the Bank and NIB to further improve the recovery of arrears and a further
review mission in August 1975 found that progress was satisfactory. This
report, based on the findings of the last two missions, appraises NIB for a
loan of $10 million.
1.02      The principal objectives of the proposed loan are:
(a) to provide needed foreign exchange for financially and econo-
mically viable projects of NIB's clients, who are mainly
small-and medium-size industrialists. Since NIB follows a
decentralization policy, the Bank funds will also contribute
to regional development;
(b) to assist in the institutional growth of NIB through Bank
reviews of subprojects, training of NIB staff and advice
from supervisory missions, in order to continue to improve
the already good project appraisal capability, the arrears
recovery and hence the financial position of NIB;
(c) to allow the Bank to review with NIB its policies and priorities,
in relation to governmental policies, in order to define projects
of economic benefit to Ghana, and to give the Bank further
opportunities to discuss policy matters with the Government.
II. THE ECONOMY AND INDUSTRY
The Ghanaian Economy
2.01      In mid-1975 Ghana had a population of nearly ten million with a per
capita income of about US$315. Since independence, GDP growth has not kept
pace with population growth, estimated at 2.5 - 3.0 percent per annum. Very
rough estimates indicate, however, that GDP may have spurted by around 6 percent
in 1974, thanks to good agricultural conditions and the availability of imports,



-2-
but this is not likely to be repeated in 1975. In fact Ghana's planners are
seeking to achieve a GDP growth rate averaging roughly 5.5 percent per year
over the period 1975-80. Although they envisage fuller utilization of existing
industrial capacity, as well as improved efficiency from new investment, capital
spending will have to rise substantially if the target industrial growth rate
if 8 percent per annum is to be achieved.
2.02      The Bank's most recent Economic Report reveals that the foreign-
exchange constraint will be binding on Ghana during this 1975-80 period. 1/
O)il imports are estimated to have risen from US$30-40 million in 1972-73 to
JS$140 million in 1974, and the burden of these imports together with the low
growth potential of cocoa will keep the balance of payments under pressure
over the next few years. Industry was quite well off in terms of foreign-exchange
availability during 1973 and most of 1974, and many firms are believed to have
stockpiled essential spare parts and other imported items. When in September
1974 the authorities realized that import licenses had been issued for-amounts
in excess of projected available exchange, the face value of outstanding import
licenses was immediately cut by 50 percent, and heavy cash advance deposits
were imposed against expected imports. Official net foreign exchange reserves
dropped from US$200 million at the end to US$23 million at the end of 1974,
covering only two weeks' normal imports. Government has recently established
new procedures for import licensing, and has issued an import program for the
year 1975 which allows a total volume of imports representing only about three-
quarters of the imports of 1974, the major cut-backs being on non-durable con-
sumer goods. The program is likely to constrain the growth of industrial
production in 1975, but without any extensive stoppages among the various
manufacturing sectors.
2.03      The Government's fiscal policy has to cope with the complication of
fluctuating revenue from cocoa. In recent years non-cocoa revenue has been
expanded but with current expenditure rising more rapidly than total revenue,
budgetary saving has been minimal. Facing a decline in cocoa revenue the
Government announced stringent measures in the 1975/76 budget, including wide
ranging tax increases and restriction of current expenditure growth to 10
percent. In spite of this the large public investment program will still
require substantial borrowing from the Bank of Ghana.
2.04      Gross domestic savings have averaged only 12 percent of GDP during
the last decade, a proportion that will have to be doubled by 1980 if the
Plan investment target is to be met. In July 1975 the Bank of Ghana took an
important step, raising interest rates across the board by 2% to 2-1/2%.
Minimum interest rates now are 7.5% for demand deposits, 7.625% for 3-6 months
deposits and 7.875% for 6-12 months deposits. This may still not be high
enough to attract large amounts of deposits, even if the current pace of
inflation (price increases of 18% in 1973 and in 1974) decelerated sharply.
A dialogue has been initiated by the Bank with the Ghanaian authorities on
financial matters, and direct involvement with the NIB should help to facilitate
more intensive discussions.

2.05      The recent measures Jn the balance of payments and the budget reflect
improved economic management and determination on the part of the Government Lo
adopt unpopular measures if necessary.
The Industrial Sector
2.06      Manufactur-ing industry now accounts for approximately one-tenth of
Ghana's Gross Domestic- Product, as compared to 59 percent for agriculture/
forestry/fishing. Industry's relative share in value added has doubled in
the past decade or so. The 1975-80 Plan envisages an 8 percent real growth
rate fZor manufacturing industry, versus 5.5 percent for total GDP. Industry
has received a great deal of official attention and favor since political
independence in 1957, on the assumption that rapid development requires forced
industrialization.  Results have fallen short of expectations, which were un-
realistic in the first place, and precious resources have been wasted. The
current development program is more closely attuned to Ghana's resources and
capabilities.
2.07      Between 1962 and 1970 manufacturing enterprises with 30 or more
employees increased their gross output by 15 percent per year, measured in
constant prices. 1/ Value added rose by about 13 percent per year during the
period, value added per worker rose by nearly 4.5 percent per year and employ-
ment doubled. Notwithstanding these gains, the industrial sector mission
which visited the country in October 1973 was critical of industry's perfor-
mance. High import tariffs and quantitative controls, together with a notable
lack of domestic competition, have permitted many firms to prosper financially
despite inefficiencies and high production costs, because of their ability to
pass such costs on through price increases. Others, including public enter-
prises and firms subject to price control, lost money. Industry is unusually
import-intensive (most material inputs and nearly all machinery and equipment
are imported), and underutilization of capacity is common because of foreign-
exchange shortage.
2.08      Many industrial enterprises in Ghana are inefficient savers of
foreign exchange, in that their domestic costs per unit of foreign exchange
"saved" via substitution of imports are high; as a result they cannot compete
unprotected against imports - even after assuming a 50 percent currency de-
valuation. Ghanaian industrial firms typically have very little domestic
linkage with other sectors. Consumption goods predominate, and are "import-
reproducing" rather than import-substituting, meaning that they use the same
designs, material specifications, and technologies as foreign manufacturers,
despite widely different factor endowments. The production of indigenous con-
sumer goods and intermediates based on local materials is hampered by (a) an
overvalued currency, (b) price controls which make industrial crops unattrac-
tive to Ghanaian farmers, and (c) Western-oriented consumer tastes. Technology
is seen to be unnecessarily capital-intensive, in part because of factor price
distortions arising from duty-free imports of machinery, extensive recourse to

mission titled: The Role of Manufacturing in Ghana, Report No. 465a-GH,

suppliers' credit financing, low interest rates, and an inappropriate licensing
system.
2.09      Exports of manufactured goods amount to less than two percent of gross
output and just over one percent of total exports. Machinery and equipment are
inadequately maintained and repaired.  Many state-run industrial enterprises
have failed to earn adequate profits, in part because of the absence of man-
agerial and employee performance incentives. And finally, small-scale industry
appears to be neglected. Although employing about 400,000 persons compared to
60,000 in large-scale industry, small-scale firms have little access to insti-
tutional credit, imports, and other requisites.
2.10      In several of the many areas where the Bank's industrial mission
made recommendations, the government has already taken some action, but much
remains to be done. Through its on-going program of economic studies and
project analysis the Bank hopes to assist the Ghanaian authorities in their
effort to develop the country while reducing somewhat its high vulnerability
to exogenous forces.
III. INSTITUTIONS FOR ASSISTANCE AND FINANCE
3.01     Ghana has a variety of institutions for providing technical and
financial assistance to enterprises, some of which specialize in small-scale
enterprises. The most important ones are listed below:
Capital Investment Board
3.02      The Capital Investment Board (CIB) was established in 1963 to
encourage and approve capital investments, to administer the investment
incentive scheme, and to assist investors in the implementation of their
projects. Available incentives include income tax holidays for a maximum
of 5 years, exemptions up to 100% from customs duties and purchase tax for
imported goods that are essential for the implementation and operation of the
project, exemptions of up to 100% for a maximum of 10 years from export taxes,
excise duties and sales tax on goods produced, an employment tax credit for
a maximum of 10 years and various other tax advantages. Guarantees for the
transfer of profits and against expropriations can be given to foreign in-
vestors.
3.03      In the past, CIB has encouraged rather large investments (average
size of investments granted concessions during the 1969/70-1972/73 period:
01.5 million), with excessive concentration on the textiles and garments
sector (40% of total); import duty concessions tended to favor capital inten-
sive investments or industries relying heavily on imported materials; the
employment tax credit has not been used to encourage more labor intensive
industries. Foreign transfers of profits have not been guaranteed since 1970,



-5-
for reasons of balance of payment stringency, and this has seriously deterred
new foreign investors. This seems to be the main reason why CIB's promotional
unit has not found suitable investors for around forty projects for which
they have prepared feasibility studies.
3.04      CIB has calculated economic rates of return since mid-1971 and has
not recommended projects with an economic rate of return below 15%, except
if the project is labor-intensive, export-oriented, makes heavy use of local
raw materials or is sited in a depressed area. In such cases the economic
rate of return must be at least 10%. The increasing, and desirable coopera-
tion between NIB and CIB at the stage of project studies should result in an
improved appraisal capability.
Management, Development and Productivity Institute
3.05      The Management, Development and Productivity Institute (MDPI),.
was established in October 1967 as a UNDP/ILO project. In order to increase
productivity and improve management in Ghanaian enterprises, it organizes
training courses in general management, industrial engineering, financial
and management accounting, marketing and sales, etc. and provides advisory
and consulting services to all sectors of industry on problems related to
management and productivity. The majority of the participants have come from
larger firms. To remedy this, the Institute has created the Ghanaian Business
Bureau to support small-scale enterprises (see following para.)
Ghanaian Business Bureau
3.06      The Ghanian Business Bureau (GBB) was established in January 1971
as a division of MDPI. It has offices in Accra and Kumasi. It provides
consultancy services to Ghanaian businessmen engaged in all sectors of the
economy from small-scale farming to medium-size manufacturing. It offers
advice on all types of business problems, including marketing, financing,
production, personnel management and record keeping. It assists prospective
entrepreneurs in planning and establishing new business. It also offers, for
a nominal fee, a wide range of training courses, seminars and workshops to
Ghanaian entrepreneurs in Accra, Kumasi and seven other regional centers.
Many participants in GBB training programs have later requested its consul-
tancy services. Though GBB's approach is practical, its present impact is
small due to staff and budgetary constraints. In February 1975, it had 90
active clients, of which 80 were in Accra. Its influence could be easily
increased if the plesent staff of 16 professionals were expanded.
Office of Business Promotion
3.07      The Office of Business Promotion (OBP) was established as a unit
of the Ministry of Finance at the end of 1970, to assist Ghanaians to acquire
or start new enterprises. Under the Ghanaian Business (Promotion) Act of



-6-
that year, some business activities, such as retail and wholesale trade (with
sales of less than ¢500,000), commercial transportation by land, bakeries,
printing and manufacture of cement blocks, were reserved for Ghanaians. Loan
approvals until December 1974 totalled 08.6 million for acquisitions and
02.1 million for new enterprises. Applications for financing new enterprises
are subjected to feasibility studies by GBB. Loan amounts ranged from 0100
to ¢300,000, with terms of up to 5 years. Before the general increase in
interest rates which occurred last July, the interest rate was 8% on the
initial amount during the life of the loan, which was equivalent to an actual
interest rate of about 16% on outstanding amounts. Joint efforts of OBP, the
Army, the Police and the Regional Commissioners have recently greatly improved
loan recoveries. OBP was also initially supposed to provide advice to Ghanaian
entrepreneurs, but chose to leave that function to GBB.
Ghanaian Enterprises Development Commission
3.08      On April 25, 1975, the Government published two Decrees, the Ghanaian
Enterprises Development Decree which created the Ghanaian Enterprises Develop-
ment Commission (GEDC), and the Investment Policy Decree which extended the
list of industrial operations in which Ghanaian participation was required.
3.09      GEDC has been given the duties of  a) ensuring the assumption of
the control of the economy by Ghanaians within the shortest possible time;
b) creating an effective institution providing technical and financial
assistance, as well as general advisory services to Ghanaian businessmen
and c) advising the Government on matters relating to Ghanaian business. In
fact GEDC takes over from OBP the function of helping Ghanaians acquire
foreign enterprises, while OBP will continue to promote new Ghanaian enter-
prises. GEDC is funded by the Government and may borrow with a Government
guarantee from NIB or other financial institutions. It may establish financial
schemes for assistance to small-scale Ghanaian business, and also guarantee
loans. It is not yet known how GEDC will operate in practice.
3.10      The Investment Policy Decree extends the list of industrial opera-
tions in which full or partial Ghanaian participation is required. Previous
rules, set out in a white paper of January 1973 were as follows: a) full state
ownership for public utilities, infrastructure, arms and ammunition;
b) minimum 55% state participation in large enterprises (capital of ¢500,000
or more or turnover of 01 million or more) in the timber industry, the mining
industry (with exceptions), and the manufacture of some necessities; c) full
private Ghanaian ownership for a number of simple activities such as
retail trade, bakeries or manufacture of cement blocks; d) 50% Ghanaian private
ownership in large enterprises in a number of industries (such as cement,
paints, footwear, etc.) and 40% Ghanaian private ownership in small manu-
facturers of basic necessities. The major change introduced by the Invest-
ment Policy Decree is the addition of further industries to those already
listed for full or partial private Ghanaian ownership (for instance textile



screen hand printing passes from the category of partial Ghanaian ownership
to the category of full Ghanaian ownership, and industries such as manufactures
of plastic products, ball point pens, gramophone records, etc, are added to
the category of partial ownership). All ownership changes should occur by
January 1, 1976. The reaction of present owners of industries mentioned in
the Decree and of potential investors in such industries is not yet known.
Development Finance Lepartment of the Bank of Ghana
*.4       ine ueveiopment Finance Department of the Bank of Ghana (Central
'want-8 Is organize! into four units: i) the Institutional Finance Unit which
follows the activities of commercial banks and development banks; ii) the
Consultancy Services Unit which appraises loans referred to the Bank of Ghana
for guarantees (see next para.); iii) the Credit Guarantees Unit which manages
the Credit Guarantee Scheme;.and iv) a small Business Intelligence Unit, for
the collection and circulation of information.
3.12      The Credit Guarantee Scheme is intended to overcome the reluctance
of commercial banks to lend to small businesses. It is compulsory; all
commercial bank lending to small enterprises must be guaranteed by the Bank
of Ghana. Small enterprises are defined as: manufacturing and servicing
enterprises with original investments not exceeding 0100,000; agricultural
operations under a maximum acreage varying with the nature of the crop; and
trades with annual sales volume not exceeding ¢300,000. Originally the
guarantees covered two-thirds of the loan. As it was not obtaining appreciable
increases in commercial bank lending to the desired areas, the Bank of Ghana
experimented briefly with 100% guarantees in agriculture. Also, as a temporary
measure to assist Ghanaians acquire businesses left by departing aliens, the
central bank guaranteed 75% of loans made for this purpose up to June 1971.
For fully guaranteed loans, the Central Bank dealt directly with the borrowers
and charged them a guarantee fee of 3%. For partially guaranteed loans, the
Central Bank does not want the borrower to be informed of the existence of a
guarantee, for fear that defaults rates would increase. The commercial banks
are thus supposed to keep the guarantee secret, and cannot pass to the borrower
the 1% fee they have to pay to the Central Bank. The scheme is not popular
with the banks because of its compulsory nature, its cost, and the delays in
realizing the guarantees due to the obligation for the bank, in case of default
by the borrower, to make every effort to recover the loan before applying to
the Central Bank for repayment.
Commercial Banks
3.13      The Ghana Commercial Bank, the largest of the three commercial banks
in Ghana, is a wholly government-owned institution with a paid-up capital of
¢11.0 million. As of June 30, 1974, it had ¢515 million in deposits or about
60% of total national deposits. It entered the medium- and long-term credit
field in 1969-70, first to facilitate the purchases of alien businesses, and
from 1971-72 for investments in all sectors of the economy. However, it



- 8 -
limits the amount of its outstanding medium- and long-term loans to 10% of
its savings deposits, or about ¢10 million. The maturities of these loans
run up to 10 years and their interest rates ranged between 8% and 11% before
the Government raised maximum interest rates in July.
3.14      Barclays Bank (Ghana) Ltd. and Standard Bank (Ghana) Ltd.  These
two foreign banks are very liquid. Demand for commercial credit has declined,
in particular because of import restrictions due to a shortage of foreign
exchange. This has encouraged the two banks to increase their term lending.
Medium- and long-term loans outstanding for the two institutions totalled
about 035 million as of February 1975, of which a large part was in the form
of consortial loans at 7-1/2%, guaranteed by the Government, to government
corporations. Actual interest rates on loans without government guarantee
were about 12%-13%, before the July increase. Terms are normally no longer
than 3-4 years and rarely go beyond 8 years.
Agricultural Development Bank
3.15      The Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) was established in 1967 as
a fully government-owned institution with a paid-up capital of ¢14.0 million.
It has branches in all regional centers and representatives in most of the
country's district centers. It provides credit primarily to the private
agricultural sector. ADB's resources consist of loans at 2-1/2% from the
Bank of Ghana, savings accounts and sight deposits. An IDA Credit to the
agricultural sector has been channelled through it by the Government. Before
the July increase, interest rates were 6% (plus a one-time 1% on initial
amount) on small agricultural loans, 8% for cocoa projects, 9% for sugar
projects and fishing boats, and 10% on commercial overdrafts, and for food
processing projects. Repayment periods are mainly within the range of 1-1/2
to 5 years but can extend to 10-11 years for oil palm projects and a maximum
of 14 years for other tree crops.
3.16      ADB's approvals, after a record of 029 million in 1972 in support
of the government's "Operation Feed Yourself" launched during the same year,
amounted to 024 million in 1973, of which about 60% was medium- and long-term,
and ¢18 million in 1974. ADB intends to increase in 1975 its financing of
rice crops and rice mills and also to increase short-term loans for food
crops and expects that about 70% of its lending in this year will be short-
term.  ADB has financed jointly with NIB the large Nasia rice project.
Bank for Housing and Construction
3.17      The Bank for Housing and Construction (BHC), a young government
controlled institution which commenced business in December 1973, is rapidly
expanding its financing of housing projects, commercial buildings, tourism
projects, urban development programs and civil engineering works. Its paid-in
share capital amounted to 05.4 million as of December 31, 1974. At that date
its loan approvals since inception amounted to 017 million, of which 09 million
were for short-term, and its approval of equity investments amounted to 04



- 9 -
million. Under proposed Bank Group assistance for highway maintenance, about
US$7.5 0l1liu., will be channelled through PRIC to private domestic road con-
tractois and quarry operators.
IV.  THE NATItONAL INVESTMENT BANK
Origin and Purpose
4.01      The National Investment Bank (NIB) was established in 1963.  NIB's
authorized share capital is 020.0 million of which 418.0 million is subscribed.
The Government of Ghana holds 015 million (83% of the shares) and has paid in
¢ 14.1 million. As a result total capital paid-in is now ¢ 17.1 million; the
Bank of- Ghana and the Ghana Commercial Bank hold 8.7% and 3.8% of the shares
respectively, bringing the total percentage of public shareholding to 95%.
The remaining shares are held by two private commercial banks and 75 other
private companies and individuals.
4.02      NIB provides financial assistance to all sectors of the economy
through the granting of medium- and long-term loans, subscribing shares or
giving guarantees. Besides providing financial assistance, NIB's role is
to encourage and facilitate participation of other sources of capital in the
enterprises it finances; to identify emerging investment opportunities and
bring together capital, capable management and technical expertise to estab-
lish financially and economically viable new enterprises.
Short-Term Objectives
4.03      Each year NIB's Board approves an investment program specifying
economic priorities. That for 1975 gives high priority to projects that:
(a) provide raw materials for local industries;
(b) increase foreign exchange earnings;
(c) serve as import substitutes; and
(d) utilize local raw materials.
NIB has therefore been according priority to projects in the wood processing
sector (producing plywood, veneer, hardboard, furniture, and flooring pro-
ducts), the agribusiness sector (including processing of oil, palm, citrus
products, sugar, starch and fish), fertilizer production, bricks and tiles,
agricultural machinery, and a caustic soda plant as well as direct agricul-
tural investments.
4.04      The Government has recently agreed to establish a closer coordination
with NIB on industrial policy matters, particularly with a view to ensuring
that projects considered of priority by NIB due to their attractive economic



- 10 -
and financial returns would also be considered as priority projects by the
Government for allocation of foreign exchange needed for their operation. The
representative of the Ministry of Industry on NIB's board has been instructed
to pay particular attention to this matter. Also the Government has agreed
to give careful consideration to the foreign exchange needs of NIB's existing
clients in the 1976 allocations; NIB is accordingly preparing a list of their
needs and on completion the relative priorities of enterprises and of indus-
trial sub-sectors will be discussed between Government and NIB. Finally the
Government has agreed to keep NIB fully informed in future of its policies
and priorities for foreign exchange allocations to industry and advise NIB
of any changes in them.
Board
4.05      NIB's Board consists of eight members.  The Managing Director of
NIB is the chairman of the Board. Other members include his Deputy, the
Senior Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, the Principal Secretary
of the Ministry of Industries, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Ghana, the
heads of two commercial banks (Ghana Commercial Bank and Barclays Bank of Ghana)
and a member representing individual shareholders. The Board meets at least
once a month and must approve all loans and investments exceeding ¢100,000.
Loans and investments of less than 0100,000 are approved by a House Committee,
consisting of the Managing Director, his Deputy and the department heads. 1/
All loans and investments are reviewed before presentation to the Board by
a Loan Committee consisting of the same members as the House Committee less
the Managing Director. The Board appears to have been free to make independent
decisions on individual projects, except in a few cases in the early seventies
when Ghanaians acquired control of certain sectors. The present Board is
composed of people experienced in the fields of both banking and public service.
Management
4.06      NIB is headed by a full-time Managing Director, assisted by a Deputy
Managing Director. The current Managing Director is Mr. J.S. Addo who joined
NIB in February 1973 from the Bank of Ghana, where he was Deputy Governor.
Mr. Addo is fully conversant with the operations of NIB as he has been a
member of its Board for several years. His deputy, Mr. R.E. Obeng-Ansong,
rejoined NIB early this year from the Ghana Commercial Bank where he had been
seconded by NIB for one and a half years as head of the development finance
department. NIB's management is fully competent and capable.

Auditor and the Chief Accountant.



- 11 -
The staff is adequate in number, educational background and experience to cipe
with the present workload. NIB is making good use of training opportunities
offered abroad. In particular, two of its professional staff recently fol-
lowed EDI courses, and, after the course, worked for several months in the
Bank with the DFCD Africa Division. NIB has also a regular in-house training
program using staff trained abroad as lecturers. NIB is currently system-
atising and expanding its training program.
4.08      NIB's Development Services Institute (DSI) is in charge of project
appraisal. It was initially conceived as an independent unit to serve ex-
ternal clients as well as NIB. Though now fully integrated within NIB, it
still undertakes feasibility studies for public institutions and private
enterprises for a fee. It has a professional staff of 29, including the two
staff members who have had training in the Bank. It is divided into three
Divisions: Industrial Projects, Agricultural Projects and Investment Develop-
ment - the Investment Development Division's function is to promote projects
and find technical partners and other investors (para. 5.03). The staff is
adequate in number and background, well motivated and eager to learn. It has
made impressive progress in economic anaLysis during the past year and the
general standard of subproject analysis is very good. Prior to 1973 staff
turnover was very high in DSI, mainly due to promotion of DSI staff members
to high positions in other financial institutions. The turnover has since
stopped.
4.09      At the end of 1973, NIB partially decentralized its operations by
the formation of three regional operations departments (i.e. Greater Accra,
*4orth and South). The Northern region has area offices at Tamale and Kumasi;
in the Southern region there are area offices at Ho, Takoradi and Koforidua.
Each area office is staffed by a manager plus assistants and reports to a
regional director based in Accra. The area offices are responsible for the
appraisal of loans of less than 050,000, providing initial appraisal informa-
tion to the DSI on projects above 050,000, project supervisions and the re-
covery of arrears. The decentralization has not proved fully effective, in
part because most decisions are still taken in Accra and also because of a
lack of suitably qualified staff at senior levels in the area offices. NIB
agreed to review the possibility of undertaking a more complete decentraliza-
tion of operations.
4.10      As recommended by the Bank reconnaissance mission of November, 1973,
the internal auditor who formerly reported to the Director of Finance Depart-
ment, now reports directly to the Managing Director.
4.11      On April 1, 1975 NIB opened a small commercial banking department,
1-Pa4ed by Mr. Ellis-Sackey, who has 20 years of experience in this field, in
Lo.ndon and in Accra. Its activity is described in para. 5.06.
Financial Policies
1! x12    NIB's financial policies are found in its By-Laws, with the excep-
4.w4n of the debt-equity ratio limit of 3:1 which is in NIB's Act.  NIB's
management who wanted the Act to be amended to allow a higher ratio, has
agreed to retain it at the present level.



- 12 -
4.13      It was not clear in the By-Laws whether a limitation of 10%
of NIB's equity applies to NIB's equity investments in any one enterprise or
to total equity investments made by NIB. NIB has agreed that it applies to
equity investments in any one enternrise, and that total equity investments
should be limited to NIB's equity.
4.14      Present By-Laws prohibit NIB from taking majority participation.
NIB wanted to remove this limitation in order to Drotect some of its loans,
but has agreed that, as a rule, it should not take majority participations
and that, when doing so in exceptional circumstances, it should seek to
return to a minority position as soon as feasible.
4.15      NIB's lending to any one enterprise or group of enterprises owned
or controlled by a single interest was limited to 01 million, but there was
no limitation on total exposure (equity plus loans plus guarantees) vis-a-vis
individual clients. NIB has agreed to limit its total exposure to 20%O of its
equity. This limitation, as well as the 10% limit on equity investments, will
not apply to past investments. NIB has agreed that the upper limit of 01 mil-
lion onlending is no longer necessary and should be removed.
Procedures
4.16      Project appraisal.  Project appraisals procedures carried out by
the agricultural and industrial divisions of DSI as well as by its promotion
division are well organized, comprehensive and thorough. Economic analysis
was introduced in early 1973 at the suggestion of the Bank. DSI senior
officers, who are already familiar with such analysis are conducting regular
internal training courses on this subject for junior officers.
4.17      Follow-up.  NIB's follow-up work, entrusted to the regional offices;
has been weak, for lack of emphasis given to it by the management, inexperi-
ence of the regional offices managers, and poor utilization at the headquarters
of the reports routinely prepared by regional offices. A thorough review of
the status of all problem projects is currently underway on the occasion of
the special effort undertaken by NIB to clear its arrears. It is expected
that the special committee recently set up to review arrears will be kept in
operation and that systematic follow-up will become part of NIB's normal
procedures. The present review of arrears includes discussion with the
managers of deficient projects on the nature of their problems and possible
remedies with a view to either solving the problems or coming to an agree-
ment on loan rescheduling consistent with reasonable estimates of the future
profitability of the enterprise. Where no agreement has been reached, fore-
closure procedures have been initiated.
4.18      Legal Agreements with Clients.  NIB has two types of agreements with
clients, a loan agreement and a joint venture agreement. These contain the
normal clauses for lending by development banks and are satisfactory.



4.19      Procurement and Disbursement.  NIB normally requires its clients to
invite ;uotations from different suppliers. WJhen needs be, NIB checks quoted
prices through UNIDO Industrial Services or various banking or trade corres-
pondents abroad. Disbursement is done against contracted or incurred costs
and is generally made directly to the suppliers of goods and services.
Interest Rates and Exchange Risk
4.20      Article 13 of the By-Laws requires NIB to fix interest rates having
due regard to the cost of borrowed funds, the need to cover operating expenses
and maintain a sound financial condition, the structure of prevailing interest
rates in the country, and the financial prospects of the project to be financed.
In July 1975 maximum interest rates were raised 'by the Bank of Ghana from 6%
to 8-1/2% on agricultural loans, with higher rates permissible when financial
cost of funds dictates, and from 10% to 12-1/2% on industrial loans not gua-
ranteed by the Bank of Ghana. NIB now charges 10% on agricultural loans and
12-1/2% on industrial loans, plus a 1% service charge. A commitment fee of
1% is also charged on undrawn balances.
4.21      Following discussions with the government, Bank staff adopted as a
working hypothesis that price inflation in Ghana would decelerate by about
two percentage points yearly, from roughly 18 percent in 1975 to 10 percent
in 1979 and beyond (Report 638a-GH, May 19, 1975). Price inflation averaged
7-8 percent per year during the 1960s and 11-12 percent in the first half of
the 1970s. Under this projection a 13 & 1/2 percent interest rate applied
to a typical 8-year subloan would imply a 2 percent real cost of funds. Since
recipients of NIB foreign-currency loans are to carry their own exchange risk,
however, the additional cost likely to arise from currency devaluation must
also be recognized. This cost is difficult to quantify, but may be substan-
tial. In 1969-74, when prices were rising by 11-12 percent yearly, the Cedi
depreciated by about 2-1/2% per annum vis-a-vis the US dollar. Roughly two-
thirds of NIB industrial lending, by value, is expected to be in foreign
currency in 1976-80 (Annex 14-2).
4.22      The exchange risk on the KfW credits received by NIB in 1968 and 1970
has been passed to the four large companies to which the credit has been on-
lent. NIB has agreed that the exchange risk on the proposed Bank loan as well
as on all its other external loans would also be passed to its clients.
V. NIB OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Operations
5.01      Annex 4 summarizes NIB's operations between 1969 and 1974 and Annex
5 provides a sectoral breakdown of NIB's cumulative approvals from inception
to December 31, 1974; they totalled 4 90.9 million of which 83% were loans,
10% equity investments and 7% guarantees. The main industrial sectors for
which approvals were given, were cement and ceramics (¢ 14.5 million) and



- 14 -
mining (¢ 8.7 million); other sectors, by order of decreasing amount of
approvals (from 0 5 to 2 million), were raw materials for industry, metal
industries, transportation, commercial services, agribusiness, food process-
ing, and textiles and apparel. 105 loans totalling 0 15 million were made
to agriculture. Investments in the finance sector, totalling 0 1.2 million
consist of equity participations. Guarantees totalled 0 3.1 million - half
of which were approved in 1973. They allowed industrial clients to secure
suppliers credits and short-term financing from commercial banks.
5.02      Industrial approvals have fluctuated widely in recent years; the
peak figure of 0 22.2 million in 1972 is due to the approval of 0 8.7 million
for a mining project and the high figure of 1974 (¢ 17.5 million) is due to
the approval of two joint loan-plus-equity investments totalling 0 8.6 million
in a brick and tile and in a printing project. Without these 3 large projects
annual industrial loan approvals would have ranged between 0 8 million and
0 12 million over the last four years.
5.03      Annex 6 provides an analysis of NIB's industrial approvals since
inception to December 31, 1974. NIB has mainly financed the small industria-
list with half the 190 loans approved (by number) being below 0 50,000; median
loan size was 0 54,837. It has also approved a small number of large loans.
The 6 largest ones, ranging from 0 3.7 million to 0 8.7 million (see Annex 8),
total 31.6 million or 53% of total approvals. The weighted average interest
rate on all industrial loans was 9% as of December 31, 1974. NIB has financed
mainly private sector industrialists; 95% of loans approved by number and 63%
by value were to the private sector. The average maturity of the loans
approved was 6.3 years. At 31st December 1974, NIB had promoted 28 projects
in both private and public sectors involving a total investment in assets of
4 38.6 million (Annex 7). The projects cover a variety of industrial and
agricultural sectors.
5.04      Since 1969, NIB has approved loans to the agricultural sector
equivalent to 12.2% of total lending (0 8.8 million). The value of lending
to the agricultural sector has gradually increased, partly in response to
the Government's desire to expand indigenous food production, so that in
1974, loans valued at 0 3.5 million were approved representing 17.3% of total
1974 approvals. NIB's average interest rate on 48 agricultural loans approved
between 1969 and August 1973 was 7.1% and was due to NIB being able to lend
at between 7% and 8-1/2% to agricultural projects prior to 1973.
5.05      The level of annual approvals for equity investments made by NIB
since 1969, has varied between 0 0.8 million and t 1.8 million. As of
December 31, 1974, NIB had approved equity investments in thirty-four projects
to a total value of 0 8.9 million although at that date, the equity portfolio
disbursed and outstanding amounted to 06.7 million. (See list of approved
equity investments in Annex 10, and in Annex 8, a list of companies in which
total NIB exposure, including equity, loans, and guarantees, exceed 0 1 million).
1. Lilly two projects (Mosaic Parquet and Brick and Tile) both approved in
+-i4, has NIB taken a majority equity position; both these projects are being
promoted by NIB. Equity investments have been approved in varied sectors
including seven agribusiness, three agricultural and three financial institu-
tion projects.



- 15 -
Commercial Banking
, o6      Through its commercial banking department, which opened on  April 1,
,975, NIB has received short-term deposits, amounting to 0 5.5 million as of
Ai.;vust 1, 1975 (including ¢ 2 million from State Insurance and Social Security),
of which ¢ 4.6 million was in fixed terms (3 to 12 months) deposits and 0 0.9
pillion in demand deposits.  According to Bank of Ghana regulations, NIB must
sep 20% of its deposits in cash or with the Bank of Ghana and invest another
.W% in Treasury bills or Government securities, leaving 60% for short-term
investments. Such investments amounted, as of July 1, 1975, to 0 1.5 million
to five customers, of which one loan of ¢ 0.7 million was guaranteed by the
Government. It is NIB's intention to ask all customers taking term loans to
open an account with it. NIB's management thinks that some of its clients
will find it easier to secure needed working capital from NIB rather than from
commercial banks, and that its commercial banking activity will improve its
knowledge of clients' operations and facilitate arrears recoveries. However,
the Bank cautioned NIB against a rapid increase in its commercial banking
activities, which could divert management's attention from tasks of higher
priority, including the current arrears recovery program. NIB's projections,
which indicate a progressive rise of short-term deposits from ¢ 9.6 million as
of December 31, 1975 to 0 13.2 million as of December 31, 1979 reflect manage-
lieat's intention to only cautiously expand its commercial banking activities.
Portfolio
i901      Loans portfolio.  As at December 31, 1974, NIB had loans outstanding
on 303 projects to a total value of ¢ 44.1 million. By value 59% of the loans
outstanding were to the industrial sector, 23% to the agricultural sector
-<md the remaining 18% to service industries. Approximately 42% of the loans
-)utstanding by value were in the Greater Accra region, 42% in the Southern
region and 16% in the Northern region.  In the Greater Accra region, indus-
:ial and service industries loans represented 98% of loans outstanding; in
-te Southern region, approximately 70% was in loans to industry and 28% in
ioaas to agriculture; in the Northern region 62% was to agriculture. As of
.december 31, 1974, total loan approvals amounted to ¢ 75.2 million of which
,r was to the industrial sector, 20% to agriculture and 14% to service
Audstries.
J8      Arrears.  A high level of arrears, partly due to poor recovery
-.edures, has been a major weakness of NIB.  Though NIB obtained in May 1974
repayment of ¢ 4.2 million from the Government which represented nearly the
itality of arrears from the public sector, arrears of more than 3 months as
)ecember 31, 1974, still amounted to ¢ 8.1 million, (¢ 3.6 million in
- i"Apal and 0 4.5 million in interest) on a total loan portfolio outstand-
Of ¢ 44.2 million. Excluding projects under construction (accounting
-   16.9 million in the portfolio) the exposure of the loan portfolio
U7.3 million) was 79.6% as at December 31, 1974. Exposure of the loan
Folio to the public sector (¢ 5.4 million outstanding) was only 21.8%
xposure of the loan portfolio to the private sector was 93.9% (90.7% for
x.s to industry, 98.1% for loans to agriculture and 95.3% for loans to other
ors, consisting of mainly the service sector).



- 16 -
5.09      There are a number of causes for the high level of past arrears
including the belief of some clients that as NIB is a government institution,
repayment is not important; lack of pressure on the part of NIB; client
liquidity problems due to a depressed level of economic and productive
activity; shortage of raw materials and spare parts due to import restrictions
caused by shortages of foreign exchange; poor project conception and bad
management. NIB is now better equipped to avoid these pitfalls (see paras.
4.04 and 4.08).
5.10      In March 1975, NIB started an energetic program for the recovery of
arrears. It set up an Arrears Review Committee comprising the Managing
Director, Deputy Managing Director, Area Directors, the Chief Legal Adviser
and the Director of Development Service Institute. The whole portfolio in
arrears will be systematically reviewed with a view to coming to one of the
following decisions:  (i) write-off the loan; (ii) foreclose or (iii) re-
schedule the loan with re-appraisal of the project and an understanding with
management on measures to be taken to meet present difficulties.  The proce-
dure involves preliminary discussions between Area Directors and Project
Managers and an in-depth study of the project when a rescheduling is con-
templated.  Presently about two-third of DSI staff members are involved in
re-appraisal of projects in arrears. A first review program to be carried out
between March and August 1975 involved 99 projects (of a total of 220 projects
in arrears more than 3 months), representing 60% of arrears of more than 3
months and 52% of the outstanding portfolio in arrears of more than 3 months.
At the time of the post-appraisal mission (early August), this exercise was
on schedule. It is NIB's intention to review at the same pace the remaining
121 projects in arrears of more than 3 months. The effect of the review
will remove immediately from the list of arrears all loans written off and
all loans rescheduled, though loans for which a foreclosure procedure has
been initated will remain on the list until the procedure is completed.
5.11      Though proper remedies will have been brought to the entire port-
folio presently in arrears by the end of the current exercise, new arrears
may appear in the future, related either to the large portfolio of projects
still under construction, or to loans rescheduled if revised forecasts should
turn out to be optimistic. For these reasons, it is the intention of NIB to
maintain the Arrears Review Committee in existence and machinery for arrears
review will become part of NIB's systematic follow-up procedures.
5.12      Equity and Guarantee Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1974 the equity
portfolio outstanding amounted to X 6.7 million.  Eleven of the 34 projects
were profitable, nine had only been in operation for a limited period, ten
were under construction or about to be implemented and four were not operating
profitably or were under review.  Only three projects paid dividends in 1974,
totalling 0 130,000. At the same date five NIB guarantees were outstanding
for a total amount of ¢ 2.2 million. Four of the guarantees were to projects
where private Ghanaians had a majority ownership and the fifth was under
private foreign ownership.



- 17 -
Resources
5.13      NIB's foreign exchange resources have been provided by two loans
DM 10 million from Kreditanstalt in agreements signed in 1968 and 1970. RQti
loans were fully disbursed by September 1974. The 1968 loan was at 3% over
25 years with 7 years grace and the 1970 loan at 2-1/2% over 30 years with
7-1/2 years grace.  In December 1973, the African Development Bank agreed a
loan of $2.7 million at 6% to be repaid over 15 years with 4 years grace:
at November 12, 1974, $352,296 of this loan had been disbursed.
5.14      Until 1974 all NIB domestic loan resources were provided by the
Bank of Ghana. The Bank of Ghana has made six loans to NIB between August
1970 and May 1974 for a total of 0 35.8 million. The last loan signed in
May 1974 was for 0 9.0 million at 5% interest; at October 1974 0 1.41 million
of this loan had been disbursed. The interest rates to NIB on the other
fully disbursed loans was 2-1/2% for agricultural lending and 5% for indus-
trial lending. One loan of 0 2.8 million signed in 1974 was for repayment
over 5 years after two years grace; the remainder are for repayment over
twenty-five years with two years grace. In 1974 NIB made a public offering
of NIB 6% Project Registered Bonds underwritten and guaranteed by the Bank
of Ghana; 0 6.12 million was issued and paid-up. With the above foreign
and local currency loans, the average cost of loan funds to NIB in 1973 and
1974 was 3.4%.
Financial Results
5.15      Annexes 11 and 12 show NIB's income statements and balance sheets
for the period 1971-1974 and Annex 13 shows past and projected financial
ratios. Provisions of 0 232,000 and 0 634,000 were charged against income
in 1973 and 1974 (after no provisions in 1971 and 1972) to raise the provi-
sion level to 0 1.5 million in 1974, representing 3.0% of outstanding loan
and equity portfolio.  Net profits rose from 0 416,000 in 1971 to 0 619,000
in 1973 before falling to 0 536,000 in 1974. The return on average net
worth similarly increases from 3.5% to 5.1% before falling to 3.6% in 1974.
The loan income as a percentage of average loan portfolio has also increase'
from 7.8% in 1972 to 9.1% in 1974 reflecting the higher lending rates charged
in recent years. The cost of debt as a percent of the average term debt
remained steady at 3.4% in 1973 and 1974. Administrative expenses at 3.4%
of average total assets in 1974 are fairly high in part because of the rece.
semidecentralization of NIB's operations.
Financial Position
5.16      Total provisions for doubtful debts amounted to 0 1.2 million in .
draft audit accounts at December 31, 1974. Following a request by the Bank
for a reevaluation of the portfolio, the provisions were first increased tt
¢ 1.5 million with a matching reduction in 1974 profits from 0 801,000 to
0 536,000, and increased again with the concurrence of the external auditot
to 0 2.4 million as at June 30, 1975, while about 0 0.5 million of bad in-
vestments were written-off, and reserves were drawn down by 0 1.4 million
to about 0 2.0 million. Total provisions now amount to about 5% of total



- 18 -
portfolio and seem adequate. As a result of the reduction of reserves, the
debt/equity ratio -- with the inclusion in debt of guarantees outstanding of
0 2.15 million -- increased to 3.4:1 as of June 30, 1975. To correct this,
the Government paid NIB in August 1975 ¢ 4.04 million out of its 0 5 million
of share capital subscribed but not paid-in (see para. 6.09). The financial
situation of NIB is basically sound.
Auditors
5.17      The accounts of NIB have been audited the last four years by Pannel
Fitzpatrick and Company. The 1974 audit did not cover the scope of work out-
lined by the Bank's "Illustrative Form of Audit Report for Development Finance
Companies" with regard to arrears and the corresponding level of provisions.
This work has been satisfactorily performed in August 1975 and NIB has agreed
that it will be regularly performed in future audits.
VI. PROSPECTS
Forecast Activity
6.01      NIB's proposed lending policies for 1975 which are consistent with
Government priorities are detailed in para. 4.03.
6.02      Projects in some of the priority sectors identified in para. 4.03
are currently under study within NIB; some 41 projects requiring total financ-
ing of 0 10 - 15 million are currently undergoing feasibility studies by the
D.S.I. and another 132 projects requiring total financing of 0 20 million
are in preliminary stages of investigation. NIB is also considering equity
investments in brick and tile, soap and detergent, meat processing, salt
production, wood flooring production and fertilizer granulating projects.
In a number of these projects NIB is actively seeking foreign technical
partners and is promoting the projects, as well as providing financing. The
majority of the projects under feasibility study would require NIB financing
of below e 100,000 and are for private Ghanaian interests. There are also
6 or 7 projects under feasibility study which would require sums in excess
of ¢ 1 million, of which five are in the public sector.
6.03      NIB's financial projections and the underlying assumptions appear
i.n Annexes 14-1 through 14-5. The large increase in 1974 and 1975 loan and
equity investment approvals over the 1973 level is due to the approval of
a aumber of large projects in each year.  In 1976, the level of approvals is
forecast to fall to 0 17.2 million and thereafter increase in real value terms
at 15% per annum.
Resource Position
6.04      NIB's industrial loan approvals have been forecast at 0 12.0 million
in 1976 and ¢ 15.75 million in 1977.  The foreign exchange component for these



- 19 -
two years' approvals is estimated at 0 18.3 million (about US$16 million).
We recommend an IBRD loan of US$10 million to partially meet this foreign
exchange need. The remaining foreign exchange resource gap for industrial
investment of US$6 million, together with the corresponding gap for agricul-
tural lending of US$5.6 million, is expected to be covered from other sources,
such as Kreditanstalt and Canadian CIDA, and perhaps through some foreign
equity subscriptions.
6.05      With regard to local currency, as of December 31, 1974 there was
already a resource gap of 0 17.7 million in relation to past commitments.
(See Basic Data.) The local currency resource gap in relation to commitments
to the end of 1977 would be as follows:
(¢ '000)

6.06      The maximum local currency resource gap in relation to commitments
occurs at the end of 1975 but thereafter begins to fall as the level of
foreign exchange in future approvals increases. The maximum local currency
resource gap in relation to commitments would be 4 26.7 million as above.
6.07      However the maximum local currency requirement in relation to
disbursements is considerably lower as shown in the forecast cash flow (see
Annex 14-5). If the equity subscription projected for 1975 is fulfilled,
NIB will be able to finance its local currency disbursement requirements in
1975 without additional borrowings by the liquidation of part of its current
assets. In 1976 additional sources of local currency will be required to
meet disbursements requirements; borrowings of 0 15 million have been assumed
either from the Bank of Ghana and/or by a further issue of Government guaran-
teed bonds.



- 20 -
Forecast Financial Results
6.08      Throughout the projection period, the earning performance of NIB
is very attractive. The return on average net worth would average 13.5%,
despite being only 4.0% in 1975 due to the high level of provisions in that
year. This attractive rate of return is largely due to the low cost of
borrowed funds; even in 1979, the average cost of borrowings would still
only rise to 6.4X (it is assumed that any KfW, CIDA or Bank of Ghana funds
would be on preferential terms). Administrative expenses at 3.4% of average
total assets in 1974, are forecast to decline slowly through 1979; the sharp
decline in 1975 to 2.3% is due to the large increase in total assets caused
by accepting commercial banking deposits.
6.09      The term debt/equity ratio at 3.1:1 in 1974 is in violation of the
3:1 limitation set in the Act. However in 1975 the 0 4.04 million equity
payment by the Government plus forecast earning will bring NIB below this
limitation. The debt/equity ratio is expected to be 2.3:1 end of 1975, to
rise to 2.6:1 end of 1976 and thereafter to fall to 2.3:1 in 1979. The major
constraint to achieving the attractive financial forecasts remains however
NIB's ability to recover loans and collect interest payments on schedule.
Proposed Terms of Bank Loan
6.10      The terms and conditions of the proposed loan should be those
generally applied to recent Bank loans to development finance companies.
The amortization of the loan should be the aggregate of the amortization
schedules of sub-projects, with a maximum maturity of 15 years. A free limit
of $200,000 and an aggregate free limit of $2.5 million are recommended.
This would permit the Bank to review at least 75% of the financing provided
to NIB under the proposed loan and about one-fifth of the number of projects,
VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMIENDATIONS
Conclusions
7.01      NIB is the most important institution in Ghana for term financing
and promotion of industry. Its management is competent. Its staff is
adequate in number and ability, well motivated and eager to further improve
through training and experience. This is illustrated by the recent intro-
duction of economic analysis in all NIB's project appraisals and by the good
performance of NIB's staff in such analysis.
7.02      NIB, has suffered from a high level of arrears, mainly due to its
failure to actively pursue defaulting clients, but also in part to operating
difficulties experience by clients. Though many of the clients attributed
their troubles to shortages in raw material and spare parts caused by limited
availability of foreign exchange in the country, it seems that bad manage-
ment, marketing problems or poor conception of projects were also reasons



- 21 -
for their difficulties. NIB's greatly improved appraisal capacity should
guard against its approving such projects in the future. NIB is currently
making a major effort to recover outstanding arrears by reappraising the
situation of their clients and accordingly, deciding either to foreclose,
reschedule or seek immediate repayment. In only six months (from March to
August 1975), NIB has already succeeded to put in order half of its portfolio
in arrears of mDre than 3 months, and its effort is continuing.
7.03      The outlook with regard to availability of foreign exchange for
1975-80 is not promising. Cocoa revenues, which accounted for about 60% of
total export earnings in the 1972-74 period are projected to fall through
1980. If these predictions are borne out, foreign exchange for industrial
purposes will remain tight and restrict import licenses for industrial raw
materials and spare parts. Moreover, though the guidelines for the 1975-80
development plan give general indications on governmental industrial policies,
they do not indicate clear priorities for industrial sub-sectors, and defi-
ciencies remain in the procedures for import license allocations. However,
the Government is currently trying to correct these deficiencies and the
import program for 1975 attests to its determination to give high priority
to industrial needs in foreign exchange allocations. The Government has
agreed to tighten its cooperation with NIB, particularly with a view to
assuring, as far as possible, NIB's subprojects receive the foreign exchange
allocations they will need for their operations. It is also hoped that
NIB's continuous progress in project appraisal will result in an improvement
of the management of investment incentives through the cooperation between
NIB and CIB. It is expected that the proposed loan will make a significant
contribution to the industrial development of Ghana.
Recommendations
7.04      The recommended loan of $10 million would finance investments in
the manufacturing, agribusiness and tourism sectors. Its use would be limited
to the CIF cost of imported goods and the estimated foreign exchange component
of imported goods purchased locally, of civil works and of goods made in Ghana
substantially with imported materials. Annex 15 shows the estimated disburse-
ment schedule for the proposed loan.
