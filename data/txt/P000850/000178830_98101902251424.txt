INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK (NIB)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF
GHANA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the National Investment Bank (NIB), with the guarantee of the Republic
of Ghana, for the equivalent of US$10 million to help finance industrial,
tourism and agro-induLstrial development projects. Amortization would conform
substantially to the aggregate amortization schedules applicable to the speci-
fic investment projects financed out of the proceeds of the loan with a maximum
period of 15 years from the approval or authorization of an investment project.
The interest rate would be 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Fiscal and Balance of Payments Aspects
of Ghana's Development" (638a-GH) dated May 19, 1975, was distributed to the
Executive Directors in June 1975. A report on Ghana's industrial sector
(465a-GH) dated October 25, 1974, has also been distributed to the Executive
Directors. A summary of basic data on the economy is presented in Annex I.
General Background
3.        Ghana enjoys a high standard of living compared with most other West
African nations, as its annual per capita GNP was about US$300 in
1973.    Government policy is aimed at attaining the growth potential of the
country's major resources, including cocoa--it is the world's largest producer--
timber, manganese, gold, and electric power. However, over the past decade and
a half GDP growth averaged about 2.5 percent per annum and failed to keep pace
with the growth of population. Export growth was slow (2.3 percent per annum)
and depended almost entirely on a few traditional export commodities--cocoa,
gold and timber. In addition to contributing 60 percent of the country's
export earnings, cocoa provided around 30 percent of government revenue and
employed upwards of 20 percent of the labor force. The 1960s witnessed a
declining trend for cocoa production and rapidly growing imports of food and
raw materials for industry. Although the industrial development strategy of
the early 1960s broadened the industrial base, industry depended heavily on
imported inputs and generally had low domestic value added content. This
strategy of the sixties resulted in recurrent balance of payments crises and
an accumulation of external debt.
4.        The economic and social policy of the early 1960s rested on extensive
involvement of the Government in the provision of a wide range of social ser-
vices, in the setting up of a large number of state enterprises and in allocating
resources through an extensive system of physical and financial controls. Since
the mid-1960s, there has been a growing imbalance in public finances due to
rapid growth of budget current expenditure, slow growth in budget revenue and



uneconomic operations of several government enterprises.    The imbalance
depressed government development expenditure to an inadequate level and was
also a persistent source of inflationary pressure.
5.        After cocoa and timber, Ghana's principal traditional exports are
gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite. Production of most of these minerals.
is stagnating or declining, mainly because of depletion of the ore reserves.
With regard to bauxite, however, a proposal for the opening of a new mine
to produce bauxite for local reduction to alumina to supply the existing
aluminum smelter is under study.   Ghana imports its entire oil requirements,
most of it in the form of crude oil which is refined domestically. Oil is
used chiefly as a source of fuel for the transport sector. Oil exploration
is being carried out offshore and in the Volta Basin, but commercially
exploitable reserves have not yet been discovered. Hydroelectric power meets
most of Ghana's energy requirements.
6.        Despite poor performance of the economy during most of the 1960s,
Ghana's development is well advanced in some respects. The education system
is well established, elementary education has been free and universal since
1962, and public health facilities are fairly widespread and further expansion
favors rural areas. It is the declared policy of the Government to achieve a
more equitable income distribution by increasing productive investments in
the rural areas, by expanding low cost rural housing and water supply and by
improving feeder roads.
Recent Developments
7.        Overall GDP growth in 1974 was 6.5 percent, up from 0.5 percent in
1972 and 2.6 percent in 1973. General guidelines have been issued for a five-
year Development Plan covering the period 1975-1980 while a more detailed plan
for that period is being prepared.   The Plan's target GDP grcwth rate is an
average of 5.5 percent per annum.   Since 1972 a reorientation of economic
policy has taken place.   A three-phase "Operation Feed Yourself" program was
started by the new Government in 1972; Phase I aims to achieve self-sufficiency
in basic foods such as rice, maize, cassava and plantain; Phase II is Lo .,ring
about self-sufficiency in agricultural raw materials for industry; and
Phase III will focus on expanding agricultural exports.    Production by small-
holders is being encouraged alongside large scale mechanized farming. In
food production considerable progress has been made by 1974, particularly
in rice and maize,but the crucial cocoa sector has failed to show similar
progress.  In industry, the Government's policy is to discourage the excessive
use of capital through the levying of duties on imported capital goods and the
granting of an employment tax credit.
8.        Public Finance.   Although in recent budgets the Government has success-
fully expanded non-cocoa revenue, thus gradually reducing its reliance on
fluctuating income from cocoa, current expenditure has risen more rapidly thaa
total revenue. With a limited inflow of external capital, the Government has
had to borrow extensively from the Bank of Ghana to finance development expend-
iture, and this, along with general world inflation, has been a major factor
contributing to the high rate of domestic inflation. The national cost of
living index rose by 18 percent in 1973 and 1974, a rate of increase almost
double that of 1971 and 1972, and comparing unfavorably with the rate of 2.4
percent a year in the late 1960s.   In its 1975/76 budget the Government introduced



-3-
a number of bold and far-reaching measures to expand revenues and to limit
reliance on inflationary borrowings. The revenue measures include increases in
import and excise duties on a wide range of commodities, and of personal income
tax; charges of public utilities (water rates and telecommunications tariffs)
have also been increased. Also, the Government announced stringent measures to
restrict the growth of current expenditure to 10 percent in nominal terms. In
July 1975 minimum bank deposit rates were increased from 5 to 7.5 percent and
maximum lending rates increased by 2.5 percentage points (to 8.5 percent for
agriculture with flexibility for higher rates when financial cost of funds dic-
tates, and 12.5 percent for other sectors). The budget also reflects the
Government's determination to maintain a high level of development expenditure,
but a substantial part of this public investment program will still have to be
financed by credit creation.
9.        Balance of Payments.   Strict control of imports, coupled with favor-
able price developments for cocoa, gold and timber, led to a strong improve-
ment in the balance of payments and the reserve position during 1972 and 1973.
This recovery ended abruptly in 1974 when a serious breakdown in the import
licensing system together with the impact of higher oil prices sharply pushed
up imports and caused an acute balance of payments crisis, reducing Ghana's
net external reserves to only a few weeks import cover (US$23 million) by the
end of the year. Since September 1974, the Government has introduced a series
of measures to restrict imports which are producing considerable improvement.
Reserves increased considerably, to a gross amount of US$192 million by the end
of September 1975, partly as a result of a drawing on the IMF oil facility, but
given the trend in world cocoa prices it appears unlikely that the current
account of the balance of payments will show a surplus in 1975.
10.       External Debt.   An agreement on a long-term rescheduling of Ghana's
medium-term external debt was concluded in March 1974.. Under this agreement,
all payments due after February 1, 1972, in respect of pre-1966 debt obligations
will be paid over a period of 28 years, including a grace period of 10 years,
with an interest rate of 2-1/2 percent per annum. This agreement was the
result of more than two years of negotiations between Ghana and the creditor
countries in which the good offices of the Bank were provided. Following
Ghana's review of the validity of the contracts underlying the debts in question,
a final settlement has now been reached with all the credit countries that
signed the March 1974 agreement.
11.       Ghana had set a goal for 1977.of eliminating pre-1972 arrears of
trade credits totalling US$54 million in 1973. US$21.4 million was paid in
1974, mainly in the first half; with the sharp fall in reserves, payments
slowed down in the second half of the year and new arrears totalling US$26.4
million were accumulated, but these were eliminated by mid-April 1975. The
authorities intend to resume payment on the pre-1972 arrears as soon as external
resources permit, with the intention of adhering as closely as possible to the
original goal. Other potential obligations include outstanding applications
for remittance of profits and dividends estimated at US$111 million. In addition,
the Government has undertaken to pay compensation for the increased equity it
has acquired in several foreign private investments. The amounts are still
under negotiation.



-4-
Prospects
12.       The recent measures on the balance of payments and the budget reflect
improved economic management and illustrate a willingness on the part of the
Government to adopt unpopular measures. Medium-term projections indicate that
the external resource constraint, which hampered Ghana's development in the
past, will remain severe. Reliance on cocoa will continue for a considerable
time as diversification can proceed only gradually, but with cocoa production
expanding slowly at best, there is a need for a substantial net inflow of
external aid, roughly in the order of US$100 million annually over the next
several years,if the overall growth target of 5 to 6 percent is to be met.
The current external debt service ratio is under 5 percent and is expected to
rise to around 8 percent towards the end of the decade. The Bank Group's share
of Ghana's total external debt is currently about 13 percent and is expected
to rise to about 15 percent over the next several years. The Bank Group's
proportion of Ghana's external debt service payments in 1974 was abnormally
high at 25 percent because of the suspension of payments on most suppliers'
credits pending the negotiation of bilateral agreements. By the end of the
decade it is expected to be around 10 percent. Ghana should be considered
creditworthy for additional Bank lending in these circumstances.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
13.       Since 1962, when the Bank Group financed its first operation in Ghana,
the Bank has made three loans amounting to US$76 million for the Volta dam
and associated infrastructure works for electricity generation and for a tele-
communications project; IDA has extended 11 credits totalling US$86 million--
5 for agriculture (including livestock and fisheries), 2 for water supply and
sewerage, 2 for power distribution and 2 for highways. Annex II contains a
summary statement of loans and credits as of October 31, 1975.with notes on the
execution of ongoing projects. There are no IFC investments.
14.       Ghana is currently engaged in restructuring its economy, with the
principal objective of reducing dependence on imports generally, achieving
greater self-sufficiency in agricultural products, particularly food, expanding
cocoa production for export and improving its infrastructure support for an
expanding economy. The main thrust of the Bank Group's operations in Ghana
is to assist the Government in achieving these objectives, with emphasis on
institution-building and training of Ghanaian nationals for project preparation
and improved implementation. Thus, in addition to the proposed project to
assist the National Investment Bank, a Government-owned institution engaged
in the financing of industry, including tourism and agricultural processing,
a second cocoa project and a second highway project have been negotiated and
should be presented to the Executive Directors in the coming weeks.



15.       The Bank Group is also assisting the Government to strengthen the
power sector which is based on the development of Ghana's hydroelectric poten-
tial. A power distribution project is under appraisal and this may be followed
by further investments in the Volta River generating system for which Canadian
consultants recently completed a feasibility study. The Government has ex-
pressed a strong commitment to attain self-sufficiency in food and to assist
the small farmers increase productivity, and a rural development project covering
about a million population in the Upper Region is also under appraisal. Following
the recent Annual Meeting of the Bank, the Government has requested assistance
in designing and implementing projects to help the urban poor. With UNDP assist-
ance a small-industries project is being prepared for possible Bank Group assist-
ance, and a Bank mission will review with Government in early December its
urban development program.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
16.       Shortly after attaining its independence in 1957, Ghana embarked upon
an ambitious program intended to transform its predominantly agrarian society
into an industrialized economy in the shortest possible time. In order to
speed the pace of industrialization, medium and large factories were set up;
traditional manufacturing activities mostly carried out in small-scale, cottage
or artisan workshop enterprises, were neglected. During 1956-66, much of the
investment was in state enterprises, financed mainly by suppliers' credits and
budget deficits. After the change of Government, more encouragement was given
to private entrepreneurship and to joint partnerships with the State. Ghana's
investment policy now specifies areas reserved for full state ownership, for
joint state/foreign ownership, private Ghanaian/foreign ownership, and full pri-
vate Ghanaian ownership. This policy was set out in a white paper dated
January 1973. In line with its policy of increasing Ghanaian control over
economic activity in the country, the Government has recently (April 1975)
published two decrees: (1) Investment Policy Decree, which extends the list
of industrial and commercial operations in which Ghanaian participation is
required; and (2) Ghanaian Enterprises Development Decree, which provides for
increased technical and financial assistance to local entrepreneurs.
17.       Manufacturing industry now accounts for about 10 percent of Ghana's
Gross Domestic Product, as compared to about 60 percent from agriculture,
forestry and fishing. However, the relative share of industry in GDP has
increased over the past decade. The 1975-80 Development Plan targets envisage
an 8 percent per annum real growth rate for manufacturing industry, compared
to an average of 5.5 percent for total GDP. Manufacturing enterprises with
30 or more employees increased their gross output by 15 percent a year (in
constant prices) between 1962 and 1970. During the same period, industrial
employment doubled and value added per worker rose by about 4-1/2 percent
a year.
18.       Concealed in these apparent gains, however, were a number of weak-
nesses related to the manufacturing sector. These included an excessive
dependence of Ghana's industry on imports, under-utilization of capacity and
neglect of small-scale industry.   However, the present Government has recog-
nized these weaknesses and has taken measures that will help remedy them.



-0-
The measures, as stated in paragraph 7, include;    (a) increased emphasis on
agriculture to expand availability of raw materials to industry; (b) intro-
duction of a 20 percent levy on imported machinery to discourage excessive
substitution of capital for labor and granting employment tax credits as an
investment incentive; and (c) introduction of 20 percent bonus to encourage
the expansion and diversification of exports.
19.       A Bank industrial sector mission which visited Ghana in October
1973 noted, inter alia, that there had been a rapid expansion of commercial
bank loans and advances to the manufacturing sector during 1966-72. The share
of commercial bank loans to manufacturing increased from about 4 percent in
1964-65 to about 30 percent in 1971-72. During the same period, commercial
bank loans and advances to manufacturing enterprises in the private sector
grew at a higher rate (37 percent per annum) than to enterprises in the public
sector (27 percent per annum).
20.       Prior to 1969, the banking system provided only short-term financing.
Since 1969, the three commercial banks in the country have become more
involved in the development of the industrial and agricultural sectors of the,
economy by reorienting their traditional policies and introducing, on a limited
scale, medium and long-term loans. The central bank--Bank of Ghana-- has made
loans to National Tnvestment Bank (NIB) and Agricultural Development Bank (ADB)
to increase their resources for relending to industrial and agricultural
enterprises. By the end of 1972, Bank of Ghana's loans to NIB and ADB amounted
to 033 million and 922 million respectively. It also operates a Credit Guarantee
Scheme which automatically insures, against a fee of 1 percent, all commercial
bank loans to small borrowers.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
21.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the National Investment Bank of
Ghana" (Report No. 880-GH, dated November 10, 1975) is being distributed
separately. The project was appraised in February-March 1975. A loan and
project summary is attached as Annex III.   Negotiations were held in Washfngton,
D. C., October 28-29, 1975. Dr. A. K. Appiah and Mr. J. S. Addo represerr.ed
the Guarantor and the Borrower respectively in the negotiations.
NIB - The Borrower
22.       Established in 1963, the National Investment Bank has an authorized
slhare capital of 020 million of which ¢18 million is subscribed. The Govern-
ment of Ghana holds ¢15 million (83 percent of the shares) and has pa-;d in
V14.i m,illion. The total paid-in capital is at present 017.1 million; tne
Bank of Ghana and the Ghana Commercial Bank hold 8.7 percent and 3.8 percent
of the shares respectively, bringing the total of public shareholding to 95
percent. The remaining shares are held by two private commercial banks and
75 other private companies and individuals.



23.       NIB is the main institution providing medium and long-term finance
to industry. In addition to granting medium and long-term loans, subscribing
shares or giving guarantees, NIB encourages and facilitates the participation
of other sources of capital in the enterprises it finances.
Management and Organization
24.       NIB has a Board of eight members, with the Managing Director serving
as Chairman. The other members include the Deputy Managing Director of NIB
and representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industries,
the Bank of Ghana, Ghana Commercial Bank, Barclays Bank of Ghana, and a member
representing individual shareholders. The Board meets at least once a month
and must approve all loans and investments exceeding ¢100,000.     Loans and.
investments of less than ¢100,000 are approved by a House Committee consisting
of the Managing Director, his Deputy and the department heads.
25.       The current Managing Director of NIB, Mr. J. S. Addo, joined the
institution in February 1973 from the Bank of Ghana, where he was Deputy
Governor. He represented Bank of Ghana for several years on NIB's Board prior
to his appointment as Managing Director. NIB's present professional staff is
considered adequate in number, educational background and experience to cope
with the institution's present work load.    NIB has also made impressive progress
over the last two years in;improving its appraisal capability, which is now very
satisfactory. In particular, at the Bank's suggestion, NIB introduced economic
appraisal of projects in early 1973 and its staff is now familiar with such
procedures.
26.       In 1973, NIB undertook a partial decentralization of its operations
with the establishemnt at its headquarters of three regional operations
departments each headed by a regional director. The regional departments
have field offices in their respective areas, which report directly to the
headquarters in Accra. The field offices are responsible for the appraisal
of loans of less than 050,000,for providing appraisal information to the
head office in Accra on projects costing above ¢50,000 for project supervision
and for the recovery of arrears.
Operating Policies
27.       NIB adjusts annually its lending priorities to the economic develop-
ment priorities of the Government. Its current (1975) Operational Program,
consistent with the Guidelines for the Five-Year (1975-80) Development Plan,
accords priority to investments that would: (a) provide raw materials for
local industries, (b) increase foreign exchange earnings, (c) serve as import
substitutes, and (d) utilize local raw materials.
28.       Maximum lending rates were raised across the board by the Govern-
ment in July 1975 (details in paragraph 8). At present, the interest rates
charged by NIB are 10 percent for agriculture and 12-1/2 percent for industry.
In addition, NIB applies a service charge of 1 percent on all its loans, and
charges a commitment fee of 1 percent on undrawn balances.    The exchange risk
on the proposed Bank loan, as well as on all its other external loans, will be
passed on to NIB's clients. The average maturity of the loans approved by NIB
in the past was 6.3 years.



-8-
29.       NIB's Act limits its debt/equity ratio to 3:1.    Its other finan-
cial policies, as stated in its By-laws, need some clarification and broadening.
NIB has, therefore, decided to revise its By-laws in the following way:
(a) NIB's equity investment in any one enterprise will be limited to 10 per-
cent of its equity; (b) NIB's total equity investments will be limited to its
own total equity; (c) NIB will, as a rule, refrain from majority participation
in enterprises it assists (in cases where it has majority participation under
exceptional circumstances, it will seek to return to a minority position as
soon as feasible); (d) NIB will limit its total exposure (loans, equity and
guarantees) in any one enterprise to 20 percent of its total equity; (e) the
present limitation of-¢l million on NIB's lending to any one enterprise will
be removed.
30.       Industrial loan approvals have fluctuated in recent years, particularly
in 1974 and 1975. Without taking into account the limited number of large
loans, annual industrial loan approvals have ranged between ¢8 million and ¢12
million over the last four years. Agricultural loans have increased steadily
from 00.5 million in 1971 to 03.5 million in 1974, partly in response to the
Government's desire to expand domestic food production. Total annual approvals
of equity investments over the last four years have ranged between ¢1 million
and ¢1.7 million. Guarantees in the same period totaled 03.1 million. The
guarantees were mainly for industrial clients to allow them to obtain suppliers'
credits and short-term financing from commercial banks. Since 1969, NIB has
approved loans for agriculture equivalent to 12.2 percent of total lending.
31.       NIB has financed small industrialists in the private sector; about
half of its loans by number have been below ¢50,000, and over 90 percent of
loans approved by number and 60 percent by value have been to the private
sector.
Portfolio
32.       As at December 31, 1974 total loan approvals amounted to 075.2
million of which 80 percent were to the industrial sector and 20 percent to
agriculture. The equity portfolio and guarantees outstanding amounted to
06.7 million and 02.2 million respectively.   At the end of 1974 NIB had loans
outstanding on 303 projects for a total value of 044.1 million. By value,
about 60 percent of the loans outstanding were to industrial enterprises,
about 20 percent to agriculture and the remaining 20 percent to service indus-
tries. About 40 percent of the loans outstanding by value were in the Greater
Accra region, 40 percent in the Southern region and about 20 percent in the
Northern region.
33.       NIB's loan portfolio as at December 31, 1974 reflected a high level
of arrears. As at December 31, 1974, 80 percent of its loan portfolio and 94
percent of its loan portfolio to private clients was in arrears of more than
3 months. The main causes for the high level of past arrears included:
inadequate recovery procedures on the part of NIB; poor project conception;
liquidity problems on the part of clients due to depressed levels of economic
activities; shortage of raw materials and spare parts due to import licensing
restrictions; and inadequate efforts at recovery. NIB is now better equipped
to avoid these pitfalls (see paragraphs 25 and 34).



-9-
34.       In March 1975, NIB launched a vigorous program for the recovery of
arrears. It set up an "Arrears Review Committee" and scheduled a systematic
review of the entire portfolio affected by arrears with a view to coming to
one of the following decisions: (a) write-off the loan, or (b) foreclose, or
(c) reschedule the loan with re-appraisal of the project and an understanding
with clients on measures to be taken to resolve the problem. By the end of
August 1975, NIB had taken firm decisions on 99 projects (out of 220 in arrears
of more than 3 months), representing more than half the amount in arrears and
more than half the outstanding portfolio in arrears. Of these, only 3 loans
had to be written off; 3 loans were entirely paid off; 54 were found to be
viable, requiring only rescheduling; and 39 loans were called in and legal
action taken where necessary. Most of the loans are well secured, and adequate
provisions have been made in all cases where security was considered insuf-
ficient (see paragraph 35). This exercise which will continue until all loans
in arrears are reviewed, should ultimately clear present arrears and will become
part of NIB's regular follow-up procedures. Moreover, the Government has
recently decided to establish a closer coordination with NIB on industrial
policy issues with a view to ensure that projects accorded high priority by
NIB are consistent with the country's development objectives, and that NIB
finance only those projects that would receive priority in the allocation of
foreign exchange by the Government for their operations.
Financial Results
35.       NIB's net profits increased from 0416,000 in 1971 to 0619,000 in 1973,
but dropped to 0536,000 in 1974. The return on average net worth also increased
from 3.5 percent to 5.1 percent and then dropped to 3.6 percent in 1974.   The
loan income as a percentage of average loan portfolio has increased from 7.8
percent in 1972 to 9.1 percent in 1974, reflecting the higher lending rates
charged in the later years. Following a request by the Bank for a reevaluation
of the portfolio, the provisions were increased with the concurrence of the
external auditors to ¢2.4 million as at June 30, 1975, while about ¢0.5 million
of bad investments were wirtten-off, and reserves were drawn down by 01.4
million to about 02.0 million. NIB's accounts are audited by competent auditors
(Panel Fitzpatrick and Company).   A special audit of NIB's provisions against bad
debts was conducted following the Bank's guidelines and the provisions were found
to be adequate. NIB's loans are secured with adequate collateral.
36.       The financial results projected for the period 1976-79 are attractive.
The return on average net worth during these years is estimated-to average
about 13 percent.   These encouraging financial forecasts can be achieved pro-
vided NIB remains firm in its determination to recover loans and collect interest
payments on schedule.
Projected Operations and Resources
37.       NIB has a sizeable pipeline of investment projects at various stages
of preparation. Feasibility studies are currently being conducted on about
41 projects requiring an estimated total financing of about 010-15 million.
There are also about 132 projects, estimated to require a total of about ¢20
million, at preliminary stages of investigation. NIB is also considering
equity investments in a number of projects. It is seeking foreign technical
partners for many of the projects, most of which would require NIB financing
of less than 0100,000 each and will benefit private Ghanaian interests.

38.        Projected total industrial approvals are estimated at 012 million
in 1976 and ¢15.75 million in 1977. Of the total ¢27.75 million, about ¢18.5
million (equivalent to about US$16 million) will be in foreign exchange. The
proposed IBRD loan of US$10 million will cover 62.5 percent of the foreign
exchange requirements of NIB's investments in the,industrial sector in 1976
and 1977. This leaves a foreign exchange gap of US$6 million for industrial
investments, which is expected to be covered by such sources as Kreditanstalt
(KfW) and Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and perhaps
through some foreign equity subscriptions. Local currency requirements for
1976 and 1977 are expected to be met from internal cash generation and borrowings
ftom the Bank of Ghana and/or issue of Government-guaranteed bonds.
39.       Total approvals for agriculture in 1976 and 1977 are projected to
amount to about 012 million, of which 06.4 million (US$5.6 million) will be
in foreign exchange. The amount required to meet agricUltural commitments is
expected to be raised from domestic sources, particularly from NIB's cash
generation.
40.       NIB's total industrial and agricultural cormmitments in 1976
and 1977 are estimated at US$34.7 million; and are expected to be met by
the following sources:

Disbursement
41.        The Bank loan would be disbursed to finance imported goods and
services. Individual projects requiring withdrawals of up to US$200,000 of
the proceeds of the proposed loan would not require the prior approval of the
Bank, until the total of such withdrawals reached an aggregate free limit of
US$2.5 million. The estimated disbursement schedule of the Bank loan is
presented in Annex III.



Conclusion
42.        The National Investment Bank is the most important institution
in Ghana for term financing and promotion of industry.   It is consciotus of
the importance of encouraging Ghanaian entrepreneurs, including small and itediuw
investors, and should be able to exercise important promotional influence at
a time when the Covernment itself is engaged in supporting private initiative
in tne economy. Forty-one investment projects are in an advanced stage of
study in the NTh and another 132 are under preliminary investigations.    however,
shortage of foreign exchange continues to be the most important cozstraint in
these efforts and the proposed loan should help to attract further foreign
financing. If the institution continues to make progress in clearing arrears
and pursues the present system of economic analysis for appraising projects,
it should be eligible for future support from the Bank Group.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRLNENTS AND AUTHORIZATION
43.         The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and NIB, the draft Guarantee
Agreement between Ghana and the Bank, the Report of the Comnittee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
draft Resolut-on approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executiv-e Directtcrs separately.
44.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply wich the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.         1 recormend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

B.       PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-'
Cr. No. 163 - Fisheries Project; US$1.3 million;
Credit of September 25, 1969;
Effective Date: January 21, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
1.        This project originally provided for:    (a) the construction of
forty purse seiners; (b) credits to fishermen for purchasing such vessels;
(c) fishing harbor improvement and expansion studies, and (d) the improve-
ment of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation's Boatyard Division.
Following protracted problems over design and price, the number of boats
was reduced from the original 40 to 10, the procurement of equipment is now
virtually concluded, and delivery of the boats is expected to be completed
soon. Delays have also been encountered in the execution of the harbor
studies. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972, which was extended
first to December 31, 1973 and then to June 30, 1975, has been further
extended to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 205 - Cocoa Rehabilitation Project; US$8.5 million;
Credit of June 26, 1970;
Effective Date: March 12) 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
2.        The project, principally involving the rehabilitation of 51,000
acres and replanting of 36,000 acres of cocoa is behind schedule mainly
because of drought damage in 1973, poor farmer response, limited availabi-
lity of labor, and past indecision on the part of the Government concerning
spraying cocoa against pests, in particular capsids. The drought caused
a high mortality rate amongst young planted seedlings, creating a large
demand for replacement seed which could not be satisfied since production
of seedlings was hampered at the same time. The relatively low producer
price for cocoa has not encouraged farmers to participate in the project nor
to pay attractive wages to hired labor. Consequently little hired labor
has been forthcoming. The government spraying program caused a delay of
two years in the project's rehabilitation program. Increased costs, due to
higher salaries and wages and higher than expected prices for construction
material, equipment and vehicles, might necessitate additional funding unless
the replanting and rehabilitation programs are reduced.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 354 - Sugar Rehabilitation Project; US$15.6 million
Credit of January 29, 1973;
Effective Date: May 31, 1973
Closing Date: March 31, 1979
3.        The project experienced difficulties in the 1973-1974 milling
season and only 8,200 tons of sugar were produced compared with 10,800
tons estimated in the appraisal report. The main problems were factory
beakdowns, irregular cane supplies from outgrowers and a lower than expec-
ted sugar recovery rate. Management is good and excellent progress has
been made with the rehabilitation of estates and factories. An increase
in producer and domestic sugar prices was recently approved which will
strengthen the project's financial viability.
Cr. No. 438 - First Highway Project; US$13 million;
Credit of November 21, 1973;
Effective Date: January 22, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
4.        In spite of initial delays, project execution is progressing
satisfactorily. Consultants have been appointed. Contracts for the first
three road sections to be rehabilitated have been awarded to a domestic
construction firm, following international competitive bidding. The Main-
tenance Task Force and a Government research institute have completed
studies on road maintenance (including feeder roads), and a program based
on their recommendations is being prepared. The Government has taken steps
to strengthen the highways administration by creating Highway Authority
to be responsible for all public roads.
Cr. No. 499 - Second Water Supply Project; US$10.4 million;
Credit of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: January 7, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
5.        This project is a follow-up on the first Water Supply project
financed under Credit 160-GH and consists of the construction of an
earth dam at Weija; extension of the distribution system in the Accra/
Tema area; extension of rural water supplies near Accra; and technical
assistance and training. The Credit became effective in January 1975,
the delay being due mainly to the delayed conclusion of a loan agreement
between the Government and CIDA which is co-financing the project. (The
other co-financier is the African Development Bank). However, construc-
tion of the Weija dam is well under way.

Cr. No. 500 - Livestock Development Project;
US$2.0 million Credit of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: May 14, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
6.        The project consists of:   (a) development of three breeding/
fattening ranches; (b) improvement of about 50 privately-owned herds
in the vicinity of the breeding/fattening ranches; (c) training of
Ghanaian ranch managers, and (d) feasibility studies of the identifica-
tion of a second phase project. The credit became effective on May 14,
1975.
Cr. No. 531 - Oil Palm Project; US$13.6 million;
Credit of March 5, 1975;
Effective Date: Not yet effective;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
7.        The project consists of the following main components:
establishment of a 10,000-acre nucleus plantation; provision of tech-
nical services and credit facilities for the development of 3,000 of
outgrower plantings; construction of a 10-ton/hr palm oil mill; training
of personnel; construction of 10 miles of road and provision of tech-
nical assistance to the Agricultural Development Bank. The credit is
not yet effective due mainly to delays in concluding a contract with a
firm of management consultants who are to provide key management personnel
for the project unit.
Ln. No. 1122 - Telecommunications Project: US$23 million;
Loan of June 10, 1975;
Effective Date: Not yet effective;
Closing Date: December 31, 1989
8.        Project components include the rehabilitation and expansion
of telephone exchange equipment, improvement and expansion of long
distance telephone facilities and expansion of telex services. Engineering
consultants have been appointed. The loan is not yet effective.
