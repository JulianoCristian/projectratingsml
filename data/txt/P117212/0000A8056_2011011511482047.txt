                         The objective of the project is to increase access to improved seed among 300,000 smallholder farmers farming in targeted food-insecure communal lands of
                         Zimbabwe.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall status of project implementation is rated satisfactory. The project has completed a restructuring to allow US$1.6 million in savings resulting from the unexpectedly low cost
                         of improved seed in year one to be allocated to the purchase of an additional 500 t of seed to distribute to 50,000 farmers in the next 2010/11 summer cropping season. Additional
                         seed cost savings in year two have raised the level of seed purchases to 583 tons destined for 58,300 needy farmers. We anticipate that the project will contribute to a net increment
                         in food production and household food security.
