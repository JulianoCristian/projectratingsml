                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall status of project implementation is rated highly satisfactory. GRM has met all deadlines laid out in the last Aide Memoire, improved its consultation with the Bank, and
                         improved the quality of its reporting.

                         All but one of the outcome targets laid out in the project's Results Framework have been met. The only target missed related to the timeliness of procurement. However, GRMhas
                         substantially improved its procurement capabilities, and has been more proactive in its efforts to resolve outstanding questionsin consultation with Bank staff.

                         Approval has been granted for the reallocation of US$1.6 million in savings to the purchase and distribution of an additional 500 t of hybrid maize seed by voucher redeemable at
                         rural retail shops prior to the 2010/11planting season. The documentation for the reallocation of grant proceeds, and 3 month extension of the project closing date associated with this

                         agreement, is now being finalized.

                         The GRM voucher programme stands as a model for broader adoption of voucher based input delivery in the country. This model has been endorsed by government, and most
                         development partners have agreed to use vouchers for input distribution in the future.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project has completed a restructuring to allow US$1.6 million in savings resulting from the unexpectedly low cost of improved seed in year one to be allocated to the purchase of an
                         additional 500 t of seed to distribute to 50,000 farmers in the next 2010/11 summer cropping season.
