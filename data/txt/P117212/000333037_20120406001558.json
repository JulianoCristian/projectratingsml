PROJECT,TF095035-Zimbabwe Emergency Agricultural\n            Input Project", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Emergency Agriculture\n            Input Project for Zimbabwe were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was highly satisfactory,\n            and the Grantee performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: this project was prepared at short notice\n            to meet the needs of a fragile state facing a humanitarian\n            disaster. The risks of the operation were considerably\n            reduced by building off the experience and institutional\n            arrangements already operational on the ground. This\n            foundation was most obvious in the operations of the\n            Protracted Relief Program, or PRP which had been involved in\n            the distribution of agricultural inputs and related\n            humanitarian support for several years. The project then\n            identified and made use of the skills of GRM, a\n            competitively selected lead institution under the PRP. GRM\n            and the PRP already had well established implementation\n            links with many Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) who were\n            already well known by local communities, and who had already\n            been involved in the identification of farm families in\n            need. The combination of using these existing institutions,\n            OP 8.00 rules, timely support from a diverse project\n            development team, timely review and due diligence assistance\n            from Bank lawyers, and retroactive financing allowed the\n            project to be signed and implementation started quickly at\n            the beginning of the 2009-10 agricultural season, when the\n            assistance was most needed. The primary aim of the project\n            was to get maize seed into the hands of needy farmers\n            quickly and efficiently. This aim was successfully achieved.\n            One spillover, pursued through the voucher pilot was to also\n            re-build linkages between seed suppliers and rural\n            retailers. However, it was evident that this objective can\n            only be effectively achieved with multiple years of support\n            involving a common set of companies. The simple fact that\n            one seed company won the tender to work with local retailers\n            in 2009-10, and another won the tender in 2010-11,\n            undermined the development of these commercial linkages. At\n            best, the relationship was initiated and companies now\n            better understand the prospects of rural markets. But\n            multiple years of support are necessary to build sustainable markets."}, "docdt": "2012-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
