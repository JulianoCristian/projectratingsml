1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country context: At the time of project appraisal in 2009, Zimbabwe was in the
midst of political and economic instability. Hyper-inflation, devaluation of its currency,
negative growth, high unemployment and low agricultural productivity contributed to the
country‘s economic decline. Cumulative real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was
estimated to have declined over 35 percent since 1999. Over 70 percent of the population
lived below the poverty level and many basic services had collapsed. Health outcomes
were particularly dominated by the decimating effects of HIV/AIDS on the population.
2.       In mid-February 2009, a new coalition Government1 was formed with an
immediate mandate of arresting the country‘s deteriorating economy through major
policy reforms. The Short Term Economic Recovery Program (STERP) detailed
Government‘s strategic response for bringing hyper-inflation under control2, improving
economic growth, restoring basic services, and lifting price and trade controls which had
left a negative impact on many sectors, particularly agriculture. The STERP placed
revitalization of the agriculture sector, and in particular, improving food security, among
its top priorities3.
3.      Sector context: Agriculture accounts for about 18 percent of GDP, and 70
percent of employment. Yet, agricultural production had been declining since the late
1990s, and was further worsened following implementation of the Fast Track Land
Redistribution program starting in 2000. Household food security declined precipitously,
especially in the rural areas. In 2008, Zimbabwe harvested less than 30 percent of cereal
grain requirements as a result of drought and a shortage of farm inputs. By 2009, upwards
of 7 million people or more than 60 percent of the country‘s population required food aid
due to high international grain prices and the inability of Government to find sufficient
resources to meet the demand.
4.     There was no budget provision under STERP4 to fund agricultural inputs as
donors were expected to purchase and distribute inputs using Government or Non-
Government (NGO) channels. A number of donor partners stepped in and committed
investments to support humanitarian efforts under a larger relief program that was
coordinated by the FAO Emergency Coordination Unit. This included DfID through its

  The Government of National Unity (Zimbabwe‘s coalition Government) was formed on February 13,
2009.
2
  As part of the reform in 2009, the country legalized commercial transactions in multiple currencies
(United States Dollar; Botswana Pula; South African Rand) and the Zimbabwe dollar for the most part
disappeared.
3
  Under STERP, agricultural inputs in the form of maize seed and fertilizer would be provided to 800,000
vulnerable and food-insecure farming households. Each farmer would receive 10 kg of maize seed, 50 kg
of Compound D basal fertilizer and 50 kg of ammonium nitrate top dress sufficient for 0.5 ha or about 1
acre of land.

  There is no agreed figure on the funding gap.

Protracted Relief Program (PRP)5 which was co-financed by donors such as AUSAID,
the Netherlands, DANIDA and NORAD. Other donor partners included EU, CIDA,
USAID, BMZ and SADC.
5.      Rationale for Bank involvement: Zimbabwe had just suffered a severe drought
in which farmers in some areas had lost most of their assets and as a result were unable to
plant the next season‘s crop. Many markets, including fertilizer and seed markets, had
collapsed as a result of hyperinflation. Zimbabwe was becoming increasingly dependent
on expensive food aid for a large portion of the rural population and the political and
economic situation was not conducive to normal channels of outside financial support.
Zimbabwe was in a non-accrual status, as it has been since 2000, and consequently
ineligible for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and
International Development Agency (IDA) financing. Yet the emergency nature of the
food crisis, exacerbated by the country‘s lack of budgetary resources to finance expensive
food imports, provided the rationale for the Bank to support the STERP, along with other
donor partners, through grant financing allocated through the NGO community. At the
global level, the Bank was already responding to the food crisis through the establishment
of a multi-donor trust fund – Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP). Zimbabwe
was eligible for grant support under the GFRP as it satisfied the following criteria: (i)
country negatively impacted by the rising cost of food; and (ii) country with limited
financial resources to address the crisis. The Zimbabwe Emergency Agricultural Input
Project (ZEAIP) was formulated as the Bank‘s response to the crisis securing financing
from the Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR) Core Trust Fund under the GFRP.
6.      Linkage to the CAS: ZEAIP is fully consistent with the Bank‘s strategy for
Zimbabwe. The project is aligned with the Interim Strategy Note (ISN; FY08-096) and
supports the broad objectives of collective dialogue with NGOs, particularly in the area
of service delivery, and with development partners, to ensure readiness for future
recovery programs. To ready itself for renewed country engagement, the Bank and donor
partners established the Analytic Multi-Donor Trust Fund (A-MDTF) in 2008 to deliver
on the objectives of the ISN. An agrarian window under the A-MDTF was opened to
support dialogue and analytical work in the areas of agricultural development strategy,
land reform and food security.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
7.      As stated in the Emergency Project Paper (EPP), the objective of the project was
to increase access to improved seed among 300,000 smallholder farmers farming in
targeted food-insecure communal lands of Zimbabwe.




5
  The DfID-led PRP was implemented during the periods: 2004-2007 (PRP I) and 2008-2013 (PRP II).
The objectives of PRP II are to reduce extreme poverty in Zimbabwe and to prevent destitution and protect
and promote the livelihoods of the poor and most vulnerable. PRP II is expected to benefit almost two
million people living in rural and urban areas: ZEAIP Completion Report July 2009-June 2011, Closing
Date September 30, 2011: GRM International; December 2011.

8.      Project outcome indicators were: (i) Producers receiving improved seeds7
(number); and (ii) Area cultivated with improved seeds (hectares). These performance
indicators were reflected in the Grant Agreement along with a set of intermediate
indicators measuring implementation performance. Table 2 presents the full list of
performance indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.      The PDO and key indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

10.     Original (as approved). Project beneficiaries consisted of 300,000 smallholder
farmers living on food-insecure Zimbabwe communal lands8 who had not produced
sufficient cereal grain during the 2008/09 summer cropping season to meet household
consumption needs9. Under the project, higher priority was given to: (i) women,
especially those heading households; (ii) households affected by HIV/AIDs or related
health problems; and (iii) households with high dependency ratios. Project beneficiaries
also had no or limited access to draught power. The targeted beneficiaries were spread
across 45 districts.
11.     Revised. An additional 45,000 smallholder farmers were targeted as beneficiaries
during a second round of input distribution during the 2010/11 agricultural year.
Unanticipated budget savings of US$1.6 million from the 2009 maize seed purchase
made it possible to extend support to needy farmers for a second year. The beneficiary
profile, as elaborated above, did not change.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

12.     At appraisal stage, the project comprised 2 components:
Component 1: Provision of Improved Seed (US$6.1 million or 87 % of project costs).
The component‘s objective was to purchase and distribute 3,000 mt of improved maize
seed to 300,000 farmers residing in Zimbabwe‘s food-insecure Communal Lands. Each
farmer would receive a 10 kg bag of improved maize seed in time for the 2009/10
summer planting season. Distribution of seeds was carried out using two approaches as
reflected by the following sub-components: (i) direct distribution of maize seed:
approximately 2,750 mt of improved maize seed distributed to 275,000 food-insecure
smallholder farmers; and (ii) voucher-based seeds distribution: approximately 250 mt
of hybrid maize seed distributed to 25,000 smallholder farmers through local rural retail


7
  Improved maize seed includes hybrid and Open Pollinated Varieties (OPVs).
8
  Communal Land consists of Tribal Trust Land in terms of the Tribal Trust Land Act, 1979. See full
definition in Standard Conditions under Article 1 of Grant Agreement. Seed was not to be distributed in
Zimbabwe‘s newly resettled lands where land rights were being contested.
9
  This would comprise farmers who produced less than 1 mt of grain for a family of 6: ZEAIP Post-Harvest
Report, ICRISAT; December 10, 2010.


                                                   3
outlets in exchange for vouchers. This market-based distribution approach was
implemented as a pilot program to help rebuild linkages between seed suppliers and local
retail shops.

Component 2: Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.9 million or
13 % of project costs): Under this component, the implementing entity was responsible
for all aspects of project management as reflected by the two sub-components: (i) project
coordination and monitoring of seed supply companies and NGOs to ensure timely
tendering and delivery of seeds to farmers; operation of the pilot seed voucher program
to ensure timely distribution of vouchers, stocking of seed in rural retail shops, voucher
redemption and commission payment; and safeguards compliance; and (ii) project
evaluation through an independent entity to carry out an impact assessment, as well as
an independent audit.

1.6 Revised Components (restructuring)
13.     ZEAIP was restructured (Level 2/CD approved) on September 28, 2010 and the
Grant Agreement was subsequently amended. Significant budget savings (US$1.6
million) from the lower than expected 2009 seed procurement cost were used to finance a
second round of seed distribution for the 2010/11 season (see Table 1 below). Component
1 was revised to include the purchase and distribution of an additional 450 mt of
improved maize seed to benefit an additional 45,000 smallholder farmers using the
voucher program only. Following the lessons derived from the pilot retail voucher
program in year one, the entire distribution effort was implemented through retail
vouchers in year two. There were no substantive changes in the methods of purchase or
seed distribution. In addition, Component 1 was reduced by US$240,000 with a
corresponding increase under Component 2 to allow for a second year impact assessment
and final audit. Project restructuring included a 3 month extension of the original closing
date from June 30, 2011 to September 30, 2011 to carry out the additional activities. The
results framework was also amended to formally reflect the revised targets.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15.     Bank Process: ZEAIP for US$7 million was processed under OP/BP 8.0 which
allows for flexible and accelerated procedures. An experienced Bank team prepared the
operation in roughly three months (June to August 2009) and followed required due
diligence procedures including GFRP approval in June 2009 followed by the AFR Rapid
Response Committee decision review. ZEAIP was approved by the AFR Vice President
on August 12, 2009 and the grant became effective on September 3, 2009.
16.    Project design: ZEAIP‘s design was built on years of experience gained by
Government, donors and NGOs in implementing humanitarian seed distribution programs
in Zimbabwe. The project‘s success was influenced by the following lessons:
         seed delivery and planting needs to be timely in order for farmers to benefit from
          the summer season rains;
         seeds must be certified in line with Zimbabwe‘s agriculture regulatory protocol to
          ensure genetic and physical purity, and good germination;
         seed distribution should form part of a coordinated approach among all
          stakeholders (Government, donors, NGOs) so as to reduce overlapping support to
          beneficiaries;
         monitoring of seed companies is critical to ensure timely supply of inputs;
         provision of complementary inputs such as fertilizers, top dressings, etc., can
          contribute to increased seed productivity.
17.     PDO: The Bank‘s intervention was straightforward. The PDO was focused as it
reflected the Bank‘s one-time commitment to Zimbabwe‘s national input supply program,
and was not envisaged to support a longer-term agriculture development agenda. The
project‘s two components complimented the focused PDO as its main thrusts would be
the timely delivery of seeds to poor rural farmers for planting thereby contributing to
increased cereal area planted and yields.
18.     Preparation/Implementation start-up: GRM International Limited, a private
company registered in the United Kingdom and Wales had been competitively selected to
manage DfID‘s PRP in Zimbabwe for several years. The team‘s decision to use GRM10
as the lead implementing agency was to effectively capitalize on an already established
mechanism for managing donor-supported input programs on-the-ground. In addition,
GRM worked in close collaboration with FAO‘s Emergency Coordination Unit based in


10
   GRM International Ltd. was procured by the Bank under single source selection (SSS) on the basis of the
firm‘s competitive selection under the PRP and its extensive experience implementing input distribution
programs in Zimbabwe.

Harare and had developed strong relationships with an extensive network of experienced
NGOs operating throughout Zimbabwe11.
19.      Under the PRP II framework, ZEAIP was able to ensure quick implementation
start-up since it was critical to identify beneficiary farm households and provide them
each with a 10 kg bag of improved maize seed in time for the summer planting rains
(November – December). In parallel, the same beneficiaries received complementary
fertilizer and legume seeds funded under the PRP II. In the second year of seed delivery,
a significant share of the top dressing fertilizer was provided by the Zimbabwe
Agricultural Inputs Project (ZAIP) under the Bank-administered State and Peace Building
Fund (SPF).
20.      Risks and mitigation. A number of risks were identified during project
preparation. Among them was the risk of elite capture. GRM‘s unfamiliarity with the
Bank‘s fiduciary procedures was identified as a risk since it had no prior experience
implementing Bank-supported operations. Another identified risk was the effectiveness
of piloting a voucher-based distribution system which would depend on the good-will of
rural retailers to stock seed inputs (as well as other inputs from parallel programs) as
many of them were at the initial stages of re-establishing their trading operations and
some had limited experience and/or knowledge of agriculture products. Possible delays
in seed supply by contracted seed providers due to production or import delays were also
highlighted as a major risk. Risk mitigations included strong on-the-ground Bank
supervisory support especially provided to GRM; and training programs/workshops
provided by the seed companies to educate local retailers on inputs, stocking, record-
keeping, etc. Finally, full consultation with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Ministry
of Agriculture, Mechanization and Irrigation Development (MoAMID) which resulted in
their strong endorsement and support contributed to effective implementation of ZEAIP
given its alignment to the STERP.

2.2 Implementation

21.    Overall, implementation of ZEAIP was carried out as planned. The operation
covered 45 districts under the first year and 14 districts (using the retail voucher program
only) under the second year. Forty-nine rural retail shops participated in the pilot
voucher program in year one (2009/10) and 139 in the second year (2010/11). Highlights
of implementation progress are outlined as follows:




11
  These were NGOs that had worked extensively with GRM on previous humanitarian support programs.
GRM had previously undertaken capacity assessments of the NGOs which were shared with the Bank. The
Bank agreed to select the NGOs on the basis of SSS.

22.     Provision was made under the project for retroactive financing of up to
US$60,000 to allow GRM and Crown Agents Zimbabwe12, GRM‘s procurement agent, to
quickly float seed tenders in the interest of time. Sub-contracting of 17 experienced
NGOs was also initiated early to quickly select and register ZEAIP beneficiaries and
identify retail outlets13. These arrangements ensured timely implementation although
some delays were experienced by the seed company in obtaining OPVs which had to be
imported from Malawi and Zambia.

23.     Overall, 3,047 mt of improved seed were accessed by 307,632 beneficiaries14 in
time for the critical planting season thus exceeding the original targets by 25 percent.
Favorable seed prices contributed to an extra 46.7 mt of seed to be procured benefiting
additional farmers. The pilot voucher distribution program was considered a success as
most retailers expressed satisfaction with its implementation. By mid-December 2009,
Seed Co (the contracted seed supplier) presented the redeemed vouchers to GRM.
Following a reconciliation process, Seed Co. invoiced GRM prior to the end of December
2009 and payment to Seed Co. was made in January 2010 due to the holiday break. The
performance target of ―proportion of vouchers paid out by GRM within 3 weeks of
receipt‖ was not achieved although this did not adversely affect achievement of the PDO.
24.     Required inspection of maize seed facilities and genetic seed sampling were
undertaken by the Department of Seed Services (DSS) of MoAMID and the International
Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) respectively. The outcome of these
tests was deemed satisfactory in both cases. An independent impact assessment of the
2009/10 post-planting and post-harvest season and an evaluation of the pilot voucher
program were carried out by ICRISAT.


2010/11 season (restructured)
25.     Pannar Seed Company won a seed supply tender and was contracted by GRM to
supply hybrid maize seed under the retail voucher distribution method given the success
of the pilot program during the previous year. Thirteen NGOs were contracted to
distribute vouchers to farmers for a 10 kg bag of improved maize seed. NGOs were also
responsible for monitoring voucher redemption by the farmers.
26.     According to GRM‘s completion report, by November 30, 2010, NGOs reported
that 94 percent of farmers had redeemed their vouchers thus exceeding the project‘s 90
percent target. By the end of December 2010, most farmers (99.3 percent) had collected
their inputs and commenced planting. The independent household post-planting report

   Crown Agents Zimbabwe was procured under single source selection (SSS) as they had an established
working relationship with GRM to carry out procurement activities under the PRP. Crown Agents handled
ZEAIP procurement of maize seed for the 2009/10 season only. However, they provided technical
assistance including several staff to GRM for the 2010/11 season.
13
   Participating retail outlets had to be within reasonable walking distance for targeted beneficiaries.

similarly estimated that on average 85 percent of the farmers had received their seed by
end-November. This was slightly lower than the 90 percent target because a supplemental
purchase of 133 mt of additional seed required a later, supplementary printing of
additional vouchers. In total, 583 mt of improved maize seed was purchased and
delivered to 57,961 farmers exceeding the year two target of 450 mt and 45,000
smallholder farmers, respectively by 29.6 percent and 28.8 percent, respectively. Pannar
was slow to collect and reconcile all of the seed vouchers with GRM. This delayed the
final payout for this seed. As a result, the performance target of ―proportion of vouchers
paid out by GRM within 3 weeks of receipt‖ was not fully met although this did not
affect achievement of the PDO.
27.     The DSS carried out similar inspection of seed facilities as required by Zimbabwe
law. Maize seed was also submitted to CIMMYT for a second round of genetic testing.
In both cases, there were no problems. A 2010/11 household post-planting assessment
and a retail voucher performance evaluation was also carried out by ICRISAT. Due to
the closure of the project, a similar post-harvest assessment was not prepared.

Challenges
28.    A few challenges were noted during implementation, but overall did not
materially affect achievement of the project‘s development objectives:
        Seed distribution/voucher printing delays: Delays in the supply of a small
         quantity of OPV seed during the first season of distribution led to associated
         delays in the delivery of seed to targeted beneficiaries. In the second season, a
         second supplemental printing of vouchers required in conjunction with a
         supplemental purchase of seed made possible by lower than expected prices, led
         to late delivery of some vouchers to NGOs for distribution to beneficiary farmers.
         Based on the independent post-planting survey, the small number of farmers who
         received their seed later than planned kept the seed for planting the following
         year15. These farmers likely accessed their own or locally ―recycled‖ seed or
         purchased seed from other sources (NGOs, other farmers, etc.).
        Procurement delays: Early procurement delays slowed down some aspects of the
         contracting process as both GRM and the local staff of Crown Agents were
         unfamiliar with the Bank‘s procurement process. Nonetheless, these delays did
         not affect the project adversely. Although the target of ―100 percent of
         procurement completed within one month of the plan‖ was not attained, seed
         inputs were received by the beneficiaries by the targeted deadline.
        Adverse climatic conditions: A dry spell (lasting more than 20 days) affected
         most of southern Zimbabwe16 during both years of ZEAIP implementation with
         damaging effects on productivity and crop yield. As a result, some crops had to
         be written off. Although there were lower yields in the southern region due to the

were still in stock because inputs were obtained late in the season: ZEAIP Household Post-Planting Report,
ICRISAT; June 1, 2011.
16
   Areas affected included Matebeleland South, Masvingo and southern parts of Midlands and Manicaland
Provinces.


                                                    8
         drought, this was offset by better yields in the higher rainfall regions in the north.
         Despite the dry spells in the south, the 2009/10 post-harvest report indicated that
         90 percent of ZEAIP seed was planted contributing to roughly 41 percent of
         maize area sown among the targeted households. The post-harvest assessment for
         the same season reported that hybrid ZEAIP seed contributed to higher yields
         (1,747 kg/ha) compared to non-ZEAIP hybrid seed (1,252 kg/ha). See Table A2.2.
         Similarly, the 2010/11 post-planting survey reported 90 percent utilization rate of
         hybrid maize seed effectively contributing to 45 percent of maize area sown
         among the targeted households (see Table A2.3).
        Commission payment delays: Particularly during the 2010/11 season, commission
         payments to a number of participating retail outlets were delayed17. A
         contributing factor was that a number of local establishments did not have
         banking arrangements to facilitate timely payments of their commissions. In a
         few extreme cases, retailers reported that they were forced to go to Harare to seek
         their payments personally. While delayed commission payments to retailers were
         an issue, it did not adversely affect achievement of the PDO.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

29.     M&E design: The key performance indicators were straightforward and
adequate to monitor project implementation and measure progress against the PDO in
order to assess: (i) efficiency of seed distribution; (ii) reach and efficiency of both direct
and voucher seed distribution programs; and (iii) overall quality of project
implementation at component level. Given the emergency nature of the project and the
short implementation period, originally one year, the indicators were appropriately
focused on the efficiency of the delivery of inputs rather than long term impacts.
30.     M&E implementation: At the field level, project monitoring was carried out
primarily by the contracted NGOs as they were tasked with ensuring timely delivery of
the seed and vouchers, where applicable, to farmers. GRM also undertook field
monitoring visits and provided quarterly progress reports to the Bank documenting
implementation progress against the project‘s KPIs. These reports were deemed
satisfactory to the Bank. ICRISAT was contracted by GRM to conduct an independent
impact assessment for each agricultural season covered by the project. Surveys were
carried out by ICRISAT to assess ZEAIP‘s implementation, and impact on household
beneficiaries in a number of rural provinces and districts, using structured sampling
methods. Post-planting, post harvest and retail voucher performance assessments were
undertaken and assessed against KPIs.
31.     M&E utilization: The Bank team also undertook regular implementation support
missions and progress against the KPIs indicators was discussed and documented in aide
memoires and Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs). The project was seen
to be performing well and no changes were made. Utilization of the M&E results
enabled the project to expand the voucher system after the first season.

retailers (100 retailers) experienced difficulties in receiving commission payments from the seed supplier.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     Environmental Safeguards: ZEAIP was classified as a Category C operation at
appraisal. OP 4.09 Pest Management was triggered as treatments to the seeds (fungicides
and pesticides) prior to distribution to the farmers and/or retail outlets could be
considered hazardous. However, treatment of seed is a common practice as required
under Zimbabwe regulations (Zimbabwe Pesticide Act of 2006). No genetically
modified seed was procured under the project. A Pest Management Plan (PMP) was
prepared and risk mitigation included inspection of seed plant facilities to ensure safe
application, use and storage of seed treatment pesticides. This was confirmed during
supervision missions. Throughout project implementation, there were no safeguard issues
identified by the team.
33.     Financial Management: During preparation, the project‘s overall financial
management risk was assessed as Moderate primarily because GRM had no prior
experience implementing Bank-supported projects and also given the unique nature of the
project‘s design (i.e., very limited Government involvement; wide stakeholder spread).
GRM already had in place an adequate accounting/financial system under PRP II. The
Bank‘s requirement for a legal representation letter and guarantee agreement with direct
payment on the large seed contracts made by the Bank helped to mitigate the project‘s
financial risks. Quarterly unaudited IFRs were submitted to the Bank within the required
period.
34.    At project closure, 98.6 percent of the grant amount or US$6,905,439 was
disbursed and unused funds of US$94,561 from the project‘s designated account are to be
returned to the trust fund. An independent audit of the project for the period ended June
30, 2010 (2009/10 season) resulted in an unqualified opinion. The audit report for the
period ended September 30, 2011 (2010/11 season) also resulted in an unqualified
opinion. Based on the final aide memoire and ISR (June 2011), financial management
was rated as satisfactory.
35.     Procurement: The project‘s procurement requirements were not complicated
given the simple design and objectives of the project. Procurement consisted mainly of
contracting 17 NGOs (2009/10 season) and 13 NGOs (2010/11 season), seed suppliers,
and firms to carry out the impact assessments and financial audit. Initial procurement
delays were encountered on the part of GRM with respect to compliance of terms of
references (TORs) and requests for proposal (RFP) formats in line with the Bank‘s
guidelines. Similarly Crown Agents experienced delays due to miscommunication of
seed supplier payment arrangements for direct distribution tenders. The Bank‘s team
provided considerable guidance to GRM and Crown Agents from the field as well as
during regular implementation support missions.
36.    There were no major procurement issues other than the delays noted above during
implementation start-up. Based on the final aide memoire and archived ISR (June 2011),
procurement was rated as satisfactory.
37.      Legal Covenants: Apart from the standard financial and implementation
covenants, several conditions of effectiveness formed part of the Grant Agreement such
as: (i) execution and delivery of the Guarantee Agreement between the Bank and GRM in



                                           10
form and substance satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) execution and delivery of the
Representation Letter of the Recipient and Guarantor concerning its legal structure and
financial condition; and (iii) adoption of a chart of accounts acceptable to the Bank. A
letter from the Government of Zimbabwe confirmed its support to the project and
implementation arrangements prior to grant effectiveness.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

38.      ZEAIP closed on September 30, 2011 with no follow-on operation under
consideration. As previously stated, the project was formulated as a short-term
commitment in support of Zimbabwe‘s national seeds input program under STERP in
response to the 2008 food crisis. Post assessment reports show that ZEAIP-targeted
smallholder farmers benefitted from an additional year of improved seed inputs instead of
one year, as originally designed. ZEAIP‘s project design did not call for reforms or
institutional capacity building. No significant operation and maintenance (O&M)
arrangements were established over the period of project implementation as an already
well-defined framework of food assistance was in place under the PRP II.
39.      However, one of the project‘s innovations was to pilot linkages between rural
retail markets and agricultural seed suppliers through the voucher distribution approach.
A post-evaluation of this activity showed that while local retailers were able to increase
their stock of seed through participation in ZEAIP (i.e., commissions received) and
suppliers increased their knowledge of the rural retail demand for agricultural inputs,
sustaining these market linkages would require a multi-year intervention above and
beyond what ZEAIP was designed to achieve. Nonetheless, a main goal of this project
was to pilot the concept of a voucher scheme and this goal was achieved.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

40.     ZEAIP‘s development objective remains highly relevant to Zimbabwe‘s priorities
and the Bank‘s strategy. The project‘s design was in direct response to supporting
Government‘s efforts under its national strategic priority – STERP – to improve food
security for the most vulnerable farming households through emergency relief efforts.
The project‘s contribution to the Bank‘s strategy remains relevant through its
contribution to the strategic/thematic pillars of the ISN. One of the outputs under ZEAIP
was the fostering of agricultural input market linkages between seed suppliers and rural
retail outlets through the voucher redemption program as well as contributing to
increased donor harmonization efforts.




                                            11
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

41.     This objective was fully achieved: ZEAIP fully achieved its development
objectives based on the final assessment against its key outcome indicators:
42.     Producers receiving improved seed: Overall, 3,630 mt of improved seed was
distributed in 10 kg packages to 365,593 farm households under both direct and retail
voucher-based programs compared to revised targets of 3,450 mt and 345,000
respectively. On average, 90 percent of farm households were able to effectively plant
the improved seed within the critical summer planting period thereby contributing to their
own food security. Although assessment reports revealed that in a few districts, NGOs
split seed bags into 5 kg packs to benefit more farmers or distributed 20 kg bags to a
small number of farmers practicing conservation agriculture, on average this did not
change the beneficiary profile or affect the PDO. The 2009/10 post-harvest impact
assessment report estimated that the proportion of households that had produced
sufficient grain to meet their household requirements18 increased from 30 percent in
2008/09 to 48 percent in 2009/10 based on its review sample. In addition, it was
estimated that ZEAIP maize seed contributed 118 to 377 days of additional cereal supply
from the 2010 harvest at the household level. Due to the closure of the project, no similar
impact assessment report was prepared following the 2010/11 season harvest.
43.     Area cultivated with improved seed: Based on the 2009/10 post-harvest survey,
ZEAIP seed contributed roughly 41 percent of total maize area planted in the targeted
areas resulting in 137,050 ha of area sown19 based on a 90 percent utilization rate.
ZEAIP hybrid maize seed was found to have produced higher yields (1,747 kg/ha)
compared to non-ZEAIP hybrid seed (1,252 kg/ha) (see Table A2.2). It should also be
mentioned that parallel fertilizer input support from other donor programs (ZAIP and
PRP II) would have also contributed to increased cereal yields achieved under the project.
For the 2010/11 season, ZEAIP seed contributed to roughly 56 percent of total area
planted in targeted areas (see Table A2.3) resulting in 26,083 ha of area sown. Total
maize area planted using ZEAIP seed over the two years was estimated at 163,133 ha
which exceeded the revised performance target of 155,250 ha by 8 percent.
44.    Farmers receiving vouchers: This intermediate indicator was included in the
Grant Agreement and hence is discussed here. Successful implementation of the piloted
voucher program, which was then exclusively used in the second round, resulted in
86,193 farmers receiving seed under the program. Compared to the revised target of
70,000 farmers, this indicator exceeded the overall target by 23 percent.
45.    Table 2 below documents the progress made against each PDO and intermediate
outcome indicators. The project met or exceeded all of its project outcome and
intermediate indicators with the exception of two indicators.

3.3 Efficiency

46.     The project implemented efficient approaches to address the food security gaps
and yielded incremental benefits for vulnerable households. The project‘s costs were
generally reasonable, given the unique conditions under which this project was
undertaken and given the need to use retail vouchers as a means to revive market linkages
for the distribution of agricultural inputs. An economic and financial analysis was not
carried out during appraisal as this was an emergency operation. In the absence of a
calculated net present value (NPV) or economic rate of return (ERR), this analysis relies
on cost-effectiveness criteria and estimates of measurable benefits relative to costs.
47.     In terms of cost-effectiveness, the project‘s costs to deliver maize seeds to
smallholder farmers were very similar to the local retail price of US$22 – US$23 for a 10
kg bag of improved maize seed in rural outlets. Overall, for the first year (2009/10), the
total cost per beneficiary to undertake direct distribution of maize seeds was US$24.09,
inclusive of the costs of seeds, transport and distribution, NGO implementation costs, and
other associated costs. Voucher distribution of seeds was only slightly higher at
US$24.63 per beneficiary. For the second year (2010/11), the cost of voucher
distribution was US$27.31 per beneficiary.
48.    The cost-effectiveness findings above are based on an analysis by ICRISAT20.
ICRISAT examined component costs using four lenses: procurement of ZEAIP inputs;
implementation of ZEAIP by NGOs; management of ZEAIP by the implementing agency,
and beneficiary costs.
49.     A benefit-cost analysis, an alternative to the cost-effectiveness measures of
project efficiency, cites a conservative benefit-cost ratio of approximately 1.7. This
finding is based on crude estimates of the incremental benefits to farmers from increased
maize production and increased yields compared to the total project cost of US$7 million.
The value of the increased maize production from this project is estimated at
approximately US$12 million, depending on the assumptions made in the analysis.
Further details of the benefit-cost analysis, including data sources and key assumptions,
are provided in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

50.    Rating: Satisfactory. Given the high relevance of the PDO, satisfactory
implementation progress, overall attainment of project targets (with the exception of not
achieving the targets related to timely payout of retail vouchers and procurement not
completed within one month of plan) and the project‘s contribution to increased cereal
production provided by ZEAIP seed, an overall satisfactory rating is fully justified. This
performance was substantiated by independent impact assessments undertaken.
Improved maize seed successfully got into the hands of poor, food-insecure farmers who
expressed satisfaction for the operation on the whole.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

51.     ZEAIP helped 365,593 smallholder farmers improve their household food
security by generating sufficient food to support their households. ZEAIP specifically
targeted households unable to produce enough grain to meet their family consumption
requirements. These were households who were cutting back on meals, and who were
dependent on expensive and often intermittent distributions of food aid costing over
US$500 per mt. The 10 kg of maize seed provided under ZEAIP helped most targeted
households to produce at least 100 kg21 of additional grain contributing directly to the
expansion of household food supplies. Scarce cash resources that did not need to be used
for grain purchases could be reallocated to meet other household needs such as school
fees, medical fees, etc. On the market side, rural retailers who participated in the voucher
distribution program reported that they mainly used their commission for restocking
inventory (primarily groceries) and for consumption purposes.
52.    Gender was an important focus in project design and hence targeted beneficiaries
included female-headed households. The project established a female beneficiary target
of 33 percent. Although the impact assessment did not explicitly look at targeting,
including gender, in terms of lessons learned, survey results did confirm that on average,
33 percent of female-headed households22 were served by the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.     As discussed earlier, ZEAIP was designed as a short-term emergency operation
with no institutional development objective. However, the innovative use of retail outlets
(agro-dealers, small grocery stores) to pilot the voucher distribution program was an
attempt to help revitalize market linkages between seed companies and rural retailers.
The success of the 2009/10 pilot program influenced the design of a second year of input
distribution solely using the voucher distribution method. Overall, most ZEAIP
participating retailers expressed satisfaction with the voucher program as they felt that it
helped to strengthen their relationships with seed suppliers and also contributed to
improved knowledge and understanding of agricultural inputs. Despite the voucher
program‘s overall success, achievement of longer-term sustainability was not envisaged
in the two seasons undertaken by project. Nonetheless, the project example, and
associated discussions with key stakeholders contributed to the expanded use of voucher
based input distribution efforts by a range of development partners.




21
   This production gain is estimated to be approximately one-third of the total yield gain derived from the
seed distributed under the ZEAIP and the fertilizer distributed under complementary PRP programs. The
remaining 2/3 of the productivity gain is attributed to the use of fertilizer. Larger production gains were
achieved by farmers expanding the area they were able to plant.
22
   According to the ZEAIP Household Post Planting Report, ICRISAT; June 1, 2011, on average 33.25% of
beneficiaries were female-headed households.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

54.    None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

55.     The Task Team Leader (TTL) organized one major stakeholder workshop to
discuss alternative strategies for input distribution under humanitarian relief programs
under the auspices of the Agrarian Sector Technical Review Group (ASTRG). This
workshop highlighted several experiments with voucher based input distribution and
encouraged stakeholders (Government and NGOs) to continue to experiment with these
strategies (see Annex 6).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

56.    Rating: Low. Short-term results that were the goal of this project have already
been achieved.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

57.     Rating: Highly Satisfactory. The Bank was engaged in dialogue on the impact of
the 2008 food crisis with Zimbabwe‘s donor community as early as September 2008.
However, the Bank was unable to support the 2008/09 season given insufficient lead time
and instead focused on the 2009/10 season. This project was prepared in very difficult
country circumstances given the political, economic and social context and the acute
appeal to provide food inputs to poor farmers within a narrow window of opportunity.
ZEAIP was prepared in roughly three months by a highly experienced Bank team who
followed the required due diligence procedures under OP/BP 8.0 including GFRP and
regional reviews. This was an unusual operation as the grantee and implementing agency
was the private sector (GRM International) and not the Government. The Bank team
worked extensively with the Legal department as well as with the Financial Management
and Procurement Units to ensure that compliance with the Bank‘s legal and fiduciary
requirements would be satisfactorily met by GRM. While there was no formal Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) review of the project at entry, the operation was not assessed at
any time as a problem project or a project at risk. Therefore, it is the conclusion of this
ICR review that the project‘s quality at entry was found to be highly satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

58.     Rating: Highly Satisfactory. Five implementation support missions were carried
out by the Bank‘s team fielded from the Zimbabwe Country Office. Based on mission
aide memoires and ISRs filed, the Bank‘s implementation support mission team reviewed
progress against the project‘s objectives and performance indicators and fiduciary and


                                            16
safeguard aspects. GRM‘s unfamiliarity with the Bank‘s procurement procedures led to
some delay in the issuance of no objections because of incomplete or incorrect paperwork.
But this improved over the course of project implementation. Under the Bank‘s strong
supervision effort, implementation bottlenecks were effectively resolved and the quality
of GRM‘s reporting improved to a level satisfactory to the Bank. Finally, the project was
rated satisfactory or higher following each supervision mission undertaken by the Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

59.     Rating: Highly Satisfactory. Based on the above justifications, the diverse
experience of the Bank team contributed to a well-designed and straightforward operation.
The Bank collaborated fully and in partnership with the multiple stakeholders involved in
the project. ZEAIP was successfully implemented, achieved its development objective
and exceeded all but two of its targets. ZEAIP was awarded a 2010 Africa Region‘s
Award for Excellence in the areas of design, teamwork and first year implementation
achievements.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

60.     Rating: Satisfactory. This was an unusual operation as the Government was
neither the grant recipient nor key implementing agency, although it was fully committed
to the operation. However, MoMID local extension workers (Agritex) and DSS staff did
play a role in identifying targeted beneficiary farmers and carrying out regulated
safeguard activities. The MoF was kept fully abreast of implementation progress during
regular Bank supervision missions. Aide memoires and management letters were
officially issued to the Ministry of Finance.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

61.     Rating: Satisfactory. GRM demonstrated satisfactory performance in
implementing ZEAIP given its experience implementing PRP II. GRM carried out all
aspects of project management including timely submission of quarterly progress reports
to the Bank, procurement, monitoring safeguard aspects and ensuring required impact
assessment and audits were contracted and completed. Although there were initial
procurement delays, GRM collaborated well with the Bank and NGO partners in
resolving implementation bottlenecks such as supplier delays, and quickly helping to
resolve issues related to commission payment delays to ZEAIP retailers.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

62.     Rating: Satisfactory: Overall, the performance of the Grantee and Government
was satisfactory as ZEAIP achieved it development objective and fully exceeded its
targets. Targeted smallholder farmers expressed satisfaction as beneficiaries of the
operation.

6. Lessons Learned

63.      Using Existing Institutional Structures, Particularly the Private Sector,
Reduces Risk in OP 8.00 Operations. This project was prepared at short notice to meet
the needs of a fragile state facing a humanitarian disaster. The risks of the operation were
considerably reduced by building off the experience and institutional arrangements
already operational on the ground. This foundation was most obvious in the operations of
the PRP which had been involved in the distribution of agricultural inputs and related
humanitarian support for several years. The project then identified and made use of the
skills of GRM, a competitively selected lead institution under the PRP. GRM and the
PRP already had well established implementation links with many NGOs who were
already well known by local communities, and who had already been involved in the
identification of farm families in need. The combination of using these existing
institutions, OP 8.00 rules, timely support from a diverse project development team,
timely review and due diligence assistance from Bank lawyers, and retroactive financing
allowed the project to be signed and implementation started quickly at the beginning of
the 2009/10 agricultural season – when the assistance was most needed.
64.      Emergency Operations can be Designed to Reestablish the Private Sector
Quickly and Move Away from Expensive Food Aid. The combination of drought and
economic dislocation associated with hyperinflation had created a dependence on free
handouts of food and inputs in Zimbabwe. The needs of smallholders were particularly
acute in 2009 as a result of the high global food and fuel prices. During project design
various constituencies argued for a simple humanitarian design encompassing direct
handouts of inputs to individual farmers. The project team argued that the recent change
in Government, and adoption of hard currencies to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, opened
opportunities for market development, and a path toward the reduction of handout
dependency. After some debate, the project was allowed to pilot a voucher based seed
distribution program during the 2009/10 planting season. The success of this effort
encouraged interest in testing a broader range of market based delivery systems for
agricultural and rural assistance – including open vouchers, electronic vouchers and
retailer credit. The combination of a willingness to take this risk, and close
implementation monitoring, fostered a broader commitment to a humanitarian plus
development model. This was reinforced by seminars on alternative delivery strategies
and discussions about alterative rural assistance models led by a wider range of
development partners.
65.     Heavily Subsidized or Free Bulk Input Supply Programs can Destroy Private
Retail Markets and Vouchers are a Useful Tool to Reduce this Problem. To further
develop input markets, the project asked each of the seed companies winning a tender to
supply seed in exchange for vouchers, to also supply seed to the selected agro-dealers for
commercial sale on consignment. In both 2009/10 and in 2010/11 this effort largely
failed for three inter-related reasons. First, many farmers still expected to receive free or
cheap seed directly from one or another distribution program, or from Government.
Many asked why they should purchase seed if they still hoped to receive this as a handout.
Second, many farmers had become so accustomed to seed handouts that they did not
believe observers who argued these were no longer available. Community discussions
were held to discuss exit strategies, but most participants argued, even when the season


                                             18
was known to be favorable, that their poverty still justified free assistance. Finally, the
seed companies faced an incentive to hold and earmark seed for bulk sales to NGO and
Government programs, rather than risk the pursuit of smaller sales on rural retail markets.
In effect, the transition from relief to commercial seed markets takes time and needs to be
consistent. The voucher system used on this project is a useful tool for making this
transition because the vouchers can be subsidized while still maintaining private sector
infrastructure supply systems and incentives. Vouchers also have the advantage that the
level of subsidy can be adjusted over time. The key lesson for future Bank emergency
operations is that NGO or Government bulk delivery input supply programs should only
be used as a last resort in emergency situations because they can reduce incentives for or
even destroy existing private delivery structures. The other lesson is that voucher
systems can avoid this problem if they are used in the first place or gradually repair the
damage if the bulk distribution of inputs has already been introduced.
66.     The Competitive Procurement of Seed from One Supplier Limits Seed Choices
to the Farmer and can Dislocate Supply Markets. The ZEIAP procured seed from the
cheapest supplier with varieties (hybrid or open pollinated) known to be suitable for the
targeted environments. As a consequence, the program undermined the capacity of
farmers to choose what variety they preferred. They were effectively given a voucher
redeemable for one variety alone – the one winning the tender for the targeted district.
The project found no evidence of rejection of seed varieties being distributed. However,
this procurement strategy limits the development of competitive markets and probably
limits the introduction of new varieties. This constraint has been partially resolved by the
testing of open-ended vouchers in more recent input distribution programs. However,
questions remain whether open-ended vouchers are viable in outlying areas where input
markets are poorly developed. In summary, the lesson learned from this project is that
open-ended vouchers would better stimulate competitive input supply markets and should
be used whenever possible. Under such as system distributors would be allowed to
exchange vouchers for inputs that they have sourced themselves. One caution in
emergency situations is that distributors may not be able to source inputs because of cash
flow constraints or other logistical issues and the project would need to provide a stock of
inputs to suppliers. In these situations it may be beneficial to procure inputs from more
than one supplier to provide farmers with a choice. Procuring from multiple sources
would also avoid the market dislocation caused by hiring one supplier one year and
another next, as discussed in more detail below.
67.     Input Market Development Takes Time – Multi-year Emergency Projects may
be Better. The primary aim of the project was to get maize seed into the hands of needy
farmers quickly and efficiently. This aim was successfully achieved. One spillover,
pursued through the voucher pilot was to also re-build linkages between seed suppliers
and rural retailers. However, it was evident that this objective can only be effectively
achieved with multiple years of support involving a common set of companies. The
simple fact that one seed company won the tender to work with local retailers in 2009/10,
and another won the tender in 2010/11, undermined the development of these commercial
linkages. At best, the relationship was initiated and companies now better understand the
prospects of rural markets. But multiple years of support are necessary to build
sustainable markets.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Overview
1.     This annex presents results of the economic and financial analysis of the ZEAIP.
The Project Development Objective was to increase access to improved seed among
300,000 smallholder farmers farming in targeted food-insecure Communal Lands of
Zimbabwe.

2.      The analysis indicates that the project represented an efficient approach to
addressing food security needs of vulnerable households in Zimbabwe. This conclusion
is based on the findings from two approaches to measuring the project‘s efficiency. The
first approach relies on an analysis by ICRISAT23 of the project‘s cost effectiveness. The
second approach uses a simple benefit-cost analysis. As this was an emergency project, a
conventional economic and financial analysis was not carried out during appraisal to
calculate the net present value (NPV) or economic rate of return (ERR).

Methodology
3.      Cost-effectiveness: In ICRISAT‘s cost-effectiveness analysis, the component
costs were examined using four lenses: (i) procurement of ZEAIP inputs; (ii)
implementation of ZEAIP by NGOs; (iii) management of ZEAIP by the implementing
agency; and (iv) beneficiary costs. Procurement costs included bulk seed purchase, cost
of transporting the seed to either NGO delivery points (for direct distribution) or retail
outlets (for voucher program), and other services such as voucher printing, training and
commission handling.

4.      Overall, for the first year 2009/10, the total cost per beneficiary to undertake
direct distribution of maize seeds was US$24.09, inclusive of the costs of seeds, transport
and distribution, NGO implementation costs, and other associated costs. Voucher
distribution of seeds was only slightly higher at US$24.63 per beneficiary. For 2010/11,
the cost of voucher distribution was US$27.31 per beneficiary. Including NGO costs but
excluding implementing agency costs brings this cost down to US$23.02. The detailed
breakdown of the costs is presented in Table A3.1. These costs are very similar to the
local retail price of US$22 – US$23 for a 10 kg bag of improved maize seed in rural
outlets. Finally, beneficiary costs were assessed as the opportunity cost of time spent
attending community meetings, and redeeming vouchers where applicable. The
beneficiary households incurred these costs as part of their efforts to obtain the inputs
from this project, and other parallel projects that were distributing agricultural inputs.
This opportunity cost was significantly lower than the value of the total assistance
received by beneficiary households through this project and the other parallel projects.

5.      Benefit-Cost Analysis: A benefit-cost analysis gives a project benefit-cost ratio
of 1.7. This finding is based on crude estimates of the incremental benefits to farmers
from increased maize production and increased yields compared to the total project cost
of US$7 million. The key assumptions are presented Table A3. 2. The value of the
increased maize production from this project is estimated based on the local retail price
estimated at US$0.28/kg for 2010 and US$0.32/kg for 201125. The local retail price is
used to estimate the value of maize production because it represents the price at which
the households, being net deficit in food, would have had to purchase grain on the local
market. The retail prices are obtained using the FAO GIEWS Food Price Data and
Analysis Tool26. The benefit-cost analysis is based on a 14 percent increase in cropped
area27.

   This is a conservative estimate of the value of this seed to net deficit households. The additional maize
production resulting from the ZEAIP offset the need to import and distribute food aid which was estimated
in the EPP at US$500 per mt implying a local grain value of at least US$0.50 per kilogram given rising
regional grain prices over the period of this project. The additional production might alternatively be valued
in terms of the nutritional gains derived from the consumption of more grain calories, though this gain is
difficult to quantify.

                                                                Incremental
                                                               Value of Maize    Benefit/cost
Key Assumptions                                                  Production         ratio
 Maize production is valued at local retail price of         US$11,977,186.95       1.7
   US$.28/kg in 2010 and US$.32/kg in 2011
 Improved seeds led to increased yields of 1747 kg/ha
   for hybrid seeds and 1076 kg/ha for OPV compared to
   yields of 620 kg/ha for recycled seeds.
 Of the yield gains realized, 1/3 can be attributed to the
   improved seed varieties while 2/3 can be attributed to
   fertilizer.
 Farmers increased cropped area by 14 percent

6.      The analysis of the benefit-cost ratio is subject to some basic assumptions. First,
the analysis assumes that all other inputs (primarily farmers‘ labor) would have been
invested in the project areas in the counterfactual scenario (in the absence of the project).
Second, the analysis assumes that the investment and application of US$7 million in
project costs to distribute improved seed resulted in higher yields and incremental value
of approximately US$12 million. Lastly, the analysis assumes that, given the short
duration of the project, no discounting need be applied to the estimated benefits.

7.       Non-Monetary Benefits: In addition to the direct benefits from the project, the
project resulted in two notable indirect benefits. First, the pilot initiative to use vouchers
to distribute hybrid maize seed strengthened the retail distribution system of the national
maize seed industry. By strengthening the linkages between seed companies and rural
retail shops, the project had likely beneficial impacts on reviving the maize seed market.
The project‘s second indirect benefit came from the use of NGOs and extension agents to
engage farmers and ensure the appropriate use of the agricultural inputs. This investment
by the project, if it led to sustained productivity gains from improved farmer knowledge
and practices, would result in higher yields in future seasons.

           Subsidized Input Delivery and Market Development Workshop
                          Imba Matombo, April 23, 2010

     Workshop organized by the Agrarian Sector Technical Review Group (ASTRG)
                           of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund


Free or heavily subsidized agricultural inputs have been offered to needy smallholder
farmers most years since the catastrophic drought of 1991/92. These programs have been
run by government and donors consistently over the past five years, and have accounted
for the dominant share of seed and fertilizer sales in the country. This has severely
undermined wholesale and retail trade of these inputs. Despite recent improvements in
the economy, many rural traders remain reluctant to stock seed or fertilizer given the
risks of competing with subsidized deliveries by NGOs or government.

There is broad agreement that these subsidy programs are not sustainable. Commercial
input markets need to be strengthened, and farmers need to be encouraged to regularly
purchase their seed, fertilizer and agro-chemical needs at market rates.

Yet the demand for subsidized inputs remains. These are viewed necessary to strengthen
agricultural productivity in order to help the country meet its basic food needs.
Subsidized inputs appear likely to remain a staple component of drought relief programs.
And free inputs are still viewed necessary to help severely impoverished farm households
to lift themselves out of poverty.

In this context, two questions arise. How can subsidized inputs be delivered in a market
friendly manner? And how can the transition from free handouts to commercial purchases
be achieved?

Purpose of Meeting
In recent years there have been multiple experiments with delivery of subsidized
agricultural inputs in more market friendly ways. The main purpose of this workshop (see
Agenda in Annex 1) was to review lessons drawn from these endeavors, and discuss their
implications for future investments in subsidized input supply.

The presentations started with a historical review of market based input assistance
programs. This led into a more detailed discussion of several input voucher programs
implemented during the 2009/10 summer planting season. One presentation summarized
early lessons relating to the use of input consignment insurance aiming to encourage
flows of seed and fertilizer from wholesalers to rural retail shops. A complementary
presentation reviewed opportunities for linking input supply with the development of
product markets. A presentation examined strategies for linking input supply with public
works. And another highlighted some of the lessons drawn from the larger and more


                                           29
sustained commitment to input subsidies in neighbouring Malawi. Finally, national seed
and fertilizer companies were asked to outline their views of the transition from a
dependence on sales through publicly funded programs to a stronger commercial market.

The workshop participants encompassed a range of government representatives,
development partners, NGO representatives and industry delegates (see participants list
in Annex 2). Under the guidance from an international expert familiar with the evolution
of input delivery under humanitarian auspices throughout Africa, the group completed
these deliberations with a discussion of lessons to be drawn for the next few agricultural
seasons.


Starting Agreement

Stop the direct distribution of free seed and fertilizer (―in-kind‖ distribution)
There is a growing consensus encompassing government, development partners, and
other stakeholders on the need to move away from free handouts of agricultural inputs to
smallholder farmers under humanitarian and development programs. In recent years,
these deliveries have encouraged input suppliers to concentrate their efforts on the pursuit
bulk sales to government and NGO programs. The expansion of these sales, in
combination with capital constraints and hyperinflation, have severely undermined the
operations of wholesale and retail markets for a seed and fertilizer, in particular. Retailers
question whether to stock inputs that may be provided by government or NGOs for free.
This particularly affects sales in outlying rural markets.

Workshop participants were divided about whether direct, free deliveries should be halted
altogether. Some argued that a ‗most vulnerable group‘ of chronic poor (e.g. HIV/AIDS
affected households) may still need such assistance as part of a social protection strategy.
Others suggested the need for continuing support for direct delivery in outlying areas
where input markets, particularly for fertilizer, are least developed. But most agreed that
reliance on direct input distribution to farmers should be sharply reduced, and possibly
eliminated over time.


Strategic Decisions

The Promise of Vouchers
Results of various types of vouchers programs were presented. The overall assessment
was that voucher programs can offer good access to seed and fertilizer and other
productive inputs while stimulating the development of rural retail businesses. These may
encourage farmers to look to retail shops for their broader input needs in the future. Yet
many questions remain about how best to implement these sorts of programmes. Key
considerations include the following:

       a) tied input delivery – Most input voucher programs in Zimbabwe have
       historically been linked with the subsidized purchase and delivery of a stipulated



                                             30
       set of inputs. In effect, vouchers are redeemable at a retail shop for a specific set
       of inputs provided by the project investment. This assures the availability of
       inputs when farmers seek to redeem their vouchers. But what would happen if
       vouchers were provided without the supply of inputs? Are retail markets
       developed enough to assure that inputs will be available commercially when
       vouchers are presented for redemption? Will seed and fertilizer companies be
       willing to compete for voucher based sales? This is already happening in Malawi,
       most successfully for seed. But the evidence in Zimbabwe remains limited.

       b) top-up payments – In most voucher programs, the external project or input
       supplier pays the retail markup. In effect, retailers are paid for their shop space
       and time. Farmers may be encouraged to pay a share of their input costs, starting
       with the retail markup. In Malawi, for example, farmers regularly pay a share of
       the costs of subsidized inputs. In the case of seed, this covers the retailer‘s
       margins. In the case of fertilizer, this top-up is returned to the government.

       c) flexible vouchers – a more flexible voucher would allow farmers a choice of
       agricultural inputs. This includes a choice of seed types, a choice of alternative
       inputs (e.g. seed versus fertilizer), and a choice of the quantities of different types
       of inputs to be purchased. One farmer may purchase more seed, while another
       buys more fertilizer. It also allows more flexibility in different agro-regions rather
       than an imposed set of inputs. A significant number of participants saw this as the
       most appropriate approach for the coming season. However it was recognized
       that it would only be appropriate where it was realistic for an adequate range of
       inputs is being stocked to allow farmers a choice.

       d) cash transfers – the broadest choice is provided by cash transfers. These allow
       farmers to purchase whatever goods or services they most need. A growing range
       of literature suggests these offer the highest multiplier effects in cash strapped
       communities. There remains the worry that farmers will simply use these
       transfers to buy consumer goods such as cooking oil and clothing., Others note
       that most poor rural households spend more on agro-inputs than provided by most
       donor funded schemes making this concern less significant.

Public Works
There is broad interest in the use of public works programs as a means to help target
input delivery (to households in such need that they are willing to contribute labor to
these programmes) and encourage farmers to ‗pay‘ for their seed and fertilizer.
Practitioners warn, however, that to be meaningful, public works programmes first need
to be carefully organized and funded. In many cases, inadequate investment in preparing
public works leads to poor and unsustainable results. Technical designs are deficient, the
tools for carrying out the works are lacking, or the supervision is inadequate.

One conclusion is that public works programmes should not be established as a means to
deliver subsidized inputs. Rather the main objective should be a quality public works




                                             31
product in and of itself. The means of payment, whether by cash, or inputs, or input
vouchers, is of secondary importance.

Another risk is that targeting is poor because some needy are unaware of the opportunity,
or the opportunity to work is restricted to a subset of households residing in local
communities. A further problem is the difficulty of accounting for public works payments.

It appears there is limited experience with the linkage of public works with input supply
in Zimbabwe. Initial investments in capacity building may help assure these sorts of
commitments offer higher and more sustained payoffs.

Input Consignment Insurance
In the past, seed and fertilizer companies provided retail agents with consignments of
inputs which could be paid for as they were sold. At the end of the season, the input
supplier would to take back unsold stock. However, this practice disappeared with the
rise of capital constraints and hyperinflation. In 2009/10, one project provided insurance
to wholesalers willing to provide seed and fertilizer on consignment to a sub-set of 71
rural retailers. The experience was positive, leading to an expansion of retail sales, while
maintaining a limited insurance liability. Proposals are now on the table to expand the
coverage of this insurance programme to over 500 shops in 2010/11.

Questions remain about the true level of risks underlying this insurance liability. If larger
numbers of retailers participate, and monitoring per retailer declines, will losses sharply
increase? Can the local insurance industry handle the possible liability of millions of
dollars in payouts?

Questions also remain about the appropriate division of responsibility for premium
payments between an external project and the wholesaler.

Nonetheless, most workshop participants agreed on the value of expanding this
programme. If this happens, a stricter independent evaluation of the program may be
useful.

Linking Input Delivery with Output Markets
The main procedure for linking input delivery with output markets is through contract
farming. Farmers are provided with inputs, and sometimes extension advice, in exchange
for a commitment to sell their crop to a particular buyer. These arrangements have a
mixed, and often difficult history. Farmers are prone to side market their crop in order to
obtain higher prices, or avoid repayments for input loans. Buyers provide inputs late, and
farmers commonly worry that buyers pay too little for their crops. The frustration on both
sides of the contract has limited the expansion of these arrangements, though
experimentation with the strengthening of these endeavors continues.




                                             32
Targeting
There seems to be broader agreement on the need to improve the targeting of input
subsidies, than on how this targeting should be pursued. Stakeholders most commonly
perceive three general categories of farmers:
       i) those facing a chronic need for assistance because of very severe resource
constraints;
       ii) those facing transitory needs, and lesser resource constraints, and
       iii) those generally capable of meeting their own needs if markets are functioning.

Questions remain about the relative size of these household classes, and their capacity to
make effective use of input vouchers. Some argue that the poorest households simply
need consumption assistance while others argue that insofar as most of these families
remain active farmers, input assistance should logically remain a component of welfare
support.

A second, and less discussed need for targeting is by market status. Households residing
in areas with better market access are more likely to benefit from more flexible types of
voucher programs. Households residing in outlying areas with less market competition,
or service, risk difficulties in redeeming vouchers – either because inputs are simply not
available, or because local traders are collusive. Unfortunately, the distribution of
competitive, retail trade in agricultural inputs remains largely unknown.

No Single Solution
There was a strong consensus that blanket humanitarian and development responses
should be avoided. Zimbabwe encompasses considerable socio-economic differentiation,
and substantial agro-ecological variation. Different geographic regions are recovering and
growing at different speeds. In these circumstances experimentation with alternative
strategies should be encouraged. But if this experimentation is to be useful, there is also a
need for independent evaluation of the result.

Monitoring, Evaluation and Accelerated Learning
Strong monitoring systems, in real time, as the program unfolds, provide immediate
feedback necessary for refining and re-orienting programs. In complement, independent
evaluation is essential for accelerated learning.

It was noted that implementing agencies are rarely as effective at evaluating their own
efforts. The independence of the assessment increases the chances that problems may be
identified (as well as successes). And a fresh set of eyes can yield insights that would
otherwise remain hidden.

Good monitoring and evaluation requires a clearer articulation of performance criteria.
These include performance indicators specific to the project investment (e.g. quantity of
inputs delivered) as well as indicators of wider impact (e.g. production gains, and
strengthened retail trade). A proper evaluation requires a ―without treatment‖
comparison. Yet many evaluations only consider the beneficiaries of a given investment,




                                             33
and infer that all changes are a result of the project. The inferences drawn from such
assessments will be flawed.

By inference, good monitoring and evaluation must be fully funded when a project is
designed. Proper evaluation is not cheap. But the repetition of mistakes in program
design may be substantially more expensive.

Information Gaps
Several key information gaps are undermining the planning of input delivery and market
development strategies in the short run. Three, in particular, were signaled for immediate
resolution:
    a) Cash flow/buying power. How severe are cash constraints among target
        populations? Can most farmers now be expected to contribute part of the costs of
        buying inputs? How long will it take for most farmers to assume this entire
        responsibility? Does there remain a significant population that is so poor that it
        cannot even find a dollar as a possible top-up payment for voucher redemption?
        How can the severity of cash constraints be monitored?

   b) Client population characterization (stratification). What proportion of
      Zimbabweans is most severely vulnerable, and will require social welfare-type
      programs? What proportion of farmers need partial assistance necessary to expand
      their production base? And what proportion of farmers only need improved access
      to agricultural inputs in the market? Characterization of the rural populations into
      well-defined client groups is a priority task in order to guide continuing
      investments.

   c) Retailer development. How quickly are retailers able and willing to initiate the
      stocking of key agricultural inputs such as seed and fertilizer? What is the
      distribution of these input markets? And by corollary, what is the likelihood that
      farmers with vouchers will have difficulty finding the seed or fertilizer to
      purchase from nearby retail shops?

Goal setting—and devising clear strategies to move towards goals
Finally, it seems evident that some of these programs may benefit from greater clarity in
their objectives. Workshop participants identified a broad range of priority short and
medium term goals encompassing humanitarian support, agricultural recovery and market
development. But if these objectives are not explicitly defined, the success of strategies
proposed to achieve them is difficult to judge. The program goals and objectives need to
be explicit and prioritized. Corresponding sets of performance indicators need to be
defined. Then lessons can be appropriately drawn.
