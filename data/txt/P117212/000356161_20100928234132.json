Project is to increase access to improved\n            seeds among 300,000 smallholder farmers farming in targeted\n            food-insecure communal lands of Zimbabwe. The project will\n            contribute to reduce Zimbabwe's dependence on food aid\n            and strengthen the capacity of poorer farm households to\n            meet their grain consumption requirements. The restructuring\n            will allow the reallocation of US$238,000 from goods and\n            services for seed and voucher deliver to operating costs and\n            services for evaluation in order to cover the extra\n            administrative and evaluation costs associated with the\n            purchase and distribution of an additional 450 tons of maize\n            seed to 45,000 households. These expenses include the costs\n            of GRM management, seed procurement, seed testing, audit and\n            an additional year of impact assessment. The results\n            indicators have been amended to account for the additional\n            quantity of seed being distributed, and the additional\n            number of beneficiaries. Correspondingly, the area planted\n            with improved maize seed will also increase. The project\n            implementation will be extended one additional cropping\n            season. The project closing date is extended to September\n            30, 2011."}, "docdt": "2010-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
