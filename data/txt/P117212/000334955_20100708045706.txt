Any Other Special Selection Arrangements: 
The following arrangements should be 
noted: 
 
a. 
The NGOs would be selected under single source procedures for the following 
reasons. The method and procedures that GRM used for the selection of NGOs for 
activities financed by DFID under the PRP I and PRP II were reviewed and found to 
be satisfactory by the World Bank. Specifically, under the PRP, pre-proposals were 
solicited by GRM from any NGO interested in providing the requisite services. GRM 
conducted a review of the pre-proposals and identified a list of NGOs meeting the 
preliminary qualification criteria. These NGOs were requested to submit more 
detailed proposals and GRM evaluated them and selected 20 as qualified to undertake 
the tasks required under the PRP. These tasks are similar to those that would be 
performed under the project. The NGOs to be contracted, individually, under the 
GEAIP will be drawn from amongst the same 20. 
 
b.  Although not currently planned under this project, Service Delivery Contracts, Fee 
Based Selection (FBS) and Quality Based Selection (QBS) may also be used for the 
procurement of goods and consultants.
