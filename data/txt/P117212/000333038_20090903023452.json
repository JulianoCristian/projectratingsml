   Agriculture Input Project is to increase access to improved\n            seeds among 300,000 smallholder farmers farming in targeted\n            food-insecure communal lands of Zimbabwe. The project will\n            contribute to reduce Zimbabwe's dependence on food aid\n            and strengthen the capacity of poorer farm households to\n            meet their grain consumption requirements. Specifically, it\n            is expected that 300,000 smallholder farm households will\n            receive enough seeds to plant 0.5 hectares. If 90 percent of\n            this seed is planted, the project will have supported maize\n            production on 135,000 ha. Thirty percent of this is expected\n            to represent a net addition of planted area. Most of the\n            remainder of the seed will replace old recycled seed thus\n            offering a yield gain of at least 20 percent. In sum, the\n            project will contribute to a net increase in production of\n            approximately 44,000 tons of grain valued at more than USD\n            11.8 million. This is equivalent to an average gain of three\n            50 kg bags of maize per household. Additional gains can be\n            achieved insofar as this seed is complemented with the\n            delivery of fertilizer. The project will also contribute to\n            the re-establishment of seed sales through rural retail\n            shops. At least 40 rural retail shops are expected to stock\n            seed as a result of this program."}, "docdt": "2009-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
