                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall progress towards the achievement of the project development objective is satisfactory. Over the two year project period, 3630 t of maize seed was distributed to 365,932
                         farm households. This volume of distributed seed exceeding the original estimate of 300,000 households by 22%, and the revised estimate at the beginning of year 2 of 345,000
                         households, by 6%. The project is on track to meet virtually all of its Project Outcome and Intermediate Indicators. The main target missed was that GRM failed to complete all
                         procurement tasks within one month of the planned target. However, this did not materially affect the implementation of the project. All actions mandated at the time of the last
                         Implementation Support mission have been successfully implemented.
