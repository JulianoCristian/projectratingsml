Positive lessons reinforce the\n            importance of realistic project design in accordance with\n            Government priorities, as well as that of government\n            commitments, particularly from government officials directly\n            involved in project activities, with a preparatory framework\n            set prior to implementation, to significantly achieve\n            success, as demonstrated in this operation. Nonetheless,\n            negative lessons from this project point at the need to\n            establish distinct output, and outcome indicators, as well\n            as project impact indicators with a base value, and target\n            value, to help assess the degree of achievement of the\n            project's development objectives, and sustainability,\n            particularly on those objectives of intangible nature, such\n            as those relating to quality, and efficiency of the\n            education system. To this end, it is worth undertaking an\n            impact evaluation of the project, which should provide an\n            objective analysis of achievements, and identify unexpected\n            challenges. This could have benefited the project, given its\n            restricted supervision. In addition, greater attention\n            should have been paid to contractual enforcement, and\n            include an action plan for handling cases of non-compliance\n            with the loan agreement. Finally, as a general lesson,\n            education projects should emphasize reform policies, in\n            order to achieve significant impact."}, "docdt": "2001-09-10T00:00:00Z"}
