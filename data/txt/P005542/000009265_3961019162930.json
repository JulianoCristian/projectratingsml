Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Third Education Project in Oman. The\n            project objectives included: (i) the development of key\n            services (management, planning and curriculum development)\n            in the Ministry of Education (MOE), which was later expanded\n            to include expert assistance and fellowship training for\n            education planning and the production of educational\n            Television (TV); (ii) the training and upgrading of\n            teachers; and (iii) increased access to education,\n            particularly for girls and children of the poor in rural\n            areas. Bank's performance was highly satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was highly satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (a) local capacity to\n            adequately select, manage and monitor experts who implement\n            Technical Assistance (TA) programs was overestimated; (b)\n            responsibility for implementation should be lodged in a\n            single unit within the MOE. This was not the case in this\n            project resulting in weak coordination and monitoring of TA;\n            and (c) the TA recipient must ensure that there is adequate\n            reporting by the TA provider who is held accountable for\n            delivering the product according to firm schedules."}, "docdt": "1995-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
