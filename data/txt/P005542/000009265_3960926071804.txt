SULTANATE OF OMAN
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
Lan and Pro*ect Summars
Borrower:                Sultanate of Osaan
Amount:                   US$13.8 million equivalent
Terms:                   Standard
Project D,Pcription:    The overall aim of the proposed project is to develop
and modernize the school system, enabling it to
prepare Omanis for modern sector employment. It would
also enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Education
and Youth (MOEY) to plan and efficiently manage a
rapidly  expanding  school  system.   Specifically,  its
obiectives are to: (a) develop key education services
(planning, matuagement and curriculum development) in
the MOEY; (b) train and upgrade teachers; and (c)
increase   access   to   education,   particularly   for
children  in rural areas  and for girla.  The project
would  address  these  objectives  by:   (a)  providing
technical    assistance    to    strengthen    planning,
management and curriculum development capabilities in
the MOEY; (b) constructing and equipping three teacher
training colleges in rural areas, implementing an
in-service teacher training program and developing new
curricula;  and  (c)  constructing  and  equipping  30
primary schools and 5 secondary schools.
Benefits:                The proposed project would enhance the capability of
the  Ministry  to  manage  the  school  system  more
efficiently   and   to   establish   and   operate   new
educational  services.   It  would  also  increase  the
number of qualified Omani teachers and help upgrade
the quality of serving  teachers.  The  pr( *ect would
provide access to gzneral education for over 9,000
primary and 3,000 secondary students. This would help
alleviate   the   acute   shortages   of   well-prepared
graduates  from4 the  school  system  to  enter  further
education,  training or the labor market.   In support
of the Government's policy of providing educational
opportunities   for   girls   and   increasinS   female
participation in the labor force,  the project would
provide 2,000 places for females at primary and 850 at
secondary levels and 250 places for women in teacher
training.

Risks:                        All project  components  are  included  in the MOEY
investment budget under the Third Five-Year Plan
1986-90.   The principal  risk  is  that  given  the
scarctty of qualified Omani staff in the MOEY,
candidates for training through TA would not be
made  available  in  a  timely  fashion.   However,
there is a firm commitment to manage the TA
program cost-effectively.   Moreover,  staff  to be
trained have been identified and the timetable for
training should not prevent Ministry services from
operating normally.   Finally, much training would
be short,  intensive and  in-:ountry,  facilitating
continuity on the job.

SULTANATE OF OMAN
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Economic and Sector Backgrotnd
1.01     On the accession of the present Sultan in 1970, the Government used
its oil revenues to promote rapid transformation of Oman's traditional economy
and  societl.   Current  policy  is  to  diversify  the  oil-dependent  economy,
promote a wider geographical distribution of investment and social services,
stimulate private sector growth, and encourage human resource development,
with the specific goal of replacing foreign workers by Omanis.   The economy,
however,  remains  highly  oil-dependent.   In  1985,  for exampie, oil provided
86.5% of total Government revenue and comprised about 50Z of gross  4omestic
product.   With the decline in cil revenues since 1981, and particularly with
the sharp fall in oil prices in 1986, the Government has be3n obliged to
reduce its investment targets.   In particular, the Third Five-Year Development
Plan (1986-90) was revised downward significantly and only a core investment
program  has  been  retained.   The  impact  of  this austerity  program on  the
education sector was discussed in detail with the appraisal mission, and a
education investment program, consistent with limited financial resources, was
agreed upon (para. 1.14).
1.02     According to Bank estimates,  the Omani population is small,  (about
1.1 million in 1985) and although growing rapidly (3.62 p.a. in 1986-90) will
attain only some 1.6 million in 1995.   It is also young:   about 45% of the
population is under 14 years of age.  Consequently, in order to implement its
development programs and diversify its economy, Oman has been obliged to
import foreign labor in significant quantities.  Some 300,000 frreign workers,
many accompanied by their families, lived in Oman during 1980-85, and they
represented about  602 of  the  labor  force.   The remaining 40X of the labor
force was made up of Omanis, who were concentrated in the public sector and
the traditional economy and mostly in jobs which require only minimal
education and low skill levels (para. 1.04).
1.03     Given  the small  population base,  GNP  per  capita  remains  high  at
US$6,490 (1984).   However,  this statistic gives a false impressicn of Oman's
stage of development.  Most of the physical and social development has taken
place  in the capital city of Muscat.   In rural areas living conditions are
very difficult indeed, similar to those in many IDA countries.   For example,
many areas are not served by schools and have no health facilities.   Infant
mortality is hi,,h (124 per thousand live births) and less than 452 of students
in the primary age group complete basic schooling while only 12% of the age



group  (net  enrollment  rate)  is  in secondary school.   Such conditions are
comparable with Morocco and Botswana which have less than US$1,000 per capita
income.
1.04     Labor  Force.   Given  the  drop  in  oil  revenues  since  19dU,  the
Government has endeavored to reduce  -ts dependence on  foreign  labor.   Many
foreigners have recently returned home, resulting in significant financial
savings.   The exodus of qualified foreign workers thas enhanced  the need  to
develop a trained Omani labor force, not only to meet the shortages of
critical skills, but also to give nationals a greater share in the country's
economic a.tivities.  At present, Omanis are concentrated in the public sector
and in the traditional economy, mainly in unskilled jobs.   Few Omanis  hold
technical and professional positions and Omanis are particularly poorly
represented in jobs which require a science education.   Even in skilled and
semi-skilled office jobs, normally requiring at least nine ,ears of education,
Omanis account for less than half of those employed.  Thus far, few Omanis are
employed in the private sector, where employers express reluctance to take on
nationals, citing lack of educazion and poor work habits as the reason.
Women, despite government commitment to educate and employ them, comprise only
9% of the modern sector work force (1985); most of them are in public service,
mainly in teaching.  As in other Gulf States, female labor force participation
in sectors other than traditional agriculture is closely linked to their
attainment of secondary and higher education.   Consequently, continued growth
of girls' enrollments in school is essential to further Government's policy of
utilizing   indigenous  human  resources  more  fully  in  key  modern  sector
activities.   While  girls'  participation  in  primary  schocling  has  improved
considerably (42% of primary enrollments in 1985), their enrollmel.t at
secondary level has not much improved (at about 30% of total enrollments) over
the last five years, 1981-85.  This is attributable to the lack of secondary
schools close to their homes and to the absence of women teachers in rural
areas.   If  these  barriers  are  removed,  the  number  of  female  secondary
graduates will increase to parity with boys by 1996, enhancing their
participation  in  the labor force.   Experience in neighboring Gulf countries
confirms that, in addition to teaching and the civil service, modern sector
jobs for women are available in commerce, banking, and the health sector.
1.05     Outlook.   Government  projections  (Table 1.1) suggest that the share
of Omanis participating in the labor force will increase slowly, mainly in
non-technical middle-level jobs, and in skilled and semi-skilled office
employment.   The main  factor  constraining  a more  rapid Omanization of  the
labor force is the underdevelopment of the education system which, while
growing fast, started from a small base, and the poor preparation of Omani
secondary school students in science and languages which prevents them from
entering technica'  and  scientific  jobs.   It should  be emphasized,  however,
that the projected modest improvement in Omani labor force participation will
depend on the availability of secondary school places, improved educational
and vocational guidance, and better teaching facilities.

The General Education System
1.06     Guided by the  policy-making  Council  for Education,  chaired by  the
Sultan of Oman, the school system is operated by the Ministry of Education and
Youith (Chart 2).  It encompasses primary (grades 1-6), lower secondary (grades
7-9) and upper secondary education (grades 10-12), as well as teacher training
for  the  primary  grades.   Secondary  school  teachers  are  trained  at  the
autonomous Sultan Qaboos University's Faculty of Education (Chart 3).
1.07     Institutional  Capacity.   With  the exception of the MOEY's Projects
Department  (responsible  for  supervising  school  construction),  the  central
services of the Ministry lack trained Omani staff.  The Educational Planning
Detartment  is  typical,  where  only  two  out  of  17  staff  are  Omani.   The
predominance of foreigners in these cervices affects their quality, primarily
because of their lack of continuity on the job.  Performance is weak in such
vital  areas  as  planning,  budgeting,  curriculum  development  and  teacher
training.   The impact on  the system  is adverse:  schools  have been  located
inappropriately or have seen their enrollments expanded beyond capacity;
certain programAn are of poor quality (science and languages, for example) or
unavailable (education and vocational counselling, remedial instruction,
achievement testing and library services).   The MOEY has recently set up an
organized system for selecting and training school principals and for
upgrading teachers. Consequently, the training of Omani staff (in-country and
via intensive short-duration courses so as not to further weaken an already
poorly-staffed ministry) is a high priority.  The Ministry plars to strengthen
this program during the Five Year Plan period.  The Oman-US Joint Commission
(OJC) is launching a comprehensive training program in 1987 for education

1.08     Expansion  of  the  System.   The  school  system  has  grown  rapidly,
particularly in the last five years (Table 1.2).

The rapid growth of enrollments (Annex I, Table 1) has sev ely taxed the
capacity of the MOEY to plan and administer the system a. d operate the
schools.  Yet, despite this major development effort, much remains to be done:
lower secondary educatioa, required for even lower-level office jobs, is
seriously underdeveloped (only 352 of the age group are enrolled) and is the
major factor behind the very low enrollment rate (121 of the age group) in
upper secondary school.   This,  in  turn,  is a major obstacle  to access to
middle and higher level occupations (para. 1.05), particularly for girls.
While primary enrollments have improved dramatically (75% of the age group
were enrolled in 1985) they mask serious regional disparities and the grim
reality of overcrowded primary schools, many of which offer an incomplete
program which does not establish permanent literacy or numerrcy, or house
secondary   school   grades   without   providing   the   specialized   facilities
(libraries,  laboratories,  workshops)  necessary  to  provide  good  quality
education at secondary level.
1.09     Teachers.   The availability of trained national  teachers is a major
determinant of the quality of basic  education.   Despite a major effort  in
teacher training, Omani teachers are a large minority (Table 1.3), and many
schools  are  operated  entirely  by  foreign  staff.   This  creates  serious
problems:   foreign teachers come and go on short-term contracts; turnover is
high and unanticipated gaps in supply occur when one foreign contract teacher
is not immediately replaceable by another. While non-Omani teachers perform a
useful service, the Government's objective in the medium term is to create an
indigenous  teaching  force.   The  substandard  teaching  environment  leads  to
irregular attendance jnd repetition of grades on the part of students who fail
to meet required test standards, (for example, 10% of primary students repeat
grade I and 201 repeat grade 4).  These students take up scarce school places
required  for new enrollees.   Measures  to improve school management and the
quality of instruction are urgently needed in order to improve the efficiency
of the school system.

1.10     Until recently,  teaching was not a preferred occupation for Omanis.
Conditions have changed, however, and further expausion of teacher training is
feasible.  Enough Omanis graduate from the school system to pass the rigorous
admission requirements  to teacher  training programs.   Consequently,  wastage
during  training  is  a  low  21.   Trainees  receive  stipends  (which  attracts
candidates)  and  are  bonded  to  serve  for  four  years.   The  new  two-year,
post-secondary (grades 13-14) teacher training curriculum (1984) is well
designed  and  includes  adequate  exposure  to  practice  teaching.   Finally,
salaries are sufficient to retain Omanis in the teaching profession.   There
are only four Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs) in Oman which provide the
two-year pre-service training program.  Two more will be in operation by 1988
(one provided under the Second Education Project-Loan 2419-OM).  This network
of TTCs would bring enrollments to about 700, of whom 401 would be women.
However, primary student enrollments generated by a recent birth rate of over
3%  will  create a demand  for  teachers which will exceed the output of i.he
teacher training program (Annex I, Tables 1 and 2).  Also, progressively, some
proportion of primary teachers (about 101) must be upgraded through further
education and re-training to serve in lower secondary schools.
1.11     The  quality  of  the  preuent  teaching  ;orce  is  inadequate.   Many
serving Omani teachers (40%) are underqualified and the first generation of
qualified Omani teachers also had a weak formal education, having entered
training colleges after grade 9 under a pre-1984 secondary level training
p,.ogram now phased out.  These teachers are in the main young.  Consequently,
it is a sensible investment to upgrade their educational and professional
levels. MOEY's capacity for organizing and operating an in-service training
program is limited  (para.  1.07) and must be strengthened.   Any new program
must also address the task of identifying and training primary school
principals, of whom under half are Omani.
1.12     Facilities.   While  construction  of  new  school  buildings  has been
efficient, the provision of school places has been handicapped by poor school
location planning (para. 1.07).  The rapid expansion of the system during the
1970s and early 1980s (para. 1.08), particularly at the primary level, has
been contained by the ad hoc addition of classrooms to existing, poorly
designed schools.  They have remained "incomplete," that is, not offering the
full six years of primary schooling which would enable adequately prepared
graduates to enter the next level of education, training or employment.   In
other areas, where population growth has been rapid, schools are seriously
overcrowded,  and operate on  two or,  frequently,  three shifts.   This makes



school administration difficult and has a negative impact on the quality of
education.   For example,  it is difficult  to establish coherent  school-level
policies for instruction and it is especially hard to monitor student and
teacher  performance.   In  other  cases,  primary  schools  have  had  secondary
classes annexed to them without the provision of specialized facilities
(libraries,  laboratories,  workshops  and  administrative  offices).    These
secondary school annexes are incomplete and are administered by school
princ4.pals who lack the training and experience to operate secondary schools.
Issues in General Education
1.13     The overriding issue facing the Omani education system is the need to
increase  the  supply  of  educated  a,id  trainable  youth  required  for  the
diversification of the economy and to meet. critical labor shortages (para.
1.04).   As a result  of population pressuras,  the school systcm is growing
rapidly and its administration is stretched thin at all levels (para. 1.08).
It is essential that Omanis be trained to plan nd manage the school system
and to ensure that cost-effective instructional programs are put in place,
with  the  capacity  to  adapt  them  to  changing  needs.   The  MOEY's  central
services must therefore be strengthened to do this.  At the same time,  the
quality of basic educacion--the indispensable foundation for further education
and training-- must be improved and maintained.   The most  important  factor
here will be increasing the number of trained Omani teachers and principals
(paras. 1.10, 1.11).  Finally, while there is significant acceptance of modern
education, even for girls, access to schooling, particularly in rural areas,
is a major obsta.le (para. 1.12).
Government Policy and Sector Strategy
1.14     Medium-term policy  objectives  remain  the same as  in  the  previous
development plans:  increasing equitable access to general education for boys
and girls, in urban and rural areas. in order to develop a pool of educated
and trainable youth to meet the manpower needs of an evolving economy.  This
policy has support from the highest levels in government and is monitored by
the Council for Education (para. 1.06).  Government priorities for the sector
comprise (a) enrollment of all six-year-olds in primary schools by 1990,
expanding access at the base of the system to rural children aud girls; (b)
continued expansion of access to upper secondary education in rural areas, to
raise the proportion of the age-group enrolled to 20% by 1990; (c) expansion
of teacher training facilities in rural areas to provide about 1,000 trained
nationals a year to rural schools from 1990; (d) improved, cost-effective
planning  and  operation  of  the  school  system  through  reduced  repetition,
increased teacher-class ratios and the introduction of school building
maintenance; and (e) better quality of schooling through the Omanization and
upgrading of the teaching force, appointment of nationals to school management
positions, and the introduction of services for student testing, remedial
instruction and curriculum programs in secondary science and language and
vocational   guidance.    These   measures   are   indispensable   given   the
underdeveloped character of the school system which must increasingly cater to
an economy where human resources have become as important as natural resources



-7-
were in the past.   The core investment program underpinning these objectives
was designed  in mid-1986  in  response  to  falling  oil  revenues.   The  Bank
appraisal mission assisted in its development and the proposed project
directly supports it.   The allocated  investments  budget  (US$50 million)  is
adequate  for  the  Ministry  to  undertake  the  above  measures.   Recurrent
expenditures (RO 80 million in 1986) would rise by an estimated 752 over the
period.  However, as a proportion of total recurrent expenditures, the MOEY's
share is currently modest (177 in 1985) and would rise to 28% in 1990, a
percentage comparable with other countries still expanding their school
systems.
Bank Lending for Education
1.15     The  First  Education  Loan  (Loan  980-OM)  for  US$5.7  million  was
approved in 1974, only four years after Oman made the decision to establish a
national  school  system.   It  supported  the  creation  of  the  first  teacher
training  colleges   in  the  country,  introduced  a  diversified  curriculum
(practical skills, science) at the lower secondary level, and initiated the
training of agricultural technicians.  The Project Completion Report (October
1981) and the Project Performance Audit Report (No. 3849, March 9, 1982) note
that the project helped lay the foundations of a modern education and training
system and assisted the MOEY to design, plan and execute education programs.
Technical assistance (TA), mainly in the form of long teim specialists, was
less successful because the MOEY lacked a cuifficient cadre of Omanis, obliging
the specialists to assume line duties at the expense of training loca'l
counterparts (para. 1.18).
1.16     The  Second  Educaticn  Loan  (Loan  2419-OM)  for  US$15  million  was
approved in 1984 and is scheduled to close in i990.  The project provides for
the construction of a teacher training college, two general secondary schools
(one for boys and one for girls) and a commercial secondary school for girls,
together with TA to improve curricula and to assist the central services of
the  MOEY.    After   initial  delays,   implementation   is  now  going  ahead
satisfactorily  and  the  ix.atitutions  and  TA  program  are  expected  to  be
completed by the closing date, December 1990.
1.17     The proposed Third Education Project would consolidate previous Bank
efforts to aid Government in its development of a modern school system.  It is
also designed to promote the sustainability of sectoral development in the
future, along the lines of the comprehensive strategy agreed with the
Government  (para.  1.14).   Technical  assistance  under  the project  would be
paralleled and complemented by a grant from the OJC of about US$1.5 million
for in-country training and foreign fellowship (para. 2.04).
Lessons of Experience
1.18     The  principal  lesson  of  experience  relates  to  the  design  and
management of TA.   In the  First  Education Project,  the design of experts'
terms of reference and staff training programs failed to take into account the
severe shortages of trained and experienced Omani staff in the Ministry.   In
the  absence  of  counterpart  staff,   specialists  were  thrown  into  line
responsibilities at the expense of training.   In addition,  few qualified and
willing Omani candidates could be found to take up overseas fellowships.



-8-
During preparation of this proposed Third Project, there were extensive
discussions on all aspects of the proposed TA program, and the MOEY agreed on
draft terms of reference for specialists (Annex II) which specify the
monitorable products or results expected of specialists.  The OJC's overseas
fellowship program for Ministry staff would complement the Bank's TA and in-
cotntry training. While the MOEY's services are still underdeveloped (para.
1.07), enough candidates with an adequate educational level have been
identified who can profit from the OJC fellowships.  Importantly also, there
is the comitment to rinage TA cost-etffectively.



I. THE PROJECT
2.01     The proposed project was identified and prepared by the Government
with the assistance of Bank missions in September 1985 and January 1986.  The
project was appraised in October 1986.
Project Objectives
2.02     The overall aim of the project is to develop and modernize the school
system, enabling it to prepare Omanis for participation in the modern sector
labor force. The project objectives are to:
(a)  develop   key   services   (management,   planning   and   curriculum
development) in the MOEY;
(b)  train and upgrade teachers; and
(c)  increase access to education, particularly for girls and for children
of the poor ir rural areas.
Project Scope
2.03     The project would comprise the following items:
(a)  specialist services and related in-country training for institutional
development of the MOEY;
(b)  construction,  equipment  and  furniture  for  three  teacher  training
colleges; and
(c)  construction, equipment and furniture for 30 primary schools and five
secondary schools.
2.04     Technical  assistance would be provided  in the  form  of  short-term
specialists  (Annex  II).   The  TA  packages  would  provide  a  wide  mix  of
specialist skills permitting a flexible response to evolving MOEY needs,
through  both  short-  and  long-term  assignments.   The  TA  for  institutional
development would concentrate specialist assistance on specific operational
problems such as the need for new procedures and services (for example,
building maintenance and vocational counselling), on products (such as new
operational manuals and curricula), and on the training of Omani staff.
Because trained teachers and instructional materials are known to be the most
important factors in improving educational quality, the TA emphasizes the
development of training programs and materials, in particular, for in-service
teacher  and  principal  training.   Time allotted  for specialists  to execute
their responsibilities was discussed fully with the Ministry, is adequate for
the tasks to be completed and is consistent with the absorptive capacity of
the MOEY.   The project-financed  TA  is  designed  to  take  into  account  the
existence of a parallel but free-standing comprehensive in-country training
and fellowship program, based on a 1985 training needs assessment study, to be
provided by the Oman-US Joint Commission (paras. 1.07 and 1.17).  This program
provides for some 700 staff-months of in-country training and a foreign
fellowship program of almost 400 staff-months of which 160 are for

institutional development in educational planning and systems management, and
240 for curriculum development in general education.
2.05     The number of student places to be provided is shown in Table 2.1:

Institutional Development
2.06     The project would provide 105 staff-months of specialist services to
strengthen the capabilities of the MOEY Departments of Educational Planning,
Budgets, Projects, Teacher Training, Curriculum Development and Research
(Table 2.2). These departments execute the Ministry's developmental planning,
management and program functions.
2.07     Planning.   The Ministry would be assisted in updating its planning
methods and in developing alternative policy scenarios for the physical and
staffing requirements of general education.  Twelve staff-months of specialist
services would be provided to organize seminars and technical workshops for
the Ministry staff ia the Planning and Teacher Training Departments and the



- 11 -
Directorate for Financial Affairs to help them prepare for the next
development  plan.   The  school  inventory  and  staffing  data  base  for  the
efficient utilization of school facilities and teachers would be upgraded with
the  participation  of  Regional  Directorates.   Technical  training  would  be
provided in planning techniques and in the design and implementation of
surveys and tracer studies.

2.08     Management.   The  MOEY  is  phasing  in  a  computerized  management
information system to serve the planning and management departments.  In this
context, 12 months of system analysts' services would be provided to design
report formats, develop staff training manuals and hold workshops for staff.
The analysts would also work with the budget and planning departments on:  (a)
the design of more detailed budget formats; (b) procedures for budget
monitoring and review; (c) cost analysis, projection programs and project
programming  techniques.   This assistance would enable  the MOEY to exercise
better control over costs.



- 12 -
2.09     Maintenance  of  Facilities.   School  building  maintenance  is  weak
although ar. annual budget is provided and technical staff are available (para.
3.13).   The principal deficiencies relate to the planning and programming of
maintenance services.   Also,  the maintenance  service  is handicapped by the
lack of a school facilities data base (site plans, building characteristice,
renovation and maintenance records) which would permit the forecasting of
tasks  and  budgetary  provisions.   With  12 months  of  specialist  services,
regular building maintenance procedutes would be established in cooperation
with the Projects Department, through development of a facilities inventory,
management   manuals,   service   handbooks   and   related   staff   training.
Headquarters and regional maintenance capabilities would be reviewed and
procedures for regular maintenance operations, including the scheduling of
tasks and the allocation of budgets, would be established in collaboration
with the departments of planning and finance.
2.10     Curriculum Development.  The project would assist the MOEY to improve
the quality of education through specialist services to develop and implement
new teacher upgrading  programs  and curricuia.   Twelve months  of specialist
assistance would be provided to the Ministry, through its Teacher Training
Department, to establish a long-term program for the in-service training of
Omani  primary  teachers  and  principals.   As  part  of  this  assistance,  an
analysis of the recurren. cost implications of teacher and school principal
upgrading as well as a long-term projection of teacher salaries would be
carried out.   Personnel  policies  relating  to teachers and principals would
also be  reviewed.   The benefits  would be:   (a) improved skills of serving
teachers; (b) training of Omani principals in school management, which is
known to have a beneficial impact on overall school quality; and (c)
strengthening of the MOEY's capability to analyse the cost and personnel
implications of its operations.  As an important contribution towards improved
primary school management, the Ministry would appoint trained Omani principals
to project  primary schools  in their first year of operation.   In order to
establish achievement  testing  and  remedial  instruction,  the  project  would
provide 18 months of specialist assistance to the Ministry's Educational
Research   Department   to   determine   the   causes   of   primary   student
under-achievement and to identify measures required to improve achievement
'evels.  At present, the Ministry has not yet organized the hard data which it
is acquiring on what children learn in each grade and their ability to perform
acquired  skills.    Through  testing,  benchmarks   on  achievement   can  be
established  against  which  future  gains  and  losses  can  be  measured.   In
collaboration with the Departments of Research and Curriculum Development, the
specialists would assist in developing diagnostic tests and remedial teaching
materials, especially in science, and languages which are known to be the
areas where student failure is most likely and which underpin other subjects.
The establishment of testing and remedial instruction would upgrade student
achiavement, and better prepare them to enter the next level of education and
training.   The project  would also address  the concerns of the Government,
employers and parents that Omani youth is insufficiently prepared for modern
sector jobs.   Fifteen months  of specialist  services  would  be  provided  to
assist staff of the Departments of Curriculum Development and Teacher Training
to establish a vocational guidance service for secondary schools together with
training manuals for teachers and handbooks for pareiits and students.  These
measures to introduce educational and vocational counselling and guidance
would enhance the preparedness of Omani students for entry into the modern
sector  labor  force.   The  project  would  provide  12  months  of  specialist
services  to  the  MOEY,  through  its  Curriculum  Development  and Educational



- 13 -
Research Department, for a review of secondary science equipment and its
suitability to the new science curriculum. It would make recommendations for
teacher training including simple science teaching kits. Finally, ir. order to
improve student reading habits by developing their language and communication
skills, the ?roject would provide 12 months of specialist services to the
Curriculum Development and Teacher Training Departments,  to review secondary
school library services, as well as student reading habits, prepare a training
program for staff in the use of library resources including the use of graded
reading materials appropriate to students' ieading skills.
Teacher Training CoUeges (TlCs)
2.11     The proposed project would assist the MOEY to expand primary teacher
training capacity by constructing, furnishing and equipping three TTCs in
Ibri, Nizwa and Sohar.  These would be the first TTCs in the rural regions of
Dahirah, Dakhliyah and Batinah respectively and would train teachers from the
rural areas surrounding these three small towns to serve in local schools.
The decentralization of teacher training together with provision for boarding
would ensure  increased  access for females.   The TTCs would have a combined
capacity of 720 student places (Table 2.1). Each one would have a capacity of
240 students (grades 13-14), boarding for 160 students and a projected annual
output  from  the  two-year  program  of  115  graduates.   The  TTCs  would  be
completed in 1990 and, when fully operational in 1992, would provide about 350
trained teachers a year (one-third fema.'e).   These TTCs would also serve as
centers  for  short,  intensive  teacher  and ;Lincipal  upgrading courses.   The
curriculum is suitable and appropriate recruitment procedures are in place
(para.  1.10).   While  appropriately qualified foreign trainers are currently
available, they will be progressively replaced by master's degree holders of
the Faculty of Education, beginning in the mid-1990s.
Primary and Secondary School
2.12     Primary  Schools.    The  project  would  expand  access  to  primary
schooling in rural areas by constructing and equipping 30 primary schools.
This construction program represents about 202 of the Ministry's total
investme,nt program for primary education contained in the Third Development
Plan (1986-90), the education sector component of which was developed in full
consultation  with  the  appraisal  mission  (para.  1.14).   The  schools  would
provide basic education to children of the poor and females currently not
attending school and would relieve pressures of overcrowding in existing
schools  and  temporary  facilities  (para.  1.12).   The schools would be built
according to a new economical and environmentally appropriate design
recommended by the mission and would serve as a model which the MOEY has
approved for the country's primary schools.  The capacity and location of the
schools have been determined on the basis of a household survey which the MOEY
completed in 1985.  Each school would have between 6 and 10 classrooms and a
capacity ranging from 240 to 400 students, a manageable size and consistent
with population densities in the localities where the schools would be sited.
They would provide 9,280 places, 2,480 for boys and girls in co-educational
schools, 2,400 for girls in girls' schools and 4,400 for boys in boys' schools
(Table 2.1j.   Additional places by Region would be 3,280 in Dakhliyah, 2,280
in Dahirah, 2,240 in Batinah, 760 in Sharqyah, 480 in Al-Wasta, and 240 in the
Capital Region (Annex I, Schedule 3).

2.13     Secondary Schools.  At the secondary level, schools are overcrowded
and incomplete  (para.  1.12) and students  in rural areas are  often  denied
access because schools are located in urban centers.  The project would assist
the MOEY to expand capacity through the provision of two lower-secondary day
schools (grades 7-9) outside Muscat with a combined capacity of 1,200 places
(Table 2.1): a proposed girls' school in Quriyat would have 432 places and a
proposed boys' school in Al Khuwair would have 840 places. Both schools would
be sited in recently developed and rapidly growing zones of the Capital Region
where existing facilities are over-crowded and students are forced to travel
long distances  daily  to Muscat  to attend school.   The project  would  also
assist the MOEY to relieve critical shortages of upper-secondary school places
by  constructing,  equipping  and  furnishing  three  upper-secondary  schools
(grades  10-12) with a combined capacity of 1,704 places (Table 2.1).  This
assistance would include a boys' day school in Hail al-Awaamir (Seeb) (840
places), a fast developing part of the Capital Region where there are no boys'
upper  secondary  schools.   The  project  would  also  establish  two  boarding
schools for rural areas:  a proposed girls' school would provide 432 student
places (including 232 boarding places) at Ibri (Dahirah Region) where about
1,900 girls are presently accommodated in secondary classes attached to
primary and preparatory schools.  The second rural school with the same day
and boarding capacity would be in Rustaq and would be the first comolete
secondary school in that region.  The combined capacity of all five secondary
schools would be 2,964 student places (Table 2.1).

3.03     Basis of Cost Estimates.   Construction costs in general have fallen
sharply since 1985 as a result of financial constraints and resulting intense
competitiotn.  Construction costs fer the T.Cs and upper setondary schools are
based on reviews of recently received bids for comparable institutions under
the  Second  Education  Project.   Construction  costs  for  lower secondary and
primary schools are basea on review of recent contracts for comparable
schools.  Costs per square meter of gross construction area rarge from USi260
equivalent for primary schools to US$312 for secondary Fchools and teacher
training  colleges.   Costs  for professional  services,  at  6% of the cost of
construction, reflect the current fee scales of available architectural firms
which are foreign.   Furniture and equipment costs have been estimated on the
basis of existing,  satisfactory  lists.   Base  cost  estimates  reflect  prices
projected to the date of negotiations (March 1987).
3.04     Customs  Duties  and  Taxes.   No  duties  and  taxes  are  included  in
project costs.  The amounts of duties paid on building materials imported by
building  contractors  are not accurately  identifiable.   Equipment  and goods
imported for use by government ministries are exempt from duties.
3.05     Contingency   Allowances.    Project   costs   include   a   cotitingency
allowance for unforeseen physical additions (US$1.2 million), equal to 5% of
the estimated cost of all project  items  including  furniture  and equipment.
This allowance is modest because school designs would be based on existing and
satisfactory  plans  and  no  unusual  aite  problems  are  anticipated.   Price
contingencies between negotiations in March 1987 and the end of project
implementation are estimated at US$1.8 million equivalent or 72 of base cost
plus physical contingencies.  Total contingencies represent 12% of base cost.
Annual rates of price increases have been applied to both local and foreign
costs and for all categories in US dollar terms at the following annual rates:
3X 1987, 1% 1988-90 and 3.5% 1991-94.
3.06     Areas  and  Costs  per  Student.   Area  allocations   for  academic,
communal, and boarding construction shown in Annex I, Table 3, are appropriate
and similar to the Bank median allocations for such facilities.  Total capital
costs per student place for academic, communal and boarding facilities are
similar to the cost of comparable institutions Bank-wide.   Cost  comparisons
are sziuwn in Annex I, Table 3.
3.07     Foreign  Exchange  Component.    The  foreign  exchange  component  is
estimated as follows:   (a) construction 74%;  (b)  furniture  and equipnment -
901;  (c) specialist services 95%.  These percentages have been determined by
assuming that (a) about 901 labor and 75% materials would continue to be
imported, but that all construction contracts would be awarded to locally
based firms; (b) all furniture and equipment would be imported; and (c) all
specialists would be foreign.   Including contingencies, the resulting foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$21.6 million, or about 78% of total
costs.
Recurrent Costs
3.08     Under  the  proposed  project,  increirntal  recurrent  costs woule be
generated principally by the recruitment of aL-Aitional teachers to  staf  the
project institutions. The project's incremental annual costs when fully
operational  (1993-94)  would be about  RO  6.1  million  (1986  prica'.   This



- 18 -
represents 72 of the 1985 MOEY budget and is appropriate and acceptable
because   project   institutions   would   significantly   increase   access   to
educational and teacher training institutions in a system which is still
expanding from a small base.   Annualized capital costs of the project items
would be about RO 0.4 million in 1986 prices or about 0.5% of the MOEY's
recurrent budget in 1986.   The revised  investment  plan and  related budgets
make provision for these costs.
Project Flumcing
3.09     The proposed IBRD Loan for US$13.8 million would finance 502 of total
project costs equivalent to 64% of the foreign P:Lchange component of the
project.   The Government would finance the balance of foreign costs and all
local costs.  ProjectJfinanrcing would be in accordance with Table 3.3 below.

Project inplementation
3.10     The Under-secretary for Educatio,, would have overall responsibility
for implementing the proposed project (Annex I, Chart 2).  Under his general
direction the Directorate General of Financial Affairs, through its  Projects
Department, would be responsible for all aspects of day-to-day monitoring and
implementation, including construction and procurement of works, equipment and
technical   assistance,   preparation   of   budgets,   accounting,   auditing,
withdravals  and  liaison  with  the Bank.   Coordination of  the  ir.stitutional
development, qualitative and physical aspects would be undertaken by a special
TA steering committee reporting to the Under-secretary of Education and
comprising  the  Directors  of  the  Departmcnts  of  Curriculum  De elopment,
Educational Planning, Educational Research, Projects and Teacher Training.
The Bank would conduct regular and systematic reviews of the preliminary
products and interim reports of specialists in collaboration with the
Committee and a comprehensive review of TA would be conducted mid-1990 and at
project completion.  During negotiations the Government would be requested to
provide an assurance that current staffing levels in the above departments
would be maintained together with appropriate support services.

3.11     Architectural Services.   The overall  responsibility  for preparation
of designs and supervision of construction is with the Projects Department of
MOEY.   Architectural  design work and supervision  id  carried  out  with  the
assistance of two experienced architectural firms already retained.  Designs
prepared under the Second Education Project for the TTCs and upper-secondary
schools would be used for the proposed project institutions following
modifications  already  prepared  and  acceptable  to  the  Bank.    For  the
lower-secondary schools, designs recently used by the Projects Department
would be used in the preect.   For the primary schools, a model design has
been accepted by the Ministry which would be used for the project and become
the standard for MOEY primary schools (para. 2.12).
3.12     All  project  institutions would be on Government-owned  land.   Site
surveys are expected to be completed for all institutions by September 1987
except for the primary schools scheduled for construction in 1990 and 1991.
3.13     Maintenance.  Adequate maintenance budgets are provided  for schuol
buildings in Oman and maintenance personnel are available. The annual budget
for facilities, furniture and equipment repair and maintenance was RO 369,000,
(US$960,000)  in 1986 or 2% of the investment budget.   Under the investment
budget of the Third Development Plan (1986-90), an additional total of RO 1.2
million  (US$3.1 million) has been allocated.   There is, however, a need to
strengthen maintenance planning and management (para. 2.09).
Procurement
3.14     Bids for civil works would be invited separately under IC3 procedures
for each of the three teacher training colleges and five secondary schools and
half of the primary schools (15).  Invitations to bid (ICB) on equipment would
be grouped into about ten packages, the contents of which could typically be
procured  from one supplier.   Items  suitable  for  ICB would be  procured  in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits" (May 1985) and would acc:unt for about 90X of the total value of
equipment.   The remaining  l0O  of the equipment value would be suitable for
procurement procedures other than ICB (para. 3.16).
3.15     About 80% of TA would be provided in two packages, one for planning
and management support and the other for teacher upgrading and curriculum
development.  The Ministry would recruit individuals for the remainder where
specialist expertise such as building maintenance would not be readily
available through a conventional TA supplier.  A minimum of three technical
assistance suppliers would be requested to submit proposals for the two TA
packages, following a short listing of suppliers acceptable to the Bank.  The
procurement of TA would be in accordance with principles and procedures
acceptable to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency".   During negotiations the MOEY would submit draft  bidding documents
for procurement of the TA packages and confirm the draft terms of reference
(Annex II) and implementation schedule (Table 2.2).   Procurement arrangements
are summarized in Table 3.4:

3.16     The exceptions to ICB would be as follows:
(a)  construction of half of the rural primary schools (15) which would be
procured in about ten packages costing less than US$0.4 million
equivalent  each  and  aggregating  US$4.2 million equivalent.   These
would not be expected to interest foreign suppliers because of the
low contract values and because of the dispersed nature of the rural
sites.   However,  they are expected  to interest  small  local  firms
amongst whom competition is strong and could be awarded, using local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank; and
(b)  sundry items not exceeding US$50,000 equivalent in each contract and
aggregating a maximum of US$0.3 million equivalent which could be
purchased on the basis of the minimum of three quotations in
accordance with local procurement procedures.
3.17     In comparison  of  bids  for  equipment  to be procured  through  ICB,
domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 151, or the
existing customs duty, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. prices of competing
imports.  Under ICB procedures, invitations to bid and the proposed award of
contracts would be reviewed by the Bank prior to final award decisions.  It is
estimated that this review would cover about 90% of the value of all equipment
contracts  (US$3.8  million  equivalent).   The  remaining  10%  of  equipment
contracts would be subject to selective post award reviews.

Status of Preparation
3.18     The status of preparatiln is as follows:
(a) draft terms of reference for the TA have been agreed by the MOEY; and
(b)  designs  for  all  project  institutions  were  reviewed  and  found
acceptable during appraisal.
During  negotiations,  the  Ban:-  reviewed  documentation  for  construction,
furniture and equipment and TA proposals.
Disbursements
3.19     Disbursements from the loan would be made against:
(a)  421 of total expenditures on civil works;
(b)  100%  of  foreign expenditures  for  directly  imported  furniture and
equipment;
(c)  100%  of  local  expenditures  ex-factory,  for  locally  manufactured
furniture and equipment;
(d)  90% of local expenditures for locally procured items of furniture and
equipment; and
(e)  100% of total expenditures for TA.
Disbursements under the proposed loan are expected to occur on average about
six months after expenditure is made.  A disbursement schedule and profile,
reflecting this and making a comparison with regional disbursement profiles
are shown in Annex I, Schedule I.  The loan would be disbursed over seven and
a half years which is shorter than the standard regional profile for education
projects  (10  years).   This  is  reasonable  given  the  advanced  stage  of
preparation of this project in comparison with earlier education projects in
the  region.   Further,  the  disbursement  period of  the proposed project  is
consistent with experience on the previous two education projects in Oman
which form a basis for this project.  The completion date would be June 30,
1994 and disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31, 1994.
3.20     Withdrawal  applications  against  contracts  for  goods  and  services
exceeding US$50,000 equivalent would be supported by normal documentation.
Disbursements against contracts below that level would be made on the basis of
statements  of expenditure.   The supporting documentation (invoices, evidence
of shipment and payment) will not be forwarded to the Bank.  Documents will be
retained by the Projects Department of the MOEY, will be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to :he Bank (para. 3.21) and will be made
available  for  review  by  Bank  missions.   To  facilitate  timely  project

implementation, the Government would establish, maintain and operate, under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, a Special Account with the
Central Bank of Oman to which the Bank would make an initial deposit
equivalent  to  US$0.75  million.   The  Special  Account  would  be  replenished
against monthly withdrawal applications as appropriate when the undisbursed
balance of the account falls below an amount equal to 30X or less of the
amount of the Special Account. Withdrawal applications would be supported by
appropriate documentation.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.21     Overall  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project  would  be  the
responsibility of the Project Director, with the assistance of the Chairman of
the TA Steering Committee  (para. 3.10).   Specific  tasks would include:  (i)
preparing semi-annual progress reports covering achievement of quiantative and
qualitative   objectives,   and  measuring   implementation   progress   against
monitoring  indicators  to  be  prepared  by  the  Projects  Director;  (ii)
undertaking a mid-project review and (iii) preparing a project completion
report which would be submitted to the Bank no iater than six months after
Closing Date of the Bank Loan. Guidelines and criteria for project evaluation
were discussed with the Government during negotiations.  The Government would
keep the Bpnk informed of progrese made in the attainment of project
objectives and furnish progress reports to the Bank semi-annually until six
months after the Closing Date.
Accounts and Audits
3.22     The Projects Department would establish a separate project account as
was  done  for  the  First  and  Second  Education  Projects.   Project  accounts
including the Special Account (para. 3.20) would be audited in accordance with
the Bank "Guidelines for Financial Auditing of Projects financed by the World
Bank", March  1982.   During negotiations  the Government provided  assurances
that within six months of the end of each fiscal year the Bank would be
provided with an audit report of such scope and detail as it may reasonably
request, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against
a certified statement of expenditures.

Iv. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01     The proposed project would enhance the capability of the Ministry of
Education and Youth to plan and manage the education system and to establish
and operate new educational services.
4.02     A  major  contribution  of  the  proposed  project  to  the  quality  of
schooling would be the provision of 720 additional primary teacher training
places, increasing the annual output of trained Omani teachers by 350 from
1991.  The management and performance of existing schools would be enhanced
through in-service training of school principals and teachers.
4.03     The project would significantly improve access to primary education
for over 9,000 students in rural areas, reducing overcrowding in existing
schools.   These  improvements in basic education would better equip students
for further education and training.
4.04     By increasing access to secondary education (some 3,000 places), the
proposed project would assist in alleviating critical shortages of Omani
skilled manpower by increasing the supply of well-prepared graduates from
general education into higher education, professional and technical training
and the skilled labor market.
4.05     In support of the Government's equity objectives, the project would
provide 2,000 places for females at primary level, 850 in secondary and 250 in
teacher training.  It would also provide access to education for the children
of the rural poor, 832 of places at primary and secondary level being provided
in rural areas.
Risks
4.06     All project components are  included  in the MOEY investment budget
under the Third Five-Year Plan 1986-90.  The principal risk is that given the
scarcity of qualified Omani staff in the MOEY, candidates for training through
TA would not be made available in a timely fashion.  However, there is a firm
will to manage the TA program cost-effectively.  Moreover, staff to be trained
have been identified and the timetable for training should not prevent
Ministry services from operating normally.   Finally, much training would be
short, intensive and in-country, facilitating continuity on the job.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During negotiations,  the status of  implementation of the  proposed
project   items  was   updated,   including  bidding  documents   for  project
inps:itutions and for technical assistance, and implementation and monitoring
schedules for the technical assistance.
5.02     During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
(a) the borrower would use its best efforts to appoint trained Omani
principals to project primary schools no later than the end of their
first year of operation (para. 2.10);
(b) Staffing levels in the MOEY Departments of Curriculum Development,
Educational Planning, Educational Research, Projects and Teacher
Training would be maintained with appropriate support services (para.
1.07); and
(c)  the Government would open and maintain a special account on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.20); that accounts would
be audited each year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
and in accordance with appropriate auditing principles; and that the
Bank would be furnished within six months of the end of each fiscal
year with certified copies of the audit report (para. 3.22).
5.03     Subject to the above conditions, the project would provide a suitable
basis for an IBRD loan of US$13.8 million equivalent to the Sultanate of Oman.

SULTANATE OF OMAN
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Technical Assistance Component
A. INTRODUCTION
The Government of the Sultanate of Oman has concluded a loan
agreement with the World Bank in support of the Third Education Project. The
overall aim of the proposed project is to develop and modernize the school
system, enabling it to prepare Omanis for modern sector employment.  It would
also provide the Ministry of Education and Youth (MOEY) with the capacity to
plan and efficiently manage a rapidly expanding school system.  Specifically,
the project's objectives are to: (i) develop key education services (planning,
management and curriculum development) in the MOEY; (ii) train and upgrade
teachers; and (iii) increase access to education, particularly for children in
rural areas and for girls.
The project would assist in financing technical assistance (TA)
consisting of 105 months of specialist services related to the above
objectives.  The education system in the Sultanate has expanded rapidly from a
small base over the last fifteen years.   The MOEY is continuing its school
construction in parallel with a curriculum development program and the
upgrading of teacher training.  TA would thus operate in a context of a rapid
development of the education system which, however, is constrained by severe
shortages of trained nationals in both the central Ministry and in the
Regional  Directorates  of  Education.   In  particular  specialists  would  be
reqLired to:
(a) collaborate closely with counterpart staff to tackle ongoing problems
and issues facing the Ministry in managing the system, upgrading the
quality  of  education  or  preparing   for   the  Fourth  Five-Year
Development Plan 1991-95, and provide specific products in the form
of training manuals, policy-oriented studies or technical papers,
which would have sustained impact cn the Ministry's capabilities;
(b)  visit   the   country   for   periods   of   time   appropriate   for
familiarization,  in-country  training and follow-up  activities,  and
prepare products at their home country headquarters;
(c)  collaborate  with other  specialists  to provide a mix of skills and
appropriate on-the-job training of Ministry personnel in formal

Pase 2 of 18
training workshops and seminars and informally in daily participative
teamwork.  Training would take place both centrally and in Regional
Directorates and specialists would be expected to take an active part
in their organization.  In this context specialists will collaborate
with  the  Oman-US  Joint  Commission  which  will  provide  foreign
fellowships and some local training for Ministry staff in educational
planning, management, teacher training and curriculum development; and
(d) assist the Ministry in its overall management and monitoring of Bank
projects by preparing initial and mid-term progress reports and final
reports for the special MOEY TA steering committee which reports
directly  to the Under-secretary of Education.   These reports  will
form the basis of joint mid-term and completion reviews with the Bank.
