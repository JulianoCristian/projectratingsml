      Project are to develop and modernize the education system in\n            Oman so that Omanis are better prepared for modern sector\n            employment. In support of this objective, the Ministry of\n            Education and Youth's (MOEY) ability to plan and\n            efficiently manage a rapidly expanding school system will\n            have to be improved. This will be accomplished by developing\n            such key education services in MOEY as planning, management\n            and curriculum development. Attention will also focus on\n            training and upgrading teacher qualifications, and improving\n            access to education for children in rural areas,\n            particularly girls. These mentioned objectives will be\n            addressed by: 1) establishing technical assistance support;\n            2) constructing and equipping three teacher training\n            colleges; and, 3) supporting the construction of 30 primary\n            schools and 5 secondary schools."}, "docdt": "1987-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
