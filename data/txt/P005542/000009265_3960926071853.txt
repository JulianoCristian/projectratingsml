MEMORANDUM AND RECOMIMENDATION OF THE PRESIENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE SULTANATE OF OMAN
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Sultanate of Oman for
US$13.8 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loar would carry a
standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 15 years including 3 years
of grace and would help finance an educational development project.
2.       Background.   Oman's  development  as  a modern  state, based  almost
entirely on oil revenues, began from a very low base only 16 years ago.
Despite progress in the capital city of Muscat, living conditions, and the
educatiornal and health status of the population in rural areas, are still
poor, close to those in low-income countries. Current policy is to diversify
the oil-dependent economy, promote a wider distribution of social services and
encourage human resource development, with the specific goal of replacing
forei6a workers by trained Omanis. A major and critical constraint on Oman's
development is the shortage of skilled labor. The country has a small and
young indigenous population (1.1 million and 45% under 15 years of age in
1984) and a poor educational status (25S of rural children do not go to school
and only a low 12% of the age group go to secondary school). Furthermore, the
adult work force is largely unqualified because the school system dates only
from the early seventies. Because of this, employers are reluctant to hire
Omanis, specifically citing lack of education and poor work habits.
Consequently, Omanis comprise only 40S of the labor force and are concentrated
in the public sector and the traditional economy.  Only 92 of the modern
sector work force is female. With the sharp drop in oil prices in 1986, the
Government was obliged to reduce its investment targets for the Third
Five-Year Development  Plan  1986-90.   During  appraisal,  the  Bank  and  the
Government agreed- on ways to minimize the impact of this austerity program,
establisting priorities for the education sector.   The resulting  i.ivestment
program would expand access to education, upgrade the quality of curricula and
improve their cost-effectiveness.   The proposed project would support  this
endeavor.
3.       Project Objectives.   The proposed project is designed to assist in
the development and modernization of the school system, enabling it to prepare
Omanis for participation in the modern sector labor force. Specifically, it
would: (a) develop key services (planning, management and curriculum) in the
Ministry of Education and Youth; (b) train and upgrade teachers; and (c)
increase access to education, particularly for girls and for children of the
poor in rural areas.



4.       Project    Description.       The   proposed   project   would   assist
institutional development in the Ministry of Education and Youth through
technical assistance and training to: (a) update planning methods and develop
alternative policies for the physical and staffing requirements of general
education; (b) develop a management information s;stem including new budgeting
techniques, cost analysis and projections to enable the Min stry to exercise
better control over costs; (c) introduce a school building maintenance
program; (d) establish an in-service training program for Omani primary
teachers and princ4pals; (e) introduce achievement testing and remedial
instruction to improve student achievement levels and better prepare them for
the next level of instruction; (f) establish a vocational guidance service for
secondary schools to enhance the preparedness of Omani students for entry into
modern sector employment; (g) develop secondary science teaching; and (h)
develop secondary school library services to improve students' language
skills.   The  proposed  project  would assist  in expanding primary  teacher
training capacity in rural areas by constructing and equipping three teacher
training colleges, with provision for boarding to ensure increased access of
females. It would expand access to schooling in rural areas by constructing
and  equipping  30  primary  schools   for  9,000  students  (50% girls)  and  5
secondary  schools,  3 of  them with  boarding  facilities  (307  girls).   The
project, to be implemented over seven and a half years, provides funds for
technical assistance, civil works, furniture and equipment. The total cost of
the project is estimated at US$27.7 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$21.6 million (78%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of IBRD operations in Oman are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively.   A map is attached.   The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6584-OM dated March 30, 1987, is being distributed separately.
5.       Rationale  for  Bank  Involvement.   The  proposed  project  directly
underpins Government priorities for the orderly development of the country's
embryonic education system and supports the education investment program
1986-90 which the Ministry of Education and Youth developed in collaboration
with  the appraisal mission.   Specifically,  the project supports Government
policy with programs to achieve universal primary education by the end of the
century,  to  raise  to  20%  the  proportion  of  the age  group  in secondary
education. to train sufficient Omani teachers to staff rural primary schools
and to improve the quality of primary and. secondary education.   Technical
assistance focuses on strengthening the planning and management capabilities
of   the   Ministry   of   Education   to   deliver   educational   services
cost-effectively.   The  Bank's  involvement  in  the  sector  is  especially
appropriate at this juncture of Oman's development in order to ensure the
sustainability of educational  programs.   In particular,  the  project  would
assist the Government in fostering and maintaining financial discipline in its
investment program and in ensuring that the composition of the investment
program is consonant with priorities for human resources development
supportive of the country's prospective economic growth and its Omanization
policy.

6.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations  the Government  confirmed  its
agreement on  the following actions:  (i)  to make every effort to appoint
trained Omani principals to project primary schools no later than the end of
their first year of operation; and (ii)  to maintain current staffing levels,
with appropriate technical support, in the Ministry of Education and Youth
Departments of Curriculum Development, Educational Planning, Educational
Research, Projects and Teacher Training.
7.       Justification.  The proposed project would enhance the capability of
the Ministry to manage the school system more efficiently and operate new
educational services.  It would also increase the number of qualified Omani
teachers and help upgrade the quality of serving teachers. The project would
provide access to general education for over 9,000 primary and 3,000 secondary
students.   This would help alleviate the acute shortages of well-prepared
graduates from the school system to enter further education, training or the
labor market. In support of the Government's equity objectives, the project
would provide 2,000 places for females at primary level, 850 at secondary and
250 in teacher  training.   It would also provide access to education for
children of the rural poor, 83% of places at primary and secondary level being
provided in rural areas.
8.       Risks.   All  project  components  are  included  in the Ministry of
Education and Youth investment budget under the Third Five Year Plan 1986-90.
The principal risk is that, given the scarcity of qualified Omani staff in the
Ministry, candidates for training through TA would not be made available in a
timely  fashion.    However,   there  is  a  firm  will  to  manage  the  TA
cost-effectively. Staff to be trained have been indentified and the timetable
for training should not prevent Ministry services from operating normally.
Finally, such training would be short, intensive and in-country, facilitating
continuity on the job.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
