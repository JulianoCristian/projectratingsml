                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's renewable energy objective, in line with GEF Operational Program 6, is to remove the barriers to, and reduce the implementation costs of,
                         renewable energy technologies to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The specific priority is CC-3 Power sector regulatory frameworks and policies for
                         grid-based renewable energy.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's renewable energy objective, in line with GEF Operational Program 6, is to remove the barriers to, and reduce the implementation costs of,
                         renewable energy technologies to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The specific priority is Power sector regulatory frameworks and policies
                         for grid-based renewable energy, which has progressed well. The implementation especially Matching and Performance Grants have also progressed
                         and the first projects will be supported. Since South African clean energy environment is changing rapidly, the Project will proactively review areas to be most
                         relevant and proactive in light of the development objectives of the operation.
