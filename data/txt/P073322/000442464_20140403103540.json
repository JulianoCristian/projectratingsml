were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to global\n            environment outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: well-targeted technical\n            assistance (TA) activities, although time consuming, can\n            support the enabling conditions for scale-up of RE markets.\n            Well-designed pre-financing and financing mechanisms for RE\n            projects are key elements of scale-up of RE investments.\n            South Africa combined elements of both feed-in-tariffs and\n            competitive tendering in the implementation of the Renewable\n            Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program\n            (REIPPPP), creating a replicable model of RE development for\n            other countries. Flexible project design allows clients to\n            move quickly to adjust to changing global market conditions.\n            Effective project implementation seeks to harmonize with the\n            country's broader and urgent goals. Creating dedicated\n            in-house project management capacity by locating the\n            implementation support unit (ISU) at the department of\n            energy (DoE) can have been considered as an option.\n            Attracting and retaining qualified personnel on the basis of\n            fixed-term employment contracts can be a challenge for\n            project implementation. The engaged and flexible approach\n            demonstrated by the ISU, the DoE, and the World Bank during\n            implementation was critical in maintaining the\n            project's relevance during a period of considerable\n            policy change. Reducing turnaround time for procurement of\n            consultants will have helped the project become even more\n            responsive in a fast-moving policy and regulatory\n            environment. Engaging small RE enterprises to participate in\n            the REMT matching grants (MG) program is a time-and\n            resource-intensive activity and requires a significant level\n            of ISU support. Successful projects require close oversight\n            and engaged supervision with sufficient budgets."}, "docdt": "2014-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
