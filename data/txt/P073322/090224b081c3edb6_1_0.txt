                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The renewable energy objective of the REMT Project, in line with GEF Operational Program 6, is to remove the barriers, and to reduce the implementation costs of renewable energy
                         technologies to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

                         REMT has provided significant inputs to policy and regulatory guidance issued by the Government of Republic of South Africa on renewable energy, including the review of the initial
                         Renewable energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) procurement and related standardized power purchase agreement (PPA), socio-economic study related to the implementation of the

                         valuable inputs to the IRP process and the Independent Systems Market Operating Bill. These have provided the policy and regulatory framework which have helped implement the

                         REMT continues to support DoE and the Government in implementing the Renewable Energy IPP procurement program, which has made a strong start toward procuring over 3,625
                         MW of renewable energy capacity, with strong response, especially in the category of Concentrated Solar Projects (CSP) and Wind. In parallel, Solar Water Heating initiatives
                         implemented in South Africa have so far resulted in over over 50,000 high pressure and over 200,000 low pressure installations supported by Eskom and DoE, which have reduced
                         approximately 60 MW of peak demand and about 323 GWh of annual energy reduction, resulting in an outcome of annual GHG emissions reductions of over 300,000 tonnes from the
                         SWH component alone.

                         The REMT project has completed five rounds of Matching Grant selection in order to support feasibility and pre-feasibility studies of renewable energy projects, including solar, wind
                         and biomass as well as solar water heating (SWH). Contracting for Round Five of the Matching Grants program is in the final stage of process of finalizing contractual obligations in
                         May 2013. The project encountered some challenges, notably internal restructuring at the DBSA, and the departure of the experienced project coordinator, which resulted in the
                         delay of certain activities. The matter has since been addressed by the DBSA appointing a Program Manager and an Energy Specialist to ensure continued service by the ISU. With
                         the conclusion of the Round Five matching grants, the REMT MG contractual commitments now stand at approximately ZAR 19.6 million.

                         Recognizing the value that REMT has been bringing to the renewable energy development in South Africa, the Department of Energy of South Africa (DoE) has contributed ZAR 7.4
                         million as co-financing to the REMT project, which has created a level of continuity and sustainability for the Project.

                         A series of workshops in renewable energy, such as SWH and Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) have been organized, and the REMT website has been established as a renewable
                         energy resource information dissemination platform.
