                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's renewable energy objective, in line with GEF Operational Program 6, is to remove the barriers to, and reduce the implementation costs of,
                         renewable energy technologies to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The specific priority is CC-3 Power sector regulatory frameworks and policies for
                         grid-based renewable energy.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A major priority, which has progressed well, is to help put into place power sector regulatory frameworks and policies for grid-based renewable energy. In particular, REMT Project
                         has provided significant inputs to policy and regulatory guidance issued by the Government of Republic of South Africa on renewable energy, including the review of the initial
                         Renewable energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) procurement and related standardized power purchase agreement (PPA), as well as the development of the National Solar Water Heating
                         Framework (NSWHF) and draft Renewable Energy White Paper (REWP).

                         Moreover, the implementation of Matching Grants and Performance Grants has also progressed well. The Program has launched three rounds Matching Grants Selection and has
                         been supporting feasibility and pre-feasibility study of renewable energy projects, including solar, wind, solar water heating (SWH), and biomass energy.

                         Lastly, a series of workshops in renewable energy, such as SWH and Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) have been organized, and the REMT website was well established as an

                         A Mid-Term Review was conducted in May 2011, based on the achievement of the REMT project and taking into account significant changes that have taken place in the South
                         African and international renewable energy sectors since the REMT project'➂ s inception. It concluded that the REMT should (i) provide ➂ real time support and advice to the
                         Government under Project Development Objective 1 (PDO 1); and (ii) consolidate and accelerate Performance and Matching Grant Programs under PDO 2.
