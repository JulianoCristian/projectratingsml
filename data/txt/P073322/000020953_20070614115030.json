The project global environmental objective, in\n            line with GEF Operational Program No. 6, is to remove\n            barriers to renewable energy technologies to help mitigate\n            greenhouse gas emissions. The project has 2 components: 1)\n            Renewables-based power generation in South Africa: For\n            renewable energy power generation, the project will assist\n            South Africa in strengthening the organizations and\n            institutions that would help the government meet its\n            renewable energy target. The capacity areas include\n            development of legal and policy frameworks, promotion,\n            regulation, and service provision of renewable energy power\n            generation; and 2) Commercial Solar Water Heating (CSWH) is\n            an integral component of South Africa's renewable\n            energy policy framework. However, it is important to\n            recognize that solar water heating is a substitute for all\n            types of power generation, whereas renewable energy power\n            generation is a substitute for fossil fuel power generation.\n            As a result, solar water heating transactions are not linked\n            to transmitting power over the main power grid, and there is\n            no need to involve the grid operator (Eskom) in promoting\n            this resource."}, "docdt": "2007-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
