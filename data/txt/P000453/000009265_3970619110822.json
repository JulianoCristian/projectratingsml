is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Education Rehabilitation and\n            Development Project in the Central African Republic. The\n            project had two specific objectives: (a) to improve the\n            quality of primary and higher education; (b) to strengthen\n            the capacity for managing the education system at the level\n            of the Ministry of National Education, Scientific Research\n            and Technology (MENRST) and the University of Bangui.\n            Project implementation was satisfactory overall, and was\n            virtually finished by the closing date of the credit. Bank\n            supervision of implementation was regular and effective. The\n            Borrower's participation was effective during project\n            preparation, and particularly satisfactory during\n            implementation, given the lack of changes in the Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) team, which was well trained and had\n            access to good technical assistance. Some of the lessons\n            learned included: 1) Implementation of a complex project\n            over a long period in a context of social instability can be\n            satisfactory, particularly as regards the physical\n            components, if there is a stable local team well-versed in\n            procurement procedures and regularly supervised by the Bank;\n            2) Achieving objectives that depend on structural reform and\n            the upgrading of professional skills may be more difficult,\n            but the progress made -- even if only partial -- can serve\n            as a foundation for future sector work; and 3) The entire\n            institutional strengthening aspect should be rethought,\n            since the approach selected has not produced the intended results."}, "docdt": "1997-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
