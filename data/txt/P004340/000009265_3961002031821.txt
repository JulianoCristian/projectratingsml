MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE MONGOLIAN PEOPLE' S REPUBLIC
FOR AN ECONOMIC REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed development credit to Mongolia for SDR 22.2 million
($30.0 million equivalent), on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, to
help finence an economic rehabilitation project. A Staff Appraisal Report
(Report No. 10078-MON) is being circulated to the Executive Directors sepa-
rately. Economic indicators and a map (IBRD 23405) are attached.
2.        MongolJJ  4-ined the Bank Group (IBRD, IDA and IFC) on February 14,
1991. An economic mission visited Mongolia in June/July 1991 and its report
"Mongolia-Towards a Market Economy" (Report No. 10108-MON) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors.
PART I: COUNTRY POLICIES AND BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
3.        Background.  Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1924,
Mongolia'3 political structure and economic development have been shaped
largely by its close relations with the USSR. This resulted in the country's
transition from a peasant feudal agrarian society with strong religious and
cultural tradit ons to a centrally-planned command economy. Owing partly to
these circumstances and partly to its geography, Mongolia remained almost
completely isolated from the international community for most of this period,
although it became a member of the United Nations in 1961 and has participated
in the activities of several specialized agencies since then (including UNDP,
WHO, FAO, IAEA, UNIDO and UWFPA).  In early 1990, the pace of political and
economic reforms initiated during the second half of the 1980s quickened dra-
matically, leading, after Mongolia's first multi-party elections in July 1990,
to the formation of a reformist, coalition government that decided to "con-
struct a market-oriented economy."
4.        At the same time, the adverse impact of external factors on its
economy is significantly irfluencing the dynamics of the reform process now
underway in Mongolia. Per capita income, estimated at around $500 in 1990,
may have fallen 20 percent as a result of these external shocks. Production
and output have fallen owing to power outages and shortages of spare parts and
new materials. Unemployment in Ulaanbaatar, the capital, may reach 25 percent
by year-end. These impacts and the abrupt termination of new aid from, and
drastically reduced trade with, the USSR and its former CMEA partners have
reinforced the new government's intention to proceed with comprehensive
economic reforms as quickly as possible. Although detailed plans are still
being worked out, the authorities hope to introduce the principal measures
over the next three years. These include the return of state livestock herds
to individual groups, privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
accounting for 70 percent of state assets with the partial sale or lease and,
eventually, the promotion of private sector equity (including foreign joint
venture) participation in others. Laws to protect enterprise ownership rights
and their transfer are being drafted. More broadly, a phased program of price
adjustments was introduced in January 1991; the governmental bureaucracy is
being streamlined; tax reforms are under way; and financial sector reforms,



including the separation of comercial and central banking functions, the
introduction of independent bank supervision, and the use of indirect monetary
policy instruments, are being formulated.
5.        Stabilization. Ad1ustment and Rtefom.  There is little doubt about
the authorities' commitment to reform. Indeed, they seem determined to move
ahead on all fronts at once, although the immediate actions required to stabi-
lize the economy suggest that a more measured pace would be more appropriate.
Recent progress on some key components of the reform program, particularly the
privatization of SOEs and other state assets, has been somewhat uneven. More
attention will need to be paid to the sequencing of different reforms, their
coherence and internal consistency, and measures to evaluate their effective-
ness. An early priority is the need for further price reform and the deregu-
lation of internal trade and markets to underpin the privatization process and
to stimulate small-scale private enterprise and foreign investment. To
develop the institutional framework for a market-based economy, Mongolia will
need a cohort of administrators trained in the methods of indirect macroeco-
nomic management, financial market development and the creation of an enabling
legal framework. At the same time as promoting privatization, the government
must also redefine its role and activities to bring them more in line with the
needs of a market-based economy. While all production-oriented SOEs should be
privatized at an early date, the government will need to ensure that remaining
SOEs (e.g., public utilities) are managed efficiently under appropriate
regulatory and pricing policies. The government's principal responsibility
should be to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to growth
for different economic agents, one in which they can compete on an equal
footing. Restrictions and regulations that distort resource allocation and
private sector initiatives need to be removed. These include: subsidies,
state orders, foreign exchange allocation, and remaining price controls. Free
entry Pad exit of enterprises, anti-monopoly measures and consumer protection,
and appropriate pricing policy for natural monopolies, also need to be
considered. A social safety net that takes into account not only the short-
term effects of adjustment, but also the pension, health and social welfare
needs of a market economy, needs to be further developed.
6.     Environmental. Social and Human Resources Issues.  In its paper
recently prepared for the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development,
the government has affirmed its commitment to alleviating the adverse
environmental effects caused by economic development activities. Areas
identified for action include protecting and restoring steppe pastureland,
reducing urban air pollution, protecting the water supply, and promoting a
balanced use of natural resources. The cessation of external financing from
the Soviet Union and the difficulties associated with the transition to a
market-based economy have resulted in a drop in living standards and rising
unemployment. Privatization is likely to increase unemployment further as
loss-making enterprises close down. The government plans to replace general
subsidies with targeted schemes for thGz!' most vulnerable, and to introduce
cost recovery for health and education services (with special provisions for
those unable to pay).
7.        External Economic Relations.  Diversification of Mongolia's external
economic relations is one of the government's stated priorities and is an
increasingly important practical issue. Recent economic and political uncer-
tainties in the Soviet Union have underlined the need to secure alternative
trade and development partners in the short- and medium-term. Mongolia's



- 3 -
geography dictates that trade with the Republics of the Soviet Union, pa-ticu-
larly Russia, is likely to continue to be significant. Its other large neigh-
bor, China, may also become an increasingly imrortant source of essential
imports and a convenient export market. Mongolia's creditworthlness for com-
mercial borrowing has not yet been established, in the absence of a track
record. For the foreseeable future, it will therefore rely on the interna-
tional financial institutions for most of its external capital requirements.
With an appropriate policy framework and enabling institutions, direct foreign
investment could also play an important role in providing capital, as well as
in transferring technology and skills. Almost all of Mongolia's existing
external debt is with the Soviet Union, denominated in transferable rubles.
The servicing and repayment of this debt are being discussed with the Soviet
Union, which has agreed that resolution of these issues should not hamper
Mongolia's development.
8.        Aid Coordination and Relations with Donors.  As the seriousness of
Mongolia's short-term economic situation bAcame clear during 1990, IMF staff
played a key role in helping the authorities analyze the situation. A Stand-
By Agreement was approved on October 4, 1991. Contacts with the World Bank
began in late 1990. A first economic mission took place in June 1991, and the
World Bank and Japan co-chaired a Mongolia Assistance Group meeting on
September 5 and 6, 1991 in Tokyo. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
collaborated in IDA's initial economic work. ADB held discussions in June
1991 on a three-year program of proposed projects as well as grant technical
assistance for project-related studies supporting lending program development.
UNDP has moved to refocus its program to provide support in a wide number of
areas. These include advice from the other UN Specialized Agencies; provision
of UN Volunteers; English training; and practical advice, coaching and
training for skills needed quickly for the reforms. UNDP-financed consultants
have examined the social dimensions of adjustment and helped prepare for a
donor meeting in Ulaanbaatar in October 1991 and for the 1992 UN Conference on
Environment and Development. Bilateral donors, notably China, Denmark,
Germany, Japan, Korea and the United States, have already provided significant
financial and technical assistance and have begun to formulate aid programs.
The opening up to the foreign private sector has also been rapid, with signif-
icant investigation by commercial interests inter alia in telecommunications,
mining, oil exploration, tourism, consulting and trade. UN, American and
British volunteers are in the country mainly to teach English, while NGOs from
the United States and Sweden working through indigenous organizations have
begun to explore the support they might offer to small businesses, rural pro-
ducers and disadvantaged groups.
9.        Country Assistance StrateRg.  The Bank Group's overall strategy in
Mongolia is to support and assist the country's transition from a centrally-
planned to a market-based economy. After over 60 years of detachment from the
world economic community, Mongolia needs early access to the development expe-
rience of its East and South Asian neighbors, to the external capital (includ-
ing direct foreign investment) potentially available from the OECD countries
and, not least important, to new markets for its limited range of exports.
This process has rapidly gained momentum during the last year and Mongolia has
already begun to receive modest amounts of financial and technical assistance
from a growing number of multi- and bilateral sources.
10.       With Mongolia now at the initial stage of a process of comprehensive
and fundamental policy change, the Bank Group's country assistance strategy is



- 4 -
similarly at an early stage. In general, the Association expects to play an
Important role in facilitating the reforms needed to lay a solid foundation
for sustainable development and a successful transition to a market-based
economy, well-integrated into the world economic, financial and trading Sys-
tem. Mongolia's low per capita income, unestablished commercial creditworthi-
ness and reform-oriented economic and social development goals make it eligi-
ble for IDA borrowing. The first year of the relationship has been character-
iztd by: a familiarization process on both sides; informal, but intensive
working relationships with the highest levels of the government and its core
agencies; and, unusually close coltalF,ration with UNDP, other IFIs (IMF, ADB)
and several bilaterals (particularly, Germany, Japan and the United States).
Compared to most other new members, there is sparse documentation on Mongolia
from western sources. The Mongolians need--and want--to become familiar with
the Bank Group's functions and procedures, a process made diff-.cult by
Mongolia's relative isolation. Given the country's almost complete lack of
contact with and experience in ra.mning a market-oriented economy, IDA and IMP
staff, working together, have devoted considerable effort to responding to
requests for information and advice from Mongolia's political leaders and
civil servants responsible for economic management.
11.       Given its limited resources, the Bank Group will seek to focus its
activities selectively in those areas where its interventions are likely to
provide maximum benefit, either directly or in concert with others. Basic
infrastructure--transport, energy, agriculture and mineral resource develop-
ment--appear to be sectors of obvious priority, once the necessary analytical
work has been done. In the short-term, however, IDA's efforts have been con-
centrated on three priority tasks: to prepare a technical assistance project
(to be considered simultaneously with the proposed project) designed to help
strengthen the key government agencies responsible for macroeconomic
management and reform, and to finance sector surveys and feasibility studies;
to prepare the present project which, together with the IMF program, an ADB
special program loan and bilateral grant assistance, will support the
government's short-term economic rehabilitation and stabilization efforts and
thereby help to sustain its economic reform program; and, through its economic
and other operational work, to help Mongolia mobilize and, in concert with
ADB, IMF and UNDP, coordinate official development aid from potential donors.
Mongolia's size and relative inexperience with international donor agency
policies and procedures imply that coordination of financial and technical
assistance will be particularly important in the immediate future. Given the
authorities' strong emphasis on the role of the private sector and the need to
stimulate private investment, IFC has already visited Mongolia and identified
several possible investments. FIAS is also expected to advise the authorities
on measures to improve the climate and legal framework for direct foreign
investment.
12.       The economic and sector work proRram will complement efforts by ADB,
IMF and by other donors to deepen understanding of macro and sectoral issues
and enrich the policy dialogue. For example, the proposed Technical Assis-
tance Project allocates about $2 million to fund several sectoral studies.
These include reviews for mining and mineral development during 1992, and
later for education, livestock, external transport links and health. In addi-
tion, short reform-oriented studies to be undertaken largely by government
during 1992 will underpin the next phases of reform and, should it be feasi-
ble, a first adjustment lending operation. In addition to the analytical and
information role of ESW, technical assistance, institutional development and



capacity-building to run a market-based economy are high priorities. Given
the interest of bilateral donors and ADB already emerging in this area, and
the fact that for many donors Mongolia may be a country more suitable for
technical assistance than for project leading, the need for future IDA proj-
ects in this particular area is likely to be quite small. It will be
important, however, to ensure that the donors are .ware of each other's
activities so as to avoid duplication and promote complementarity, a role
perhaps most appropriate for UNDP.
PART II: THE PROJECT
13.       Project Obiectives and Description.  The project's principal objec-
tive is to help rehabilitate, maintain and operate priority sectors of
Mongolia's economy. Together with complementary assistance already committed
or planned by other donors (Germany, Japan, USA, ADB, IMF), it constitutes
part of an immediate response by the international community to the country's
short-term economic difficulties. The project would finance equipment, mate-
rials, spare parts, vehici_s and other inputs needed for the key agriculture,
energy (electric power, coal mining and petroleum products), and transport
sectors, to help sustain economic performance and output.
14.       The sectors identified and the specific items to be financed were
selected on the basis of an overall assessment of critical import require-
ments, estimated at about $500 millior. in 1991 and up to $600 million in 1992,
and of potential sources of supply, including the increasing likelihood that
the 1991 $400 million USSR/Mongolia barter trade agreement (accounting for
80 percent of import needs) may not in practice be fully realized. This
assessment, undertaken by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in August
1991 with IDA assistance, was developed taking into account inter alia the
following broad criteriat (a) the economy's structure and sectoral priori-
ties; (b) the country's need gradually to reduce its absolute dependence on
one country (the USSR) for certain essential products and commodities and, at
the same time, begin the process of diversifying its external trade; (c) the
need for quick action in a few particularly vulnerable areas of the economy
and, related to this, the desirability of committing the external aid already
available (from Japan and the United States) to the most urgent (1991/92)
priorities; and (d) the transport and other logistical constraints imposed by
Mongolia's remote, land-locked location.
15.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Against this background and given
the importance of the reform measures already undertaken and underway, the
rationale for IDA involvetaent is threefold. First, the proposed project,
*        together with the IMP program and ADB program loan, would support the govern-
ment's short-term stabilization efforts and thereby help assure the sustain-
ability of its economic reform program. Second, this package of coordinated
ADB, IDA and IMP assistance would help arrest a further deterioration in the
country's economic and social infrastructure. Third, IDA's involvement has
already included helping the goverrnent establish clear criteria for determin-
ing and justifying critical import needs and is expected to catalyze the com-
mitment of additional assistatnce by other donors over the coming months.
16.       Project Cost and Financing.  The project's estimated total cost,
including import duties and taxes and local handling costs, is $37.95 million
equivalent, of which $30 million would be in foreign exchange (Schedule A).
The costs of procurement advisory and support services ($300,000) are based on



- 6 -
typical current costs for such assignments. Contingencies of $5.3 million
(20 percent) have been included in view of the uncertainty of cost estimates,
which are based on Mongolia's very limited experience with international pro-
curement, recent experience -In nearby ALian countries and historical costs of
contracts with USSR suppliers based on barter trade. In the event of substan-
tial cost overruns and given the nature of the project, quantities would be
reduced correspondingly. The proposed credit would finance the project's full
foreign exchange cost. All local costs of storage, handling and transport,
and custotas duties of 25 percent of the DAP price, would be borne by the end-
users.
17.       Proiect Implementation.  Tile Ministry of Trade and Industry's (MTI)
Foreign Trade Department (FTM) would be responsible for day-to-day administra-
tion, coordination and management of the project. A four-person project unit
has been established in FTD. The staff of the unit would be assisted by an
internatioi'ally recruited procurement advisor. The project is expected to be
completed by December 31, 1992. The Closing Data is June 30, 1993. Schedule
C lists key project processing events.
18.       Procurement.  Except for specified items to be procured from the
USSR, all project-financed goods and related services would be purchased in
accordance with IDA Procurement Guidelines. Related items have been grouped
into ten bid packages, to be purchased by international competitive bidding
(ICB). ICB contracts (net of transport and taxes) are expected to amount to
$17.7 million equivalent, or approximately 60 percent of the credit, plus the
cost of transport to Mongolia. About $300,000 of goods would be obtained
through international shopping, and $400,000 of proprietary items would be
purchased in IDA member countries directly from original suppliers. The goods
are readily available, stock, off-the-shelf or commodity items. Mongolia's
unique landlocked location, the very high proportion (over 90 percent) of its
external trade with the USSR, and its technological dependency on the USSR for
virtually all goods, make direct contracting from the original suppliers and
vendors in the USSR the most efficient procurement method for bitumen and
certain limited categories of urgently needed spare parts of a specialized and
proprietary nature. MTI would negotiate direct purchase contracts in a
standard format, acceptable to IDA, for these goods. The value of goods to be
procured in the USSR, including transport costs to the USSR/Mongolia border is
presently estimated at $6.0 million. Based on information provided to the
appraisal mission, procurement from the Soviet Union appears, under the
current circumstances, to be feasible. Contracts acceptable to IDA for
procurement advisory and support services, international courier and, as
required, external audit would be financed under a separate consultants
category of the credit. All contracts would be subject to prior review by the
Association. Up to $3 million of expenditures made after October 23, 1991,
would be eligible for retroactive financing to allow urgent procurement
actions after completion of appraisal but prior to credit effectiveness to
proceed without delay. Schedule B summarizes procurement and disbursement
arrangements.
19.       Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, agreements were reached on:  pro-
cedures for International Competitive Bidding according to a procurement plan
and timetable satisfactory to IDA; appointment of a firm to provide procure-
ment advisory and support services, under agreed terms of reference;
maintenance of the firm-supplied Procurement Advisor and MTI's key project
staff (already appointed and in place) urt4l project completion; and MTI col-



lecting from end-users tugrik payments for the imports, applicable duties and
handling charges. It was agreed that in Mongolia's special cir^umstances,
with the uncertainty of the cost estimates and as a one-time exception to the
World Bank's Procurement Guidelines, financing of up to $7.5 million of
bitumen and spare parts of a specialized and Proprietary nature parchased
directly from the USSR would be permitted. The authorities also agreed to
exchange views from time to time during project supervision on Mongolia's
economic reforr program and medium-term development. To facilitate dis..ussion
of issues of patticular importance for the medium-term reform and adjustment
of the economy (includinS energy policy, coal pricing, petroleum demand and
supply, agricultural supply and distribution, and external trade and export
promotion), the government agencies concerned would undertake modest studies
of these topics, which form part of the proposed Technical Assistance Project.
These studies, and a priv.te sector assessment to be financed under the
proposed project, will be undertaken during 1992.
20.       Benefits.  The proposed project will support three key sectors whose
output performance has declined seriously during the last 21 months owing to
lack of foreign exchange for the purchase of spare and replacement parts.
Financing critical imports for agriculture, energy, and transport will
increase and maintain capacity utilization and hence increase production dur-
ing the next 12 to 18 months. The aggregate output effects attributable to
the project are expected to be considerable. Moreover, given the backward and
forward linkages of the three sectors to the rest of the economy, economy-wiie
effects of the project will e-lso be substantial. Longer-term project effects
and bAnefits will depend upon continuing economic reforms, which IDA plans to
support through an adjustment operation in the near future.
Zi.       Private Sector. Social and Environmental Impact.  The private sector
will benefit indirectly through improved availability of elect?'.city and heat,
transport services (including urban transport) and food (grain, vegetables and
meat). Complementary to activities other donors are planning (USAID and
Germany, in particular), consultant funding under the project will be used to
undertake a modest, reform-oriented study of how best to assist micro-, small
and medium enterprises, and to prepare private sector development activities
suitable for external financing.
22.       The project is not expected to have any negative environmental
impact, since it does not involve capacity expansion or untested technologies
in the selected sectors and avoids industrial activities whose economic, tech-
nical and financial viability remain to be confirmed under market conditions.
Other donors are now studying improvements to existing power plants that would
reduce air pollution once the installations are retrofitted or replaced.
23.       Risks.  The main risks to the project are that procurement problems
and transport bottlenecks could seriously delay or prevent the delivery of the
critical imports. The procurement plan and timetable was designed to mitigate
these risks, and the project will receive frequent supervision by IDA missions
staffed with procurement expertise. Special attention was paid to simplifying
specifications so that off-the-shelf and stock items would be procured (i.e.,
no goods requiring custom manufacturing). Because of the authorities' inex-
perience with international procurement, the project would finance procurement
advisory and support services, which are in place. Transportation of spare
parts and other equipment from Tianjin, China, may pose a problem (despite new
transport and forwarding arrangements that have been implemented for



- 8 -
Mongolia's trade through China) given the volume of containerized freight that
will be arriving, financed by IDA, Japan and the Asian Development Bank. The
procurement monitoring system includes monitoring of physical location of all
shipments. The terms of reference for the procurement advisor include special
attention to these transport and logistics issues and the need for close coor-
dination with suppliers and transport organizations in both China and
Mongolia, particularly et the border transshipment point.  Changes of key MTI
personnel responsible for the project would pose a risk to the procurement and
management process; accordingly, the government has agreed to maintain the
staff in place during project implementation.
24.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would com-
ply with the .Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Isecutive Directors approve it.
