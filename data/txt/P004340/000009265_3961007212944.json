Mongolia experienced enormous supply\n            shocks in 1991 due to the disruption in the flow of imports\n            and the collapse of traditional export markets in the former\n            Soviet Union and Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.\n            Exceptional arrangements were made for procurement and\n            disbursement given Mongolia's high proportion of trade\n            with the Commonwealth of Independent States. The project\n            successfully supplied urgently needed inputs and contributed\n            to the diversification of Mongolia's trade. Moreover,\n            the quality of inputs from nontraditional suppliers was\n            considerably improved. This had an important demonstration\n            effect in the sectors concerned. The project proceeded on\n            schedule throughout the early stages of the cycle, but\n            procurement delays required extension of the closing date to\n            June 30, 1994. Communication and cooperation between the\n            Borrower and IDA were satisfactory, as was Borrower\n            compliance with credit covenants. Four main lessons emerged\n            from this project. First, rapid disbursement is greatly\n            facilitated by a well-prepared procurement timetable and\n            monitoring system and the appointment of procurement\n            advisors prior to negotiations and Board preparation.\n            Second, a project of this type can have valuable long-term\n            benefits if attention is paid in design and implementation\n            to developing the Borrower's institutional capacity.\n            Third, emergency assistance of this nature is most effective\n            when combined with donor coordination to address broader\n            macroeconomic and sectorial concerns. Fourth, the objectives\n            of counterpart fund management and emergency assistance are\n            difficult to reconcile in transitional economies where\n            ability to pay is constrained by adjustment processes."}, "docdt": "1994-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
