infrastructure and\n            capacity for assessment administration, analysis and report\n            writing, and to increase stakeholder knowledge and\n            acceptance of assessment. There are three components to the\n            project: 1) Capacity building would be the main component,\n            where the execution of an assessment is unusually technical\n            in nature. Any one of a number of small mistakes can cause\n            serious delays in implementation and, in the worst case,\n            lead to meaningless findings. Therefore, a high-level\n            technical assistance, including the services o f a senior\n            Technical Advisor, would be required to monitor and assist\n            in all aspects of both central and provincial operations. 2)\n            Pilot experiments will be required to determine what will\n            produce the desired, valid results, and what process is most\n            implemented. 3) Information dissemination. Through this\n            component, the project will facilitate information\n            dissemination about assessment to stakeholders in advance of\n            the actual assessment to explain its purpose and to provide\n            insight and reassurance about its intended uses."}, "docdt": "2003-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
