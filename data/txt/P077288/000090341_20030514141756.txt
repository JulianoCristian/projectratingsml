Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
development objectives 
of 
the 
National 
Education 
Assessment 
System 
(NEAS) 
are: 
to 
design 
and 
administer 
assessment 
mechanisms; 
to 
establish 
administrative infrastructure and capacity 
for 
assessment 
administration, 
analysis 
and report 
writing; 
and 
to 
increase stakeholder 
knowledge and 
acceptance 
of 
assessment 
objectives 
and 
procedures. 
Under 
those 
broad 
objectives, 
specific 
objectives 
of 
the 
assessment 
system 
to 
be 
piloted 
include 
development 
of 
an 
empirical 
understanding 
of 
the 
following:

e 
how 
well 
the 
curricula 
are 
being 
translated 
into 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
among 
students; 
subject, geographic 
and 
gender-related 
areas 
of 
inequity 
in 
student 
performance; 
the 
principal 
determinants 
of 
student 
performance 
including 
teacher, 
student 
background 
and 
other 
causal variables; 
how 
resource 
allocation 
(fiscal, 
material and 
human) 
might 
be 
redirected 
to 
improve 
student 
performance; 
how 
to 
assist teachers 
to 
use 
data 
to 
improve 
student 
performance; 
and 
how 
to 
create 
a 
sustainable 
capacity 
to 
conduct 
quality 
surveys 
of 
student 
learning 
and 
to 
apply 
findings 
to 
policy 
formation. 
The 
NEAS 
is 
planned 
as 
a 
sample-based 
national 
assessment, 
to 
be 
conducted at 
grade 
4 
and 
grade 
8 
levels, 
in 
four 
subjects 
- 
Language, 
Mathematics, 
Science 
and 
Social StudiesIIslamiyatlLife 
Skills. 
This 
project 
will 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
designing and 
pilot 
testing 
the 
administrative 
process, 
the 
measurement 
instruments 
and 
the 
information 
dissemination 
strategy 
associated 
with 
assessment 
of 
learning 
outcomes. 
In 
addition, 
this 
project 
should 
enable 
the 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
(GoP), 
Provinces/Areas 
to 
make 
assessment 
a permanent 
feature 
of 
the 
education 
system 
in 
the 
country. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Performance 
of 
the 
project 
during

teaching and 
resource 
allocation. 
B. 
Strategic Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
(CAS) 
goal 
supported 
by 
the project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
24399-PAK 
Date 
of 
latest CAS discussion: 
06/24/2002 
The 
Bank's 
assistance strategy 
remains focused 
on 
helping 
reduce 
poverty 
in 
Pakistan 
by 
investing 
in 
people 
and 
promoting 
sustainable 
economic 
growth. 
Supporting pro-poor and 
pro-gender 
equity policies 
is 
among 
the 
CAS 
program priorities. 
Under 
this 
priority, 
the 
CAS 
states 
that 
"Bank 
support 
will 
focus 
on 
those 
-3- 
Page  10
interventions 
in 
the education 
sector 
that 
would 
help 
the 
goal 
of 
achieving universal 
primary 
education, 
with 
particular 
focus 
on 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
provided, and 
giving priority 
to 
the 
poor 
and 
disadvantaged, 
particularly 
girls 
and children 
in 
rural 
areas.” 
Among 
the 
principal 
indicators 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
services 
delivered 
are 
what 
students 
are 
learning 
and 
how 
well 
they 
are 
able 
to 
apply 
the 
skills 
acquired through 
learning. 
Credible 
evidence 
of 
outcomes 
and 
their 
determinants 
is 
needed 
to 
maximize 
the 
impact 
of 
investments 
in 
education.  Therefore, 
under 
Education 
Reforms, 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
National 
Education 
Assessment 
System 
(NEAS) 
is 
one 
of 
the 
five 
areas 
of 
Bank 
support 
for 
its 
FY03-FY05 
program. 
The 
NEAS 
is 
a 
priority 
program 
under 
the 
MoE’s 
Education 
Sector 
Reform 
(ESR 
2001-2005) 
Action 
Plan. 
One 
of 
the 
specific 
priorities 
in 
that 
Plan 
is 
to 
”build 
assessment 
capacity 
at 
the 
school, 
provincial 
and 
federal 
levels 
to 
better 
measure 
learning 
outcomes, 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
program 
interventions”. 
NEAS 
would 
also 
develop 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
(MoE) 
Curriculum 
Wing 
(CW) 
as 
well 
as 
the 
provinceslareas 
to 
monitor 
the 
standards 
of 
education 
in 
the 
country, a 
responsibility 
for which 
the 
CW 
holds 
a 
legal 
mandate. 
The project 
will 
support 
the 
establishment, 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
Pakistan, 
of 
a 
national 
and 
cross-provincial 
baseline 
of 
student 
achievement 
as 
measured against 
the 
national 
curricula. 
Conducting 
the 
national 
assessment 
would 
make available 
credible 
data 
to 
provide 
feedback 
to 
the 
education 
system 
for 
resource 
allocation, 
policy 
formulation, improvement 
of 
curriculum, textbook 
and materials 
development, 
and 
teaching, 
supervisory 
and 
management practices, 
all 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
enhancing 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
at 
the 
elementary 
level. 
Tangible 
evidence 
of 
student 
learning may 
help 
to 
restore 
public 
confidence 
in 
the 
education 
system 
and, 
as 
a 
result, 
help 
increase 
access 
as 
well. 
The 
national 
objectives 
of 
economic 
development and 
improved quality 
of 
higher 
education, 
particularly 
in 
the 
area 
of 
science 
and technology, 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
achieve 
without 
a 
human 
resource 
base 
of 
individuals who 
have mastery 
of 
basic 
literacy 
and numeracy 
skills 
for 
accessing 
information 
for 
life-long 
learning. 
The 
new 
assessment 
system 
will 
provide 
credible 
evidence 
of 
how 
schools 
are 
performing 
to 
local 
officials 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
to 
enable 
them to 
identify 
areas 
of 
weaknesses 
and 
thereafter 
influence 
the 
elementary 
education 
process. 
The 
heavy 
emphasis 
on 
capacity 
building 
in 
the 
project 
(TA 
and 
Training) 
will 
help 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
assessment 
system 
is 
both 
well 
institutionalized 
and 
sustainable 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project, 
and 
by 
improving 
technical 
services, 
indirectly 
enhancing 
the 
monitoring 
of 
investments 
in 
basic 
education. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
As 
a signatory 
to 
key 
international 
Declarations and Frameworks 
(Jomtien,  1990; 
Dakar, 
2000), 
the 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
(GoP) 
is 
committed 
to 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
at 
all 
levels, 
and 
especially 
at the elementary 
stage. 
The 
Jomtien 
Declaration 
underlines 
the 
need 
for 
ensuring 
that: “The focus 
of 
basic 
education 
must 
be 
on 
actual 
learning 
acquisition and 
outcome, 
rather than 
exclusively upon 
enrolment” 
(UNESCO, 
1990). 
In 
the 
EFA 
Assessment 
2000 
document, student 
achievement 
scores 
are 
included 
as 
Indicator 
No.15. 
The 
government’s 
education 
policies 
(1992,  1998-2010) 
and 
the 
recently formulated 
Education 
Sector 
Reforms 
(ESR) 
Action 
Plan 
(200 
1-05) 
recognize 
the 
interdependence 
of 
quality 
and quantity 
in 
education 
as 
an 
important contributory 
factor 
in 
national 
development. 
The 
National 
Education 
Assessment 
System 
(NEAS) 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
programs 
of 
the 
ESR. 
The 
Curriculum 
Wing 
(CW) 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
has 
a 
legal 
mandate 
for 
the “maintenance 
of 
standards 
of 
education”. 
Although 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
has 
testing 
mechanisms 
for 
assessing 
individual 
student 
performance 
used 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
determining 
promotion 
and 
placement, 
it 
has 
no 
system 
of 
measuring 
how 
well 
schools are 
doing 
in 
implementing 
the 
curricula 
and 
learning 
objectives 
associated 
with 
them.

is 
not 
comparable 
across 
the 
country 
because 
the

issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
As 
noted 
above, 
the basic 
issue 
is 
that 
no 
institutional 
arrangement 
exists 
at 
the 
national 
level 
to 
conduct 
quality 
surveys 
of 
student 
learning 
and 
to 
determine 
how well 
the 
education system 
is 
performing 
and 
to 
apply 
findings 
to 
policy 
formation 
and 
resource 
allocations. 
Similarly, 
there 
are 
no 
appropriate 
means 
to 
know: 
(a) 
how 
well 
the 
curricula 
are 
being 
translated 
into 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
among 
students; 
(b) 
the 
principal 
determinants 
of 
student 
performance; and 
(c) 
the ways 
to 
assist 
teachers 
to 
use 
data 
to 
improve 
student 
performance. 
The 
Government 
of 
Pakistan, 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
(MoE) 
has 
requested 
the 
World 
Bank's 
assistance 
in 
designing, 
piloting 
and 
initiating 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
system 
to 
fill 
these 
gaps. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
be 
the 
vehicle 
for 
such 
assistance.

(see 
Annex

for 
a 
detailed description and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown) 
: 
By 
its 
very 
design, 
this 
project 
is 
experimentalidevelopmental 
in 
nature.  Because 
of 
the 
specialized 
skills 
and 
the 
paucity 
of 
them 
in 
Pakistan, 
a 
sizeable 
portion 
of 
the 
credit 
will 
be 
used 
for 
learning- 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
skill 
acquisition 
and 
applied 
learning 
through 
the 
pilot 
testing 
and 
experimental 
procedures 
of 
the 
assessment 
design. 
As 
shown 
in 
the 
table 
below, 
the 
project 
would 
have 
three 
components: 
capacity 
building; 
pilot 
testing 
and implementation 
of 
the 
assessment 
activities; and 
information 
dissemination.

Capacity

would 
be 
the 
main 
component, 
accounting 
for 
about 
77.1% 
of 
the 
total 
project 
cost. 
The 
execution 
of 
an 
assessment 
is 
unusually 
technical 
in 
nature. 
Any 
one 
of 
a 
number 
of 
small 
mistakes 
can 
-5- 
Page  12
cause 
serious delays 
in 
implementation 
and, 
in 
the 
worst 
case, 
lead 
to 
meaningless 
findings. 
Therefore, a 
high-level 
technical 
assistance, 
including 
the 
services 
of 
a 
senior 
Technical Advisor, 
would 
be 
required 
to 
monitor 
and 
assist 
in 
all 
aspects 
of 
both 
central and 
provincial 
operations. 
This 
technical 
assistance 
(which 
initially 
should 
be 
on 
a 
full-time 
basis) 
would 
be 
placed 
in 
the 
NEAS 
office, 
and 
later 
in 
the 
"partnering" 
institution, 
but 
available 
to 
all 
of 
the 
partners. 
A 
"partnering" 
relationship 
will 
be 
established 
with 
a 
recognized 
international 
and 
/ 
or local 
agency 
experienced 
in 
national 
assessment. 
This 
organization 
will 
provide 
"on-call'' 
support, 
linkages and 
guidance 
as 
the 
assessment 
design 
emerges. 
The 
partnering 
arrangement 
and 
long-term 
technical 
advisor 
will 
be 
put 
into 
place 
as 
soon 
as 
possible, 
but 
not 
later than 
the 
September 
2003. 
See 
Annex 
11 
for 
the 
Terms 
of 
Reference 
for 
the 
Technical 
Advisor 
and 
Annex 
12 
for 
the 
expectations 
of 
support 
to 
be 
provided 
by 
the "partnering"  organization. 
Eventually, 
a 
sustainable 
system 
will 
require 
a core 
team 
of 
full-time 
professionals 
with 
expertise 
in 
psychometrics, 
statistical 
analysis and 
information 
technology, supported 
by 
office 
staff, technicians 
and 
part-time 
assessment 
professionals, 
resource persons, 
training 
specialists, software/systems specialists, 
sampling 
specialists, 
scorerdmarkers and 
field 
workers 
for 
administration 
of 
assessments 
and data 
collection. 
Full-time 
staff 
of 
the 
NEAS 
and 
Provincial Education 
Assessment 
Center 
(PEACE)Units 
will 
be 
drawn 
mostly 
from 
existing 
MOE 
and 
provincial/Areas 
DOES 
personnel. 
In 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
project, when 
staff 
appointed 
from 
within 
the Government 
are 
being 
trained, 
there 
may 
be 
a 
need 
to 
hire 
experts 
and 
I 
or 
institutions 
on 
contract at 
market 
rates 
to 
meet 
the 
target 
of 
conducting 
the 
first 
round 
of 
assessments 
during 
February/March 
2004. 
In 
addition, 
there 
will 
be 
a need 
to 
hire 
teachers 
and 
university 
students 
on 
a 
part-time 
basis 
for 
writing 
assessment 
instruments, 
administration 
of 
assessments, 
and scoring/marking 
of 
assessments. 
Above 
all, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
need 
to 
monitor 
the 
implementation 
of 
NEAS 
for 
quality control 
through trained 
Quality Control Monitors 
and 
the 
various 
technical 
committees described 
in 
Annex 
13. 
To 
ensure 
long-term 
sustainability, 
the 
capacity 
of 
Pakistani 
officials 
will 
have 
to 
be 
developed 
in 
critical 
technical 
areas 
in 
each 
of 
the 
provinces 
and 
areas, 
and 
in 
sufficient 
numbers 
of 
staff 
members 
to 
institutionalize 
the 
assessment 
process 
over 
the 
long-run. 
The 
flexibility 
of 
the 
project 
instrument 
will 
permit 
a 
two 
stage 
implementation 
strategy. 
At 
stage 
I, 
emphasis 
will 
be 
placed 
on 
quickly 
developing 
a core 
instrument 
for 
piloting 
during 
the 
first 
year. 
At 
stage 
11, 
to 
overlap 
with 
or 
to 
begin 
soon 
after 
stage 
I, 
one 
or 
more 
"partnering" relationships 
will 
be 
established between 
an 
intemational 
entity 
(university 
or 
assessment 
organization) 
and 
a 
local 
university 
or 
research 
organization. 
It 
is 
extremely 
important 
that 
technical 
assistance 
be 
internally 
consistent 
and 
mutually 
reinforcing. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that, 
through 
this 
arrangement, 
an 
international 
organization 
can 
be 
contracted 
to 
provide: 
(i) 
short-term technical 
assistance; 
(ii) 
short-term 
training 
courses 
(3-6 
weeks); 
(iii) 
faculty 
development 
through 
curriculum 
design 
and 
instruction; 
(iv) 
"on-line" 
I 
on-demand 
technical 
support 
services; 
(v) 
access 
to intemational 
literature 
on 
assessment 
and 
best 
practices; 
and 
(vi) 
sandwich 
training 
programs 
and "on-campus" 
visits 
and 
internships. 
To 
the 
extent 
possible, 
training 
of 
project staff 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
Pakistan, 
possibly 
through 
one 
or 
two 
National/Provincial 
universities 
or 
educational 
institutes. 
It 
is 
expected that 
training 
of 
staff, 
especially 
long-term 
training, 
would 
emphasize 
training staff 
of 
the 
partnering organization 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
capacity 
of 
that 
organization 
is 
sufficiently 
developed. 
The project 
provides 
for 
a 
limited 
number 
(10) 
of 
opportunities 
to 
pursue 
MA 
degrees 
or 
equivalent 
training 
abroad, 
but 
that 
number 
may 
be 
reduced 
in 
preference 
for 
larger 
numbers 
who 
might 
be 
trained 
under 
a 
"sandwich" 
program 
of 
equal 
length 
(local-overseas-local) 
with 
a 
degree 
being 
awarded 
by 
the 
partnering 
institution(s). 
Although 
training 
and 
skills 
development 
will 
take 
place 
largely 
in-country, 
it 
is 
anticipated 
that 
-6- 
Page  13
approximately 
one 
individual 
per 
regiodarea 
will 
obtain 
the 
equivalent 
of 
a 
Master’s 
Degree 
in 
some aspect 
of 
assessment 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project.  Ideally, 
the 
overseas 
training 
would 
be 
coordinated 
through 
the 
partnering 
organization 
so 
as 
to 
minimize 
the 
length 
of 
time 
spent 
abroad 
and 
to 
ensure 
direct 
applicability 
of 
skills 
and 
effective 
application 
of 
newly 
acquired 
capacities. 
In 
addition to 
regular cross-provincial technical 
review 
meetings, 
2-3 
day 
workshops and 
seminars 
on 
technical 
issues 
will 
be 
held 
over 
the course 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
course 
offerings 
will 
be 
coordinated 
by 
the 
Curriculum 
Wing 
and 
developed and 
offered 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
partnering organization 
or 
with 
independent 
technical 
assistance 
as 
needed.  Courses 
and 
technical 
assistance 
will 
help 
to 
develop 
not 
only 
good 
instruments 
but 
also 
strengthen analytic 
skills 
and 
linkages 
to 
policy 
makers and 
planners. 
Among 
the 
specific 
skills 
which 
will 
be 
developed 
under 
the 
project 
are: 
(i) 
general 
measurement concepts 
and 
theory; 
(ii) 
item 
writing; 
(iii) 
item 
analysis; 
(iv) 
item

(v)

administration 
; 
(ix) 
data 
coding, 
cleaning 
and 
file 
creation; 
and 
(x) 
data 
presentation 
and report production. 
The 
heavy 
emphasis 
on 
training 
in 
conjunction 
with 
piloting 
procedures and 
instruments 
is 
due 
to 
the 
highly 
technical nature 
of 
testing 
and 
assessment. 
Training 
will 
focus 
on 
skill 
areas 
including: 
Planning 
and 
design 
of 
assessment 
systems 
and 
instruments 
Data 
analysis 
Management and

Component 
2: 
Pilot 
Testing and 
Implementation 
of 
Assessment 
Activities 
This 
component 
would 
account 
for 
about 
21.1% 
of 
the 
total project 
cost. 
In 
light 
of 
the 
complexity 
of 
population 
characteristics 
across 
provinces 
in 
Pakistan, 
and 
in 
light 
of 
a weak 
technical infrastructure 
with 
little 
experience 
in 
this 
type 
of 
assessment, 
pilot 
experiments 
will 
be 
required 
to 
determine 
what 
will 
produce 
the 
desired, 
valid 
results, 
and 
what 
process 
is 
most 
implementable. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
allow 
technical 
experts 
to 
pilot 
instruments 
to 
ensure 
that 
language 
and 
other 
potential 
contextual 
differences 
which 
might 
affect 
performance 
results 
are 
addressed 
to 
reduce 
assessment 
bias 
to 
a 
minimum. 
During 
the 
initial 
stages 
of 
the 
project, 
options 
for 
ensuring 
effective 
working 
arrangements 
and linkages 
among the 
provinces 
will 
be 
tested, 
measurement 
items 
developed at the 
provincial 
level 
will 
be 
pooled, 
then 
shared 
and 
evaluated 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
national 
pool 
of 
assessment 
items. 
The 
criteria 
used 
for 
developing 
sampling 
frames 
will 
be 
discussed 
and 
agreed 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
assessment 
results 
can 
be 
generalized 
to 
agreed 
sub-populations and 
are 
representative 
of 
the 
national cohort 
of 
Grade 
4 
and 
Grade 
8 
children. 
Options 
for 
implementing 
the 
assessment 
instrument 
in 
the 
field 
will 
be 
explored 
under 
the 
project. 
Most 
students 
in 
Pakistan 
are 
not 
familiar 
with 
multiple 
choice type 
questions 
or 
with 
machine 
readable 
scoring 
sheets. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
a modest amount 
of 
equipment 
and 
books 
will 
be 
purchased 
to 
facilitate 
the 
work 
of 
staff involved 
in 
instrument 
development, 
piloting 
and 
data analysis. 
The 
acquisition 
of 
computers 
and 
optical 
scanners 
will 
be 
an 
important part 
of 
the 
piloting 
phase 
of 
assessment.

class 
by 
the 
teacher 
during hidher 
teaching. 
A 
sample 
of 
students 
identified 
by 
the Federal 
Bureau 
of 
Statistics 
(FBS) 
would 
be 
tested 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Grade 
4 
and 
grade 
8 
in 
each 
provincelarea 
of 
Pakistan. 
The 
tests 
will 
be 
administered 
in 
a standardized 
way to 
ensure 
fairness 
for 
individual 
students. 
After 
piloting, 
a 
revision 
would 
take 
place 
of 
tests, 
instruments 
for 
gathering background 
data, 
test 
administration 
process, 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
training, 
student 
sampling 
and 
its 
size, 
dissemination 
process 
and 
feedback. 
Care 
will 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
that 
revisions do 
not 
impact 
on 
the 
monitoring 
of 
achievement 
over 
time. 
When 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
government 
agencies 
is 
developed 
through 
this 
project, 
NEAS 
should 
be 
able 
to 
administer 
tests 
to 
the 
FebruaryIMarch 
2005 
cohort 
of 
grade-4 
students 
reaching 
grade-8 
in 
FebruaryIMarch 
2009.

In 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
project, 
the 
center 
will 
have 
an 
edge 
in 
human 
capacity 
and 
is 
likely 
to 
produce more 
substantial 
assessment 
reports.  Indeed, 
for 
the 
pilot 
study 
there 
may 
be 
only 
a 
single 
report 
produced 
by 
NEAS, 
and 
for 
the 
first 
full 
cycle 
of 
assessments 
some 
of 
the 
provinces 
may 
decide that analysis 
of 
assessment 
data 
is 
beyond 
their 
capacity 
and 
simply 
transfer 
the 
raw 
data 
to 
NEAS. 
However, 
every 
effort 
will 
be 
made 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
PEACEs, 
so 
that 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project 
they 
will 
have 
equivalent capacity 
relative 
to 
NEAS. 
All 
the 
main 
stakeholders (students, 
teachers, 
parents, 
educational 
supervisors, managers, 
curriculum 
developers, 
subject 
experts, 
material 
writers,  statisticians, 
etc.) 
would 
be 
associated 
with 
these 
efforts and 
their 
participation 
would 
be 
assured 
at 
appropriate 
stages 
of 
conducting 
a 
cycle 
of 
assessment. 
Component 
3: 
Information 
Dissemination 
This 
component 
would 
account 
for 
about 
1.9% 
of 
the 
total project 
cost. 
Through 
this 
component, the 
project 
will 
facilitate 
information 
dissemination 
about 
assessment 
to 
stakeholders 
in 
advance 
of 
the 
actual 
assessment 
to explain 
its 
purpose and 
to 
provide 
insight 
and 
reassurance 
about 
its 
intended 
uses. 
Information 
dissemination 
would 
also 
take place 
in 
order 
to 
make 
findings 
known to 
stakeholders, 
media 
and elected 
officials 
so 
that 
they 
understand 
what 
the 
findings 
imply 
for 
administration 
of 
the 
education 
system, 
resource 
allocation 
and 
potentially effective 
policy 
shifts.

2. 
Key 
policy 
and institutional reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
first 
and 
the 
foremost 
reform to 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project 
is 
institutionalizing 
a 
National 
Education 
Assessment 
System 
along 
with 
developing 
capacity 
of 
the 
provinceslareas 
of 
Pakistan 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
conduct 
sample-based 
periodic 
student 
assessments 
in 
line 
with 
the 
project 
objectives. 
This 
will 
be 
supported 
through 
a 
series 
of 
steps. 
The 
Technical 
Group 
Meetings that 
have 
been 
held 
over 
the 
last 
two 
years 
on 
NEAS 
have 
produced 
a 
highly 
detailed map 
of 
steps 
that need 
to 
be 
taken 
as 
part 
of 
the 
design 
and 
pilot-testing 
phase. 
Each 
step 
has 
been 
assigned 
to 
a 
specific group 
for 
carrying 
out, 
dates 
have 
been 
set 
for 
completion, and 
the 
task 
to 
be 
accomplished 
clearly 
delineated. 
In 
summary, 
the 
following 
major 
stages 
are 
involved 
in 
conducting 
one 
cycle 
of 
student 
assessment 
-- 
each 
pilot 
stage 
includes 
a number 
of 
critical 
steps,

Review 
the 
success

As 
stated 
above, 
it 
is 
expected that 
two 
rounds 
of 
grade4 
and 
one 
round 
of 
grade-8 
assessments 
in 
four 
subjects 
will 
be 
completed 
during 
the 
five 
years 
of 
this 
project 
in 
addition to 
the 
pilot 
rounds 
for 
each subject. 
Lessons 
learned 
from 
each 
cycle 
will 
be 
used 
to 
revise 
tests 
(giving 
due care 
that 
revisions do 
not 
impact 
on 
the 
monitoring 
of 
achievement 
over 
time), 
the 
logistics 
of 
administering 
them 
and 
providing 
security 
of 
results, 
and 
to 
develop ways 
and 
procedures 
to 
institutionalize 
the 
National 
Education 
Assessment 
System 
by 
developing 
capacity at 
federal 
and 
provincial1Area level. 
3. 
Benefits and 
target population: 
The 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
would 
critically 
depend 
on 
the 
utilization 
of 
the 
information 
to 
be 
generated 
by 
the 
new 
assessment 
system. 
Potentially, 
the 
benefits 
are 
quite 
substantial. 
The 
new 
data 
would 
provide 
policy-makers 
and government 
officials 
with 
a 
solid 
basis 
for taking 
decisions 
concerning 
resource 
allocation 
within 
the education 
sector. 
It 
would 
give 
guidance 
to 
teachers 
and 
their 
supervisors 
about 
the 
substantive 
areas 
that need 
to 
be 
emphasized 
within 
the 
curriculum. 
It 
would 
also 
provide 
households 
with 
a 
much 
better 
basis 
for 
gauging 
the value 
of 
the 
education 
being 
provided 
to 
their 
children. 
Thus, 
as 
the 
system 
takes 
hold, 
appropriate 
use 
of 
the 
data 
it 
generates 
would 
result 
in 
a 
better 
quality 
of 
education 
for 
the 
country’s children. 
-9- 
Page  16
By 
FebruaryIMarch 
2005, 
baseline 
data 
for 
Grade 
4 
in 
language 
and 
mathematics 
should 
be 
available. 
The 
quality 
of 
the instruments developed 
and the effectiveness 
with 
which 
they 
are 
administered 
and 
the 
resulting 
data 
analyzed 
will 
be 
the 
measure 
of 
how much 
of 
an impact 
the 
project 
has 
had. 
Each 
pilot 
test 
and 
full 
test 
will 
serve 
as 
independent 
monitors 
of 
how 
well 
the 
outcomes 
of 
the 
project 
have 
been 
achieved. 
Training 
and 
technical 
assistance 
reports 
will 
provide 
further 
independent 
assessments 
of 
whether 
the 
desired 
outcomes 
are 
being 
achieved. 
The 
target 
population, 
to 
start 
with, 
would 
be 
a 
carefully 
selected sample 
of 
all 
the 
children 
in 
grades 
4 
and 
8 
in 
government 
schools 
and 
community 
schools. 
The population 
may 
include, 
at 
a 
later 
stage, 
children 
of 
the 
same 
grades 
from 
private 
schools, 
NGO 
schools, 
and 
other schools. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
The project 
will 
be implemented over 
a 
period 
of 
five 
years 
(2003-08). 
The 
NEAS 
involves very 
close 
collaboration 
between 
the 
federal 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
and 
the 
Provincial 
and 
Area 
Departments 
of 
Education 
(DOES). 
Overall, 
coordination 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Federal government 
under 
the 
umbrella 
of 
the 
broader 
Education 
System 
Reform 
initiative 
led 
by 
the 
Federal 
Secretary 
of 
Education. 
The 
various 
work 
groups that 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
design 
and implementation 
of 
the 
system 
and 
for 
its 
piloting 
are 
summarized 
in 
the 
chart 
which 
follows. 
See 
also 
Annex 
13 
for 
a 
detailed description 
of 
the 
responsibilities 
of 
various

to 
implement 
the 
ESR 
components 
including 
student 
assessment. 
The 
purpose 
was 
that 
the 
Islamabad 
Capital 
Territory 
as 
a 
model 
would 
demonstrate 
to 
provinces and 
areas 
how 
the 
Plan could 
be 
implemented 
effectively focusing 
on 
quality. 
This 
alternative 
was 
not 
considered appropriate 
as 
the 
Islamabad 
Capital Territory, mostly 
urban 
in 
nature, 
is 
not 
truly 
representative 
of 
the 
country given 
the 
complexity 
of 
population 
characteristics 
across 
provinces 
and 
areas 
in 
Pakistan. 
Piloting 
in 
a 
single 
province 
or 
selected 
provinces 
willing 
to 
participate 
The 
possibility 
of 
initiating 
the 
process 
in 
a 
single 
province 
or 
selected 
provinceslareas 
was 
considered 
and 
rejected 
for 
the 
following two 
reasons. 
First, 
if 
large provinces 
like 
Punjab 
or 
Sindh 
opted 
not 
to 
participate, 
there 
would 
again 
not 
be 
a 
true 
representation 
of 
all 
the 
sections 
of 
population 
and 
the 
assessment 
system 
could 
not 
be 
called 
a 
national 
system. 
Second, 
several 
provinciallarea 
specific 
student 
assessment 
studies 
were 
conducted 
in 
the 
past 
as 
discussed 
in 
Annex 
14 
but 
the 
function 
of 
educational 
assessment 
could 
neither 
shape 
up 
as 
a 
national 
system 
nor 
was 
it 
institutionalized 
at 
provincial 
level.

Sample 
of 
all 
types 
of 
schools 
versus 
Government 
schools 
Although 
it 
is 
desirable 
to 
include 
all 
types 
of 
schools 
to draw 
a representative 
sample 
at 
national 
level, 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
include 
only 
government 
and 
community 
managed 
schools 
to 
start 
with 
in 
view 
of 
capacity 
considerations and 
uncertainty 
about 
the 
willingness 
of 
private, 
NGO 
and other 
schools 
to 
participate. 
Later 
on, 
when 
capacity 
is 
developed and 
awareness 
is 
created 
about 
the 
desirability 
of 
educational 
assessment 
and 
appropriate 
work 
is 
done 
to 
remove 
fears 
of 
the 
private 
sector, 
all 
the 
remaining 
schools 
can 
be 
included 
in 
a 
phased manner. 
Leave 
this 
activity 
for 
other 
donors 
to finance 
The 
possibility 
of 
leaving 
NEAS 
for 
other 
donors, 
especially 
bilateral 
donors, 
to 
finance 
in 
view 
of 
very 
small financing 
requirements 
was considered. 
However, 
it 
was 
decided 
against 
it 
because 
both 
the 
donors 
and 
the 
government wanted 
the 
Bank's 
involvement 
in 
view 
of 
the 
work 
done 
by 
the 
Bank 
on 
educational 
assessment. 
It 
was also 
decided 
to involve 
other 
donors 
who 
are 
willing 
to 
become partners 
in 
establishing 
NEAS 
in 
Pakistan. 
DFID 
is 
co-financing 
the 
project. 
DFID 
and 
UNICEF 
have 
helped 
the 
government 
in 
holding 
most 
of 
the 
TGMs 
and 
financing 
training 
of 
government 
staff 
in 
student 
assessment 
outside 
the 
project. 
UNESCO 
has 
helped 
government 
in 
conducting 
a 
study 
to 
meet 
EFA 
requirements.

There 
have 
been 
no 
separate 
TA 
projects 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
However, 
student 
assessment 
was 
included 
as 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
above 
projects. 
Other 
donors have 
also 
been 
funding 
one-time 
assessment 
studies 
which 
are 
discussed 
in 
Annex 
14. 
Experience 
from 
other 
sectors 
regarding 
TA 
projects 
is 
not 
very 
encouraging. 
TA 
projects 
are 
generally 
not 
welcome, 
as 
they 
are 
considered synonymous 
with 
"wasting 
money 
on 
consultancies". There 
is 
also a 
very 
cumbersome 
procedure 
now 
in 
place 
for 
hiring 
of 
consultants 
by 
government 
ministries--adding 
to 
implementation 
woes. 
The 
situation 
is 
slightly 
better 
if 
implementing 
agencies 
are 
autonomous 
bodies. 
However, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
NEAS, 
the GoP 
has 
welcomed 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
TA 
project 
because 
of 
the nature and 
-

Page  21
importance 
of 
national 
assessment 
and 
recognizing 
the 
need 
for 
capacity 
building. 
3. 
Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
A 
number 
of 
studies 
of 
learning 
achievement have 
been 
conducted 
in 
Palustan 
from 
1984 
to 
date. 
Most 
of 
them 
are 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
14 
of 
the 
PAD. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Academy 
of 
Education 
Planning and 
Management 
(AEPM) 
carried out 
a 
sample 
survey 
of 
achievement 
among Grade 4 
students 
to 
meet 
the 
country 
requirements 
of 
EFA 
Assessment 
2000 
(AEPM, 
2000). 
With 
the 
exception 
of 
UNESCO 
studies, 
assessment 
activities 
have 
tended 
to 
be 
part 
of 
individual 
development 
projects 
in 
various 
provinces 
/ 
areas 
rather 
than a 
national 
level 
effort. 
All 
of 
these 
studies 
have 
weaknesses 
in, 
at 
least, 
five 
major 
areas 
which 
limit 
the 
conclusions 
that can 
be 
drawn 
and 
makes 
the 
comparison 
of 
student 
achievement 
over 
time 
difficult: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
Different 
Grades 
at 
different 
times: 
These 
studies 
were conducted 
for 
different 
grades 
(1-3,4-5, 
3 
& 
5, 
5, 
6, 
7 
or 
8 
only) 
at 
different 
times 
with 
little 
effort 
to 
relate 
findings 
to 
the 
results 
of 
previous 
studies 
or 
grades. 
Instrument 
development: 
The 
framework 
for 
constructing 
the 
items 
is 
rarely 
reported, 
so 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
evaluate 
curriculum 
coverage. 
A 
single 
form 
of 
a 
test 
paper 
is 
normally 
used, 
rather 
than 
multiple 
spiraled blocks. 
This 
increases 
the 
risk 
of 
copying, 
introduces 
order effects 
(items 
that come 
late 
in 
the 
test 
tend 
to 
get 
less 
attention than 
those 
at 
the 
beginning) 
and 
limits 
the 
possible 
coverage 
of 
curriculum 
objectives. 
Sample 
design: 
There 
is 
no 
generally-used 
sampling 
frame. 
The 
sampling 
frames 
used 
by 
these 
studies 
tend 
to 
cover Government 
schools 
well 
and 
others 
much 
less 
well. 
Community 
schools 
and 
private 
schools 
tend 
to 
be 
omitted. 
In 
many 
cases 
too many 
primary 
sampling 
units 
(PSUs) 
may 
be 
covered, 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
make 
assessment 
as 
participatory 
as 
possible. 
As 
a 
result, 
too 
few 
schools 
are 
taken 
from 
any 
PSU 
to allow 
adequate 
representation 
of 
diverse 
school 
types. 
Weighting 
according 
to 
size 
is 
not 
used 
in 
determining 
the 
probability 
of 
selection 
and 
in 
combining 
results. 
Administration: 
Administration 
was 
frequently 
devolved 
to 
local 
educators, 
at 
the 
district or 
tehsil 
level. 
This 
increases 
the 
risk 
of 
inconsistent 
or 
lax 
administration. 
Training 
and 
supervision 
of 
administrators 
is 
not normally 
reported 
in 
sufficient detail to 
judge 
its 
rigor. 
Analysis 
and 
reporting: 
The 
emphasis 
in 
the 
reports 
is 
on 
total 
scores, 
normally 
expressed 
as 
percentages. 
These 
provide 
little 
useful 
information. 
For 
example, does 
a 
mean 
score 
of 
5 
1% 
in 
math 
in 
a 
North 
West 
Frontier 
Province 
test 
administered 
in 
1995 
relate 
to 
the 
curriculum 
goals 
mastered 
by 
the 
average 
student? 
Is 
it 
evidence 
of 
any 
change 
in 
standards since 
other 
(BRIDGES) 
testing, 
which 
produced 
a mean 
score 
of 
26% 
in 
the 
same 
subject? 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
say. 
One possible 
exception 
to 
these 
limitations 
is 
the 
study 
carried out 
in 
1995 
by 
the 
Pakistan 
Psychological 
Foundation 
(Pervez, 
1995). 
This 
study 
was sponsored 
by 
UNICEF 
and 
used the 
ABC 
(Assessment 
of 
Basic 
Competencies) 
test, 
versions 
of 
which 
have 
also 
been 
used 
elsewhere 
in 
South Asia.  However, 
the 
ABC 
test 
is 
not 
based 
directly 
on 
Pakistani curriculum, 
and 
tests 
only 
very 
limited 
competencies. 
Therefore, 
although 
the 
study 
is 
suggestive 
of 
low 
standards 
of 
achievements, 
it 
does 
not 
relate 
specifically to 
Pakistani 
curriculum 
goals. 
The 
work cited 
above 
is 
often 
interesting 
and 
informative. 
However, 
there 
is 
little 
national 
experience 
in 
conducting 
cross-provincial, 
curriculum 
based 
assessments 
and 
there 
is 
very 
limited 
technical capacity 
to 
carry 
out 
this 
kind 
of 
studies 
in 
Pakistan. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
project 
has 
benefited 
from 
the 
above lessons 
/ 
findings. 
Although 
other 
projects 
also 
aimed 
at 
capacity development 
for 
assessment 
to 
some 
extent, 
it 
did 
not 
happen 
because 
assessment 
was one 
among 
several components 
of 
the 
projects, 
and 
therefore 
it 
could not 
get 
the 
attention 
which 
it 
deserved. 
This 
time, 
a 
lot 
of 
background 
work 
has 
been 
done 
over 
the last 
five 
years 
by 
the 
government 
to 
bring 
all 
stakeholders 
on

board 
in 
realizing 
the 
importance 
of 
student 
assessmentisystem 
evaluation. 
However, ownership 
of 
the 
project 
remains weak and 
sustainability 
is 
also 
not 
guaranteed. 
The 
Bank 
is 
proceeding 
with 
this 
project 
with 
the understanding that 
it 
is 
a 
high 
risk-high 
reward activity. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
The 
MoE 
has made 
a 
written 
request 
to 
the 
Bank 
through 
the 
Economic 
Affairs 
Division. 
Commitment 
exists 
at senior 
management 
and 
policy 
making 
level including 
the 
Deputy 
Chairman, 
Planning Commission and 
the 
Secretary 
Planning Division. 
An 
amount 
of 
Rs 
50 
million 
has 
been allocated 
in 
the PSDP 
for 
the 
project. 
Provincialiarea 
PC-Is 
have 
been 
approved and 
staff 
appointed. 
The 
federal 
PC-I 
has 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
Central Development 
Working 
Party 
(CDWP) 
but 
it 
has 
yet 
to 
be 
approved 
by 
the 
ECNEC. 
However, 
there 
is 
less 
ownership 
at 
the 
MoE 
level, 
in 
particular 
at 
the 
senior 
levels 
below 
the Education 
Minister. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
This 
is 
a 
first 
project 
of 
its 
kind 
in 
the 
country 
that 
aims 
at 
establishing 
an 
institutional 
arrangement 
for 
national 
education 
assessment. 
The 
government 
values 
the 
Bank's 
work 
on 
assessment. 
The 
Bank 
helped 
government 
initiate 
a 
process 
of 
awareness 
creation 
in 
1997 
and 
mobilized 
other donor partners 
to 
help 
the 
government. 
This 
process 
has 
led 
to 
a 
realization 
among 
various 
stakeholders 
that establishment 
of 
a 
national 
assessment 
system 
is 
a 
major 
step 
towards 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
education.

i.e.,

by 
a

or 
entity 
of 
the 
data 
the 
system 
generates does 
not 
deprive 
other 
persons 
or 
entities 
of 
using 
the 
same 
data. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
government 
intervention, 
a 
national 
education 
assessment 
system 
would 
not 
emerge, 
as 
private 
firms 
would 
have 
no 
incentives 
to 
invest 
in 
the 
collection 
of 
this 
type 
of 
information 
(unless 
contracted 
to 
do 
so 
by 
the 
Government). 
Thus, 
there 
is 
good 
justification 
for 
the 
government 
to 
organize

the 
establishment 
and

of 
a

system. 
Justification 
for 
Government 
Intervention. 
A 
national 
education 
assessment 
system 
is 
a 
public 
(ii) 
Benefit-Cost Relationship. 
The 
benefits 
that society 
would 
derive 
from 
a 
well-functioning national 
education 
assessment 
system 
would 
depend 
on 
the 
use 
the 
data 
are 
given. 
However, though 
no 
quantification 
of 
benefits 
has 
been 
attempted 
here, 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
economic 
benefits 
would 
far 
exceed 
the 
relatively 
small 
costs 
of 
establishing 
and 
running 
the 
assessment 
system. 
(ii) 
located 
in 
the poorest 
areas 
of 
the 
country 
also 
rank 
low 
in 
terms 
of 
educational 
performance. 
This 
would 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
possible 
geographical 
targeting 
of 
government spending 
on 
elementary education. 
Poverty

A 
rigorous 
national

system 
is 
likely 
to 
find

Fiscal Impact: 
(i) 
Fiscal 
Impact. 
The 
project's net 
fiscal 
impact 
would 
be 
negative 
in 
the short-run 
(Le., 
it 
would

16- 
Page  23
increase 
government spending 
without 
at 
the 
same 
time 
increasing 
revenues). 
Over 
the 
longer 
run, 
the 
net 
fiscal impact 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
positive, 
because 
of 
the 
taxes 
the 
government 
would 
collect 
on 
the 
additional 
earnings 
the 
labor force 
would 
accrue 
(or 
on 
the 
consumption 
made 
possible 
by 
those 
additional 
earnings). 
(ii) 
Very 
small budgetary allocations 
would 
be 
required 
to 
continue 
operating 
the 
program. 
However, 
it 
is 
not 
the 
cost 
but 
commitment 
to 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
project 
which would 
matter. 
Financial 
sustainability 
of 
the 
new 
national 
education 
assessment 
system 
should 
not 
be 
a 
problem. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
project 
is 
technically 
sound 
as 
noted 
in 
various 
sections 
of 
the 
PAD. 
4. 
Institutional: 
Institutional 
arrangements made 
for 
the 
project, 
as 
discussed 
in 
section 
C4, are adequate 
and 
a 
system 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
institutionalized 
under 
these 
arrangements 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project 
provided 
the 
commitment 
and 
ownership 
improves. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
Curriculum 
Wing 
(CW) 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
will 
be 
the 
overall 
coordinator 
for 
implementing, 
monitoring 
and 
supervision 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
executing 
agencies 
in 
the 
provinces 
will 
include: Bureau 
of 
Curriculum 
of 
Balochistan; 
Directorate 
of 
Curriculum 
and 
Teacher 
Education, 
NWFP; 
University 
of 
Education, Punjab; 
Directorate 
of 
Research 
and 
Assessment, 
Sindh; 
Directorate 
of 
Curriculum 
Research 
and 
Development 
in 
AJK; 
and 
Directorates 
of 
Education 
in 
FATA, 
ICT 
and 
NAs. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
Project 
management 
is 
discussed 
in 
detail 
in 
section 
C4. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
Procurement and 
Disbursement 
arrangements 
are 
specified 
in 
Annex 
6. 
4.4 
Financial 
management issues: 
The 
Curriculum 
Wing 
(CW) 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
Islamabad, 
and 
provincial 
/ 
areas 
Departments 
of 
Education 
would 
be 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
of 
the 
project. 
CW, 
Islamabad, 
would 
coordinate activities 
of 
the other 
implementing 
agencies 
and 
it 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
management 
of 
project 
funds 
and 
maintaining 
accounts 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
financial 
management 
system 
to 
be 
used 
for 
implementing 
the 
project 
is 
adequate. 
An 
Accounts 
Officer 
and 
a 
cashier 
would 
be 
in 
place 
at 
each 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
by 
end-May 
2003. 
Project 
accounts 
would 
be 
audited 
by 
the 
Auditor 
General 
of 
Pakistan 
in 
accordance 
with 
acceptable 
auditing 
standards. 
Annual 
audited 
financial 
statements 
would 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the 
close 
of 
each 
financial 
year. 
Further 
details 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
are

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, and 
specify 
the 
project's 
social 
development 
outcomes. 
Social 
issues 
include 
rural-urban 
imbalances and 
gender 
disparities 
in 
enrollment 
and 
curriculum 
biased 
in 
favor 
of 
male 
students. 
Following 
are 
among performance 
indicators 
to 
address 
these 
issues 
and 
to 
review 
achievement 
of 
social 
development 
outcomes: 
policy 
makers 
are 
informed 
to 
develop 
strategies 
and 
action 
plans 
for 
improving 
curriculum, 
teaching and 
resource 
allocation. 
Sample 
of 
schools 
and 
students 
will 
be 
selected 
from 
all 
government 
and 
community 
managed schools 
from all 
over 
the 
country. 
The 
sample 
will 
include 
boys 
and 
girls 
from 
rural 
and 
urban 
and 
within 
them 
from 
advantaged 
and 
disadvantaged sections 
of 
the 
society. 
The 
results 
of 
assessment 
would 
guide 
the 
policy 
makers 
and 
all 
stakeholders 
to 
plan 
targeted 
interventions 
to 
remove inequities 
and 
invest 
resources 
(human 
and financial) accordingly 
to 
achieve 
these 
objectives. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
Most 
of 
key 
stakeholders 
(students, 
teachers, 
supervisors, managers, 
administrators, 
policy 
makers, 
curriculum 
developers, 
materials 
writers, 
parents) 
will 
participate 
in 
designing, 
piloting, 
and 
reviewing 
instruments. 
Others 
would 
participate 
through 
information 
marketing 
campaign and dissemination 
of 
findings 
of 
student 
assessment. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
NA 
6.4 
What institutional 
arrangements 
have

Sustainability and Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
The 
sustainability 
of 
the 
NEAS 
will 
depend 
upon 
the 
quality 
of 
instruments 
developed; 
effective 
implementation; 
capacity 
building; 
and 
the 
level 
of 
participation 
of 
various 
stakeholder groups. 
One 
factor 
which 
will 
help 
in 
institutionalizing 
the 
system 
is 
the 
fact that 
GOP, 
the 
Provincial 
governments, 
and 
the 
government 
of 
Azad 
Jammu 
and 
Kashmir 
will 
fund 
the 
entire 
cost 
of 
staff 
salaries 
and allowances 
in 
their 
respective 
areas 
of 
responsibility. 
There 
is 
also 
a 
growing 
awareness 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
student 
assessment. 
However, ownership 
in 
the 
MoE 
and provinciallarea 
departments 
of 
education 
is 
weak, 
as 
indicated 
by 
long 
delays 
in 
meeting 
the 
basic 
requirements 
of 
the 
project, 
including 
appointment 
of 
staff 
in 
MoE. 
Strengthening 
this 
awareness 
and 
ownership 
would 
heavily 
depend 
upon 
the 
continued commitment 
of 
senior government 
officials 
and policy-makers. 
The 
quality 
of 
TA, 
especially 
of 
the 
partnering organization 
that 
would 
be 
helping 
the government 
in 
conducting 
assessments 
and 
developing 
capacity, 
would 
also 
play 
an 
important 
role. 
To 
facilitate 
sustainability and 
to institutionalize training 
capacity, 
the 
project 
will 
help 
to 
establish 
an 
overall 
certifying 
and 
accrediting 
body, 
which 
would 
award 
skill 
certificates 
in 
assessment 
and 
assure 
the 
quality 
of 
training 
provided 
by 
other 
agencies.

Detailed Project Description 
PAKISTAN: National Education Assessment System 
The 
project 
will 
have 
the 
following 
specific 
components, each 
of 
which 
will 
be 
piloted, 
evaluated, 
and 
modified 
as 
necessary 
to 
achieve 
maximum 
effectiveness 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
cost estimates 
indicated 
against each 
component 
below 
include 
contingencies 
and 
GOP's, 
GoProvinces' and 
GoAJK's 
share 
of 
financing. 
Year-wise summary 
of 
Project 
Costs 
with 
sub-components 
is 
given 
at 
Annex 
15. 
Summary 
of 
costs 
with 
financing 
plan 
for 
the 
GoProvinces, 
GoAJK, 
FATA 
and 
NAs 
are 
given 
at 
Annex 
16 
which 
include 
the 
costs 
for 
the 
following 
sub-components: 
(a) 
Provincial 
workshops,  seminars, 
meetings 
etc.; 
(b) 
Goods 
(Equipment 
& 
Furniture); 
and 
(c) 
Incremental 
operational 
costs (other 
than 
staff

and 
allowances). 
By Component: 
Project 
Component 1 
- 
US$5.34 
million 
Capacity Building: 
(Training, 
Technical 
assistance, 
development ofprofessional 
teams 
and improving 
working 
environment): 
First 
of 
all, 
training 
and 
technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
the 
primary 
sources 
of 
learning 
and 
strategy generation. 
This program 
of 
assessment 
is 
unusually 
technical 
in 
nature. 
The 
TA 
and 
training 
need 
to 
be 
very 
specialized 
and 
in-depth. 
NEAS 
would 
also 
develop 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
MoE 
(CW) 
as 
well 
as 
the 
provinceslareas 
through 
their 
respective PC-1 
s 
to 
monitor 
the standards 
of 
education 
in 
the 
country, a 
responsibility 
for which 
the 
CW 
holds 
a 
legal 
mandate. 
The 
new 
assessment 
system 
will 
provide 
credible 
evidence 
of 
how 
schools 
are 
performing 
to 
local officials 
and other 
stakeholders 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
identify 
areas 
of 
weaknesses 
and 
thereafter 
influence 
the 
elementary education 
process. 
The 
TA 
and 
training 
will 
help to 
ensure 
that 
the 
assessment 
system 
is 
both well 
institutionalized and 
sustainable 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project.  Over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project, 
training 
will 
be 
provided 
in 
approximately 
the 
following 
amounts: 
0 
0 
0 
0 
0 
15 
person 
months 
of 
in-country 
short-term 
training 
(workshops, seminars, 
etc.); 
40 
person 
months 
of 
in-country 
certificate 
I 
degree 
training; 
Around 
200 
person 
weeks 
for 
participation 
in 
international 
symposia, conferences 
and 
study 
tours; 
10 
persons 
(20 
person 
years) 
for 
overseas 
degree 
(M.A.) 
training); 
and 
10 
persons 
(20 
person 
years) 
for 
"sandwich" 
degree 
training. 
Before 
any 
major 
technical 
decisions 
are 
taken, 
that 
may 
prove 
to 
be 
misguided, 
it 
is 
important 
that 
the 
National 
Planning 
and 
Coordination 
Committee 
for 
NEAS 
have 
first-hand 
experience 
of 
how 
assessments 
are 
conducted, 
and 
assessment 
results 
used. 
Under 
the 
project, 
a 
selected 
group 
of 
potential 
test 
specialists 
should 
observe 
at 
first 
hand 
the 
practice 
of 
national 
assessment, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
national 
assessment 
results 
in 
improving 
educational 
quality. 
This 
group 
will 
consist 
of 
key 
members 
of 
the 
National 
Planning 
and 
Coordination 
Committee 
for 
NEAS, 
covering 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
both 
the 
Federal and 
the 
ProvincesIAreas. 
The project 
will 
enable 
them 
to 
visit 
at least 
two 
countries, 
as 
far 
as 
possible at a 
similar 
level 
of 
economic 
and social 
development 
to 
Pakistan, 
where 
different 
forms 
of 
national 
assessment are 
carried 
out, 
and 
the 
results 
used 
in 
monitoring 
and 
improving 
educational quality. 
They 
will 
observe the process 
of 
national 
assessment, 
and 
meet 
with 
personnel 
participating 
at 
all 
levels 
in 
the 
process 
of 
national 
assessment. 
In-country 
and 
training 
in 
foreign institutions 
through 
seminars, workshops, 
short 
and 
long 
term 
courses,

Use

of 
technology 
in 
assessment 
Building 
professional capacity 
in 
the 
present 
cadre 
of 
NEAS 
staff 
is 
an 
essential 
precondition 
for 
successful 
delivery 
of 
a 
NEAS. 
However, 
it 
is 
also 
important 
that 
when 
the current 
individuals 
leave 
their 
posts, 
there 
should 
be 
provision for 
identifying 
and 
supplying 
the 
professional 
development 
needs 
of 
their 
successors. 
Preference 
for 
long-term training 
will 
be 
given to stafflfaculty 
at 
the 
local 
partnering 
institution 
to 
develop 
long-term 
concentrated 
capacity 
in 
assessment-related 
skills. 
The 
project 
will 
help 
to 
ensure 
that: 
0 
0 
0 
job 
descriptions 
and 
personnel specifications adequately 
define 
the 
duties 
of 
the 
post 
holder, and the 
abilities required to 
carry them 
out; 
mechanisms 
for 
assessing 
skills 
of 
individuals 
against 
job 
specifications 
will 
be 
developed, 
and 
professional 
development 
needs 
identified; 
and 
a comprehensive 
training program 
for 
delivering 
the 
required 
training 
and 
support 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
implemented. 
To 
ensure 
sustainability 
and 
to 
institutionalize training 
capacity, 
the 
project 
will 
help 
to 
establish 
I 
strengthen 
an 
overall 
certifying 
and 
accrediting 
body, 
which would 
award 
skill 
certificates 
in 
assessment 
and, 
while 
it 
might 
not 
provide 
all 
the 
training, 
assure 
the 
quality 
of 
training provided 
by 
other 
agencies. 
This 
body could 
vary 
from 
province to 
province. 
As 
a whole, 
the 
NEAS 
project 
will 
implement 
a 
plan 
for 
developing 
local 
training 
capacity, 
and options 
for 
supporting 
this 
through 
partnering 
with 
a 
suitable 
international 
institution 
(like 
ETS 
of 
USA 
and 
IIEP 
of 
Paris 
or local institution 
of 
international 
standards, 
if 
possible) 
will 
be 
explored. 
Technical 
Assistance 
(TA): 
Short-term 
and 
long-term, 
national 
and 
international 
TA 
will 
be 
a 
critical 
element 
needed 
to 
provide 
technical 
inputs 
for 
developing and managing the 
assessment 
system and 
for 
training 
a 
critical 
mass 
of 
professionals 
to 
develop 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
assessment 
on 
a 
long-term 
basis, 
as 
an 
integral part 
of 
the 
education 
system. 
TA 
will 
be 
provided 
through 
Long 
Term 
(LT) 
and 
Short 
Term 
(ST) 
TA 
which 
will 
be 
largely 
coordinated 
by 
and 
offered through 
a "partnership" 
arrangement 
expected 
to 
be 
negotiated between 
a 
single 
international 
institution 
or 
small consortium and 
one 
or 
more relevant 
institutions 
in 
Pakistan.  These 
contracts 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
signed 
and operational 
by 
the 
September 
2003. 
The 
technical 
assistance 
component 
will 
consist 
of 
the 
following 
services 
in 
the approximate 
amounts 
indicated: 
0 
0 
36 
person months 
of 
Long-term 
TA; 
10 
person months 
(40 
wks.) 
of 
ST 
international 
TA 
Around 
250 
person 
weeks 
of 
short-term 
national 
TA; 
and 
48 
months 
of 
"on-line" 
support 
from 
partnering 
institution(s). 
To 
provide 
long-term 
sustainability 
to 
the 
NEAS, 
preference 
will 
be 
given 
to 
obtaining national 
and 
international 
TA 
through linkages 
with 
institutions 
that have 
expertise 
in 
student 
assessment, 
preferably 
in 
a 
developing 
country 
context. 
There 
will 
be 
need 
for 
development 
of 
professional 
linkages 
with 
institutions 
which 
have regional, 
national 
and 
international 
expertise 
in 
assessment 
expertise, 
particularly 
in 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
project. 
Development 
of 
core 
professional 
teams 
and 
improving 
working 
environment: 
Two 
other 
important 
sub-components 
of 
the 
capacity 
building 
will 
be 
(a) 
the 
development 
of 
core 
professional 
teams 
in 
NEAS, 
-27- 
Page  34
PEACEs; 
(b) 
assessment 
cells 
in 
the 
areas 
(NA, 
AJK, 
FATA, 
ICT) 
and 
provision 
of 
essential 
basic 
facilities 
to 
these 
centers/cells; 
and 
(c) 
strengthening 
of 
accounting, 
procurement and 
audit 
system. 
The 
costs 
would 
include: 
(i) 
salary and allowances 
of 
core 
staff 
and 
remuneration 
to 
subject experts associated 
with 
specific 
assignments 
such 
as 
monitoring; 
and 
(ii) 
renovation 
of 
buildings, 
refurbishing 
offices, and 
operation and 
maintenance. 
Each 
of 
the 
provinces and 
areas, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Federal 
government 
has 
committed to 
providing 
staff to 
fill 
eight 
core 
positions 
on 
each 
PEACE 
or 
NEAS 
team.  These 
core 
positions include: 
(i) 
subject 
specialist 
(4); 
(ii) 
system 
analyst; 
(iii) 
PEACE 
coordinator; 
(iv) 
computer operator 
/ 
programmer; and 
(v) 
assessment 
expert. 
The 
Federal 
and 
Provincial 
governments have agreed 
to 
pick 
up 
the 
full 
salary 
burden 
of 
these 
positions 
on 
their 
own 
budgets. 
The 
Bank 
financing 
would 
be 
zero 
for 
incremental 
salaries 
so 
that government 
has 
full 
ownership 
in 
terms 
of 
provision 
of 
financing.  However, 
Bank 
would 
finance 
the 
incremental 
operating 
costs 
on 
declining 
basis. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
provide 
equipment 
necessary 
to 
realize 
the 
basic 
administrative 
requirements 
for 
assessment 
production, 
analysis, 
and dissemination. 
This 
will 
include: 
(i) 
equipment 
(computers, 
printers, 
optical 
readers, 
fax 
machines, 
and 
type 
writers 
etc.); 
(ii) 
furniture, 
books and journals, 
stationary and 
office 
supplies; 
and 
(iii) 
printing 
of 
all 
materials. 
Initial 
capitalization 
of 
equipment 
necessary 
for 
carrying 
out 
the 
assessment 
design 
and 
analysis 
activities 
will 
be 
heaviest 
in 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
the 
project. 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that 
funds 
will 
be 
required 
in 
each 
province/area 
for 
acquisition 
of 
several commuters, 
minor 
remodeling 
required 
to 
house 
the 
new 
unit, 
printers, 
a 
photocopier and 
miscellaneous equipment. 
For 
the 
remaining 
years 
of 
the 
project, 
funds 
will 
be 
required 
for 
additional 
equipment 
purchases 
such 
as 
optical 
scanners, 
equipment 
repair 
and 
upgrading, 
purchase 
of 
assessment-related 
books 
and 
materials 
for 
reference purposes, 
access 
to 
on-line 
sources 
through 
the inter-net, 
and 
for 
communications 
costs 
for 
interaction 
with 
the 
partner 
institutions 
for 
the 
project. 
Project Component 
2 
- 
US$1.46 
million 
Pilot 
Testing 
and 
Implementation: 
The 
pilot 
testing 
and 
implementation 
component 
would 
include 
the 
following: 
(a) 
develop comprehensive 
framework 
for 
grade 1-8; 
(b) 
develop 
assessment 
items 
for 
grade-4 
and 
grade-8 (Language, math, science, 
social/life 
skills); 
(c) 
develop 
instruments 
for 
gathering 
background 
data; 
(d) 
design 
sample; 
(e) 
administer 
assessment; 
(0 
enter 
data; 
(g) 
carry out 
analysis; 
(h) 
prepare reports; 
(i) 
establish 
student 
achievement benchmarks 
and 
develop 
subsequent 
periodic 
assessments, 
including 
data 
on 
background 
variables 
or 
the 
'conditions 
of 
learning'; 
('j) 
establish 
NEAS 
Unit 
in 
the 
CW 
(MOE) 
with 
assessment 
professionals, support 
staff 
and facilities, 
office 
space, 
equipment, 
supplies; 
and 
(k) 
coordinate 
with 
and 
support 
ProvinciaVArea 
assessment 
activities 
to 
develop 
an 
integrated 
national 
assessment 
system. 
The 
costs 
would 
include 
costs 
for all 
development 
activities, 
pilot 
testing, 
analysis 
and 
associated costs 
for 
administering and 
revising 
instruments 
to 
the 
point 
of 
reaching 
acceptable 
standards. 
In 
addition, 
it 
would 
also 
include 
costs 
relating 
to 
transportation, 
reproduction 
of 
instruments, 
TA/DA, 
salaries 
for 
temporary 
staff 
such 
as 
field 
workers and 
honoraria. 
Project Component

- 
US$ 
0.13 
million 
Information 
Dissemination: 
This 
component 
will 
consist 
of 
analysis, 
interpretation 
and 
dissemination 
of 
assessment 
information, 
findings, 
and recommendations 
to 
stakeholders 
for 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
through 
strategic 
interventions. 
National provincial 
conferences 
will 
be 
held 
to 
disseminate 
the 
findings 
of 
assessment. Pre-assessment 
publicity 
concerning 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
exercise 
will 
be 
crucial 
to 
ensuring 
that 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
instrument 
occurs 
without problem 
and 
that 
the 
results 
are 
received 
as 
instructive 
and 
not 
threatening. 
The 
GOP, 
Goprovinces 
and 
GoAJK 
has 
agreed 
to 
spearhead 
an 
information 
- 
28 
- 
Page  35
dissemination 
campaign 
using 
national and 
local 
media, 
and 
inaugural 
events 
to 
educate stakeholders 
about 
the purpose 
and 
utility 
of 
assessment. 
When 
results 
are available, 
it 
will 
be 
imperative 
that results 
are 
published, 
discussed, 
and 
reviewed 
for policy 
implications 
among various 
stakeholders 
Research 
and evaluation efforts 
in 
Pakistan 
have 
traditionally 
suffered 
from 
poor 
dissemination 
and 
under-utilization. 
Thus, 
national 
conferences 
will 
be 
held 
to: 
(a) 
discuss 
the recommendations; 
(b) 
identify 
strategies 
for 
raising 
student 
learning 
achievement; 
and 
(c) 
propose 
achievement 
targets 
for 
the 
second 
cycle 
of 
assessment. 
Provincial 
conferences 
will 
be 
held 
to: 
(i) 
review 
national 
targets 
and 
set 
provincial 
targets; 
(ii) 
develop 
an action 
plan 
for 
the 
province; 
and 
(iii) 
propose 
monitoring 
indicators 
for 
schools 
and 
districts. 
PEACEs 
would 
develop a 
rolling 
program 
of 
in-service 
training 
days 
for 
teachers 
on: 
designing 
a 
test 
and 
specifications, 
identifying 
abilities beyond 
the 
recall 
level, 
assessing 
a range 
of 
abilities 
(one 
day 
in 
each 
subject).

Annex 
4: 
Cost Benefit Analysis Summary 
PAKISTAN: National Education Assessment System 
Summary 
of 
Benefits 
and 
Costs: 
Provided 
the 
data generated 
by 
the 
new 
assessment 
system 
are 
properly utilized, 
the 
resulting 
economic 
benefits 
would 
be 
large. 
There 
would 
be 
efficiency 
gains 
in 
government education expenditure 
resulting 
from 
better resource 
allocation 
decisions 
(made 
possible 
by 
the 
new 
data), 
which would 
enable 
a 
given 
output 
of 
the 
government's 
education 
system 
to 
be 
produced 
at 
a 
lower 
cost 
to 
society. 
And, 
to 
the 
extent that 
proper 
utilization 
of 
the 
new 
data 
eventually 
resulted 
in 
a 
better 
quality 
of 
education and better 
skills 
acquired 
through 
schooling, 
the 
future 
productivity 
and 
hence 
the 
earnings 
of 
school 
graduates 
should 
also 
be 
higher 
than 
in 
the 
without-project 
situation. 
Thus, 
although 
no 
quantification 
of 
benefits 
has 
been attempted 
here, 
it 
is 
likely 
that economic 
benefits 
would 
far 
exceed the 
relatively 
small 
costs 
of 
establishing 
and 
running 
the 
new 
assessment 
system.

Annex 6(A):  Procurement  Arrangements 
PAKISTAN: National Education Assessment System 
Procurement 
1. 
Procurement 
Capacitv 
Assessment 
Organization: 
A 
procurement capacity 
assessment 
was 
carried 
out 
which 
indicated 
that 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies, 
i.e. 
the 
Curriculum 
Wing 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
at 
the 
federal 
level 
and 
the 
Education 
Departments at the 
provincial/area 
level, 
who 
are 
responsible 
for 
carrying 
out 
procurement 
activities, 
are 
generally 
proficient 
with 
implementing 
low 
value 
procurement 
of 
goods 
but 
have 
had very 
limited 
exposure 
to 
the 
hiring 
of 
consultants. 
While 
some 
staff 
members 
are 
familiar 
with 
the 
procurement 
procedures 
of 
other donors 
such 
as 
the 
Asian 
Development Bank, 
they 
have 
no 
prior 
experience 
on 
IDA 
financed 
procurement. 
It 
was 
therefore 
agreed that 
a 
qualified 
and experienced 
individual 
Procurement 
Consultant 
will 
be 
engaged 
by 
the 
Curriculum 
Wing 
(CW) 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
(MoE) 
at 
the 
federal 
level, 
for 
at 
least 
the 
first 
six 
months 
of 
the 
project during 
which 
most 
of 
the 
procurement 
are 
expected 
to 
take place. 
The 
procurement consultant 
will 
serve 
as 
the 
focal point 
for 
all 
procurement 
activities under 
the 
project 
and 
will 
provide 
full 
procurement support 
to 
CW 
at 
the 
federal 
level 
as 
well 
as 
the 
provincial/area education 
departments, 
including 
assistance 
in 
the 
procurement 
planning 
and 
monitoring, 
preparation 
of 
Request 
for 
QuotatiodProposal 
documents, 
bid 
evaluations, 
contract 
award 
procedures. 
The 
consultant 
will 
also 
provide 
hands-on 
training 
to 
the 
implementing 
agency 
staff. 
The 
hiring 
of 
the 
procurement 
consultant 
will 
provide 
adequate resources 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
procurement 
activities 
foreseen 
under 
the 
project. 
IDA 
will 
assist 
in 
capacity 
building 
by 
conducting procurement 
training 
workshops 
for 
key 
procurement 
staff 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies, 
during 
the 
first 
3 
months 
of 
the 
project, 
in 
order 
to improve 
their 
knowledge 
of 
IDA’S 
procurement 
procedures. 
Overall, capacity 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
involved 
with 
procurement 
is 
“fair’ 
and 
the 
associated 
risks 
are 
in 
the 
“average”  category. 
While 
the 
agencies’ 
staff 
has 
little 
experience 
in 
implementing 
IDA-financed 
procurement, 
this 
shortcoming 
will 
be 
mitigated 
with 
the 
hiring 
of 
an 
individual 
procurement consultant 
by 
the 
CW 
at 
the 
federal 
level 
and 
training 
provided 
by 
IDA. 
Prior 
review 
thresholds have 
been 
agreed 
that 
are 
commensurate 
to 
the 
level 
of 
risk. 
A 
Procurement Supervision 
mission 
will 
be carried 
out 
every 
six 
months 
and 
procurement 
ex-post 
reviews 
at 
least once 
every 
year. 
2. 
Procurement 
Procedures 
There 
are 
some 
differences between 
the 
procurement procedures 
and 
practices 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
and 
those 
of 
IDA; 
for 
example, 
pre-registration 
requirements, 
the 
time allowed 
for 
bid 
submission, 
price 
negotiations 
etc. 
Such differences 
will 
be resolved 
through 
the 
application 
of 
appropriate 
procurement 
procedures 
based 
on 
the 
Bank’ 
Guidelines 
which 
will 
be 
required 
to 
be 
followed 
on 
all 
procurement 
under 
the 
project 
and 
will 
take precedence 
in 
case 
of 
conflict 
with 
Government’s 
procedures.  Goods 
to 
be 
financed under 
the 
project 
shall 
be 
procured 
in

value, 
ranging 
between 
US$4,00O-US$50,000 
equivalent 
per 
contract 
for 
a 
total 
amount 
of 
approximately 
USS520,OOO. 
Such 
small 
contracts 
do 
not 
warrant national 
or 
international 
competition. 
Therefore, 
all 
procurement 
of 
goods 
under 
the 
project 
will 
be 
carried out through 
National 
Shopping 
procedures. 
3. 
Procurement 
Planning 
Preliminary 
procurement plans 
for 
goods 
and 
consultants’ 
services

Disbursement Arrangements 
PAKISTAN: 
National 
Education Assessment System 
Financial 
Manapement 
1. 
Summary 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
The financial 
management 
system 
in 
place at 
the 
curriculum 
wing 
is 
adequate 
and 
can 
produce 
financial 
statements 
for 
the 
project. 
Hence, 
normal 
supervision 
by 
Bank 
missions 
will 
be 
carried out. 
The 
flows 
of 
funds 
and accounting 
process 
to 
be 
followed for 
NEAS 
have 
been observed 
to 
be 
consistent 
and 
accurate. 
The 
curriculum 
wings 
(CW) 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
Islamabad, 
and 
provincial 
I 
area 
education 
departments 
are 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
of 
the 
project. 
None 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
has 
prior 
experience 
of 
implementing 
projects financed 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Financial 
management 
assessment 
of 
the 
CW, 
MoE, 
Bureau 
of 
Curriculum, Balochistan and 
Bureau 
of 
Curriculum, Sindh 
(now 
converted 
into 
Directorate 
of 
Research 
and 
Assessment) 
was 
conducted 
during 
appraisal 
in 
April 
2002. 
The 
other 
implementing 
agencies 
in 
the 
Punjab, 
the 
North 
West 
Frontier 
Province and 
AJK 
also 
follow 
the 
same 
government 
accounting 
system. 
Hence, 
separate 
visits 
were 
not 
required. 
The 
CW, 
MoE, 
Islamabad 
would 
coordinate 
activities 
of 
the 
other 
implementing 
agencies. 
The project 
would 
be 
headed 
by 
a 
project 
director 
assisted 
by 
a 
project 
coordinator. 
An 
Accounts 
Officer, 
holding 
Masters 
degree 
in 
Commerce, 
and 
a 
cashier are 
being 
recruited 
in 
the 
CW, 
Islamabad 
to 
perform 
the 
relevant 
financial 
management 
functions. 
Provincial 
/ 
Area 
PEACEs 
will 
also 
appoint an 
accounts 
officer 
and a 
cashier. 
Funds 
Flow 
and 
Accounting 
Arrangements 
The 
bulk 
of 
the 
project 
costs 
would fall 
under 
consultancy and 
training. 
The 
Bank’s procurement 
guidelines 
would 
be 
used 
for 
procurement 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
Bank’s 
share 
in 
thefinancing 
of 
project 
costs 
would 
be 
disbursed 
using 
a Special 
Account 
to 
be 
operated 
by 
the 
federal 
CW, 
MOE, 
while 
Government 
procedures 
would 
be 
used 
for 
government 
funds. 
Provincial 
I 
Area PEACEs 
would 
submit 
expenditure 
statements 
to 
the federal 
curriculum 
wing 
for 
reimbursement 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis. 
The 
Accounting 
sections 
of 
the 
federal 
and 
provincial 
assessment 
cells 
would 
maintain 
accounts 
for 
the 
project 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Government’s 
cash 
accounting 
system. 
The 
chart 
of 
accounts 
would 
be 
based 
on 
the 
project 
costs 
as 
approved 
by 
the 
Government 
which 
are 
in 
line 
with 
the 
project 
components. 
Separate 
cash 
books 
would 
be 
maintained 
for 
counterpart 
funds 
and 
the 
Special 
Account.  Expenditure 
would 
be 
recorded 
by 
disbursement 
category and 
project 
activity 
and 
monitored regularly 
against 
the 
budget. 
A 
record 
of 
the 
fixed 
assets 
procured 
for 
the 
project 
would 
also 
be 
kept 
and 
assets 
tagged 
for 
identification. 
Expenditure 
incurred 
by 
the 
provincial 
implementing 
agencies 
would 
be 
reported 
to 
the 
federal 
curriculum 
wing on 
a 
monthly 
basis 
for 
consolidation and 
reporting 
purposes. 
Transaction-based disbursement 
procedures 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
used 
for 
disbursement 
of 
Bank 
funds. 
Internal 
Control 
The 
Government’s 
internal 
control 
procedures 
would 
be 
followed for 
payments that 
would 
be 
made 
through 
crossed 
cheques 
[for 
both 
Special 
Account 
and 
counterpart 
funds] 
to 
be 
signed 
jointly 
by 
two 
senior 
officials. 
Project 
accounts 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
periodic internal 
audit 
by 
the 
federal 
ministry, 
AJK 
and 
provincial 
departments 
of 
education. 
Risk 
Analysis 
There 
are 
no 
significant 
project 
specific 
risks 
as 
far 
as 
use 
of 
funds 
for 
intended 
purposes 
is 
concerned 
since 
there 
would 
be 
adequate 
segregation 
of 
duties 
in 
respect 
of 
processing 
payments, 
approval and 
book 
keeping.

The 
audit reports 
of 
the 
three 
implementing 
agencies 
(Federal, 
Balochistan and 
Sindh) whose 
financial 
management 
assessment 
was 
carried 
out 
did 
not 
contain any material 
weaknesses. 
None 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
has 
been 
involved 
in 
any 
project 
financed 
by 
the 
Bank. 
Country 
risks 
include 
inadequate 
budget 
management 
and 
control 
and outdated 
financial 
rules. 
However, 
these 
aspects 
are 
being 
addressed 
by 
the 
Government 
through 
improvement 
in 
budgetary 
control 
and 
reconciliation 
of 
expenditure 
between 
the 
line 
departments, 
the 
Accountant 
General’s 
office 
and 
the 
Treasury. 
These 
improvements 
would 
have 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 
financial 
management 
of 
the 
project. 
Financial 
Reporting 
The 
following 
quarterly 
financial 
monitoring 
reports 
would

Plan 
Since 
the 
financial 
management arrangements 
to 
be 
used 
for 
the 
project 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
adequate, 
Bank’s 
normal 
supervision 
plan 
i.e. 
six 
monthly 
missions 
may 
be 
carried 
out. 
However, 
special 
attention 
would 
need 
to 
be 
paid 
to 
budgetary 
control 
over 
expenditure.

conducted 
by 
the 
Auditor 
General 
of 
Pakistan 
who 
is

Terms 
of 
Reference 
for 
Resident Technical Adviser (RTA) 
PAKISTAN: National Education Assessment 
System 
Applications 
are 
invited 
for 
the 
position 
of 
Resident 
Technical 
Adviser 
who 
will 
over 
a three 
year 
period 
assist 
the 
Curriculum 
Wing 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
of 
Pakistan 
in 
setting 
up 
a 
national 
education 
assessment 
system. 
The 
Adviser 
would 
reside 
in 
Islamabad 
but 
travel 
extensively 
throughout 
Pakistan 
to 
assist 
the 
various 
provincial 
centers 
in 
their 
efforts to 
carry out 
two 
cycles 
of 
the 
national 
assessment. 
The 
adviser 
would 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
in 
all 
phases 
of 
the 
assessment 
as 
well 
as 
organize 
and 
provide 
on-the-job 
training to 
local 
staff. 
In 
these 
capacity 
building 
efforts, 
the 
adviser 
would 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
experts 
of 
one/two 
new 
assessment 
training 
centers. 
1. 
Background 
The 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
is 
committed 
to 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
education along 
with 
its 
efforts 
to 
increase 
enrollment 
and 
access. 
This 
commitment 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
government’s 
policy 
documents 
(National Education 
Policy 
1998-2010, 
Education 
Sector 
Reforms 
2001-05) 
and 
in 
its 
reaffirmation 
at 
international forums (Jomtien 
Declaration 
1990 and 
EFA 
Assessment 
2000, 
Dakar) 
to 
include quality 
outcomes 
such 
as 
student 
achievement 
scores, 
as 
performance 
monitoring 
indicators 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Curriculum 
Wing 
(CW) 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education (MoE) 
has 
the 
legal 
mandate 
for 
‘maintenance 
of 
standards 
of 
education’. 
The 
National 
Education 
Assessment 
System 
(NEAS) 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
programs 
of 
the 
Education 
Sector 
Reforms 
(ESR). 
In 
view 
of 
the 
above 
commitments, 
the 
Federal and 
Provincial 
Governments have taken 
some 
assessment 
initiatives 
under 
development 
projects 
in 
the 
past. 
Most 
of 
these 
assessment 
activities 
have 
been 
project 
driven 
and 
there 
is 
no 
institutional 
base 
either 
at 
the 
Federal 
or 
the 
Provincial 
level 
to 
sustain 
assessment 
activities 
beyond 
the 
project 
periods.  Consequently, 
there 
is 
also 
little 
evidence 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
project 
investments 
in 
training and 
human 
resource 
development 
in 
the 
field 
of 
student 
assessment. 
The initiatives 
taken 
so 
far 
are 
on 
a 
small 
scale 
and 
lack 
standardization and 
comparability. 
Neither 
the 
traditional 
school 
examinations 
nor 
the 
external 
public 
examinations 
administered 
for 
certification 
purposes, 
nor 
the 
selection 
tests 
for 
admission 
to 
institutions 
of 
higher 
education, 
sufficiently 
fulfill 
the 
criteria 
of 
standardization 
and 
comparability required 
of 
a 
monitoring 
indicator. 
A 
dialogue about 
the 
need 
and mechanism 
for 
establishing 
a 
National 
Education 
Assessment 
System 
(NEAS) 
as 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
education 
system 
in 
Pakistan, was 
initiated 
in 
a 
national 
workshop 
at 
Lahore 
in 
December 
1997. 
This 
initiative 
was 
followed 
by 
a 
series 
of 
nationaliprovincial 
workshops 
and Technical 
Group 
Meetings 
(TGMs). 
Consensus 
about 
Federal 
and 
Provincial 
roles 
in 
conducting 
assessments, 
and 
the 
broad 
dimensions 
of 
the 
assessments, 
was 
reached 
at 
the 
TGM 
held 
in 
Islamabad 
from 
February 
18-19, 
2000. 
A 
further 
series 
of 
Provincial 
Workshops and 
National 
TGMs 
held 
since 
that 
time 
have 
helped 
to 
further 
build 
consensus, 
better 
define 
Federal and ProvinciaUArea 
roles, 
and 
develop 
Federal and 
Provincial/Area 
PC-Is, 
to 
resource the 
NEAS 
and 
assure 
its 
sustainability. 
It 
was 
also proposed that 
NEAS 
and 
PEACE 
would 
be 
developed 
with 
Federal 
and 
Provincial 
coordination. 
The 
Federal 
Unit 
of 
NEAS 
at 
the 
Curriculum 
Wing 
(CW), 
MoE 
would 
have 
a 
coordinating 
role 
and 
support 
the 
assessment 
initiatives 
in 
the 
ProvincedAreas. 
PEACEs 
would 
be 
established 
in 
the 
Departments 
of 
Education 
(DOES) 
to 
undertake 
assessment 
activities 
in 
the Provinces/Areas. 
The 
two 
most 
recent 
TGMs, 
in 
December 2001 and 
January 2002, 
effectively 
completed 
the 
preparatory 
phase 
of 
the 
NEAS. 
The 
NEAS 
is 
now 
an 
accepted fact. 
In 
the 
TGM 
of 
March 
13-14,2002, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
it 
discussed 
in 
detail 
the 
initial 
phase 
of 
implementation, 
arriving 
at 
consensus 
at 
steps 
to 
be 
taken, 
and responsibilities 
for 
them. 
-47- 
Page  54
NEAS/PEACE 
would 
be 
new 
initiatives 
in 
Pakistan and need 
technical 
input 
from 
experts, 
particularly 
at 
the 
start-up 
stage. 
The 
CW 
in 
the 
MoE 
would 
require 
the 
services 
of 
a 
Resident 
Technical 
Adviser 
to 
provide 
technical 
inputs 
for 
establishing 
the 
NEAS/PEACE 
Units 
and 
for 
providing 
leadership 
in 
implementing 
NEAYPEACE 
activities. 
The 
Resident 
Technical 
Adviser 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
developing 
the 
institutional 
and human 
resource capacity 
of 
NEAS 
and 
PEACE 
Units 
to 
conduct national 
assessments 
on 
a 
periodic 
basis, 
as 
a 
monitoring 
mechanism and 
to provide 
necessary 
feedback 
to 
stakeholders 
for policy 
reforms 
to improve 
the 
quality 
of 
elementary education 
in 
Pakistan. 
To 
institutionalize 
an 
indigenous 
capacity-building capability, 
it 
is 
anticipated 
that 
two 
or 
more 
local 
universities 
/ 
institutions 
will 
be 
identified 
as 
sites 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
flexible 
degree/certificate 
level 
courses 
for 
NEAS 
and 
PEACE 
staff. 
The 
Resident 
Technical 
Adviser 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
work 
with 
the 
appropriate 
local 
institutions 
in 
developing 
the 
curriculum 
for 
their 
certificate 
programs 
and 
in 
assisting 
in 
the 
instruction.

and 
in 
its 
reaffirmation 
at 
international 
forums 
(Jomtien 
Declaration 
1990 and 
EFA 
Assessment 
2000, 
Dakar) 
to include quality 
outcomes 
such 
as 
student 
achievement 
scores, 
as 
performance 
monitoring 
indicators 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Curriculum 
Wing 
(CW) 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education (MoE) 
has 
the 
legal 
mandate 
for 
‘maintenance 
of 
standards 
of 
education’. 
The 
National 
Education 
Assessment 
System 
(NEAS) 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
programs 
of 
the 
Education 
Sector 
Reforms 
(ESR). 
In 
view 
of 
the 
above 
commitments, 
the 
Federal 
and 
Provincial 
Governments 
have 
taken 
some 
assessment 
initiatives 
under 
development 
projects 
in 
the 
past. 
Most 
of 
these assessment 
activities 
have 
been 
project 
driven 
and 
there 
is 
no 
institutional 
base 
either 
at 
the 
Federal 
or 
the 
Provincial 
level 
to 
sustain 
assessment 
activities 
beyond 
the 
project’s period. 
Consequently, 
there 
is 
also 
little 
evidence 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
project 
investments 
in 
training 
and 
human 
resource 
development 
in 
the 
field 
of 
student 
assessment. 
The 
initiatives 
taken 
so 
far 
are 
on 
a 
small 
scale 
and 
lack 
standardization and 
comparability. 
Neither 
the 
traditional 
school 
examinations 
nor 
the 
external 
public 
examinations 
administered 
for 
certification 
purposes, 
nor 
the 
selection 
tests 
for 
admission 
to institutions 
of 
higher 
education, 
sufficiently 
fulfill 
the 
criteria 
of 
standardization 
and 
comparability required 
of 
a 
monitoring 
indicator. 
A 
dialogue about 
the 
need 
and mechanism 
for 
establishing 
a 
National 
Education 
Assessment 
System (NEAS) 
as 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
education 
system 
in 
Pakistan, was 
initiated 
in 
a 
national 
workshop 
at 
Lahore 
in 
December 
1997. 
This 
initiative 
was 
followed 
by 
a 
series 
of 
nationallprovincial 
workshops 
and Technical 
Group 
Meetings 
(TGMs). 
Consensus 
about 
Federal and 
Provincial 
roles 
in 
conducting 
assessments, 
and 
the 
broad 
dimensions 
of 
the 
assessments, 
was 
reached at 
the 
TGM 
held 
in 
Islamabad 
from 
February 
18-19,2000. 
A 
further 
series 
of 
Provincial 
Workshops and 
National 
TGMs 
held 
since 
that 
time 
have 
helped 
to 
further 
build 
consensus, 
better 
define Federal and 
ProvincialIArea 
roles, 
and 
develop 
Federal and 
ProvincialIArea 
PC-Is, 
to 
resource the 
NEAS 
and 
assure 
its 
sustainability. 
It 
was also 
proposed that 
NEAS 
and 
PEACE 
would 
be 
developed 
with 
Federal 
and 
Provincial 
coordination. 
The 
Federal 
Unit 
of 
NEAS 
at the 
Curriculum 
Wing 
(CW), 
MoE 
would 
have 
a 
coordinating 
role 
and 
support 
the 
assessment 
initiatives 
in 
the ProvincesIAreas. 
PEACEs 
would 
be 
established 
in 
the 
Departments 
of 
Education 
(DOES) 
to 
undertake 
assessment 
activities 
in 
the ProvincesIAreas. 
The 
two 
most 
recent 
TGMs, 
in 
December 
2001 
and 
January 2002, 
effectively 
completed

the 
preparatory 
phase 
of 
the 
NEAS. 
The 
NEAS 
is 
now 
an accepted fact. 
In 
the 
TGM 
of 
March 
13-14,2002, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
it 
discussed 
in 
detail 
the 
initial 
phase 
of 
implementation, 
arriving 
at consensus at 
steps 
to 
be 
taken, 
and 
responsibilities 
for 
them.

NEASIPEACE would 
be 
new 
initiatives 
in 
Pakistan 
and need 
technical 
input 
from 
experts, 
particularly 
at 
the 
start-up 
stage. 
The 
CW 
in 
the 
MoE 
would 
require 
the 
services 
of 
a 
Resident 
Technical 
Adviser 
to 
provide 
technical 
inputs 
for 
establishing 
the 
NEASIPEACE 
Units 
and 
for 
providing 
leadership 
in 
implementing 
NEASIPEACE 
activities. 
The 
Resident

Adviser 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
initiating 
activities 
to 
develop 
the 
institutional 
and

of 
NEAS 
and

Units 
to 
conduct

However, 
to 
achieve 
the 
long-term sustainability 
to 
Pakistan’s 
assessment 
activities, 
it 
is 
recognized 
that 
the 
technical 
inputs 
and 
training initiatives 
of 
the Resident 
Technical 
Adviser 
will 
need 
to 
be

the 
opportunity 
to work 
with 
the 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
in 
accomplishing 
the 
above 
objectives 
should

technical 
and a 
financial 
proposal 
to 
submit 
to 
, , 
. 
.. 
by 
5 
P.M on 
... 
The 
technical proposal should 
focus 
on 
the 
following 
matters: 
General understanding 
of 
the 
role 
of 
assessments. 
Understanding 
of 
NEASJPEACE 
and 
the 
plans 
thus 
far 
devised 
by 
the 
Technical 
Working 
Group. 
For 
further 
information, 
potential 
bidders 
may 
contact 
. . . 
.. 
for 
a packet 
of 
materials. 
A 
clear 
specification 
of 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
long-term 
technical 
adviser 
can 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
assessment. 
Understanding 
of 
the 
one 
I 
two 
universities 
I 
institutions 
in 
Pakistan 
where 
the 
assessment 
training 
centers 
are 
to 
be 
developed, 
and 
a discussion 
of 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
certificate 
programs that 
might 
be 
appropriate 
for 
these 
institutions. 
Identification 
of 
the 
long 
and short-term technical 
personnel that the 
organization 
would 
provide 
to 
meet 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
RFP, 
along 
with 
a 
definite 
time 
line 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
their 
services. 
This 
time 
line 
should indicate 
a clear understanding that the 
NEAS 
project 
is 
a 
high 
priority item for 
the 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
and 
that 
strict 
deadlines 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
these 
services 
must 
be 
adhered to. 
Discussion 
of 
the 
opportunities 
for 
the 
masters’ 
training 
programs 
in 
assessment 
that the 
professional 
staff 
from 
Pakistan 
would 
attend 
with 
details 
on 
the 
courses 
to 
be 
included 
in 
these 
programs and 
the 
expected 
scheduling and 
duration 
of 
these 
programs; 
the 
discussion 
might 
outline 
options 
that 
include 
some 
instruction 
provided 
in 
Pakistan 
as 
part 
of 
the 
certificate 
programs, 
some 
instruction through 
distance 
education 
or 
other 
self-learning 
modes, 
and 
some 
at 
the 
home 
campus 
of 
the 
contracting 
organization. 
A 
management 
plan 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
all 
components. 
This 
management 
plan 
might 
involve 
the 
contracting organization 
linking 
with 
one 
or 
more 
additional 
organizations 
for 
certain 
components 
of 
the 
program 
(e.g. 
a 
testing 
organization 
linking 
up 
with 
one 
or 
more 
universities). 
A 
key 
consideration 
in 
the 
management 
plan 
should 
be 
to 
ensure 
a coherent 
and 
consistent 
approach 
in 
all 
of 
the 
project’s activities. 
If 
desired, 
the 
proposal 
might 
also 
include 
provision 
for 
the 
resident 
technical 
adviser described 
in 
a 
separate 
announcement. 
In 
considering 
the resident 
technical 
adviser, 
the 
proposal 
might 
wish to 
enlarge the 
concept 
to 
include 
two 
individuals 
(one 
classified 
as 
an 
international 
resident 
technical 
adviser 
and 
a 
second 
classified 
as 
a 
local 
resident 
technical 
adviser). 
Other related 
matters that 
might 
come 
to 
mind. 
The 
financial 
proposal should 
provide 
a 
budget 
parallel 
with 
the 
components 
of 
the 
technical 
proposal. 
The 
total 
cost 
for 
the 
proposed technical 
assistance 
and training 
exclusive 
of 
the 
resident technical 
adviser 
should 
not 
exceed 
$ 
... 
million.

available 
international literature 
on 
educational 
policy 
making 
and 
the 
factors 
influencing 
educational 
quality, and
