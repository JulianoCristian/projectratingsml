Republic of\n            Pakistan's National Education Assessment System Pro,TFS50854-NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSESSMENT SYSTEM", "versiontyp": "Buff cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the National Education\n            Assessment System (NEAS) Project for Pakistan were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: with strong ownership of\n            assessment by the Government through the integration of\n            staff into the revenue budget, the true institutionalization\n            will require moving towards a semi- or autonomous body so\n            that the credibility of NEAS is fully established\n            technically, financially, and administratively. The\n            discrepancy between the planned samples and the actually\n            achieved samples in the four rounds of assessment points to\n            the need to improve the administration of the tests to allow\n            a more representative sample of schools and students. In\n            this regard, NEAS should ensure that, during the regular\n            round of national assessment, the sampled public schools are\n            all interviewed so that they can have a valid representation\n            of Government schools in Pakistan. As one of the main\n            objectives of NEAS is to identify correlates of student\n            achievement, future dissemination activities of the NEAS\n            network should present findings from analyzing the rich\n            assessment database and produce targeted reports for various\n            stakeholder groups to get feedbacks that could, in turn,\n            feed into the assessment system. In light of the weaknesses\n            in financial management observed during the project cycle,\n            accounts officers should not be involved in administrative\n            work as this leads to weak controls and also delay in\n            submission of financial reports. Furthermore, since there\n            was only one designated account established under the\n            International Development Association (IDA) credit, the fund\n            flow to the provinces was problematic. To overcome the fund\n            flow problem, each implementation agency should have its\n            separate designated account."}, "docdt": "2009-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
