1.        I submit the following report and recomaendation on a proposed
cre:' t in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$1.5 million to the
People's Republic of Congo to assist in financing a road project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Government of Congo (Brazzaville) has requested the assitance
of the Association in financing a highway improvement project. In 1965, a
Bank mission identified the improvement of the Pointe Noire - Bondi road
(43 km) as a possible project.  The feasibility study and the detailed
engineering of this road were financed out of an IDA highTway engineering
credit of US$630,000 of May 1969 (Credit S-6 COB). Upon completion of theso
studies, the proposed project was appraised in November 1969.
3.        Negotiations with a delegation led by Mr. Victor Tamba-Tamba,
Secretary of State for Equipment, were completed in Washington on March 26
1970.
4.        The following is a summary of Bank loans and IDA credits to Congo
as of March 31, 1970.

5.        During negotiations the Plan of Operation for a railroad study to
be financed by UIDP was also agreed upon.   This study may lead, in due course,
to requests to the Bank Group and other agencies for assistance in financing
a railway realignment and track renewal project. A project for the construc-
tion of a road (Sibiti-Zanaga, 144 km), the engineering of which was included
in Credit S-6 COB of May 1969, should be ready for appraisal later this year.
An education project was appraised recently.



6.        The project road supports the transport of supplies to the CPC
potash mine and refinery, opened in 1969. The CPC project has encountered
a number of technical and financial difficulties. Construction was completed
and production began in 1969 as scheduled, but, due to adverse geological
conditions, output remained lower than expected. Construction costs substan-
tially exceeded original estimates. However, the shareholders have recently
undertaken to cover the overrun with interest-free advances, thereby
manifesting their commitmeint to the project.  Tnis solves the immediate
financial problems, and ensures that production will be maintained.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CREDIT
7. Bor,cnwer:          The People's Republic of Congo
m>qount:           US$ 1.5 million equivalent in various currencies
PLu;rose:          The improvement of 34.1 Ian of road from Pointe Noire
to Makola, and consultants' services for supervision
of construction.
Estimated Economic
Return:          17 percent per annum.
Amortization:      In fifty years, including a ten-year period of grace.
through 80 semi-annual installments beginning INoveniler
15, 1980 and ending May 15, 2020.
Service Charge:    3/4 of one percent per annum
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        The report "A4ppraisal of a Highway Improvement Project - Repliblic
of Congo" (April 17, 1970, PTR-43a) is attached. Congo's transport systemri
consists of about 10,850 km of roads and tracks, 2,300 km of navigable
waterways, and 800 km of railroads. This network handles not only internal
traffic, but also serves the international trade of Chad, Central African
Republic (CAR) and Gabon. Under- a convention betTreen Congo, OAR, Chad and Gabon,
a regional agency (ATEC) operated and maintained, from 1961 to 1969, a river,
rail and road system serving international trade between the ocean port of
Pointe Noire and the interior of Equatorial Africa.   On October 24, 1969,
the Government of Congo took over the assets of ATEC located within its
territory; the Government of CAR followed suit, and ATEC has virtually ceased
to exist. Although the proposed project is not affected by this decision,
these developments raised the question whether traffic on the trans-equatorial
route could continue to flow without interruption or increase in cost. Tnis
was discussed during negotiations. The Government representatives explained
that a series of bilateral agreements have been negotiated between the Govern-
ments concerned to divide the assets of ALEC and to ensure coordination in
operating national transport facilities which had formerly been managed by
ATEC. An agreement between the Governments of Congo and CAR was signed in
January 1970. The Government is re-negotiating existing agreements with
creditors of the former ATEC.

9.      The Government of Congo gives high priority to the development of
the transportation infrastructure. The draft development plan includes
proposals for improving rivers and railways, and for upgrading trunk roads
linking Brazzaville, the capital, to the northern regions of the country
and to the port of Pointe Noire.
10.     The pro-osed improvement of the Pointe Noire-Makola road (34.1 km)
consists in reconstructing the first 4.6 km and upgrading the remaining
29.5 km. Total cost of the project, including supervision, is estimated
to be US$ 2.0 million, with a foreign exchange component to be financed by
IDA of US$ 1.5 million, or 75 percent. Local costs amounting to US$ 0.5
million or 25 percent will be borne by the Government.
11.     The Regie Nationale des Travaux Publics (RNTP) will carry out the
project. The French consulting firm BCEOM which carried out the engineering
and maintenance studies under Credit S-6 COB, will assist the Governmer,t
in the pre-qualification of contractors and in the evaluation of bids. i.
Government has indicated that it will retain BCEOM for supervision of con-
struction. The consultants' contract will be submitted to the Association
for approval.  The signing of this contract will be a condition of effec
tiveness of the proposed credit. Construction contracts will be subject
to international bidding in accordance with the Association's Guidelines.
12.     This project would facilitate the communications between the port
of Pointe Noire and the rich industrial and agricultural area of the lower
Mayombe. The existing road is inadequate for the present traffic amounticlg
to about 300 vehicles per day, of which about 80 are heavy trucks. The ro&2
provides the transport for commuters and supplies to the CPC potash mine
and refinery at St. Paul, and to the adjoining town of Nlakola where the
mine workers live. The project road is also used to transport timber and a
growing volume of agricultural products. The expected return on the invest-
ment is 17 percent.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
13.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's Republic
of the Congo and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and
the text of a draft Resolution approving the credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
14.     The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms generally to the
pattern of Agreements for projects of this type.
PART V - THE ECONOMfY
15.     A report "The Economy of Congo (Brazzaville) - Recent Evolution and
Prospects" (AW-7a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 22, !ij69
(R 69-65). The conclusions of this report remain substantially valid.



:6.       Congo is reasonably wel' endowed with natural resources, and the
econony has been grow-xing in real terms at about 4 percent per year since 1963.
Agriculture, which employs about 60 percent of the active population, only
accounts for 30 percent of GDP and very few exports. The main reasons `foc
this are the small amount of commercial agriculture, pronounced urbanization
and emigration. Brazzaville used to be the colonial administrative capital
for a much larger area, and still has regional importance, particularly in
the transport sector. The tertiary sector in Congo is consequently unusually
large, providing 60 percent of GDP.
17.       Almost all Congo's exports are of timber and timber products,
supplemented by diamonds (partly re-exports originating in CAR), and some
agricultural products such as sugar. The latter product is exported undcer
the OCAM sugar agreement at prices well above the world market level. Exports
of potassium chloride from the CPC mine are expected to rise rapidly in the
immediate future, in spitie of the technical and financial difficulties tl-at,
have initially been encountered by this project.
13.       Most of Congo's imports come from the EEC, particularly France.
Industrial development over the past five years will permit a measure of ixport
substitution for products such as textiles (financed by the People's Repubi^
of China), cement (financed by the Federal Republic of Germany), and petro-
leum products from an oil refinery set up by an Italian company. Congo's
overall trade balance is in deficit; although balance of payments data are
incomplete, the trade deficit has normally been financed partly by transit
services provided to neighboring countries, and by foreign aid.
19.       The rate of investment in Congo, 28 percent of GDP (1964-68), has
been very high in the past, due mainly to a high level of aid from both East -n
and Western sources. However, now that the main industrial projects have beern
completed, total investment and foreign aid are expected to decline in the
future.
20.       The Government has recently reaffirmed a more socialist orientatici)
In this period of change, it is difficult to assess the effect of these poli-v
changes on the organization and performance of the public sector. However,
efforts to reduce current budget deficits indicate that the Government intends
to implement responsible financial policies. Up to 1968, large annual cur-
rent deficits wiere financed by drawing down balances and surpluses of some
public organizations, and by borrowing. In 1969 the deficit, while still
amounting to CFAF 1.0 billion ($3.6 million equivalent), was significantly
lower than the 1968 figure of CFAF 1.5 billion. The 1970 budget forecasts
a further improvement. This is to be done by containing social expenditures,
limiting salary expenditures to a 5 percent increase, and by increasing taxes.
If the budget is implemented, public development expenditures of CFAF 1.5
billion should be possible. This would partly offset the expected decline
in externa'lly financed investment.



21.       The main constraints on Congo's creditworthiness are poverty and
the limited capacity to generate savings. Although taxes are heavy, amount-
ing to 27 percent of GDP, the intractable problem of high current (1964-68)
expenditure, which can be resolved only over time, will make significant
ptublic savings difficult over the next three years. The balance of payments
position is weak, although there are prospects for improvement as exports
rise. For the present, however, Congo needs aid on concessional terms.
PART VI - CO0FPLIANCE TWITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMNT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit complies with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMNT4JDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed crer.1t.
