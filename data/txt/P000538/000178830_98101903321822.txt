APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The economny of Congo (Brazzaville) is based on agricultural pro-
duction and on the export of timber and potash, and thus relies heavily on
its transport system. The highway network provides a vital complement to
the railways and waterways which constitute the backbone of the transporta-
tion system. Reliable feeder roads and an efficient trunk road network are
required to facilitate communication between the centers of production,
consumption and export.
ii.       The highway network is relatively well-developed.  The highest
priorities in the highway sector are proper maintenance of the entire system
and improvement of selected roads. Under an IDA financed Highway Engineering
Project (S-6 COB), the Consultants, BCEOM (France), are presently studying
highway maintenance needs and are carrying out the detailed engineering for
the improvement of two high-priority roads. The proposed project provides
for the improvement of one of these roads, the Pointe Noire-Makola road
(34.1 km), which links the port of Pointe Noire with the potash mine and
refinery of the Compagnie des Potasses du Congo (CPC) near St. Paul and with
a rich agricultural area.
iii.      Total cost of the project is estimated at US$2 million including
contingencies. IDA will finance the foreign exchange cost of the project,
estimated at US$1.5 million equivalent or 75%, including consultants' sub-
sistence allowances. Local costs will be borne by the Government.
iv.       The Credit will be made to the Government of Congo; the Regie
Nationale des Travaux Publics will be responsible for the execution of
the project. Consultants will supervise the construction. The benefits
of the project will, for the most part, consist of savings in vehicle
operating costs and reduced maintenance costs, estimated to yield a rate
of return of over 17%.
v.        The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
Credit of US$1.5 million equivalent.

APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1965, a Bank/IDA mission identified two road projecta in
Congo: (a) the construction of the Sibiti-Zanaga road (143.5 km) to
open a new forest area for timber exploitation, and (b) the improvement,
including bituminous surfacing, of the Pointe Noire - Bondi road (43 km)
which links the port of Pointe Noire with the Compagnie des Potasses du
Congo (CPC) potash mine and refinery and the agricultural hinterland of
St. Paul. Under a Bank Technical Assistance Grant (US$185,000), signed
in November 1966, the French Consultants, BCEOh, carried out the feasibility
study and preliminary engineering of the Sibiti-Zanaga road. The detailed
engineering of this road and the feasibiïity study and detailed engineering
of the Pointe Noire - Bondi road are beîng carried out by BCEOM under a
Highway Engineering Credit of US$630,000 equivalent (Credit S-6 COB) dated
May 26, 1969. lhis credit also provides for the preparation of a program
to improve maintenance of the national highway system. It was the firat
Bank Group lending operation in the transportation sector of the Congo.
1.02      The detailed engineering of the Sibiti-Zanaga road will be com-
pleted by June 1970. Regarding the Pointe Noire - Bondi road, the
consultants' final report on the feasibility study was completed in
February 1970.  Only the improvement, including bituminous surfacing, of
the Pointe Noire - Makola section (34.1 km) was found to be economically
Justified, since beyond Makola, the terrain is more difficult and traffic
decreases sharply. Detailed engineering has been completed and the
consultants are proceeding with the preparation of the bidding documents,
_..pected to be completed by May 1970.
1.03      In April 1969, the Government requested financing from Fonds
d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC), the French aid agency, for the upgrading
of the first 15-kilometer section of the road from Pointe Noire, but FAC
financing was not forthcoming. The Government then requested IDA to as-
sist in the financing of the entire road.
1.04      The total cost of the proposed project will be about US$2 million
equivalent. The IDA credit of US$1.5 million equivalent will cover the
foreign exchange cost of the construction and of consultants' services for
construction supervision. Refunding of the Highway Engineering Credit S-6
COB will be considered under future Bank/IDA lending operations when the en-
gineering work under that project has been completed.
1.05      The project was appraised 3y Messrs. H. 0. Schulte (Economist)
and J. Doyen (Engineer) in November 1969 on the basis of the report on
the feasibility study and detailed engineering prepared by BCEOM. This
report was prepared with the editorial assistance of Mies J. Murphy.

2. BACKCROUNiN
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      The Republic o£ Congo lies astride the Equator on the west coast
of Central Africa.  It has a short coastline of about 200 km along the
Atlantic Ocean, and stretches more than 1,Q00 km into the African contin-
ent, bordered by Gabon, Cameroen and ^he Central African Republic on its
western and northern erontiers, and by the Democrati-c Republ!c of r'ongc
(Kinshasa) to the east and south. Beyond the coastal plain, access to the
hinterland is rendered difficult by the Mavombe mountain range.
2.02      The country has an area of about 340,000 kn2, i.e. about ihe
size of Italy.  Its present population is estimated at almost one million
inhabitants.  Brazzaville, the capital rabout 170,000 inhabitants).   i
Pointe Noire, Congo's only seaport (100,000), are the main cities. "Y
population density of about three inhabatants per km2 is one of the lowest
in Africa; three-fourths of the population, however, is located in the
western region.
2.03      The economy of the Congo is mainly based on forestry, agriculture,
and, recently, mining. Timber exports presently account for about 50% of
foreign exchange earnings. The development of agriculture has been limited
because roughly one-half of the country is covered by dense tropical for-
est and the soils are generally poor. The Niari Valley in the western
region has agricultural potential, particularly for sugarcane production
and livestock.  A ranching project for which Bank group financing will be
sought is presently under preparation.
2.04      The country's main industrial venture is the potash mine and
refinery of the CPC at St. Paul. The CPC, which received a Bank loan (Loan
480-COB) of US$30 million in 1967, started production ln mid-1969. Output
has been less than expected so far, due to technical dilfficulties; the
company is confident, however, that it will reach its production target of
850,000 tons of potash per annum by the end of 1971. Future production
increases will depend on world market conditions. Apart from the CPC mine,
the industrial sector of the Congo is small but relatively diversified.
2.05      Economic growth ln recent years is estimated to have been about
4% per annum in real terms. Gross domestic product per capita was esti-
mated at about US$200 equivalent in 1969.
B.   The Transport Sector
2.06      The transportation system of Congo, consisting of 10,850 km of
roads and track, 2,300 km of navigable waterways, and 800 km of railway,
is not only of vital importance to the economy of Congo, but to that of
other countries of west-central Africa as well. Gabon is dependent on
the 285 km railway branch from Mbinda to the main rail line at Dolisie
for the export of manganese, presently totalling about 1.2 million tons



- 3 -
annuallv. Land-locked Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) have
been channeling a large part of their international traffic via the trans-
equatorial route, through Congo's river and rail systems and the seaport
of Pointe Noire. In total, the port of Pointe Noire handles about 2.5
million tons annually, of which about 55% represents transit traffic.
2.07      The transequatorial transport route, consisting of the port of
Pointe Noire, the CFCO railway (Chemin de Fer Congo-Ocean), the port of
Brazzaville, the Congo-Ubangui river system, the port of Bangui (CAR),
and the road from Bangui to Fort Lamy (Chad), was operated until October
1969 by the Agence Transequatoriale des Communications (ATEC), an inter-
governmental agency set up in 1959 bv the Congo, the CAR, Chad and Gabon
and administered jointly by these four countries. In October 1969, the
Congolese Governînent took over all of ATEC's assets inside the Congo,
i.e. the ports of Pointe Noire and Brazzaville and the CFCO railway, and
set up a new agency, the Agence Transcongolaise des Communications (ATC).
ATC is continuing transport services for the former ATEC member countries
but intends to replace the joint ATEC convention 'by separate, bilateral
agreements with each country. The nature of these agreements as well as
the impact of the Congolese Government's decision on transport flows in
Equatorial Africa is not known at present.
2.08      Internally, the Congo and Oubangul rivers, their tributaries,
and a feeder road system link the northern part of the country with Brazza-
ville. This river port handles about 300,000 tons of traffic annually.
The CFCO railway, complemented by roads, serves the Brazzaville - Pointe
Noire area. Annual traffic volumes on the railway amount to 2.5 million
tons. The railway was not originally built to carry these large volumes,
and the section which crosses the difficult Mayombe range should be improved.
In June 1969, UNDP agreed to finance a feasibility study, with the Bank as
K.ecuting Agency, of the realignment and rehabilitation of this section.
Consultants have been selected but the start of the study was held up until
satisfactory arrangements could be concluded with the newly established ATC.
Field work for the survey is now expected to begin in mid-1970.
2.09      Transport coordination does not present a particular problem in
the Congo. The basic transport infrastructure exists, and the roles of
the various modes of transport are more or less naturally defined. ATC
will continue to coordinate investments and policies within its own system.
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A.   The Highway Network
3.01      Congo's highway network serves primarily as a feeder to the rail-
way and waterway systems and plays a vital role in ensuring communication
with the sparsely populated regions of the interior. Of the 10,850 km of
roads and tracks, about 1,975 km are classified as national roads, 4,220
km are prefectoral and 2,170 km are local roads; the remaining 2,500 km



-4-
are unclassified seasonal tracks (Table 1).  Aithough the network  s ra½her
extensive, yielding an average density of 32 lan per 1,OQ0 km2 (Table 2),
most of the roads have low design standards and are in poor condition. Of
the entire network of 10,850 km, only 1.500 km, including 335 Ian of oS wed
roads, provide reliable a'.i-weather service.
B.   Traffic Characteristics and Growth
3.02      The country's total vehicle fleet is estimated at about 7,500,
of which about 65% are passenger cars, 20% light trucks and buses, and
15% trucks. Vehicle density is about one vehicle for every 125 inhabi-
tants; comparison with other African countrîes of similar economic con-
ditions is given in Table 2.
3.03      Traffic counts have been conducted at river crossings since 1966
and, pursuant to Credit S-6 COB, the Government îs proceeding with the es-
tablishment of systematic counts on all important roads. As shown in
Table 3, 24% of the classified roads carry more than 5,000 tons annually.
Traffic has increased rapidly during the past five years on roads near
Pointe Noire and Brazzaville, on the road from Gabon to Dolisie, and on
the road through the Niari Valley. Traffic growth in the central and
northern regions appears to have decreased since 1966. This change in
traffic patterns is symptomatic of a general lessening of productivity in
rural areas, and the population exodus to urban areas.
C.   Administration
3.04      The highway network is administered by the Regie Nationale des
Travaux Publics (RNTP), a semi-autonomous state enterprise which replaced
the Department of Public Works in 1965. The RNTP has a Board of Directors,
presided over by the Minister of Public Works and Transport (see Organiza-
tion Chart). In many respects, the RNTP functions as a Government agency;
its employees enjoy civil service status and are paid from the general
budget. The Director General, however, enjoys a large degree of freedom
in planning and management. The RNTP headquarters in Brazzaville includes
four central services responsible for (i) administration and budgeting,
(ii) highway planning, engineering and construction, (iii) equipment main-
tenance, workshops, traffic control and statisties, and (iv) civil engineer-
ing and transport services. The RNTP field organization which comprises
13 subdivisions, is responsible for maintenance of the classified network
(Table 3). These subdivisions were grouped into three geographical divisions,
but, in an effort to strengthen headquarters' control over field operations,
the area divisions were integrated into the headquarters organization in
1969.
3.05      RNTP personnel number about 1,450 including labor.  The head-
quarters supervisory staff is reinforced by ten French engineers provided
by FAC. There are only eight trained Congolese engineers and technical
supervisors. FAC intends to maintain its present technical assistance
until sufficient qualified Congolese staff are available. Although engi-
neers are presently trained abroad, mostly in France, the lack of qualified



- 5 -
staff at all levels is likely to remain a problem for a number of years.
This lack is especially evident in field operations, where there is a
shortage of qualified mechanics and equipment operators. BCEOM is study-
ing this problem under Engineering Credit S-6 COB (para 3.08).
D.   Finance
3.06      The RNTP budget is established as a separate account within the
Treasury under the authority of the Director General of the RNTP and of
the Minister of Finance. RNTP sources of revenue are (i) contributions
from the Government budget (representing about one-third); (ii) a Road
Fund fed by allocations from a special tax on fuel and lubricants (about
half); (iii) RNTP's commercial ventures (about one-tenth); and (iv) inter-
mittent contributions from the National Investment Budget for betterment
works and equipment purchases.
3.07      RNTP's annual expenditures (Table 4), including current operat-
ing expenditures, investments, and debt service, have increased steadily
since its establishment, and in 1968 totalled CFAF 972 million (US$3.5
million equivalent). An estimated 60% of RNTP's expenditures have been
for maintenance and betterment of the classified highway network. Net
highway maintenance expenditures, excluding equipment depreciation, have
averaged about CFAF 70,000/km (US$254/km) over the period 1967-1969, which
appears adequate in view of the low average traffic.
E.   Maintenance
3.08      When RNTP was established in 1965, it undertook the mechaniza-
tion of its highway maintenance operations; the equipment fleet has been
continuously strengthened and has doubled in size in the last five years.
?ne present replacement value of the fleet is estimated at about US$6
nillion equivalent; if efficiently operated and maintained, it should be
sufficient to ensure adequate maintenance of the highway network. Despite
adequate maintenance allocations and the growth of the equipment fleet,
the condition of the network has not significantly improved. The reasons
for this disappointing situation are several: inefficient maintenance pro-
cedures, and poorly equipped and inadequately staffed subdivision workshop.
BCEOM is presently studying these problems under the Highway Engineering
Credit (Credit S-6 COB). They will formulate a comprehensive program for
the reorganization and management of maintenance operations and workshops,
and for the recruitment and training of RNTP personnel. During negotiations,
the Government agreed that, upon receipt of the above highway maintenance
study. it will consult with the Association with a view to agreeing upon
a schedule for implementing a program to improve the organization, planning
and execution of road maintenance operations.
F.   Engineering and Construction
3.09      Highway engineering is usually carried out by consultants.  The
RNTP operates a well-equipped soil testing laboratory, the Laboratoire
National d'Etudes des Travaux Publics (LNETP), with the technical assistance



- 6 -
of a well-known French institute for road engineering, the Centre Experi-
mental de Recherches et d'Etudes du Batiment et des Travaux Publics (CEBT?).
Highway construction is generallv carried out by foreign contractors.
Because the RNTP does not have enough qualified staff to supervise larger
works, the proposed project includes consultants' services for con-
struction supervision.
G.   Planning and Investment
3.10      The Government recognizes that high priority must be given to the
upgrading, betterment and maintenance of the existing network. While bet-
terment and maintenance have been financed from the Road Fund, upgrading
and major equipment purchases have been largelv financed through external
aid (Table 5). From 1964 to 1968, FED contributions to highway investments
totalled about US$4.8 million equivalent and provided for the bituminous
surfacing of roads near Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, for upgrading of
roads and bridge construction in the Niari Valley and the Sangha region,
and for equipment purchases. FAC con-Iributed US$1 million equivalent for
technical assistance, highway studies, and equipment. As mentioned ear-
lier (para 1.01), the Bank contributed US$185,000 for road studies. Total
capital investments in the highway infrastructure, including external and
local financing, averaged about CFAF 380 million annually (US$1.4 mil'lion
equivalent) over the period 1964-1968. Purchases of highway maintenance
equipment totalled CFAF 1,156 million (US$4.2 million equivalent), i.e.
about CFAF 230 million (US$830,000) annually.
3.11      The proposed Five-Year Development Plan (1970-1974) places great
emphasis on the upgrading of the two trunk roads, Pointe Noire - Brazza-
ville (574 km) and Brazzaville - Ouesso (887 km).  The high priority at-
tached to these projects reflects the Government's desire to improve com-
munications and to promote administrative cohesion between Congo's isolated
and ethnically diverse regions. The present project for the upgrading of
the first section of the Pointe Noire - Brazzaville road will be the first
operation to be undertaken under the proposed Plan.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The project consists of:
(i)  the improvement of 34.1 kilometers of road from Pointe Noire
to Makola; and
(ii) consultants' services for the supervision of construction.
Pointe Noire - Makola Road (see Map)
4.02      The Pointe Noire - Makola road (34.1 km), linking the CPC potash
mine and refining plant with the port of Pointe Noire, is one of the most



- 7 -
heavily travelled sections of Congo's main road network. The existing road
is inadequate for present traffic, which ranges between 290-340 vehicles
per day including about 80 heavy trucks and trailers. The first 4.6 km
from Pointe Noire were paved 15 years ago but have not been properly main-
tained and paving is showing signs of fatigue. The remaining section has
been given a gravel surface, but heavy rains have washed most of it away.
The terrain is sandy and friable; extensive erosion of ditches have, over
time, become deep trenches indenting the roadway.
4.03      Under the ongoing Engineering Credit S-6 COB, BCEOM conducted a
feasibilitv study of this road, including an economic analysis of the de-
sign standards utilized in the preliminary engineering carried out by RNTP
(Table 6). The standards were found to be technically sound and vell-
adapted to the terrain and to the volume and composition of traffic. The
pavement width of 7 m is required because of the substantial number of
heavy trucks, including timber trucks, with an overall width of more than
3 m. The shoulder width of 2 m will lessen the effects of erosion.
Supervision of Construction
4.04      Consultants will be engaged for construction supervision.  The
consultants' team will consist of one highway construction engineer and
one soil technician. They will be stationed in Pointe Noire. The LNETP
will set up a field laboratory in Pointe Noire to conduct technîcal tests
under the responsibility of the consultants.
B.   Cost Estimates and Financing
4.05      Cost estimates for the project are summarized below.  IDA will
finance the foreign component of the project costs. During negotiations,
the Government confirmed that it will bear the local costs of the project.

4.06      Cost estimates for road construction are based on BCEOM's de-
tailed engineering and reflect prices recently obtained through competi-
tive bidding for highway works of similar scope in Congo. Contingencies
include 10% for physical overruns and 5% for price escalation. The esti-
mate of the respective percentages of foreign and local components of the
construction cost is based on a detailed analysis taking into account
experience in neighboring countries.
4.07      The cost estimates for consultants' services for supervision
are based on the man-month requirements assuming a 20-month construction
period and of the cost of local transport and laboratory tests. The con-
sultants costs include about CFAF 7.15 million (USS26,000 aquivalent) to
cover subsistence allowances for fc-eign experts during their stay in the
Congo. Although disbursed in CFAF, these outlavs will mainly be used for
the purchase of consumer goods with a high percentage of foreign exchange
and hence have been included in the IDA contribution. Contingencies (10%)
cover possible time overruns and price escalation. The foreign component
of consultants services (80%). including subsistence allowances, is based
on the consultants' contract under the Engineering Credit.
4.08      Disbursement will be made on the basis of:  (i) 70% of the
contractor invoices for the execution of construction works, and (ii)
actual foreign exchange costs and subsistence allowances identified in
the consultants' contract for construction supervision. Assuming that
the Credit would be signed by June 1970, IDA disbursements will be as
follows:
Calendar Year
1970    1971    1972      Total
Forecast IDA disbursements
(US$ million equivalent)       0.1     0.9      0.5      1.5
C.   Execution
4.09      The RNTP will be responsible for executing the project and is
capable of doing so. BCEOM will assist the Government in the prequalifi-
cation and bidding. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that
bids will be awarded in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
4.10      During negotiations, the Government confirmed its intention to
entrust BCEOM with the supervision of construction and to employ them on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. The signature of a
consultants' contract for construction supervision is a condition for ef-
fectiveness of the credit.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      The Pointe Noîre - Makola road (34.1 km) is part of the main
trunk road from Pointe Noire to Brazzaville and an important link in the
transport network of the Congo. It joins the rich agricultural area of
the Lower Mayombe to the port city of Pointe Noire which, with its rapidly
increasing population (about 100,000 at present), is an important consump-
tion center. The road also carries timber traffic of about 25,000 tons
per year. Perhaps most importantly, the road serves the CPC potash mine
and refinery at St. Paul. While the potash production of the mine is
transported to the port of Pointe Noire by the CFCO railway, the activi-
ties of CPC have generated considerable road traffic as well. A certain
portion of CPC's supplies such as spare parts, small equîpment, fuel and
lubricants are transported by road. Also, there is regular commuter
traffic between Pointe Noire and the mine. Finally, the townsite of
Makola, constructed by CPC for its workers, is expected to develop into
a community of about 6-8,000 people and is another important source of
road traffic.
B.   Traffic
5.02      Since the commencement of mining operations at St. Paul in May
1969, traffic on the project road has ranged between 290-340 vpd, of
which about 80 are heavy trucks and trailers. In estimating future traf-
fic volumes, a distinction has been made between traffic directly connec-
ted with CPC's operations and other traffic. According to company of-
ficials, CPC-generated road traffic (i.e. mainly commuter traffic and
-^ansport of small supplies for the mine) amounting to about 100 vpd, is
fairly independent of the mine's output and has, therefore, been assumed
to remain constant during the period considered in the economic analysis.
Timber traffic, about 10 trucks or truck-trailers per day at present, has
also been assumed to remain constant since no increase in timber produc-
tion is foreseen in the area served by the road. Other traffic is ex-
pected to grow at about 6% per annum for the first ten years of the eco-
nomic life of the project and at about 5% per annum thereafter. The re-
sulting average growth rate of total traffic would thus be above 4%.
C.   Economic Analysis
5.03      For the purpose of the economic analysis, two sections of the
Pointe Noire - Makola road have been distinguished. Section I (4.6 km)
is now paved but would be reconstructed under the project. Section II
(29.5 km) is presently an earth and gravel road which would be upgraded
to a paved road.
5.04      The first section of 4.6 km near Pointe Noire is the most
heavily travelled part of the project road with an ADT of 340 vehicles.
It was paved 15 years ago but is now showing signs of fatigue and beginning



- 10 -
to deteriorate. Technical studies by consultants indicate that, even with
routine maintenance, the road will break up soon, and that total reconstruc-
tion will be required by 1976. Reconstruction now in the proposed project
would be less expensive for two reasons:
(i) reconstruction at a later stage of deterioration would
have to include the costs of replacing the sub-base; and
(ii) reconstructing a 4.6 km section as a separate project at
a later date would be a too small-scale operation to
justify mobilizing a foreign contractor and would, there-
fore, not be suitable for international competitive bid-
ding. Unit prices would thus be higher than estimated
for the present project.
In total, it is estimated that reconstruction in 1976 would be about 40%
more costly than if undertaken as part of the proposed project. If the
first section is not reconstructed now and maintenance continues as in
the past, the progressive deterioration of the pavement would lead to
rapidly increasing vehicle operating costs.
5.05      It is justified to keep this section, which is an integral part
of the whole project road, as a paved road since the "do-nothing" alterna-
tive, i.e. permitting its progressive downgrading, would be uneconomic.
The optimum timing for reconstruction was determined by comparing flows
of total transport costs under the two alternative solutions, i.e. recon-
struction in 1971 under the project or delaying reconstruction until 1976.
Table 7 shows that the present value of the total transport cost bill, dis-
counted at a rate of 10%, is about 13% lower if reconstruction is carried
out in 1971. Even if total reconstruction were not necessary until 1978,
the present value of the transport cost bill would still be 9% lower with
immediate reconstruction. If this small section were regarded as a separate
project, the benefits from avoided increases in vehicle operating and road
reconstruction costs would yield a return of about 22%.
-5.06     The remaining 29.5 km section terminating at Makola is a poor
earth/gravel road that carries an ADT of about 290 vehicles. The benefits
from paving the road would consist of savings in vehicle operating costs,
estimated at between 23% and 33% depending upon the type of vehicle (Table
8), and savings in maintenance costs.
5.07      Benefits have been calculated for a period of 20 years, the
estimated economic life of the project. Economic costs are based on con-
sultants' estimates for a 20-month construction period. Based on the above
assumptions, details of which are given in Table 9, the economic rate of
return on paving this section would be about 17%. A 10% lower growth rate
of traffic (from 4% to 3.6%) would not significantly affect the rate of
return. A 15% increase in project costs would reduce the rate of return
to 14% which is still satisfactory.



- il -
5.08      Thus, the reconstruction and improvement of the Pointe Noire -
Makola road is economically sound, estimated to yield a rate of return of
over 17% for the project as a whole.
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, assurances or confirmation were obtained on
the following major points:
(a) upon receipt of the highway maintenance study being carried
out by BCEOM, the Government vill consult with the Association
with a view to agreeing upon a schedule for implementing a
program to improve the organization, planning and execution of
road maintenance operations (para 3.08); and
(b) BCEOM will be retained for construction supervision and will
be employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the As-
sociation (para 4.10).
6.02      The project is economically sound, and provides a suitable basis
for an IDA Credit of US$1.5 million equivalent. A condition for the ef-
fectiveness of the credit is the signing of a contract with the consultants
for construction supervision (para 4.10).
