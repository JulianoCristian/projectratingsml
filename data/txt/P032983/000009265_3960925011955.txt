PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SPAIN - INDUSTRIAL RD&E PROJECT
(LOAN 1425-SP)
PRtEFACE
1.    Loan No. 1425-SP for the Industrial Research, Development and Engine-ring
(RD&E) Project in the amount of US$18.0 million was signed on July 8, 1978 and
was closed on June 30, 1984, having been fully committed.
2.    The main objective of the Project was to assist the Government in
establishing a system to promote the acquisition, adaptation, development and
utilization of modern technology by Spanish industry, thus improving its
competitiveness. The means to reach this objective was the creation of an
autonomous unit to finance research, development and engineering. On the whole,
the Project objective has been achieved.
3.   The Project was the first direct attempt by the Bank to assist in
industrial technological development. Therefore, it was expected to provide a
learning experience from whicth the Bank would benefit in its future work in
improving and accelerating technology development in other countries.
.4..; This Project Completion Report was largely prepared prior to the
reorganization by the then Industry Department, based on a project completion
mission to Spain in January 1985.
5.   This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on November 16, 1989, for comments by
December 14, 1989, but none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SPAIN - INDUSTRIAL RD&E PROJECT
(Loan 1425-SP)
HIGHLIGHTS
i.    This project was the first of its kind both for the Bank and for Spain.
It was developed in response to the need to modernize Spanish industry and to
introduce new technologies that would improve the efficiency and
competitiveness of manufacturing, promote new product development and create
new and technologically advanced industries. By its very nature, this is a
long-term process; the Project's objective was to create the initial
conditions favorable to its continued development (para. 2.07).
ii.   Some difficulties were encountered during Project implementation.  These
were related mainly to the lack of sufficient autonomy of the implementing
agency and to the inadequacy of the original procurement and disbursement
procedures agreed upon between the Borrower and the Bank; both problems were
resolved. Subsequent to project completion, The Center for the Development of
Industrial Technology (CDTI) obtained the autonomy from the Government
initially envisaged and the Government resources needed for CDTI to have a
substantial impact (paras. 3.02-3.05 and 3.20-3.22).
LESSONS
iii. The major lessons learned from the Project were:
a)    The project was on balance successful, in large part because the
timing for technology development investment was appropriate to
Spain's level of industrialization, the recent entry into the
labor force of a large pool of technical manpower and the need to
stimulate increased Research, Development and Engineering (R,D&E)
in industry. This demonstrates the importance of appropriate
timing for projects of this type. CDTI has since become a key arm
of the Government in stimulating industrial technology
development (para. 6.04a).
b)    The project, the first of its kind for the Bank, was also sensibly
flexible in its organizational structure and approach. However,
it was initially rigid on procurement and disbursement procedures-
the procedures needed modifications and this was done after an
excessive amount of time. In such instances, the Bank should
respond more quickly in modifying proced-res than was done in this
case (para. 6.04b).
c)    The role of CDTI, like similar institutions elsewhere, changed
gradually from an agency whose role was primarily to promote
technological development as part of the Government, to one whose
role became more demand driven and financing-oriented with
increased autonomy, as indigenous technological capability grew,
and most particularly, as it became clear that Spain would have to
compete within technologically advanced Europe (para. 6.04c).



V~~~~~~~~~~~~
d)    While the Bank was instrumental in helping to create CDTI and in                 -
developing its modus operandl, it was less successful in -
supervising this first effort and in helping CDTI learn from
experience and mistakes.  The Bank, furthermore, did not take all
the time necessary to work with CDTI to develop its financial                    i
instruments, its supervision techniques, etc., for the benefit of
CDT! as well as subsequently for applying these lessons to other
countries (para. 6.04d).
e)    With respect to financias' instruments, the conditional loan repaid
with royalties became the preferred vehicle for CDTI financing.
The royalty payment formula was a complex one, which ultimately,
even for successfu'l projects, did not result in significant pre0it
for CDTI to make up for the failures, even though the proportic-
of failures was well below the percentage anticipated (121
compared to normal 331). This was an area where the Bank could
have provided more financial expertise. Consequently, the new
administration that took over CDTI in early 1982, attempted to
correct the errors of the previotis administration by adopting a
more conservative traditional lending approach and gradually
phasing out conditional lending (para. 6.04e).
f)    Likewise, as CDTI's role as a financier of industrial technology
development grew in importance, the Bank should probably have
insisted earlier and more consistently on the need for CDTI (i) to
emphasize in its loan evaluations late-stage development and
commercialization rather than research; and (ii) to de-emphasize
financial strength and the collateral of the borrower fin order t
promote the develonRment of really innovative technolo2ie&  (para. 6.04f).
g)    Insufficient attention was devoted to other policies. (e.g., tax
incentives) related to industrial technology development (ITD).
Although these have developed rapidly in recent years, the Bank
could have contributed more throughout the project in identifying
constraints and proposing policy and program alternatives (para. 6.04g).
h)    In summary, while the project, with significant Bank contribution,
was well conceived, appropriate for the Spain of the mid-1970s and
on the whole accomplished its objectives, the project and CDTT was
slow to evolve to the needs of the 1980s--ITD and
commercialization of new technologies. The Bank did not
contribute as much as would have been desirable to helping CDTI
evolve in the later stages of the project (para. 6.04h).
iv.   The Project fulfilled its expected goals and its benefits are likely to
remain and expand in the future. The Government increasingly recognized the
importance of CDTI's role by making growing amounts of resources available to
the entity. For 1985 Government allocated Ptas. 8.0 billion (US$52.3 million)
to CDTI, up from Ptas. 2.1 billion (US$13.7 million) in 1984. These amounts
continued to increase in subsequent years.  As noted above, CDTI has since
become a key institution with regard to stimulating industrial technology
development in Spain (Table 4.4 and para. 4.06).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SPAIN - INDUSTRIAL RD&E PROJECT
(Loan 1425-SP)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01        The Bank, through the late 70s, had generally not been directly
involved in industrial technology development. Instead, it had assisted
developing countries in the utilization of modern technology through the
preparation and implementatiorn of specific industrial projects or through
components of education projects. In the case of Spain, the Government's
concern about the obvious need for technological progress and the Bank's
interest in this aspect of economic development resulted in the approval on
May 17, 1977, of a US$18.0 million Bank loan for the establishment of a system
to acquire, adapt and develop technologies tailored to the needs of Spanish
industry.
1.02        The main objective of the Project was to sensitize Spanish
industry to the urgent need for innovation and to facilitate the introduction
of new technologies in industry in order to remain -- or become --
competitive. To achieve this, a secondary objective was to create an
autonomous organization to assist entrepreneurs in their efforts to develop
and introduce new technologies. These objectives have been achieved and
appear to be sustainable, but some deficiencies remain: insufficient attertion
to the needs of the industrial inventor and technological entrepreneur who are
frequently eng;.nes of innovatiie progress; and a relative lack of venture
capital to translate successful inventions and technology adaftations and
improvements into commercial production and marketing. It should, however, be
borne in mind that a project of this type can only be the beginning of an
ongoing process, and its cost was the initial expenditure needed to launch
this process.
1.03        Following Board approval of the Loan, an R&D Unit, the Canter for
the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI)1/ was created under the
Ministry of Industry in August 1977; CDTI became a semi-autonomous
organization in February 1978.  The purpose of the Center was to select
promising areas for research, to finance selected RD&E studies, and to carry
out product development and pilot-plant operations. The Bank strongly
believed that CDTI should have full operating autonomy subject to policy
guidelines set by Government. Obtaining this freedom of action required
parliamentary approval. However, the Industrial Restructuring Law containing,
inter alia, a section granting CDTI autonomy, was not enacted until November
1983. This delay and the inappropriate procurement and disbursement
procedures contained in the Bank's Loan Agreement (later modified by Bank
letter of May 29, 1980) caused disbursement delays. The Loan closing date was
extended twice, from December 31, 1982 to June 30, 1984; the Loan was fully
committed by June 30, 1984.

1.04        By the end of 1984, CDTI had approved 306 projects.  Its average              |
participation was Ptas. 32.8 million (US$0.28 million) for a total of Ptas
10,209 million (US$87.3 million). Approximately 34X of this cost was borne by
CDTI (including from the proceeds of the Bank loan), 501 by the project
sponsors, and 161 by Government and other public sector institutions.
1.05        Out of the 306 projects approved up to early 1985 by CDTI, only 14
had failed by that time (as they did not prove commercially viable); 109
projects had been completed and many had already started repayment to CDTI;
and there were 40 (projects which proved viable but beneficiaries were not
making royalty payments to CDTI) project sponsors against whom legal
proceedings had been initiated btcause of long overdue payments or lack of
compliance with other covenants agreed upon with CDTI. These projects did
prove viable but beneficiaries were not making royalty payments to CDTI.
Given that a failure rate of 33% or higher is normal in research projects,
CDTI's failure ratio of 12% (14 out of 123 projects) is very good, althougb
possibly a reflection of overly cautious project evaluation procedures
(para. 3.14).
1.06        The main subsectors targeted by CDTI's projects were electronics,
transportation, and mechanical and chemical industries; lately, biotechnology
has also become important in CDTI's project portfolio. Most of the projects
derl7c with the adaptation or improvement of technology already known outside
Sp-?.. , but some were truly innovative. Some examples of projects are
described in ANNEX 1.
1.07        The Project under review was the first Bank project aimed directly
at technology development, and it was the last Bank industrial project in
Spain. It was expected that the project would give valuable insights into
this type of operation and be useful for future Bank operations in other
countries.
II. PROJECT BACKCROUND
A. The Sectoral and Financial Environment
2.01        At the time of appraisal, Spain was emerging from a period of
rapid growth and structural change. GNP had expanded at an average annual
rate of about 6.51 during 1961-77. Industry was the leading sector, having
grown at an average rite of 9.0X per annum during the same period. Rapidly
rising foreign exchan.se inflows from commodity exports, tourism, workers'
remittances and foreign private investments strongly supported economic growth
by removing foreign exchange constraints and opening up industry to foreign
technology, know-how and management techniques.

2.02        In the years following appraisal, however, the Spanish economy
began to experience the full impact of the petroleum price increases of the
1970s and of the world recession. GDP grew at an average of only 1.3% per
year between 1979 and 1983.  Industry continued to grow, although at a slower
pace than in the previous years; its share of GDP reached 36X in 1983 as
compared to 23% in 1965.
2.03        The most important contributors to growth in manufacturing were
metal products, machinery, transport equipment and chemical products.
Traditional industries -- textiles, wood and cork products, food products and
furniture --lagged behind.  The share of manufactured products in exports
increased from less than one third of the value of goods exported in 1970 to
more than two-thirds by the mid-1980s.
B.    Project PreRaration. ARnraisal and ApRroval
2.04        In the mid 1960s, Spaniqh authorities began discussions with the
OECD, the Bank and other organization-s on possible means to improve industrial
reseaich in Spain. The structure and potential for growth of industry in
countries at an intermediate stage of economic development were a subject of
particular interest to the Bank. In 1971/72, a Bank mission visited Spain to
review the situation of Spanish industry and to analyze possibilities for
development.
2.05        The mission's report2' concluded that Spanish industry needed to
move gradually away from traditional subsectors and should improve within each
subsector, the technology used. After some additional preparatory missions, a
research, development and engineering (RD&E) project was appraised in December
1975. In 1976, a follow-up Bank mission visited Spain, and Spanish officials
visited the Bank and RD&E institutions in the U.S.
2.06        The appraisal report I/ was finalized in April 1977.  The
Executive Directors approved on May 17, 1977 a loan of US$18.0 million to the
Government, to be passed on as a grant to an aatonomous institution. The loan
did not become effective until ten months later, on March 31, 1978, after a
unit for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) was created (para.
3.03).

C.    Project Obiectives and ScoRe
2.07        The main objective of the Project was to establish a system to
support the research, development and engineering efforts needed to create ner
products and introduce new processes, thus modernizing and improving the
efficiency of Spanish industry. One of the means to achieve this objective
was the creation of a specialized institution dedicated to the acquisition,
development and utilization of new technology. Additionally, the Project
aimed to assist interested enterprises in strengthening their own technology
development capacity.
2.08        The Project was the first direct attempt by the Bank to assist in
industrial technological development. Therefore, it was expected to provide a
learning experience from which the Bank would benefit in its future work in
improving and accelerating technology development in other countries.
2.09        The Project as defined during appraisal consisted of:
(a)   The establishment of a new organization (CDTI) to
direct Project activities;
(b)   The selection of areas for initial concentration of
RD&E activities and establishment of criteria for the
evaluation and selection of projects; and
--(c)   The creation of a project portfolio representing the
minimum critical mass required for the program to
become self-sustaining in a relatively short period of
time.
2.10        The Appraisal Report concluded that the subsectors most likely to
benefit from technology development were food processing, electronics,
mechanical engineering and machine tool production. General criteria for the
selection of suitable projects, agreed upon between the Bank and Government,
aimed at improving the competitiveness and export potential of Spanish
industry.
2.11        The Appraispl Report also attempted to define the minimum size
needed to make the program successful. The following criteria were
emphasized:
(a)   The number of commercially successful projects must be
sufficient to inave a demonstration effect, thus
encouraging other firms to undertake or increase their
RD&E efforts;
(b)  '.he expected royalty payments or other types of
returns (to CDTI) should be adequate to support the
continued expansion of the program; and



(c)   The program should fill a measurable portion of the
gap (e.g., 10X) between research funding available and
funding needed to bring it up to the level of
countries with similar per capita income.
D.    Financing OL R&D Activities
2.12        In 1974, total financing available in Spain for domestic R&D was
US$280 million, which increased rapidly to US$780 million in 1983. In 1983,
approximately 451 of total domestic R&D expenditures were used for the
4evelopment of industrial technology. In addition, there were payments abroad
for licenses, patents and technical know-how amounting to US$616 million
during that year (para. 5.01). R&D expenditures remained stable in 1984; they
were estimated at US$1,370 million (US$793 for domestic R&D and US$577 million
for imported technology), only slightly below the US$1,396 million reached in
1983 and much higher than the US$596 million spent in 1974. Over the period
1974-83, R&D expenditures grew in relative importance from about 0.4X of GDP
in 1974 to 0.6X in 1983. A summary of the sources of financing for domestic
R&D in 1973 and 1983 is shown below:

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.    Achievement of Prolect Obiectives                                                    m
3.01        A technology development project of the type under review                     a
constitutes only the first phase of a long-term process of accelerated
introduction of new technologies in industry. The attainment of such
objectives, which provide the ultimate rationale for a Project of this nature,
cannot, therefore, be tied to specific dates or volumes of RD&E expenses. The
main objectives of the Project - increasing the awareness of Spanish industry
of the need for rapid technological advancement and the creation of an
institution dedicated to assist in the acquisition, development and
utilization of selected technologies - were in the process of being achieved
at the time of project completion, although at a somewhat slower pace than
envisaged during appraisal.
B.    Project Management
The RD&E Unit
3.02        During appraisal of the Project, the Bank reached the conclusion
that the organism that would channel the Bank-assisted efforts to improve RD&E
activities in Spain should be an autonomous entity. Thus, it should have
maximum independence and receive income also from sources other tL.an
Government. The RD&E unit should be responsible for defining and financing
research, establishing working groups, recruiting staff from public and
private sector institutions or from abroad, and making quick decisions on the
allocation of funds.
3.03        The Bank, however, recognized that creation of a truly autonomous
organization would cause protracted delays because of legal and political
problems. Therefore, it accepted a compromise. In effect, Section 3.01(a) of
the Loan Agreement stipulated that the Government, should to the satisfaction
of the Bank: (i) establish within the Ministry of Industry a Unit to carry
out the Project; (ii) define the responsibilities, functions and
administrative and operating procedures of the Unit; and (iii) as soon as
possible but not later than December 31, 1979, or such other date as the
Borrower and the Bank might agree, take all necessary steps to transform the
Unit into an autonomous organization. The Unit was created as the Centro paza
el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI) on August 5, 1977.  On February
10, 1978, it became an "autonomous administrative organization" (Organismo
Autonomo de Caracter Administrativo). CDTI's organizational structure,
functions and responsibilities were further defined by Decree No. 548 of March
25, 1978. The Loan became effective on March 31, 1978.
3.04        In the ensuing years, however, it became apparent that CDTI's
autonomy was inadequate: it could not really establish its own recruitment
policies and set salary scales adequate for the hiring and retention of high
quality staff; expenses had to be incurred in accordance wita narrowly defined
categories of authorized expenditures; and cash receipts, whether from



- 7 -
budgetary allocations, Bank Loan proceeds, or operating revenues, had to be
turned over to the Treasury. This made it difficult for CDTI to taka high-
risk decisions of the type necessary for an aggressive technology development
program. At the same time it gave CDTI little incentive to improve its
financial management. CDTI's lack of autonomy was a constant preoccupation of
the Bank, highlighted in the project supervision reports and in Bank
correspondence .4/
3.05        On September 17, 1979, CDTI requested the Government to change its
status to that of an autonomous "commercial, industrial and financial"
organization. However, this request was not immediately pursued. Instead,
the new government elected to present a bill to the legislature on industrial
policy in general, which included a section on technology development. There
followed a lengthy period of debate and review during which the Government
*         industrial policies were defined.  Finally, on November 30, 1983, Royal
Decree-Law No. 8/1983, dealing with the restructuring of Spanish industry, was
enacted. Section 36 of this law authorized, effective January 1, 1984, the
conversion of CDTI into a public law entity (entidad con personeria juridica).
Such entities operate in most respects like private sector commercial
enterprises. The functions, authorities and responsibilities of the new CDTI
are spelled out in detail in Decree No. 2/1984 issued by the Ministry of
Industry on January 4, 1984.
CDTI's Management and Organization
3.06.!      Sectiont 3.01(b) of the Loan Agreement also stipulated that the
Borrower would employ in the unit a qualified and experienced managing
director appointed after consultation with the Bank. The first two managing
directors of CDTI were appointed after consultation with the Bank. However,
the Bank was not consulted regarding the appointment of the subsequent
Director General on January 16, 1984.
3.07        CDTI was reorganized in the first quarter of 1984.  Organization
charts prior to and after restructuring are shown in ANNEX 2. The new
organization structure was adequate, except that the project evaluation units,
which are vital to the work of CDTI, could have gained further in
effectiveness through independence from the Finance Department (and thus from
undue emphasis on financial criteria) and from the recruitment of additional
qualified staff.
3.08        As previously mentioned (para. 3.04), initially CDTI did not have
sufficient autonomy in recruitment and salary policy; in spite of this, a
small team of dedicated staff was built up from nine professionals in December
1979 to 24 in July 1983. Due to the lack of autonomy, CDTI had to resort to
some unusal procedures for hiring and retaining staff; this fact and some
still unresolved accusations of administrative irregularities led, after the
In particular, in the supervision reports dated August 25, 1980
and August 2, 1983.



-8-
reorganization and the appointment in 1984 of a new Director General, to
fri-tion due to differences in outlook and expectations between the old staff               -
and the new management.  As a result, about three quarters of the old staff                 -
either quit or their contracts were allowed to expire.
.
3.09        In spite of the disruptive effect of the reorganization, CDTI's
staff appeared qualified and dedicated. The institut'on's efficiency, if
anyt'hing, was increasing. However, a good deal of the experience gained since
inception, and of the institutional memory, was lost in the wholesale changes
of 1984.
C.    Operating Policies and Procedures
General Policies
3.10        At the time of appraisal, it was thought that the actual RD&E work
would be carried out by industrial firms and laboratories or institutions, as
well as directly under the control of CDTI, which would purchase most of the
equipment that it required for this purpose. In retrospect, this expectation
was unrealistic and not appropriate for an institution that was also to
finance technology projects of other firms. The actual role of CDTI evolved
therefore during the first year of operations (para. 5.03) and shifted from a
predominantly controlling role (i.e., one in which CDTI would select the
industrial subsectors, identify technologies required and commission RD&E
work) -towards a role that was predominantly supportive of industry
initiatives.
3.11        Starting in 1979, CDTI undertook an extensive promotional effort
with leading industrial trade associations, particularly with the National
Association of Equipment Manufacturers (SERCOBE). This approach was
subsequently continued. In addition CDTI was working closely with regional
development centers. It assigned technical advisors to these centers, who
promoted CDTI's activities and screened potential applicants. This approach
has not been allocated a high priority since 1984. As a consequence of its
search for broad fields of investigation, CDTI also commissioned or carried
out in-house studies of some subsectors or lines of inquiry. Most of the
studies were relatively low cost bibliographical research efforts, but three
studies'5 (out of 76) cost more than US$500,000 equivalent each. Loan
proceeds were not used to pay for any of the CDTI studies.
3.12        Section 3.02(b) of the Loan Agreement required CDTI to obtain Bank
approval for subprojects costing more than US$500,000 equivalent during the
first three years after the Loan signing date (i.e., until July 8, 1980). The
-/     Two of them were really subprojects for the pilot plant testing of
a process for the recovery of metallic values from complex pyritic
ores and energy savings in the production of cement. The third
one was a study on the production of energy by photo voltaic
cells.



-9v
Bank objected to some aspects of threa subprojects. One was later dropped and
the other two subprojects were not financed by the Bahk.
SubRroject Evaluation
3.13        Enterprises and organizations applying for CnfTI financing were to
present information on the product or process to be developed, the expected
market demand, and the organization, management, and finances of the entity.
The proposals were reviewed by CDTI with the assistance, if necessary, of
outside experts, and an appraisal report was presented to CDTI's board. After
board approval, a contract was negotiated between CDTI and the project
sponsor, specifying how CDTI would recover its investment and possibly benefit
from its participation in the project. Since CDTI traditionally financed only
about 50% of the R&D cost, the financial situation of the applicant carried
considerable weight in the project evaluation. CDTI later gave greater weight
to project objectives and the realism of the budget presented, but marketing
aspects were still not considered sufficiently. Nevertheless, CDTI's
continued emphasis on traditional financial criteria led to an over-emphasis
on established firms, and a reluctance to take the kinds of risks required in
technology financing.
3.14        Proposals submitted by individual inventors were supposed to be
screened first by the Institute of Civil Engineers. This procedure was
established in order to avoid having CDTI's professional staff mired in time-
consuming discussions with inventors of impractical schemes. Based on
experiences in other countries, this procedure may not be fully appropriate
for technology (as opposed to research) lending; rather, technical experts
should be brought into the evaluation process. (Peer review committees tend
to be biased in favor of established names and approaches.) In addition,
after the initial screening, CDTI would generally not consider financing the
proposed R&D, because individual invenLnrs frequently lacked financial
resources. Instead, CDTI would send information about the research proposal
to enterprises that might be interested. if such an enterprise could be
found, CDT! would arrange for meetings between inventor and enterprise. Once
agreement had been reached, CDTI would process the proposal like any other
enterprise-sponsored proposal. The Bank frequently pointed out that this was
inadequ4te to promote the development of really innovative technologies, which
often succeed as the result of efforts by individual inventors, and in dynamic
new firms rather than larger, traditional ones. However, CDTI did not change
its policies in this respect and continued to believe that individual
inventors would have to come to terms with going concerns, including
multinationals, to develop their new products or processes.
SubiroJect Supervision
3.15        An elaborate supervision system was originally prepared by CDTI
consisting of: (i) analyses of the physical progress and financial aspects of
implementation; (ii) evaluation of the sponsor's monitoring systems; (iii)
technical assistance to small firms lacking the means to prepare such



- 10 -
programming and control systems; and (iv) monitoring of project implementation
schedules and costs. Cost control was to be carried out through periodic
reviews, which should tie in with contractual "checkpoints" of project
progress and include the corresponding documents (invoices, payroll, etc.).
Monthly progress reports were to be prepared for each project and a summary
report for all CDTI projects was to be submitted monthly to its board. This
overly ambitious system, however, never became fully operational and many
projects were not supervised due to lack of staff.
3.16        Later, CDTI's management correctly decided that detailed
supervision of project exRenditures was too time-consuming, unnecessary and
counterproductive for the institution carrying out the RD&E project. This
view was shared by the Bank. It was generally agreed that project supervision
should concentrate on monitoring achievement of specific, agreed project
targets. However, CDTI still needed to learn from the experiences of venture
capital companies elsewhere. Supervision of technology projects is always
time-consuming and staff-intensive, and assistance of varying types needs to
be provided to the client firms.
Commercialization Procedures
3.17        The term commercialization, as used by CDTI, referred to the
monitoring of recipient enterprises to ensure the CDTI obtained its fair share
of the proceeds of any successful RD&E project financed by it. Until 1984,
the-participation agreements provided for repayment of principal and
"benefits' (funds provided by CDTI were not considered to be loans and
therefore did not earn normal interest) through the payment of a royalty on
sales over a number of years, calculated by doubling the period required to
recover the principal of the funds advanced. The formula was complicated and
led to low rates of collection, even for successful projects.
3.18        Starting in 1984, CDTI introduced more flexibility in the
repayment of advances. Three procedures could then be followed:
(a)   Priority Loan (Credito Prioritario) - This was a
conventional loan with a fixed repayment schedule and
interest rate. The interest rate in 1985 was 14%.
These loans tended to dominate CDTI's operations in
the subsequent years;
(b)   Variable Participation (Riesgo y Ventura) - The
enterprise had a reduced or no obligation to repay
CDTI if the project failed, but had to pay principal
plus royalties for a specified number of years, if the
project was successful;
(c)   Eguity ParticiDation (Capital de Riesgo) - CDTI would
take a share in the enterprise's capital, generally
combined with a loan. The number of equity



- 11 -
participations was small (6), and the amount
represented only about 2% of CDTI's total investments.
D.    Bank Procurement and Disbursement Procedures
3.19        The procurement procedures established in Schedule 4 of the Loan
Agreement were the standard ones applicable to large industrial projects,
requiring international competitive bidding (ICB) in all cases where the items
or groups of items were estimated to cost more than US$100,000, except for
proprietary equipment or items which could be procured only from a limited
number of suppliers, or whose delivery required a long lead time and for which
early delivery was needed. In the latter cases international shopping was
allowed. The procedures for Bank review of procurement decisions as
stipulated in Section D of Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement required the
Borrower to furnish the Bank, for all contracts estimated to cost more than
US$100,000: (i) before bidding: the text of the invitation to bid, the
specifications, the advertising procedures, and other bidding documents; and
(ii) after bids had been received and evaluated: the name of the bid winner
and a detailed report on the evaluation of the bids. Since the majority of the
procured items costing more than US$100,000 were proprietary in character or
could be purchased only from a limited number of suppliers or were narrowly
defined in technical terms, most of the items in a technology project of this
type should rather have been procured through international shopping.
3.20---     Other items such as pipes, small tanks and pumps, and nuts and
bolts to build or adapt pilot plants or to build some prototypes were very
large in number and of very small individual value.  The Loan Agreement did
not provide for a simplified procedure for these items. The application of
standard Bank procedures in this case was particularly cumbersome because the
goods and services were not acquired by the Borrower but by the subproject
sponsors. Application of standard DFC procedures would have been far more
appropriate for this project, in particular in view of the high percentage of
subprojects ultimately carried out by subproject sponsors in the private
sector.
3.21        The disbursement procedures established in Schedule 1 of the Loan
Agreement were also not suitable for this Project because they were designed
for large industrial type projects. Bank Loan proceeds could be disbursed
under two categories: (i) equipment and machinery, and (ii) technical
services. It is, however, clear from the Appraisal and President's Reports
that materials should have been eligible for financing, provided they were not
used in the beneficiary's daily operations. Furthermore, the original
disbursement procedures required that all orders and contracts, even for low
cost items, be submitted to the Bank prior to or together with the withdrawal
application.
3.22        The December 1979 supervision mission stated that "The application
of normal procurement procedures is awkward and the processing of thousands of
purchase orders impractical." It recommended that the Bank adopt a simplified
procedure (Statement of Expenditures or similar) to facilitate disbursements



- 12 -
of the Bank loan against small purchases made by CDTI borrowers. The Bank
approved the change in procurement and disbursement procedures. In a letter
dated May 29, 1980 the Bank proposed that simplified procedures by applied.
These procedures did not, however, become effective until December 3, 1980,
because of a long delay on the part of the Government in countersigning the
Bank letter.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF CDTI
A.    Growth of Operations
4.01        Only four projects had been approved by CDTI at the end of 1978
and no contract was signed until May 1979. There was generally a considerable
delay between project approval by CDTI's Board and the date of effectiveness
of the contract, mainly because of the time required to negotiate the details
of the agreement and the formal signing of the contract. In the following
years, the build up of CDTI's activities accelerated considerably as shown
below:

B.   TIne of RD&E Projects
4.02        Until 1983 the most important R&D subsectors financed by CDTI were
electronics and electrical equipment, transportatior. equpment and mechanical
_ndustries.  In 1984 the electronics subsector continued to attract the
highest relative participation of CDTI financing, although biotechnology was
an important newcomer (13.5Z of the total committed in 1984). A detailed
breakdown is available in the PCR file. (A list of the documents available in
this file is shown in Annex 3.) The overall classification of CDTI's
operations is shown in the following table.

4.03        Few of the projects involved advanced indigenous research.  Most
were for development and engineering based on existing basic technological and
scientific advances, either by introducing foreign technology not yet known in
Spain, or by improving already known technology. This task of efficiently
selecting, absorbing, adapting and improving existing advanced technology is
of the greatest importance in developing countries and was so considered in
the appraisal of the Project.
4.04        The average cost of the CDTI financed projects was Ptas. 61.2
(US$0.51) million and CDTI's participation averaged Ptas. 32.8 (US$0.28)
million. A classification by size follows:

C.    Snonsor Ownershig
4.05        Most of CDTI's assistance has been channelled to private
enterprises, including some subsidiaries of foreign firms. The few operations
with public sector institutions have, however, been larger than average (3.91
of the projects accounted for 17.5% of the total cost for all CDTI projects).
The main public sector beneficiaries were: ENADIKSA for a process to
concentrate complex ores by a single selective flotation process and for the
technology, design and construction of a treatment plant for solid urban
waste; ATEINSA for the design and engineering of a manoeuver yard locomotive;
Energia e Industrias Aragonesas, for a system to regenerate metallic anodes;
Empresa Nacional de Petroleo (ENPETROL) for the development of an
oligomerization process to obtain high octane gasoline; OFICINEM for energy
saving studies in cement production; and the national telephone company (CTNE)
for design of hardware and software for data processing, telecommunications
and establishment of a design unit for integrated circuits.
D.    Financial Aspects
4.06        Project sponsors generally financed between 30X to 551 of the
project costs while CDTI financed the balance; the average share of the
sponsors in their project costs was 46.61. Through December 1984, CDTI had
received budgetary allocations totalling US$96.1 million from Government and
had committed US$87.3 million. Government support to CDTI was increasing and
reached Ptas. 8.0 billion in 1985 (US$52.3 million) as compared to Ptas. 2.1
billion (US$13.7 million) in 1984. Actual disbursements stood at US$48.2
million, one third of which was drawn from the Loan proceeds as shown in the
following table:

V. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Targe-ted Activities and Generation of Technology Proiects
5.01        During the period 1974-1984, Spain's expenditures for RD&E were
mostly for basic research in institutions of higher education and the payment
of licenses, royalties and know-how for imported technology. Payments abroad
for technology increased from US$316 million in 1974 to US$720 million in 1982
and then dropped by about 20X through 1984, as shown below. Approximateiy 60%
of the payments abroad were for licenses and royalties, and the balance for
technical know-how.

The deficit widened in absolute terms, but dropped from 50X of the net cost of
total R&D expenditures in 1974 to 361 in 1984. As is frequently the case,
the main importers of technology were subsidiaries of foreign companies.
5.02        The appraisal report noted that Government R&D efforts were
dispersed over too many institutions working without sufficient coordination
and spread over too many research areas. Progress to counteract these trends
has been slow. Although steps were being taken to improve the situation
through legislation (e.g., overall planning in science and technology would be
the responsibility of an interministerial body), it was not clear that the
proposals at that time to create a complicated administrative superstructure
would improve the efficiency of R&D activities.
5.03        For the successful development of modern, competitive technology it
is not sufficient to have organizations such as CDTI alone; the policy
framework should foster efficiency in industry and should not distort
investment decisions by encouraging ventures that are not economically
justified. Therefore, in spite of the success achieved by CDTI (up to 1985),
the subsequent development of the country's technological base would require
continued attention to policy inconsistencies in the incentive framework for
the importation of capital goods and technology and in the laws governing
patents and licensing of foreign and domestic technology.
5.04        During appraisal of the Bank's Project, it was thought that CDTI
would initially concentrate on some priority areas (electronics, mechanical
industries and food processing) where technological progress could most easily
be absorbed by Spanish industry and competitiveness improved. However, the
initial reaction of industry was lukewarm. Thus, in order to obtain a
sufficiently large volume of activities to make its weight felt, CDTI
correctly decided to promote R&D in a large number of areas. In response to
growing demand for R&D in new disciplines, CDTI later participated in research
projects in biotechnology and aquaculture. There was also from the start an
important change in the source of proposals for technology development.
During appraisal, it was expected that the initial ideas would originate
mainly in CDTI, which would then conduct market studies, identify product
lines, and commission, finance and supervise the necessary R&D. Thus,
although the actual R&D would have been carried out by public and private
sector institutions, the scope of these activities would have been largely
determined by CDTI1/. This entity did, in fact, carry out several studies
which were made available to the public. However, with few exceptions, the
projects financed by CDTI were initiated and defined by the interested firms
themselves.

Subproject Evaluation
5.05        is previously pointed out (para. 3.13), CDTI initially attached
excessive weight to the financial condition of project sponsors. This policy
was subsequently relaxed somewhat, but applicants still had to be able to put
up substantial collateral. As a result, individual inventors could generally
not obtain assistance from CDTI unless they were independently wealthy or were
associated with an enterprise (para. 3.14). During the PCR mission, CDTI
stated that this policy would be continued and that employment of the
individual inventor by an enterprise, e.g.. by the Spanish subsidiary of a
multinational cooperation, would be beneficial. However, this policy may
delay the development of entrepreneurship of the type that has fostered rapid              -3
technological change elsewhere.  Bank supervision missions commented
frequently on this aspect of Spanish R&D, which was not adequately addressed
by the then existing sector policy.
Scaling-up of Facilities for New Products and Processes Developed in
CDTI SubDroiects
5.06        Many CDTI projects which reached the prototype or pilot plant
stage were not scaled up to commercial production or full s'zd industrial
operation.  In some-cases, the final economic and financial arnalyses indicated
that the project would  ot be viable.  In other cases, financing of the
investments re#uired in plant and equipment, market penetration and working
capital were tl1e principal obstacles.  This underlines the need for more
careful consideration of the commercial potential of proposed projects. It
also highlights the need for the development in Spain of venture capital
companies or other types of financial intermediaries with the resources and
the willingness to take substantial risks in exchange for high potential
returns. Such investing in the final stage of new product/process development
is indispensable for aggressive anid continued technological progress in
industrializing and industrialized countries alike. In spite of some efforts
in the country at the time, the availability of risk capital in Spain remained
limited and needed to be further developed.
VI. ROLE QF THE BANK tND LESSONS LEARNED
A.   The Bank's Role
6.01        Starting in the mid-1960s, the Bank participated actively in
discussions with the Spanish Government, OECD and other organizations on the
possibility of improving the country's research programs.  During appraisal
and initial supervision, the Bank assisted in formulating the criteria for
research project evaluation and other work related to R&D -apacity
development. The Bank also arranged visits by CDTI officials to RD&E groups
in the U.S. In November 1983, the Bank sponsored, jointly with CDTI, a
seminar on the "Technological Aspects of Development: The Spanish



- 18-
Experience." The seminar attracted an international audience and provided a
fruitful forum for the exchange of ideas in this field.
6.02        The Bank played a decisive role in developing a system for the
acquisition, adaptation and creation of new industrial technology in Spain,
was instrumental in developing an organization dedicated to this end, and in
securing the necessary autonomy for it. Through this, the Bank assisted in
making Spanish industry aware of the necessity of using the most appropriate
technology if industry is to grow and remain competitive.
6.03        On the debit side, the Bank failed to foresee the difficulties
that CDTI would encounter in applying the procurement and disbursement
procedures of the Loan (para. 3.20). It did not follow the Project's
implementation closely enough, despite the fact that this was the first
project of its kind both for Spain and for the Bank. Between March 1978 and
November 1983 there were five supervision missions, i.e., one every 14 months;
this was on the low side for a project of this type. Perhaps as a result, the
Bank did not obtain advance information on the changes in CDTI's organization
and management that took place early in 1984 (para. 3.06). The Bank was also
somewhat lax in enforcing CDTI's reporting requirements. Annual external
audits of CDTI did not take place because CDTI was part of the Ministry of
Industry until the end of 1983. The first annital external audit (for the year
1984) was in progress at the time of the PCR mission. The compliance with
covenants is shown in Annex 4.
B. ''Lessons for the Borrower and the Bank
6.04        The needs for assistance in R&D in different countries may differ
considerably. Therefore, it is not prudent to try to embody the ideal
organization for a technology development unit into a unique recipe. There
are, howe-cr, some general lessons from the Project under review:
LESSONS
(a)   The project was, on balance, successful in large part because the
timing for technology development investment was appropriate to
Spain's level of industriclization, the recent entry into the
labor marketplace of a large pool of technical manpower and the
need to stimulate increased R,D&E in industry. This demonstrates
the importance of appropriate training for projects of this type.
CDTI has since become a key arm of the Government in stimulating
industrial technology development.
(b)   The project, the first of its kind for the Bank, was also sensibly
flexible in its organizational structure and approach. However,
it was initially rigid on procurement and disbursement procedures-
-the procedures needed modification and this was done after an
excessive amount of time. In such instances, the Bank should



- 19
respond more quickly in modifying procedures, etc., than was done
in this case.
(c)   The role of CDTI, like similar institutions elsewhere, changed
gradually from an agency whose role was primarily to promote
technological development as part of the Government, to one whose
role became more demand driven and financing-oriented with
increased autonomy, as indigenous technological capability grew
and, most particularly, as it became clear that Spain would have
to compete within technologically advanced Europe.
(d)   While the Bank was instrumental in helping to create CDTI and in
developing its modus operandi, it was less successful in
supervising this first effort and in helping CDTI learn from
experience and mistakes. The Bank, furthermore, did not take all
the time necessary to work with CDTI to develop its financial
instruments, its supervision techniques, etc., for the benefit of
CDTI as well as subsequently for applying these lessons to other
countries.
(e)   With respect to financial instruments, the conditional loan repaid
with royalties became the preferred vehicle for CDTI financing.
The royalty payment formula was a complex one, which ultimately,
even for successful projects, did not result in significant profit
for CDTI to make up for the failures, even though the proportion
of failures was well below the percentage anticipated (13X
compared to normal 33X).  This was an area where the Bank could
have provided more financial expertise. Consequently, when a new
administration took over CDTI in early 1982, in attempting to
correct the errors of the previous administration, it simply
adopted a more conservative traditional lending approach and
gradually phased out conditional lending.
(f)   Likewise, as CDTI's role as a financier of industrial technology
development grew in importance, the Bank should probably have
insisted earlier and more consistently on the need for CDTI (i) to
emphasize in its loan evaluation late-stage development and
commercialization rather than research; and (ii) to de-emphasize
financial strength and the collateral of the borrower in order to
promote the development of really innovative technologies.
(g)   Insufficient attention was devoted to other policies (e.g., tax
incentives) related to industrial technology development (ITD).
Although these have developed rapidly in recent years, the Bank
could have contributed more throughout the project in identifying
constraints and proposing policy and program alternatives.
(h)   In summary, while the project, with significant Bank contribution,
was well conceived, appropriate for the Spain of the mid-1970s and
on the whole accomplished its objectives, the project and CDTI was
slow to evolve to the needs of the 1980s--ITD and



- 20 -
commercialization of new technologies. The Bank did not
contribute as much as would have been desirable to helping CDTI
evolve in the later stages of the project.
Bank Procurement and Disbursement Procedures
6.05        Bank procurement and disbursement procedures for this kind of
project should reflect the reality of RD&E activities. Normal procurement and
disbursement procedures applied by the Bank in direct loans to industry are
not practical in this kind of project. DFC type procurement policies should
be the rule. For very small items, which are quite common in some RD&E
activities, local purchasing procedures would be advisable.
Commercialization of SubDroject Results
6.06        In the process of project preparation and appraisal, careful
consideration should be given to the availability of financial resources for
scaling up technically successful RD&E results developed by researchers or
companies not strong enough to undertake this type of financing on their own.
The necessity of creating new financial institutions and/or establishing
formal links with existing financial intermediaries and potential sources of
venture capital should be explored from the start in order to avoid costly
delays, and in some cases failures, in the development of new products and
processes.
Promotion of Technological EntreDreneurshiD
6.07        Related to the above aspects, the widespread absence in most
developing countries of mechanisms, policies and incentives to stimulate
entrepreneurship of individual inventors or to create limited partnerships
should be the subject of special consideration during preparation of R&D
projects.
General
6.08        In a project of this type it is not appropriate to calculate
financial or economic rates of return.  However, it is clear that in spite of
some deficiencies, the Industrial RD&E Project in Spain had important
achievements. The project had a significant impact on the thinking of
industry executives in a number of highly innovative fields such as
electronics and biotechnology. Even in large enterprises, CDTI support for a
research proposal legitimized the research function and enabled researchers to
request appropriate funding and stronger commitments from their respective
Board of Directors.



- 21
6.09        While recognizing that it would not be possible to exactly
replicate a Project such as the one under review, many of its features and the
lessons learned could be usefullv applied in future R&D projects in other
countries. In summary, the investment in this Project promoted the
development of a more efficient and competitive industry and assisted in
opening up new fields of activity for Spanish manufacturing. The support
provided by CDTI had a catalytic effect on the development of Spanish RD&E
capabilities.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SPAIN - INDUSTRIAL RD&E PROJECT
SOME EXAMPLES OF CDTI SUPPORTED PROJECTS
Desiln and Organization of a Center to Manufacture Integrated Circuits.
This project was approved on December 13, 1979, together with
another, very costly project, both sponsored by the Compania Telefonica
Nacional de Espania (CTNE). The cost of this project was estimated at Ptas
32 million with a CDTI participation of Ptas 16 million and an
implementation time of 24 months. The objective was to develop a unit
capable of designing custom made integrated circuits and the possibility of
making them in existing 'planar' technology plants; at the same time a
learning process would be started In building specialized plants. The
group acquired a CAD computer, a CALMA computer, a logical analyzer,
micromnmipulators, etc. The implementation of the project was delayed 30
months but the final cost (excluding salaries) was close to budget.  The
project was technically successful. Sales began in 1982, and are expected
* to grow more rapidly than estimated at the time of presentation of the
project to CDTI's Board. In another project costing Ptas 246 million (with
a Ptas 100 million CDTI participation), CTNE, associated with two private
enterprises (SECOINSA and SINTRE), developed prototypes for telephone data
transmission systems that were up to then imported. Some equipment has
already been installed for Spanish customers and customers abroad have
shown interest. However, projected sales are lower than original
estimates.
DesiRg of a Battery for Solar Photovolatic ApDlications.
This project was approved by CDTI on January 30, 1981 for an
estimated cost of Ptas 9.3 million with a 68X participation by CDTI. The
objective was to design a 1OKU battery to store electric energy generated
by a solar photovoltaic generator; it would therefore be capable of
receiving and storing electric power fluctuating in intensity not only
according to the hours of the day but also according to the seasons. The
project sponsor, Fabrica Espanola Magnetos S.A. (FEMSA) successfully
designed and built two generations of battery prototypes. The project was
implemented on time and within budget. The selling price of the batteries
designed by FENSA has been estimated to be 20X higher than those built in
otter European countries. This might be an acceptable margin for a new
irdustry incorporating a technology not yet applied in Spain. However,
actual production of the batteries will have to wait until a program for
experimental solar power plants is developed. Therefore no sales are
forecast for the near future.

industry. On March 27, 1979, it obtained financial assistance from CDTI
covering 572 of the Ptas 87 million project cost to develop a tile tunnel
furnace where temperature control at different locations should be
exercised with greater precision then in the furnaces then in use in
Spain. The problem was that while the temperature should be smoothly
graduated lengthwise as the tiles move along the tunnel, the crosswise
temperature should be as uniform as possible. The project was technically
successful but after a prototype was built, the promoter of the enterprise
died and there was not enough interest to continue the project. Thli is an
interesting case where the importance of the individual entrepreneur was of
decisive importance in the development of a new business. Although not
assisted by CDTi, Tercersa successfully developed an instrument to measure
the presence of small cracks in tilea based on electric voltage
differentials rather than by using sound waves.
Radioisotopes for Clinical Diagnosis
On April 10, 1984, CDTI agreed to finance 50S of this Ptas 38
million project aimed at the development of tracing compounds based On
radloactive technecium for diagnosis based on the absorption of specific
compounds at specific sites in the human body. The technology is well
known abroad. Its introduction in Spain by Isotopos y Derivados S.Ae, a
partnership between one of the largest Spanish pharmaceutical manufacturers
and a research group, was well received by the medical profession so that
sales, which had been expected to begin in 1986, actually started in
November 1984. The company intends to separate radioactive technecium, now
being imported, and incorporate it into the compounds administered to
patients. For this purpose, it has obtained from CDTI, in October 1984, a
second credit for 50Z of the estimated cost of this project (Ptas 54.4
Electronic Artificial Respirator
Approved by CDTI on June 30, 1980, this project, sponsored by
Manufacturas Medicas S.A. , aimed at developing a respirator which would
feed back information on the patient's reaction. The proposed design was
new not only in Spain but also abroad when it was presented to CDTI. The
cost of the project was estimated at Ptaa 33.9 million and CDTI assumed
66Zo The project has been successful but because the company is not known
outside Spain (where the main market ib.) and has no established
distribution network, sales projections have been reduced. In 1982, only
32 respirators were sold instead of the estimated 227. In the meantime,

other companies (SLemens, ATM, Robert & Carrier) have introduced or are
introducing models competing wlth the Pulmosystem Z-800 made by
Manufacturas Medicas S.A. The company,in a defensive strategy, entered
into a contract to sell lts technology to Aire Shlelds Inc. (U.S.).
Mercury/Membrane Chlorine Electrolytic Call
IavestigacLon Quimica Industrial, a small research group jointly
sponsored by a large process Ludustry (EnergLa e Industrias Aragonesas) and
an engineeriag firm (TecuLcas Reunidas), presented a proposal to develop
a new type of cell for the electrolysis of sodlum chloride brine to produce
chlorlne and caustic soda, in which the advantages of a conventional
mercury cell (higher product purity) and a maubrane cell (lower operating
cost) could be combined. An added advantage sought was less floor space
requirements.  The project costing Ptas 80.3 m$llon (501 financed by CDTI)
ws approved by CDTI on October 26, 1978. Pilot tests carried out in 1980
showed It to be technically satlsfactory and patents were applied for in
the US and Europe. Unfortunately, fabrication of the type of polyu.r used
in the membranes, made by Dupont, was discontinued. The project dld not
become commercially viable because the productlon volum  for the
semL-permeable membranes was not suffLcient to justify lts manufacture in
Spain or elawhere.
-industrial Modules for Innovative Enterprises.
Thls project aimed at establishing an LndustrLal park specialized
in providLng mdules and servlces for embryonic enterprises developing new
technologies. The park was to have a deslgn center for all customers as
well as a building for offlce space and solar energy utillzation systems,
which would allow making comparlsons ln different modules. The project was
approved on July 29, 1982, and lts estimated cost of Ptas 16.0 mllion was
1OO1 fLnanced by CDTI. No sales forecast was made at the time of approval
by the Board (where lt was presented as a study and not as a project).
vtne  inditles were hiitlt. h,,t %fth the rvtA nf r?aqmant ve% r'WiT neiv 
foreseen, it ls dlfflcult to imaglne that repayment wlll be made ln less
than 50 years.
Reactance for Fluorescent LLghts
CDTI financed 50% of the Ptas 32.4 million cost of a project
developed by Glbbs & Rill Espanola S.A. for the design, development and
prototype constructlon of improved reactances for special uses (such as
400W mercury halLde, 70-400W high pressure sodlum vapor, and very high
emission lamps). According to the project sponsors, the efficlency
lmprovements of fluorscent lamps obtained ln the last few years was wiped
out by higher losses ln the reactances. The project took 12 months (5
month delay) but the fLnal cost at Ptas 29.7 mllion was below budget
Present sales projectLons are lower than orLgLnally forecast, because the
range of products to be offered has been narrowed down.
