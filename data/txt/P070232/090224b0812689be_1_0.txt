                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The GEF project was declared effective on December 27, 2007 and has then faced major difficulties during the first years of implementation. During the Mid-term review (MTR)
                         mission of this project (May 2010), it was jointly agreed by the Government of Gabon and the Bank that this project needed a thorough restructuring. During the nine months following

                         the MTR, the project team and the Bank team have closely worked together and the restructuring of the project got formally by the Board on May13th, 2011. The Project is now back
                         to a "Satisfactory" status. Major improvements can be highlighted: (i) activities on the ground are implemented according to a clearly defined 2-year Action Plan, (ii) disbursement
                         rate has significantly improved (66 per cent) and commitment amounts to about 80 per cent, (iii) results framework is in place and operational and (iv) safeguards capacities have
                         been reinforced both within the governmental entities and NGOs providing support to the National Parks.

                         A supervision mission was planned to be organized in January 2012 (6 months after the last SPN mission). However, the WB missions were frozen during the mid-Jan/mid-Feb
                         period because of the African Soccer Cup and the mission had to be postponed to May/June 2012. In order to maintain a regular dialogue on the project, a 3-hour videoconference
                         was organized on December 13, 2011 between the ANPN team and the WB team to (i) discuss with the ANPN team on progress made since the last mission and (ii) jointly review
                         the level of implementation of the 2-year action plan defined during the restructuring of the project and (iii) update the Result framework (this exercise was also based on field
                         missions organized in December 2011 and January 2012 in the GEF-targeted National Parks). This ISR has been updated based on the outcomes of both the Videoconference and
                         the field missions in the targeted parks.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project Development Objective has been revised as part of the restructuring process and now reads: "The Project Development Objective is to (i) enhance the conservation of
                         biodiversity in selected National Parks and buffer zones; and (ii) strengthen the management capacity of selected conservation- related entities in Gabon". The Result Framework has
                         accordingly been revised. The four Components of the Projects are now:
                         Component 1. Institutional Strengthening of the ANPN
                         Component 2. Enhanced knowledge on critical natural habitats for the expansion of the Network of the National Parks
                         Component 3. Support to selected National Parks
                         Component 4: Improved wildlife management and law enforcement in the periphery of the National parks.
