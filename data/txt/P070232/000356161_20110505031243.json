The restructuring is\n            to better align the project activities to: 1) the priorities\n            in the conservation area in Gabon, including some emerging\n            needs that had not been identified during the preparation of\n            the project as well as; 2) the existing institutional\n            capacities. These adjustments will also imply some resource\n            reallocations amongst the different categories of\n            expenditures as well as a 12-month extension of the closing\n            date. Additionally, it is to align the formulation of the\n            Project Development Objectives (PDO) as described in the\n            Project Appraisal Document (PAD) with those negotiated and\n            agreed upon by the bank and the recipient in the grant\n            agreement. The change reflects the changes in the national\n            priorities in terms of conservation in Gabon."}, "docdt": "2011-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
