1     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1     Context at Appraisal

      1. Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, incorporated under the Companies Ordinance,
         was set up in 2000 by the Government of Pakistan, with World Bank financing
         through PPAF-1 project, as an apolitical, autonomous, performance driven
         institution to provide resources and services to the poor through partner civil society
         organizations.
      2. The Second Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund project (PPAF-2) like its
         predecessor, continued to support an apex-body that employed a ―lean and cost-
         efficient‖ institutional mechanism of channeling funds, grants and technical
         assistance through a national network of locally based Partner Organizations, NGOs
         mandated by PPAF to work with local communities to implement development
         activities aimed at improving the lives and livelihoods of targeted poor.4 In terms of
         developmental activities, however, PPAF-1 focused more on building the Pakistan
         Poverty Alleviation Fund as a pro-poor institution that could work nation-wide and
         provide access to finance for the rural and urban poor through micro-credit.
      3. At appraisal in 2003, poverty in Pakistan continued to persist at more or less the
         same levels since the nineties, and two-thirds of the poor resided in rural areas
         where their poverty and vulnerability was more deep and severe than urban poverty.
         The rural poor struggled with low incomes, powerlessness, poor health and
         malnutrition, insufficient skills, and lack of access to basic needs - such as clean
         drinking water, proper sanitation, basic health and education. Recurring natural
         calamities, high inflation, rising levels of ethnic and religious strife, and rising food
         and fuel prices pushed the poor below the poverty line and increased their
         vulnerability to unprecedented levels. Similarly, weak governance structures in the
         country continued to exclude the poorest and most vulnerable, particularly women,
         from decision making processes.
      4. Formal financial institutions shied away from supporting the poor due to high
         transaction costs, while the effective annual interest rates in the informal sector
         ranged from 80 to 120 percent per annum, proving very expensive for the poor—
         resulting in little or no savings and high levels of life-long indebtedness.
      5. During the appraisal for PPAF-2, it was clear that a multi-dimensional and multi-
         sectoral approach to poverty reduction was necessary if PPAF was to have a
         meaningful and sustainable impact at the community and household levels.
         Therefore, the second project placed a stronger focus on provision of microcredit,

 Through the rest of the document, the acronyms PPAF-1 and PPAF-2 refer to the first and second phases of the World
Bank funded Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund projects. The acronym PPAF refers to the Pakistani institution supported
by those projects.


                                                          1
          infrastructure, social services, skills enhancement and training to the poor and low
          income, especially women and in rural and drought prone areas.
      6. PPAF-2 aligned with the Bank‘s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of 2004 5
         which had the primary goal of reducing poverty in Pakistan through ―pro-poor and
         pro-gender-equity‖ policies. It was also consistent with the Government‘s Poverty
         Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and with the Millennium Development Goal of
         reducing the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. The project sought to
         build access to finance through micro-credit grants and insurance and to basic
         services through demand-driven community infrastructure. It also worked to
         improve non-farm incomes through skills development and improve access to social
         services, such as basic health and education.
      7. During the five years of PPAF-2 implementation, PPAF proved to be a flexible,
         vibrant and inventive institution that was able to disburse funds quickly, and, more
         importantly, those funds reached the intended beneficiaries. The Government of
         Pakistan and other donors also began to channel funds through PPAF.
      8. When disasters, such as the 2005 earthquake, floods in 2010 and the Sindh and
         Balochistan floods in 2011 struck, PPAF was well positioned to respond because
         they already had a presence, a transparent and accountable disbursement system,
         and a multi-sectoral team in place. PPAF-2 received three additional financings for
         two new components: (1) Emergency Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
         (E3RP) in 2005 and 2007 to finance the earthquake response; and (2) Social
         Mobilization Component (SMC) in 2008. The context of these additions was in
         complete congruence to the above stated four goals of the CAS. E3RP provided the
         much needed support for restoring lives and livelihoods of people adversely
         affected by the earthquake. The SMC enhanced access of poor to economic
         resources and services by deepening the process of organizing communities into
         COs, and further ensuring that the COs federate into Local Service Organization
         (LSOs) at the Union Council or higher levels.
      9. Taking on new mandates—such as responding to emergencies—stretched the
         capacities of PPAF and its POs; however, PPAF has since incorporated these
         experiences into its organization by forming new units and hiring more staff to
         work on disaster response and reconstruction since this appears to be an ongoing
         need.
1.2      Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

      10. The PDO of the PPAF-2 as stated in the Development Credit Agreement remained
          the same as the PPAF-1 objective: to alleviate poverty by improving the access of
          the rural and urban poor to economic resources and services.

   11. Nevertheless, according to the PAD, the development objective was to reduce the
       incidence of poverty in the country through provision of resources and services to
       the poor and low income, particularly women. Although, the emphasis on women in
       the PAD was not mentioned in the Development Credit Agreement, throughout the
       project implementation including the Mid-Term Review (MTR), the importance of
       gender issues was emphasized. The key indicators are as follows:

1.2.1 Key PDO indicators agreed in the PAD
      Income/asset levels increase at least by 20% on average during the project period;
      Maintain a 98% repayments rate;
      Operational subsidy as a proportion of the loan disbursed maintained on average at
       10%;
      Increased number of micro-credit loans;
      Increased number of community members participating in skill development
       activities;
      Significant improvement in community infrastructure; and
      Access of poor to social services including education and health facilities.

1.2.2 With the addition of Social Mobilization Component, the following key indicators
      were added:
      An additional 50,000 COs formed by PPAF and Partner Organizations;
      65% of all CO members are from the poor and poorest households, with more than
       40% of overall membership is female;
      25% of CO leadership and/or managerial positions are held by poor and poorest
       households;
      65% of COs federated into village organizations (VOs) and 25% of these are
       federated at UC level as LSOs to access private and public sector services and
       resources;
      55% of COs, VOs, and LSOs rated as ‗good‘ or above in the annual performance
       audit in terms of transparency and accountability; and
      25% of COs engaged in larger scale innovative development activities with local
       Government and private sector and 55% of COs, VOs, and LSOs rated as good, or
       above in the annual performance audit in terms of transparency and accountability

1.2.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
   12. The PDO remained unchanged, but the indicators were revised following the Mid-
       Term Review (January 2007) as well as those added at the time of additional
       financing in August 2009. The agreed new indicators were:
      Higher income levels of poor households through provision of loans and skill
       development;
      Better standards of living for the poor through provision of community level
       infrastructure;
      Empowerment of the poor, especially women;
      Improved institutional capacity and financial sustainability of communities, POs as
       well as PPAF; and
      Provision of quality primary healthcare and formal primary education, ensuring
       maximum outreach to girls and women in order to address gender disparities.
      2000 infrastructure schemes completed with mature institutions of poor and the
       communities are maintaining infrastructure.
   13. In order to increase the focus on four chronically poor coastal districts of Sindh and
       to include finance for physical and economic interventions in addition to social
       mobilization, an amendment was made in August 2009 and following additional
       indicators were added to the Social Mobilization Component:
      The number of CO reaches 1,050 in the selected 750 settlements of the SCAD
       districts and at least 65% of them federate into Village Organizations (VOs) and
       25% of the VOs federate at the UC level;
      65% of all CO members are from the poor and poorest households and more than
       40% of overall memberships is female;
      25% of CO leadership and/or managerial positions are held by poor and poorest
       households;
      Over 1200 new infrastructure schemes including 975 conventional CPIs have been
       completed.
      At least 1000 poorest families benefitted from improved health and education under
       the Social Sector Development Projects (SSDPs).
      At least 1000 poor individuals trained to improve their productive skills and
       increase their incomes either through strengthening of their existing income sources
       or through gaining employment.
      At least 20% of federated COs report effective linkages with markets and private
       sector.

1.3     Main Beneficiaries

      14. The primary beneficiaries of the project were the poor and disadvantaged of the
          country, especially women. Since the project also played an important role in
          providing support to Pro-Poor Civil Society Organizations, other key beneficiaries
          included Partner Organizations (POs).
1.4     Original Components

      15. The project stared out with a large number of components, six in all, posing
          considerable implementation challenges given that implementation spread across a
          country of 170+ million people. The introduction of two new components added
          more complexity and challenged PPAF 6 to provide quick relief followed by
          restoration and rehabilitation of a large number of communities that were adversely
          affected by the unprecedented earthquake of 2005. Finally, another social
          mobilization component was added as bridge financing for the new PPAF-3 project
          for building institutions of the poor (namely community organizations, or COs)
          with the support of the POs using strong social mobilization processes that
          established group norms - such as, strong participation; inclusion of the poorest,
          disabled, and women; and transparent decision making processes. These COs were
          to become the platform through which the project benefits could be distributed in an
          equitable manner across regions and groups and implemented in a sustainable
          manner
      16. Component 1: Micro-Credit and Enterprise Development (MED) Loans (IDA:
          US$158 million, Reflows: US$100 million; Revised Reflows, US$600 million;
          Total component cost at completion: US$758 million). This was the largest
          component of the PPAF-2 and comprised lending to POs (as a credit) for on-lending
          to individuals or groups of individuals meeting the eligibility criteria of PPAF. The
          goal was to provide one million new loans for over 0.5 million borrowers by
          disbursing US$235 million for micro-credit and an additional US$23 million to
          cover the delivery costs incurred by POs.
      17. Component 2: Small Scale Infrastructure Projects (IDA: US$58 million,
          Community Contribution: US$13 million-Revised: IDA US$69 million,
          Community contribution: US$22 million; Total component cost: US$91
          million). The component provided grants on a cost sharing basis to finance small-
          scale infrastructure projects identified by Community Organizations (COs). It was
          estimated that US$65 million would be used for project civil works (59 percent for

 PPAF was not meant to act as a disaster management agency, it was a new role entrusted on PPAF. PPAF
did a splendid job.

         conventional projects7 and 32 percent for new initiatives8) while the remainder were
         allocated to cover POs capital and operational costs.
      18. Component 3: Education and Health Projects (IDA: US$5 million; Revised
          IDA: US$19 million). This component provided grant money to make quality
          education and health services available to the poor, especially women. It aimed to
          finance operational and capital costs as well as training, skills and capacity
          development. It prohibited the use of funds for purchase of land and vehicles and
          required beneficiary communities to share capital/renovation and operational costs.
      19. Component 4: Training and Skill Development (IDA: US$9 million; Revised
          IDA: US$14 million). This component provided grants for operational support and
          the training of communities and staff of POs and PPAF. It was intended to support
          the expenses of PPAF-organized workshops/seminars and the costs to set up and
          operationalize a Management Information System (MIS).
      20. Component 5: Capital and Operating Costs of PPAF (IDA: US$15 million;
          Revised IDA: US$21 million). This component was meant to provide funds for (i)
          civil works required for the construction of PPAF‘s office in Islamabad (US$1.8
          million); (ii) capital cost to equip the new building (US$ 0.7 million); (iii)
          consultancies for baseline socioeconomic data collection, post intervention impact
          assessments and technical assistance for improving data management and financial
          systems (US$ 3.4 million); and (iv) incremental operating costs of PPAF-2 on a
          declining basis with PPAF covering all costs by the end of PPAF-2 (US$ 2.1
          million).
      21. Component 6: Equity for PPAF (Government of Pakistan: US$10 million). As
          per the PPAF-2 DCA, GOP provided a second injection of equity into the
          endowment intended ensure the sustainability of PPAF operations in future.
1.5     Revised Components

      22. The six project components were not revised; however, three subsequent
          components were added.
1.6     Other significant changes

      23. In 2005, Pakistan was hit by the worst earthquake it has ever experienced killing at
          least 73,000 people, severely injuring another 70,000 and leaving 2.8 million people
          without shelter, especially in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) province and eastern
          Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.9 This required rapid response and in view of

 Drinking water supply, irrigation, sanitation, link roads and bridges, flood protection works

 New Initiatives aimed at integrated development, dissemination of low-cost, appropriate technologies such as micro-
hydels, desalination, windmill and solar pump projects, and drought mitigation and preparedness plans.

    PPAF‘s exceptional track record and existing presence in the areas, it was entrusted
    with the responsibility to provide immediate relief to affected communities and to
    help restore their lives and hope. It led to the addition of two new components:
   Component 7: Disaster Recovery (IDA: US$ 5 million). In order to support the
    relief efforts in the earthquake affected areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and
    AJK, IDA agreed to divert US$ 5 million from the Small Scale Infrastructure
    Projects (Component 2).
   Component 8: Emergency Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (E3RP) -
    (IDA: US$ 238 million). Responding to the 2005 Earthquake in KP and AJK, a
    component was added through two amendments to the original DCA (Dec 2005 and
    May 2007) to address the needs of restoration, rehabilitation and reconstruction of
    earthquake affected villages and communities. It included (i) reconstruction of low-
    cost seismically housing in earthquake hit village of KP and AJK; (ii) rehabilitation
    and reconstruction of village level infrastructure; (iii) Restoration & Revitalization
    of Communities; and (iv) disaster recovery assistance.
24. Component 9: Participatory Development through Social Mobilization (IDA:
    US$ 75 million; Revised IDA: US$ 25 million). Despite the fact that both PPAF-1
    and 2 were CDD projects, it did not have a component for mobilizing the poor. The
    groups were formed around microcredit and infrastructure in which not enough
    attention was being paid on building the institutions of the poor to empower them,
    to give them voice to raise their concerns and issues, and to use collective resources
    to enhance their incomes and productivity.
25. The results and achievement of PPAF-2 on one hand reinforced the view that there
    was a value in investing greater resources in mobilizing people and forging
    institutions of the poor to unleash their potential and imagination. On the other hand,
    the Bank and Government of Pakistan agreed in principle for a follow up operation
    PPAF-3, which was not likely to become effective by the time PPAF 2 was coming
    to an end. The Interim period provided a good opportunity to initiate social
    mobilization as a start up to PPAF-3.
26. Accordingly, in December 2007, a new component was added to PPAF-2 for
    mobilizing poor households, especially ultra poor, marginalized groups and women
    into existing and new community organizations and to help them federate COs into
    Village Organizations and Local Support Organizations (LSOs) at the union council
    level (US$ 75 million). In August 2009, the Financing Agreement was amended to
    incorporate the use of additional funds for: (a) SSIPs and SSDPs and; (b) inclusion
    of Sindh Coastal Areas Development (SCAD) districts of Karachi, Badin, Thatta
    and Tharparker.

2     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

      27. The project design was satisfactory. The PDO was clear; however, the original
          indicators prepared in the PAD were not always well defined and there are
          discrepancies between the indicators given in the text and those in the Project
          Design Summary (PDS). A number of indicators given in the PDS do not provide
          targets, only elements to be measured. These factors led to a revision of indicators
          during the Mid-Term Review (MTR). Given the fact that the project was follow-on
          to PPAF-1, those indicators could have been better defined at conception.
      28. The introduction of two new components for emergency relief, rehabilitation, and
          reconstruction added another US$238 million, equal to the original allocation for
          PPAF-2. The additional financing design was satisfactory, but it added complexity
          to the original project design and challenged PPAF to deliver in the face of an
          unparalleled human tragedy.
      29. The Social Mobilization Component (SMC) design was satisfactory. The process of
          organizing communities followed the well-tested participatory approach that has
          proved to be very successful in Pakistan and in other SAARC countries.
          Furthermore, the experience of AKRSP and the World Bank-supported Andhra
          Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Program in India showed that, for substantial and
          sustainable impacts on poverty, ‗blanket coverage‘ of a district is required and COs
          need to be federated into larger organizations capable of: (a) accessing services and
          resources from public and private sectors; and (b) articulating their demands and
          priorities to local and provincial governments.
2.2     Implementation

      30. PPAF-2 was a complex project with several ―moving parts‖, and implementation
          took place in extremely challenging and in some ways unprecedented circumstances.
          Several factors affected implementation, particularly the devastating earthquake of
          2005; colossal floods in 2010; significant deterioration in the macro-economic
          environment; and rising conflict, insecurity, and political instability across the
          country. The earthquake response almost doubled the amount of financing
          channeled through PPAF. This was unanticipated at preparation and considerably
          increased the strain on PPAF‘s institutional capabilities. PPAF proved to be an
          essential and extremely applied instrument for responding to urgent needs in a
          challenging environment.
      31. The deteriorating security situation, particularly in Balochistan and KP, made
          monitoring and supervision at community level more difficult for PPAF.
          Deterioration in the macro-economic situation has been more recent, and comments
          from the interviewed POs indicate that it is becoming increasingly important in
          accessing funds and the ability of borrowers to repay loans. Similarly the number of


                                               8
         disasters - both seasonal and large scale -negatively affected the ability of the poor
         to repay due to lower wages or distress migration out of the operational area.
         Financial products that cater to disaster prone areas could be developed and more
         insurance products could also be offered.
      32. The key determining factor in the implementation of the SMC was its duration. The
          component, added in 2007, aimed to build institutions of the poor and create a
          hierarchy of community organizations to give the voice and collective bargaining
          forums. Once the community groups were formed, the challenge was to keep the
          groups mobilized and motivated in the transition period between the closure of
          PAF-2 and start of PPAF-3, and to help them build productive linkages with the
          local government, government departments, market and other development partners.
      33. Initially, when social mobilization component as well as the main PPAF-2
          operation was under implementation, there was a window of eight months to
          mobilize COs/VOs/LSOs (from social mobilization funds) and provide community
          infrastructure schemes and health and education services in response to priority
          community needs, through the main project. After the closure of main PPAF-2
          project, community groups continued to be formed under social mobilization
          component but without any CPIs or health and education services. PPAF and POs
          felt that social mobilization process would have been further strengthened, if a
          provision was made in the social mobilization component to respond to priority
          community needs in CPIs and health and education services. Accordingly PPAF
          requested the Bank for an amendment, and in August, 2009 provision of CPIs and
          health and education services was allowed and 4 chronically poor coastal districts
          were added.
      34. While the social mobilization component was extended by one year till June 30
          2011, giving the project implementation a cumulative period of three years in two
          phases. The request for an extension was made in the last six month before project
          closure and it had its ramifications as opposed to an operation with a continued
          implementation period of three years from the start.
2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

      35. Progress was slow during the start up phase in establishing an integrated monitoring
          and evaluation systems that could be shared between PPAF and POs and this
          affected the quality of M&E operations, as noted in several ISRs. A subsequent
          web-based reporting system was introduced that improved the ability of the
          Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting (MER) section to process and analyze data
          and generate reports. At the beginning, PPAF monitoring focused on outputs rather
          than outcomes, but continued to improve over time and more attention as paid on
          monitoring of outcomes. M&E improved significantly during the implementation of
          social mobilization component.



                                               9
      36. The scale and scope of PPAF-2 activities and its multi-sectoral nature generated a
          massive volume of information. Adding to this were the challenges of data
          collection, analysis, regular reporting in order to make timely management
          decisions, collection and coordination of data for activities of over 80 Partner
          Organizations based in cities, villages, and remote, conflict-affected, and disaster
          prone areas. The demands on the M&E system and unit were compounded with the
          addition of the earthquake relief and reconstruction work. Tens of thousands of
          houses and infrastructure in remote areas of KP and AJK were assessed for
          damages by social mobilizers and engineers within a tight time-line to verify the
          extent of damage. Data was collected on a daily basis and fed back to Islamabad for
          verification. Compounding these demands was the poor or damaged infrastructure
          that impeded access to the affected area and the urgency of getting rush to get tents
          out and houses built before the onset of winter.
      37. Amid the push to respond to the earthquake disaster, PPAF placed strong emphasis
          on the accuracy of data collected to prevent fraud (by people claiming grants twice,
          falsifying land-records, claiming they owned damaged houses, elite capture, etc).
          PPAF established an innovate verification system (consisting of photographs, GIS
          coordinates, house-to-house damage assessment, and involving the local patwari)
          which eventually helped to identify and discard over 20,000 bogus compensation
          claims, a measure that saved over US$40 million.
      38. The SMC has an effective M&E system based on outcome indicators, which are
          measurable, precise, time-bound and direct. Besides the MER unit, each operating
          unit in PPAF is responsible for carrying out monitoring and supervision visits. SMC
          activities were carried out in close coordination with PPAF‘s Finance Unit. For
          instance, funds are released only when a PO is cleared by MER, Human and
          Institutional Development Unit, and the relevant operational unit. Therefore, regular
          field visits are mandatory and intervention is monitored more than once in its life
          time.
      39. For better implementation assistance, the MER unit tracks all interventions with the
          GIS coordinates. The coordinates and interventions are validated by PPAF field
          visits to ensure accurate reporting. During field visits, check lists are used to review
          POs, community groups, and the quality of interventions.
2.4     Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

      40. An environmental and social management framework was in place and capacity
          building events were organized for PO staff. Any environmental and social
          concerns regarding the community managed SSIPs and SSDPs were of low
          significance and temporary in nature. Environmental and social safeguards were
          fully complied with, as were the covenants regarding governance and operations.
          Fiduciary covenants required that no more than 25% of outstanding loan amounts
          and 20% of CPI expenditure was received by any single PO. NRSP‘s - the largest


                                                10
         partner organization of PPAF - share of outstanding loans only once breached the
         covenant limit of 25% of outstanding loan. For this, a PPAF request in advance for
         a one time waiver was granted by the Bank on 5 August 2007. All audits reports,
         submitted on time, were unqualified.
      41. A further financial covenant required that average operational subsidies to all POs
          not exceed 10 percent. The average subsidy for all components (credit, CPI, and
          H&E) across all POs was only 4.5 percent.
2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

      42. Several important factors will influence post completion and transition
          arrangements. Social Mobilization component continued for another two years and
          provided bridge financing to PPAF-3, which became effective in July 2009. The use
          of reflows from microcredit operations enabled PPAF to increase loan amounts
          substantially (US$ 600 million over the initial estimate of US$ 100 million), as well
          as it provided capital for on-lending to POs after the closure of post PPAF-2. The
          successful track record of PPAF led to new partnerships with and financing from
          multilateral and bilateral organizations and corporate sector including IFAD, USDA,
          KfW, Italian Development Cooperation, USAID, Unilever, Citibank, Shell, Engro
          Corporation, Tetra Pak and Sharkang. Finally, PPAF-3 – a five year operation with
          250 million dollar funds - will keep the work going until January 2015.

3     Assessment of Outcomes
3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

      43. The overall PDO is considered appropriate and relevant to Pakistan. Almost 60% of
          total initial PPAF funding (i.e. excluding credit reflows) was accounted for by four
          partner organizations, a further 62 POs each accounted for less than 1%. PPAF and
          the Bank implementation support missions appear to have accepted the need for
          more generalized support to promising NGOs, with extensive training programs,
          internships and similar capacity building measures.
      44. While large NGOs have greater outreach with relatively lower cost of delivery,
          there could a tendency to keep the communities dependent on them. In contrast,
          smaller NGOs keep their operating costs low and enhance sustainability in the long
          run. In the areas prone to conflict and militancy, home grown indigenous NGOs -
          which usually employ local staff - proved to be more successful in earning the local
          trust and acceptance and we able to continue their operations relatively
          uninterrupted. In comparison, large NGOs, were seen to be outsiders who could not
          earn the local trust and had to close their operations and withdraw their staff for

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objective

      45. The bulk of PDO has been fully achieved – as measured by PDO indicators -
          despite significant additions to these targets through new components in a
          challenging environment arising from the deteriorating security, reoccurring natural
          disasters and poor macro-economic situation. In case of SMC, all outcome
          indicators have been fully achieved except the one related to leadership positions
          held by poor and poorest households, which, is likely to be achieved in due course
          given the interest and commitment of the POs. As far as 8 additional indicators for
          SCAD districts are concerned, the achievement rate was 75%. Despite
          unprecedented floods in 2010 which brought wide scale destruction, six indicators
          were fully met. A lot of progress achieved was destroyed and POs had to regroup to
          restore and rehabilitation lives and livelihoods of the affected communities.
      46. As a whole, more than 5 million people benefitted from the project. 82% of the 4.7
          million microcredit borrowers experienced positive return on investment with
          average net amount of 78%. Economic rate of return on CPIs was 23.8%. Women
          constituted at least 50% of the beneficiaries. More than 129,000 children were
          enrolled in schools; of them 55% were girls.
3.3     Efficiency

      47. No specific studies of the efficiency of PPAF funding in comparison with that
          derived from the State or other donors has been undertaken. However, the
          preliminary findings of an as yet unpublished study undertaken by the Bank‘s
          DECRG group in relation to the 14,164 CPIs built by POs, states that they ‗have
          proven to be more pro-poor (beneficiaries are poorer on average) and less
          exclusionary (more likely to have non-excludable elements) than comparable
          government schemes in the same villages. Infrastructure schemes through this
          program are also in a better condition 5 years after completion than comparable
          government schemes in the same villages. They are also completed in a timely
          manner and have better maintained records‘. This finding is supported by the
          economic and financial analysis of the data gathered by the ICR mission during
          field visits to 52 CPI schemes 10 implemented by 15 POs in 16 districts. The
          analyses, as summarized in Annex 3, indicate that aggregate weighted economic
          internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 23.8% and financial internal rate of
          return (FIRR) as 24.3%. The 14,164 CPIs have benefited a total of 4.2 million
          people, of which 52% were women.
      48. The considerable level of demand for PPAF-financed micro-credit provision also
          demonstrates the much greater beneficiary interest in these products than for credit

  Data were updated for 33 CPIs schemes completed prior to the addition of SMC, while 19 CPIs schemes initiated and
completed after June 2009 were visited by the ICR mission of December 2011.

         through the formal banking system, which is perceived as cumbersome, difficult to
         access and with substantial informal costs.
3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
      49. A strongly positive rating for overall outcome is justified not only by PPAF meeting
          or exceeding most indicator targets in a very large and complex series of activities,
          but also by the ability demonstrated by PPAF as an institution to successfully adapt
          to significant changes in financing and the challenging environment in which it
          operates. PPAF was able to effectively respond to several emergency situations
          such as earthquake 2005, internal displaced persons, and floods in 2008 and 2010.
          In addition, operating costs for PPAF activities were held at extremely low levels,
          indicating effective and efficient management of resources.
      50. Indicator 3 (Empowerment of the poor, especially women). The overall female
          participation of 53% is impressive. It is derived from the following sector specific
          rates: microcredit 51%; SSIP 52%; health 56% and education 55%. It could be
          argued that when beneficiaries numbers touched millions (4.7 million in microcredit
          and 4.2 million in CPIs although these numbers are mutually inclusive) and entire
          communities were benefiting, achieving female participation in access of 50%
          become a stiff challenge. An interesting example is the high percentage of female
          beneficiaries in health (70%) and education (80%) sectors prior to the induction of
          SMC (as of September 2008). At that time, the scale of interventions was 30 health
          centers and 132 schools. At the completion of SMC, female beneficiary ratio in
          health dropped to 56% whereas the number of health centers increased to 369.
          Similarly, female beneficiary ratio came down to 55% whereas the number of
          schools established increased to 962. In summary, the MTR should not have raised
          the bar from 50% to 60%.
      51. Microcredit accounts for the largest proportion of total beneficiaries 4.7 million.
          The gender ratio for loans varies by season, with the late months of the year
          comprising primarily agricultural loans which are heavily dominated by male
          borrowers, whereas summer months tend to be dominated by livestock loans which
          have much higher female beneficiary rates.
      52. A challenging subset of the same indicator (# 3, ―a minimum of 33% of all PO
          credit clients being female‖) was 80% achieved. Out of a total of 53 POs, 42 met
          the benchmark. It is important to note that 90% of credit funds went to POs which
          exceeded this target.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
      53. The overarching themes of poverty reduction, gender aspects and social
          development are central to PPAF-2 and have been largely achieved.
Institutional Change/Strengthening
      54. The overarching theme of institutional change and strengthening has also been a
          central tenet of PPAF-2 (despite the relatively limited focus in the PDOs) and has
          been well implemented.

3.5.2 Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)
      55. A key unintended outcome of the successful implementation of PPAF-2 has been
          the considerable interest that the institution and many of its participating POs have
          attracted from other donors, including in the corporate sector. This is clearly a very
          positive outcome, although not without some danger of overwhelming institutional
          capacity.
3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

      56. Three extensive beneficiary surveys were undertaken as part of the PPAF-1 and 2
          projects; the most recent in 2009 PPAF Micro Credit Financing: Assessment of
          Outcomes. Gallup, Pakistan, 2009. This study, of approximately 2,100 beneficiary
          and 2,100 control households in 31 Districts across the country, found statistically
          significant benefits arising from the credit activities supported by the project,
          including positive changes in personal, household, enterprise and livestock income,
          as well as increased consumption of key food items and improved social status
          (partially held). It should be noted, however, that the survey looked at the impact in
          2009 of the loans utilized in 2006-7.
      57. Roundtable and stakeholders‘ workshops were held with a representative sample of
          POs, following which all 75 POs and 20 POs implementing SMC were contacted by
          e-mail in 2009 and 2011 respectively to complete a survey form. A total of 40 (in
          2009) and 13 (9 in 2011) responses were eventually received, which are discussed
          in detail in Annex 6.
      58. Almost two thirds of responding organizations were participating in PPAF financed
          credit operations and a similar percentage in community infrastructure provision.
          Less than one third were involved in health and education activities and 10% in
          earthquake recovery. Overall, the POs were strongly positive about their working
          relationship with PPAF, with 36% completely satisfied and 64% proposing some
          improvements to further strengthen the partnership.
      59. A large majority received PPAF support for institutional strengthening and in
          technical areas. As a consequence, POs‘ outreach to COs increased by over 40%.


                                               14
       POs were critical of, in their view, inadequate operational funds PPAF provided for
       CPI component.
    60. With the completion of social mobilization component, three workshops were held
        with the POs and LSO representatives. In addition two LSO conferences were also
        arranged.
    61. A hierarchy of community organizations (COs, VOs and LSO) was successfully
        established according to the agreed criteria with high priority to inclusion of women
        and poor and marginalized households. A shortfall was note in CO leadership held
        by the poor or the poorest of households. This is understandable though, as the
        leadership, conventionally claim people who are highly vocal and dominant. The
        poor and the poorest, overwhelmed by poverty, tend to be shy and timid.
        Nevertheless, given the system of encouraging and ensuring active participation of
        all members in CO meetings, and focused support by POs, a change towards equal
        opportunity for leadership to all is expected to transpire over time. As yet not
        enough time has passed for the COs to enter this phase of social transition.
    62. Modest progress has been made to engage COs in larger scale and innovative
        development activities with local government and private sector. So far linkages
        with COs and local governments were primarily focused on conventional and small
        scale interventions. There were exceptions though. These were cases of two
        government run schools and one health center adopted by the CO. The three
        facilities were extensively rehabilitated and optimally functional to the extreme
        satisfaction of the community.

4   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
    63. The assessment derives from project performance in relation to previously
        identified, and new, risk factors. Risks to the sustainable achievement of
        development outcomes that were anticipated at design included: (a) bureaucratic
        and political interference; (b) PPAF management commitment; (c) the ability of
        PPAF and POs to maintain focus on key activities; and (c) the capture by local
        elites of project benefits. While there have been some cases of the influence of local
        elites on the selection and location of CPI schemes, these appear to have been
        isolated events, and the other risk factors do not appear to have been significant.
    64. Factors not identified at appraisal but which must be considered to present some
        future risk for the project outcomes include: (a) a continued and serious
        deterioration in the security situation, natural disasters and weak economy could
        threaten the ability of PPAF, the POs, and the beneficiary communities, to maintain
        their achievements overtime; (c) the small size and vulnerability of many POs
        supported by PPAF carries the risk that small POs may not be sustainable should
        PPAF funding cease; and (d) in the case of SMC, focus on quantitative targets—i.e.,
        formation of multitier community organizations within a ‗fixed‘ timeframe - may

                                             15
         undermine the quality of the institutions of the poor formed, which requires an
         ‗evolutionary‘ approach—communities evolving a hierarchy of organizations as a
         result of a hierarchy of priority needs and benefits.

5     Assessment of Bank and Borrower                Performance      (relating   to   design,
      implementation and outcome issues)
5.1     Bank Performance

5.1.1 Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
      65. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory
          despite the generally good overall project design due to the lack in some cases of a
          clear definition of some PDOs, and discrepancies between PDO indicators in the
          text and PDS sections of the PAD.

5.1.2 Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
      66. The quality of Bank supervision is rated as satisfactory as supervision missions
          have been conducted regularly, constructive recommendations have been provided
          through these missions (including the modification of PDO indicators), and the
          Bank response to the earthquake was relatively rapid and substantial. In case of
          E3RP, initially quarterly mission were carried out to ensure rapid response to the
          affected communities. However, it is noted that the use of a 15 person team on a
          supervision mission might be considered excessive (e.g. November 2008), although
          some were engaged in pre-preparation activities for PPAF-3.

5.1.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
      67. In light of the strengths of the project and the generally constructive support
          provided through design and supervision, the overall Bank performance is
          considered satisfactory.
5.2     Borrower Performance

5.2.1 Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
      68. Government performance in PPAF-2 was largely limited to the provision of
          endowment funds and the transfer of Bank financing to PPAF. Both of these were
          accomplished satisfactorily, although it should be noted that the opening of a
          Special Account in the State Bank of Pakistan took more than 13 months.



                                              16
5.2.2 Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:
Rating: Satisfactory
    69. PPAF exceeded the targets in most cases, operating costs were kept extremely low
        (accounting for less than 1% of costs overall and less than 3.5% of total costs for
        earthquake response measures), strong support was provided to POs, and a strong
        commitment to the project objective. The negative factors identified were at times
        slow recruitment and training of PPAF staff in the early stages of implementation
        and initially slow rate of disbursement of funds for social mobilization.

5.2.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
    70. Given a complex project with a diverse range of activities, the extremely
        challenging environment in which PPAF and partner organizations must function,
        reoccurring natural disasters and emergencies, and almost tripling of fund flows
        over those initially anticipated at project design, the performance of the borrower
        has been commendable.

6   Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)
    71. The strong performance of PPAF and its achievement of most target indicators
        provide significant evidence that the approach used for PPAF-2 is appropriate and
        effective in the context of Pakistan.
    72. An emerging need for PPAF is to combine various stand-alone databases and the
        SMC MIS to an effective integrated Management Information System (MIS) that
        will allow more rapid updating and retrieval of key data and analysis. For such a
        system to be efficient, it should be effectively linked with the web-based data entry
        system now in use by several POs. Inclusion of a GIS with the coordinates of
        interventions would be useful for effective monitoring and reporting.
    73. Community participation—through cash or labor contribution, managing their own
        finances, and procuring materials and equipment—ensured strong community
        ownership of SSIPs and SSDPs. Such experiences in managing a complete project
        cycle approach gives voice to the poor, creates a path for community members to
        increase self-confidence and demonstrate that the poor, marginalized, and women
        can make a difference.
    74. A 20 percent minimum community contribution to total project costs promotes
        community participation and ownership. Nevertheless, it may discourage larger-
        scale interventions and exclude the ultra poor, minorities, marginalized households,
        and deprived communities. A more flexible approach to co-financing could promote
        inclusion and encourage larger interventions that will benefit more poor households.
    75. It is advised to review the use and application of compulsory savings programs
        within COs, which often appear reluctant to start internal lending and prefer using

                                             17
   these funds as a means of meeting community contributions to CPI schemes. While
   this is not in itself a bad thing, it does mean that a strong culture of regular savings
   as a means of capital formation may not yet exist and little or no experience is being
   gained at the community level in operating and managing credit funds.
76. Despite the satisfactory loan recovery rate shown by PPAF, significant risk still
    exists for POs lending to CO members. Life insurance is almost universally
    included by POs in all microfinance loans, and health insurance is becoming more
    widely available. Drought losses, in particular, have given rise in the past to
    significant repayment problems faced by POs in Balochistan and KP province. In
    view of increased incidences of natural disasters, PPAF should explore the
    introduction of disaster insurance for borrowers.
77. An assessment is recommended of the risks and benefits associated with the PPAF
    approach to health and education where recurrent costs are partially met through
    PPAF funding. While there is some initial evidence of a successful transition to
    sustainable financing (either through corporate sponsorship or beneficiary
    contributions), more options need to be explored for their long term sustainability.
78. While a model-neutral approach to community organization—whereby each PO has
    the freedom to employ its own approach to community organization—is
    appreciated, a certain set of principles need to be agreed upon for a common thread
    of core values for community organization. The principles for organizing
    communities at the grassroots are reasonably well established; however, values and
    principles for second and third tier organizations—a recent development for most
    POs—are still evolving. PPAF should review its experience thus far with the goal
    of codifying a set of core values and principles for POs for forming multi-tier
    institutions of the poor.
79. Instead of forming VO/LSO quickly to meet project targets, higher level
    community organizations should be formed only when the community feels the
    need and notices a value in a representative institution at the village or Union
    Council level. A set of priority needs must be identified, that should then perforce
    advocate the need for forming a higher level of organizations to actualize such
    needs. The respective roles, responsibilities and functions of a CO, VO and LSO
    should be clearly spelled out and a transparent governance system should be
    endured.
80. In the early stages of CO formation, usually conventional leaders come to the fore
    as the CO president or manager. A system needs to be strengthened that provides
    for substituting the conventional leadership, through fostering a culture to make this
    transition a regular feature. While training courses have been developed to impart a
    set of skills to the CO president and manager, POs need to focus more on the
    capacity building of CO itself so that members can better manage the CO office
    bearers and its corresponding hierarchies and establish a system to make them
    accountable to the general body.

7     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a)      Borrower/implementing agencies:
      81. To be completed after borrower reviews draft ICR.
(b)      Cofinanciers:
      82. Not applicable
(c)      Other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society):
      83. The key issues raised by stakeholders (POs) are discussed in Section 3.6 and
          presented in detail in Annex 6. Main points include: (a) the importance of increased
          operations cost for SSIPs; the average allowance was currently 17% while actual
          costs were estimated by POs at 24%; (b) there was a considerable demand for more
          training of PO staff, particularly in project management, field engineering,
          experience sharing and social issues, and; (c) some POs reported delays in receiving
          funds with 10% claimed that such delays were frequent.
      84. In the context of social mobilization, the POs have the impression that they must
          develop a three-tier organization i.e. CO, VO, and LSO. Some POs were not
          comfortable with the concept of a VO, especially peri-urban settlements which are
          more urban in nature than rural. In contrast to a rural settlement, peri-urban
          settlements are less homogenous and VO formation did not bode well. Rather than
          going for a three-tier system in all cases, hierarchy should be determined by the
          hierarchy of community needs and corresponding hierarchy of community response
          to the needs.

Introduction

   The PPAF-2 project initially comprised six components, which were later increased to nine through
two amendments to the DCA and through a separate financing agreement. The components were:
        Microcredit and Enterprise Development Loans
        Small Scale Infrastructure Projects
        Education and Health Projects
        Training and Skills Development
        Capital and Operating Costs of PPAF
        Disaster Recovery
        Equity for PPAF
        Emergency Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
        Support for Participatory Development through Social Mobilization


     Of these components, numbers 6, 8 and 9 were not foreseen in the original PAD or DCA.
Cost of Delivery. A study conducted in 2008 of delivery costs for all PPAF-funded field activities, both
within PPAF and among a sample of 18 of the largest POs11 found that, on aggregate, delivery cost
amounted to 6.8% of the total intervention amount. By far the highest delivery costs related to FATA,
where over one third (35.5%) of disbursed amounts were absorbed by delivery costs. At the other
extreme, Southern Punjab, which accounts for the highest share of all disbursements, required only a
1.7% share of disbursements.
Geographical Distribution. The province of Sindh accounts for 32.7% of all CPIs by value, followed
by Punjab 28.1% (including 3.9% in Southern Punjab), KP 16.9%, Balochistan 14.9%, AJK 1.9% and
Gilgit Baltistan 4.2%.

Component 1: Micro-Credit and Enterprise Development Loans

       As on June 30, 2011, 58 POs entered into financing agreements with PPAF for participation in
Credit and Enterprise Development (CED) activities, of which 47 were active partners. With an overall
disbursement of PKR 52,628 million since inception, 11,898 million rupees were disbursed through 4.58

        The findings of Gallup Pakistan (2009), commissioned to carry out an assessment of credit
outcomes, indicated that the ratio of borrowers experiencing positive change in their personal and
household income was significantly higher than that of non-borrowers (see Figure 2). The study noticed
a similar trend in sector-wise income changes from agriculture, livestock, and enterprise (see Figure 3).

        Among the conventional CPIs, 34% schemes provided safe drinking water. DECRG‘s
preliminary findings estimated that these projects saved women on average 3 to 4 hours per day from
fetching water from distant sources. The study estimated that irrigation schemes increased yields by 20-
30%. The roads and bridges led to monthly saving of US$ 15-23 per household, arising from the reduced
cost of transporting goods.
Cost of Delivery. According to the study quoted in the introduction to this Annex, the cost of small
scale infrastructure delivery averaged 10% of total amount disbursed over the period 2006-2007 but
varied widely, from 4.1% in AJK to 35.5% in FATA.

                                                                                       25
Geographic Distribution: CPIs were provided in 119 districts, including 24 districts in Balochistan, 25
in KP & FATA and 12 in AJK & Gilgit-Baltistan. Punjab/Islamabad and Sindh provinces together
accounted for more than 66% of all conventional infrastructure projects.

CPI’s Integrated Approach. While a large majority of CPI schemes were conventional, the project
adopted a holistic approach and initiated Integrated Area Upgradation Programme (IAUP) as well as
Technological Innovations Projects (TIP). A typical IAUP included three to six mutually complementary
infrastructure schemes. The purpose was to allow the poor to access more efficient, cost effective and

                                                             26
sustainable technologies. It involved the use of renewable energy technologies, for example, wind and
solar energy. In total the project financed 158 IAUPs and 606 TIPs.
        Furthermore, PPAF introduced Drought Mitigation and Preparedness Project (DMPP) with
an aim to provide holistic solutions for four drought affected areas. Each DMPP covered one to three
union councils and comprised, on average, a hundred sub-projects. These typically included delay
action/check dams for restoring water recharge, rehabilitation of aquifers, efficient water management
for irrigation, and others. DMPPs receive additional funds from United States Department for
Agriculture (USDA) which led to the establishment of Water Management Centre (WMC) to enhance
PPAF‘s long term strategy against water related disasters. The project financed four DMPP interventions
(comprising 327 sub-projects) at a cost of PKR 201.4 million.
Sindh Costal Areas Development (SCAD) Program was another approach that aimed at
complementing conventional CPIs by interlinking healthcare, education, livelihood support and the
provision of financial services in four districts of Badin, Karachi Thatta and Tharparkar. In total 2,201
projects were financed at a cost of PKR 1,147.15 million.

        There is no study available to measure the impacts of these integrated schemes/projects.
However, anecdotal evidences gathered by the ICR mission through visiting some of project areas
suggest that the integrated project approaches proved to be efficient in terms of costs and time as well as
the level of beneficiaries‘ satisfaction.

Component 3: Health and Education (H&E)

Overall performance. Primary healthcare was provided to 3.6 million people (60% females) through
300 healthcare facilities. A total of 111,205 students were enrolled in 846 schools. These services were
provided to the rural areas and poorest district where health and education indicators, particularly with
respect to women and girls, were well below the corresponding national averages as per GOP‘s Medium
Term Development Framework (MTDF).
        A total of 189 facilities (132 schools and 54 health centers), mostly community based, were
provided. It included rent for school/health center buildings, repair & renovation, utilities, furniture,
uniform, teacher and health staff training, sports material, TBA training, staff salary and teaching
learning material, equipments for health centers and medicines. Under SMC, PPAF worked with 24 POs
in the 25 poorest districts and established 714 schools and 246 health centers. For this, a total of PKR
1,490 million (PKR.820 million for education and PKR 670 million for health) were disbursed.
        In case of education services, primary focus was on hardware and infrastructure. It would be
useful to accord a higher priority to the qualitative aspects of education, such as teacher training,
teaching materials, and quality of instructions to students. Focus should be on developing intellectual,
social and emotional skills of children not as a byproduct but as a direct outcome. Indicators of quality
education should be drawn up and regularly monitored.
        In case of health, the primary focus is curative, while preventive aspects are optional, only open
to the patients who seek treatment at the facility. There is enough evidence available to argue that 80%
of the disease burden has its roots in prevention. Therefore, in future PPAF health program should
consider a more inclusive approach with a higher focus on prevention and community outreach, as a
distinct activity complementing the curative services provided at the health centers.
Delivery Costs. The cost of delivery of health and education interventions was the most expensive, on a
proportional basis, of all sector activities funded by PPAF according to a 2008 study previously quoted,
averaging almost 23% of total disbursements over the period 2006-2007.

Geographic Distribution. The services were provided in 52 districts of which Punjab accounted for
30%. Sindh was on top with 470 facilities (371 schools and 99 health centers) followed by KP and
Baluchistan with 296 and 288 facilities respectively.

Component 4: Training and Skill Development

Overall performance. Funds were provided for POs‘ recurrent and non-recurrent expenses, as well as
for training of PO staff and CO members. As of June, 2011 more than 480,616 CO members had
received training (Figure 11), while some 15,790 PO staff including PPAF staff had participated in
training courses (Figure 12).

        Although there is no study available to measure the effectiveness of training provided to both CO
members and PO staff, anecdotal evidences through ICR field visits and interviews of PO staff support
the impression that investment in capacity building for CO members contributed to the successful
completion SSIP and SSDPs, to identify and address staff training needs, and for improved management
and utilization of resources.
        The DECRG evaluation found that investments in capacity building of the poor via programs
that offer livelihood related training (business knowledge and skills) significantly increased new
business investment among poor rural households. Although the ratio of female CO trainees (40%) is
less than that of male trainees, the DECRG‘s preliminary study also indicates that the effects of training
have proven to be much greater for women who now have access to business and skills training.

Component 5: Capital and Operational Costs of PPAF

       It included four expenditure categories; (a) US$ 2 million for civil works to construct a new
PPAF office in Islamabad; (b) US$ 2 million for equipment to refurbish the office building; (c) US$ 8
million for consultancies, assessments and technical assistance, and; (d) US$ 8 million to cover
incremental operating costs of PPAF on a declining basis.
         Actual expenditures were much less than originally budgeted. Due to delays in obtaining an
appropriate office site from GOP, no PPAF building was constructed during the implementation period.
In total, only US$ 10 million of the original US$ 20 million budgets were expended by June 2011.

Component 6: Disaster Recovery

        Following a severe earthquake that brought widespread destruction in parts of KP and AJK in
October 2005, the decision was made to reallocate US$ 5 million from Component 2. These funds were
later supplemented by an additional Financing Agreement which created Component 8.

Component 7: Equity for PPAF

        As part of the DCA for PPAF-2, GOP agreed to provide a second injection of equity into the
endowment intended to ensure PPAF‘s long term sustainability. Specified in the DCA of 20 January
2004 at PKR 500 million, this amount was equivalent to USD 10 million at the time of appraisal. The
overall sum was released to PPAF by GOP in three tranches at the beginning of financial years 2005,
2006 and 2007 (PKR 150m, 150m and 200m respectively). However, due to changes in exchange rates
between the time of the DCA being signed and the receipt if the funds, these monies were recorded in
the Bank system as only USD 8 million.

Component 8: Emergency Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (E3RP)

       The work carried out by PPAF under this component can be divided into three phases: (i) Rescue
and Relief (ii) Damage Needs Assessment, and (iii) Rehabilitation and Reconstruction. As an immediate
step, PPAF set up a Disaster Management Centre (DMC). To support the relief efforts, World Bank
agreed to reallocate US$ 5 million from Component 2. In all, 500 truckloads of relief goods carrying
around 3,000 tents, 35,000 beddings, and 50,000 liters of milk, were transported. With help from the US
Air Force, PPAF with the assistance of POs transported a total of 150,000 corrugated galvanized iron
(CGI) sheets to provide safe temporary shelters against frost and snow, particularly at high altitudes. The
sheets were subsequently reused for roofing of new and repaired houses.
       Under the coordination of Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA),
PPAF was tasked to cover 36 Union Councils in six districts. In parallel, with holding damage
assessment training workshops, PPAF prepared the damage assessment guidelines and a computer
database that enabled the third phase to initiate. During the second phase, 110 Social Mobilization
Teams (SMTs) completed the assessment of more than 122,000 houses and data on potential
beneficiaries was stored into the database.

        The affected communities were also facilitated by the reconstruction of small scale infrastructure
projects including drinking water supply schemes, drainage systems and link roads. Overall, 652 CPI
schemes were completed including 202 projects in 23 UCs of Azad Jammu & Kashmir and 450 projects
in 16 UCs of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. A total of US$ 7.72 million were utilized for completion of 502
drinking water supply schemes, 104 link roads, 43 sanitation and 3 irrigation projects. It benefitted
331,087 persons belonging to 43,952 households. The communities were proactively involved during
the implementation process and took O&M responsibility for the completed schemes.

      As a result, this component achieved the reconstruction of over 78,500 houses, including three
payments to a total of over 276,000 payments for certified beneficiaries during the third phase.

Component 9: Support Participatory Development through Social Mobilization

       Government of Pakistan (GOP) recognizes that Social Mobilization is essential to the delivery of
its Poverty Reduction Strategy, which is an integral part of the Mid Term Development Framework
(MTDF). The government is cognizant of the fact that she will not be able to achieve its poverty
reduction goals unless community organizations are formed to manage their own development and act as
a bridge between the rural poor and local government and private sector service providers.
        An additional financing, signed in December 2007, with a closing date of 30 June 2010, provided
a further US$ 75 million for social mobilization of community organizations (COs), including the
creation of new COs with a focus on poor households and women and federating COs into Village
Organizations and Local Support Organizations (LSOs) at Union Council level. Initially there were 24
program districts and SCAD initiative working in 4 deprived districts of Badin, Karachi, Thatta and
Tahrparkhar was added through an amendment in August 2009. A total of 20 Partner Organizations
were engaged in the project with 10 in SCAD areas and 10 in the remaining districts. In June 2010 the
closing date was extended by one year to June 30, 2011.
Overall Performance: A total of 72,134 COs (against a target of 50,000) were formed in the 28 districts
covering 78 Union Councils. The COs comprised 1,287,860 members, of which 62% were female
members. 16% COs were using their savings for internal lending. As regards the proportion of CO
membership from the poorest of the community, PPAF was carrying out a study which was expected to
be completed in the first quarter of 2012.
        Seventy five percent of COs (against the target of 65%) were federated into 8971 VOs at the
village level, comprising 89,032 members, 60% of which were female members.

        As the SM component was based on the tried and tested social mobilization approach in Pakistan
and South Asia, the results in terms of number of COs, VOs and LSOs formed were impressive. There
are, however, two points of concern with respect to the quality of social mobilization. Firstly, the SM
component was not allocated adequate time in one go. Initially it was two years and a considerable
amount of time was lost due to slow start in the first year. One year extension materialized in April
2010, two months prior to the project closing date. Nevertheless, PPAF-3 project with a five year
timeframe has provided the much needed time and support to further strengthen institutions of the poor.
Secondly, notwithstanding the benefits of second and third tier community groups, in several cases the
focus on VOs and LSOs formation was seen more as the PPAF agenda than a need of the community.
PPAF should take special measures to inculcate the benefits of VOs and LSOs in the community so that
the community feels and appreciates its need and importance in improving their lives. Otherwise, there
is a risk that VOs and LSOs will be organizations for organization sake - alive but surviving on a life
support system - and will not be able to emerge at dynamic representative institutions of the poor and
meeting a corresponding hierarchy of needs of the communities.
        The PPAF Model-Neutral strategy for SM has its advantages and disadvantages. At the CO level
the model adopted by Rural Support Program Network (RSPN) and other POs have a long history of
success. The VOs and LSO models are in evolution and have yet to be tested to its efficacy in the local
context. PPAF needs to identify the principles for second and third tier organizations so that the POs, are
able to adapt them and take the chain of model-neutral to its logical consequences at all levels.
Exposure Visits: Several exposure visits for community groups with special focus on youth were
organized. The exposure to diverse cultures, values, customs, languages and ethnicity helped to open
their minds and broaden their vision. It was a good step in nation building, breaking social barriers and
creating bonds of friendships.
Gender Empowerment: Formulation of multi-tiered institutions of the poor had a positive effect on
poverty, gender, and social development. LSO representative stated that the forum was most effective in
conflict resolution, accessing services from line departments and other donors operating in the area.


                                                    34
Women empowerment was a special focus, to the extent that two major POs - NRSP and SRSWO -
focused only forming female COs. As a result, women representation improved considerably at the VO
and LSO level. Women proactively sought computerized national identity cards (CNIC) and registered
themselves as voters. Registration of newly born babies, which was almost non-existent in some areas,
got underway. Women also responded to the polio campaigns. In contrast in conservative districts like
Kohistan, the PO could only form male VOs. The opportunity of attending conferences and seminars by
women was highly appreciated by the women members of the community and helped bolster their
confidence and self esteem to a very high degree.
M& E System: SM component developed an effective M&E system based on outcome indicators that
were measurable, precise, time-bound, and direct. An MIS was developed and was made operational at
the PO and PPAF level. Besides a separate MER unit which has the mandate for monitoring evaluation
and research, each operating unit has the responsibility to monitor and review implementation of
respective component by the PO and ground. Another positive aspect was that release of funds to a PO
was subject to clearance by the HID, MER and the relevant operating unit. Consequently, a certain
frequency of monitoring visits becomes mandatory for the PPAF staff. The MER unit had begun to use
GIS to record coordinates of each community group and intervention for validation by the PPAF
monitoring teams.
Knowledge Management: Right based dimensions of social mobilization were introduced. To get the
desired quality in the process of social mobilization awareness raising material was printed and
published by the Social Mobilization unit in collaboration with their partner organizations. The detail of
this is as under:
Manuals: Social Mobilization: Implementation Manual; Social Mobilization Manual Forms; Social
Mobilization Guide Book;
Booklets: Budget importance; benefits and its appropriate utilization; access to social protection system;
Village development planning; Awareness campaign for women, especially ID card, Birth and death
certificate, Voters‘ registration, right of heritage, post-martial rights, marriage deed registration and
cancellation of marriage deed; Linkages development and resource mobilization; Civil and constitutional
rights; Disaster risk management at community level; Promotion of hygiene practices and Importance of
female education; Preparation and formulation of project proposal
Pamphlets: Institutional development through social mobilization; Environmental sensitization at
community level, Basic civic and constitutional rights, Garbage disposal and management, Importance
of VDP, Saving and its Utilization
Documentary: Documentary Film on concept of social mobilization
Other activities:
      Development of Impact Assessment framework for CO, VO & LSO;
      Finalization of standard contents of CMST. Designing of CMST module in Urdu.
      Preparation of Knowledge Management Framework.

                                                   35

        Development of flyer about CNIC and its importance.
    Following an amendment in 2009, in order to increase the focus on four chronically poor in coastal
districts of Sindh and to include finance for physical and economic interventions in addition to social
mobilization, additional Indicators were added to the Social Mobilization Component are as follows.
The performance against additional indicators is as follows:

Summary

       Aggregate economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of CIPs relating to irrigation, drinking water
supply, drainage and sanitation, link roads etc. completed by the 5 major partner organizations is 53.5%.
The share of these POs in financial cost is 51% of all the CPIs implemented12.
       Aggregate weighted economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 23.8% and FIRR as
24.3%. The highest contribution to economic return rate is found in irrigation schemes (9.3%) followed
by drinking water supply (4.8%), roads & bridges (3.8%) and drainage & sanitation (2.8%).
       Based on the information provided by PPAF, the project has benefited a total of 6.08 million
people comprising 48% male and 52% female.
         A total of 14,164 CIPs have been implemented including drinking water supply (34%), irrigation
(24.4%), drainage & sanitation (19.9%) roads & bridges (14.7%). The total cost of CIPs was Rs 6.74
billion.
       Twenty eight percent of the cost of all SSIPs was spent on irrigation, followed by 22.2% on
drinking water supply, 17% on road and bridges and 16.7% drainage & sanitation.
The average cost per scheme is PKR 0.476 million (USD 5,471 at current rate of exchange) and the
average number of beneficiary households per scheme is 61.
          Average cost per beneficiary household is Rs 7,859 or Rs 1,108 per beneficiary.

Background

       PPAF-2 completed a total of 14,164 CPI schemes by June 30, 2011, with a total expenditure of
PKR 6,743 million. There are a number of in-house reports available with PPAF covering 8,970 CPIs
with a cost of PKR 4,453 million by the IFAD team in Feb 2009. The number of CPIs completed under
the Social Mobilization component was 4709. In view of substantial works undertaken under the
additional funding, the project impact is being judged on the basis of available material, processed or un-
processed, supplemented by field visits to randomly selected CPIs and discussion with the beneficiaries.

Major POs involved in CPI implementation

       A total of 53 POs were involved CPI implementation (Appendix 1). Five major POs - NRSP,
PRSP, TRDP, SAFWCO, and SRSP - implemented 53.5% of schemes and utilized 51% of funds. NRSP
implemented the largest number of DWSS, IIUP, Irrigation and Roads & bridges. Whereas PRSP
implemented highest number of drainage and sanitation schemes. TRDP took lead in the implementation
of TIP schemes.

Methodology

       Secondary data was collected for all CPIs from PPAF. It was sorted by CPI types for various
aspects like number of schemes, cost, beneficiaries, etc. for each PO involved. A total of 52 CPIs
implemented by 15 POs in 16 districts of the country were finally selected for filed visit (Appendix 2).
The selection was based on the criterion that: (i) all major POs were represented; (ii) a range of different
geographical areas was included, and; (iii) a range of various types of CPIs was included.
        The secondary data provided by the client was used to have a list of all schemes implemented by
the POs. It was used to select the schemes based on criterion like representation of various geographical
areas, a mix of POs functioning in those areas and overall representation of all types of schemes. The
scheme documents prepared by the POs for approval pertaining to the demand of beneficiaries,
demographic aspects, cost estimates, time of implementation etc. was collected for all schemes before
going to the field. Primary data was collected by group discussion with the beneficiaries using a pre-
structured set of questions for all selected CPIs. It was analyzed to derive meaningful inferences in the
light of ICR requirements.

Parameters of Selected Schemes

        The selected CPIs included irrigation (12), link roads (9), flood protection (1), delay action dam
(1), drinking water supply (12), drainage & sanitation13 (8) and TIPs represented by solar lights & wind
turbines (9).

Capital cost
        CPIs were constructed at different period of time. Since the impact assessment was made in
November 2011, the nominal costs were brought at this level by using the inflation rates for the relevant
period. The construction indices varied from 5.2 to 7.8 in last few years. Therefore, the costs incurred in
the past were escalated using the annual escalation as announced by State Bank of Pakistan14. The CO
share in capital cost and annual O&M expenditure (as % of capital cost) is as in Appendix 3, for each
selected CPI. It may be mentioned that in disaster areas (coastal belt), the CO share was capped at 5%
and can be as negligible as even 1%.

O&M
       To ensure sustainability of implemented schemes, COs were responsible for operation or
maintenance The likely expenditure on O&M was taken as a proportion of capital cost and shown in
Appendix 3.

Returns on Investment for selected CPIs
   The analysis has been made to have an idea of returns on investment (ROI) using financial and
economic prices. The assumptions are as follows:
          The scheme lifespan was taken as 10 years for all CPIs.
          Although there would be some salvage value for almost all schemes, it was taken as zero.
          For Economic analysis:
          Standard wage rate (SWR) for unskilled labour was 0.75 but was taken at par for skilled labour.
          Standard conversion factors (SCF) for each scheme was based on the individual SCFs of
           itemized cost.
          Economic prices for tradables (for irrigation schemes) was based on average of January to
           October 2011 Commodity Prices issued by World Bank (pink sheet)15 in Appendix 4.

  There is negligible variation in economic prices of cotton for Sindh attributed to lesser transportation charges from the port
that has not been accounted for.

      Financial benefits were multiplied with SCF of 0.9 for use in Economic analysis unless derived
       by using economic prices.
    Diesel or kerosene value was multiplied by 0.58 considering the government tax as 40% and diesel
price is taken as PKR 80 per liter.

Types of Benefits

     The CPIs are small low cost investments. These schemes are of great importance to the poor groups
as they actively participation in planning and execution. The schemes are comparatively sustainable
attributed to the community contribution in cost and involvement of beneficiaries in implementation and
O&M. The benefits accruing are:
      Irrigation: assured water availabilities leading to higher command area, higher cropping intensity
       and better yields.
      Drinking Water Supply: availability of drinking water at or close to the doorstep leading to time
       savings and its productive use in other income generating activities, comparatively better quality
       of water, improved health and thus savings in medical bill on account of illness.
      Street Pavement: lesser seepage of water from stagnant ponds in adjoining walls, smooth flow
       leading to lesser or no spillage of produce from tractor trolleys and carts, less transport and
       haulage charges etc.
      Community Latrines: improved hygiene and cleanliness, and better health resulting in decreased
       medical bills, time saving that can be productively used.
      Flood Protection Works: security against intrusion of flood water, lesser losses to infrastructure
       including houses, easy access to communities affecting transportation charges.
      Link Roads: easy access to metallic road, opening up areas for enhanced economic activities,
       savings in commuter time, reduction in transport/haulage rates, productive use of saved time, etc.
      Delay Action Dam: savings in flood occurrence, higher seepage in adjoining areas and thus,
       control of continuous decrease of water table due to increased pumping of ground water.
      Solar Lights/ Wind Turbines: savings in the cost of kerosene oil and wax used for light during
       night time, income generation due to extra work at night time.
        The country experienced unprecedented floods in 2010. Subsequently, monsoon of 2011
triggered heavy floods in Sindh and Balochistan. During the field visit, it was observed that several CPIs
were fully or partially damaged due to floods and required rehabilitation. Link roads and bridges were
affected due to erosion of road surface due to water seepage/loose sub soil. One advantage reported by
the beneficiaries was that the road links made it possible for them to evacuate their belongings to nearby
elevated spots. The overall impact of floods was roughly 1% decrease in the returns on investment.

Returns from Selected CPIs

       The weighted average overall ERR is 23.8% and FRR is 24.3%. Irrigation is by far the major
contributor to overall returns (9.3%) followed by drinking water supply (4.8%), roads & bridges (3.8%)
and drainage & sanitation (2.8%).
        Based on the above, benefits were calculated for each type of intervention. The financial costs
were converted to economic costs using shadow prices for various items of construction cost derived on
the basis of 2011 prices. Various measures of project worth were developed and used for each CPI.
        A sum of PKR 6743 million was invested on various CPIs as of June 30, 2011. Out of this a sum
of Rs 4,082 was spent till 2009 and remaining amount under the Additional Support programme. The
nominal cost of Rs 6743 million has been brought to 2011 level using the inflation rate. The present
value at 2011 level is thus, Rs 8,590 million. Weighted average ERR is 23.7% and FRR of 26.5%.
Irrigation is by far the major contributor to overall returns followed by drinking water supply, roads &
bridges and drainage & sanitation.

Returns on Credit

       The returns on the use of credit were calculated for two representative categories: i) credit use for
purchase of goats, and ii) use of credit for additional stocking of a village level grocery shop.

Purchase of Goats
        A loan of PKR 15,000 was sufficient to purchase one mature and one young goat (Table 3). With
average milk yield of 1.2 kg per day valued at PKR 40 per kg generated an income of PKR 5,760 for an
average lactation period of 4 months. The value of young goat and with two newly born 2 baby goats,
was PKR 11,000 at year end. Average expenditure on feed and fodder and labor was around 40% of
milk value. Thus the incremental income attributed to credit availability was PKR 21,804 or PKR 3,804
after repayment of principal and interest. In summary, there was a 47% rate of return on the amount
borrowed.

Credit Utilized for Expanding Grocery Shop Inventory
        Financial constraints faced by the shopkeeper usually lead to limited stocking and higher number
of trips to the nearby towns. With credit availability the benefits as discussed with credit uses are in the
form of reduced trips and time saving that can be productively used. The returns after payment of
principal amount and interest were estimated as 33% as shown in Table 4.

                             Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results (if any)
          A large number of beneficiaries representing COs, VOs and LSOs participated in the two
workshops held in Islamabad and Hyderabad. A total of 32 male and 5 female members representing a
total of 16 COs/VOs/LSOs from Khyber Pakhtunkhawa province participated in the Islamabad meeting.
In the Hyderabad meeting, a total of 60 members comprising 48 females and 15 males representing 20
COs, 16 VOs and 8 LSOs took an active part. It was followed by field visits and meetings with smaller
beneficiary groups and individual households. While financial and economic is reported in Annex 3, the
key messages and observations emerging out of plenary discussions and groups work are as follows:

          Social mobilization leading to formation of community, village and union council level
organizations has injected a new interest, energy, enthusiasm and vision at grassroots. Initially CO
members were not sure about the benefits of forming apex groups at the village and union council level
and received it with some doubts and concerns. It took them time to first become active at the CO level
and them convince COs to come together and form a higher level group. But once formed, they were
able to see the value and benefits of organizing them. The most visible impact was the collective voice it
has given to the poor and disadvantaged, the confidence they have gained in approaching a government
office. The kind of response an LSO representing a union council received from the same government
department was something they had never experienced before.

          Most of the interventions by the POs were local community specific interventions such as
rehabilitation of health centers, and school, drinking water supply, water channel for irrigation, latrines,
street pavement, and use of solar energy for generating electricity. For notable intervention was
vocational training and asset transfer, especially for females and disabled. The interventions were highly
appreciated by the communities, especially school and health facility. These interventions were
implemented in poor communities, and served the community as a whole thus benefitting the poor by
default

          Women members were very vocal - oozing with confidence - and considered the opportunity of
CO meetings, training events and conferences as means to develop their self esteem. In the case of
Khyber Pakhtunkhawa, due to cultural constraints and security concerns, the number of female COs
formed was much less than the number of male COs. The women members from Khyber Pakhtunkhawa
were not as vocal as their counterparts in Sindh and Punjab;



                                                    50
        An increased attention to inclusion of ultra poor, minorities and disadvantaged groups has paid
dividends. Several cases of women, minority member and extreme poor holding key CO positions were
narrated. It included a beggar becoming president of a CO, and a poor women leading a large and active
LSO.

        Anecdotal evidence of COs having productive linkages - crucial for their sustainability - with
other development organizations such as National Commission on Human Development, Devolution
Trust for Community Empowerment, Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Authority and
NGOs were found.

        The spillover effects were evident in other fields of community engagement like sports
tournaments, theatre, awareness campaigns and cultural events - good examples of the use of creative
techniques to involve communities in the process of development.

        In view of the widespread poverty and unemployment especially in rural areas, skill training was
among the highly appreciated interventions. Members identified by the community groups received
extensive training and ultra poor were given a onetime asset transfer to help them kick-start a viable
means of livelihood. The participants from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported that the trained members were
earning more than PKR 6,000 every month.

        Special focus on the disabled was well received by the community groups, especially by the
persons with disabilities. Not only an increasing number of disabled were becoming community
members, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa they have formed separate COs as well and received vocational and
enterprise development training to earn their livelihoods. There were several examples of disabled
engaged in gainful vocations including grocery store, tailoring shop, cellular phone repair, electronic
repair, etc.

        In several cases, community groups were actively linked with the government departments,
especially for accessing government run health and education services. Their affiliation with the
government facilities were in the form of local community representation for managing the affairs of
health and education facilities such as parent teacher council and health committees. Linking community
groups with the public sector delivery mechanisms has a huge potential not only for improving access
and quality of service on a sustainable basis. For all such interventions support activities and sub
interventions could easily be standardized and perfected for low cost, effective and accelerated
implementation for each province/district. It would be useful for PPAF and PO to accord a higher

                                                   51
priority standard for forging productive community linkages with the local government, nation building
departments and other development projects and organizations.

                        Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
       Three workshops were organized in Islamabad, Karachi and Hyderabad in which 53 staff
members representing 20 partner organizations participated. It was followed by visits to the PO field
offices and discussions with the PO staff in the field. The significant comments and observations are as
follows:

              A hierarchy of community organizations (COs, VOs, and LSO) was successfully
               established and the criteria established for their formation were diligently followed;

              Special attention was accorded to the inclusion of women, poor households and
               minorities;

              The number of poor members holding CO leadership positions was small, but with
               encouraging trends. A gradual change towards equal opportunity for leadership to all was
               expected to occur over time;

              Engagement of the COs in larger scale and innovative development activities with the
               local government and the private sector had begun. The linkages with COs and local
               governments had resulted in conventional and small scale CPIs until then;

              COs, VOs and LSOs were playing a useful role in resolving local disputes and bringing
               community groups together around collective issues and benefits.

POs’ Partnership with PPAF

       The POs were extremely appreciative of their partnerships with PPAF. They showed a high level
of satisfaction and confidence in PPAF and the support and help they received from PPAF over time,
especially the assistance provided to improve PO systems and procedures including financial
management, procurement, preparation of project proposal and budgets, strengthening of monitoring and
evaluation system, improvement of communication systems, social mobilization, and staff training. POs
identified following areas of concern requiring further improvements:

       Delays in project implementation were experienced due to late release of funds by PPAF,
especially during the start up phase. PPAF response time for the queries raised by POs should be
improved. It causes unnecessary delays in project implementation. In some cases, short deadlines given



                                                    53
by PPAF became a hurdle in the way of effective implementation of the project activities, especially
social mobilization activities;

       The budget provided for working in remote, mountainous, sparsely populated and difficult to
access districts was insufficient considering the challenging terrain, poor road network, non-existent
transport infrastructure, population spread over large areas, and deteriorating law and security situation;

       Partner organizations should be given the flexibility to select the number and nature of
interventions according to the specific needs of the local communities. Any cuts in the budget proposed
by the PO should be made in consultation with the PO on the basis of ground realities. PO staff should
be provided training on Natural Resource Management. Area allocation to POs shall be based on
geographical basis and overlaps with other POs should be avoided.

Experiences and Challenges of Working at the Grassroots

       Ongoing militancy and fundamentalist movements, especially in FATA, Balochistan and Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa created major hurdles and delays in effective project implementation. At times the PO
staff had to pull out a troubled area, suspend work temporarily and close the field office. The partner
organization which were seen to belong to the same area and employed local staff with links and roots in
the local communities were able to work relatively uninterrupted. Militant groups monitored their
activities closely and once they were able to ascertain through their local contacts that the work being
carried out by the PO is not a threat to their interests in any way, they let them operate relatively freely.
Similarly it was important for PO to maintain a contact with the local administration and security forces
and inform them about their work in those areas. It was a delicate balance they had to maintain to allow
them work with the people who were in dire need of assistance and help due to the ongoing insurgency
in those areas;

       Another major hindrance is the prevalent extremely rigid and conservative local traditions and
practices and any imitative out of the ordinary is received with negative propaganda and suspicion.
Through hit and trial, POs were able to make inroads by molding the religious and political elements in
the favor of development and welfare of people by means of approaching them, sensitizing them and
involving them in community groups. The activities involving female participation were the most
affected by these elements. Resultantly, POs successfully achieved, rather exceeded, the target of
formation of male COs but fell short of the target of formation of female COs;


                                                     54
       POs yet have to achieve the level where it could be confidently declared that the COs, VOs and
LSOs formed have achieved self sufficiency. This was mainly due to the time constraint they had to
work with the local groups;

       Youth were involved in the project activities to train them as future leaders. Visits to other parts
of the country and the exposure they received in the process have changed their outlook and have
brought a new realism and hope to their future. POs saw it as a good step to reduce militancy. Youth
development Centers should be developed which should focus on providing training in management
skills. In addition to this, local employment exchanges should also be developed;

       Vocational training, computer literacy and exposure to social media tools and provision of
microcredit have generated employment and enterprise development opportunities for the youth. The
duration of vocational training should be increased with more focus on practical learning and internship;

       Social mobilization has created a big potential for capable community leadership. With greater
female participation, females were feeling empowered. As a result women sought computerized national
identity cards, got registered as voters and took an interest in registration of new birth, and polio
campaigns. Local Support Organizations should be linked with linked with the Social Welfare
Department for the purposes of regular monitoring and facilitation.

       Presentations

       The key message emerging out of PO presentations are as follows:

       Social Mobilization before launching incentive based projects has proved to be a very useful
tool. Three-tier model of community institutions has proved extremely helpful for deep penetration in
community and for keeping community based institutions active & vibrant at hamlet and village level.
These institutions introduced accountability factor in society in different projects. Introduction of
community resource persons from local communities proved helpful in achieving huge targets well on
time with limited resources. By taking political and other major stakeholders on board work in project
area proved very effective.

       Disaster risk management should be made an integral part of the program to cope up with
disasters in an effective way. Capacity building of staff and community on DRM should be made part of
the program.



                                                   55
       Community trainings proved very effective in terms of understanding the basic theme of the
program. Awareness trainings on Nikkah Nama (marriage certificate), CNIC registration, birth
certificates & voter registration proved extremely helpful in softening people‘s stance regarding female
members of the community. Skill and vocational trainings created good number of skilled persons at the
local level fulfilling technical needs of local and adjoining union councils. Exposure visits of activists to
the successful models of community institutions were of great worth in enhancing their skills and to
mobilize them to replicate new experiences in their respective areas. Youth entertained under HID
should be linked with industry/market. A policy need to be formulated at PO/PPAF level to be designed
as job creation platform. Active and real inclusion of women inclusion can be ensured only by creating
activities of women specific activities.

       Factor of fluctuating security situation should be kept in mind while planning target activities.

              Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
       The PPAF-2 project provided a unique and innovative opportunity within the overall PPAF
framework of community driven development. Its twin strategic objective enabled PPAF to (i) focus on
empowering poor, marginalized and women by giving them confidence and voice by fostering multi-
tiered grass root institutions/communities across the poor parts of the country, especially in the 29
poorest districts ii) help poor groups improve their lives and productivity by responding to their priority
needs through small scale physical infrastructure and health and education services, iii) provide
microcredit and enterprise development training and support to the needy poor to help them move out of
abject poverty and iii)    allowed real time effective response to a large scale national disasters
(earthquake 2005 floods in 2011). Social Mobilization additional financing provided a seamless bridge
between the Second and Third Poverty Alleviation Fund projects of the World Bank. It further
strengthened a productive engagement in the true spirit of partnership (past and ongoing) between PPAF
and World Bank.

       In our opinion the bi-annual supervision and end of project review provide effective, continuous
assessment and feedback. The lesson learning is especially useful for course correction and quality
assurance. An external perspective is a particularly useful tool for strategic planning and programme
implementation.

       We would like to renew our commitment to Mission recommendations that core values of
inclusion and empowerment and a demand driven approach to projects and sub projects is central to
successful outcomes. This is now clearly articulated in the new strategic framework of PPAF consisting
of customized approach to various regions and provinces given diversity and heterogeneity of Pakistan.
Real-time knowledge, information and data is the key ingredient for decision making. In line with its
importance, a specialized expertise is being acquired for development of a comprehensive PPAF wide
management information system. Going forward PPAF is instituting a dedicated focus on inclusion
especially of youth (and their skill development), women, persons with disabilities, poorest and most
marginalized with a view to their mainstreaming. These groups are being afforded special consideration
in line with national demographics and mandate of PPAF.

               Annex 8. Comments of Co-Financiers and other Partners/Stakeholders
       The ICR mission carried out two exercises comprising stakeholder workshops and a PO survey
in 2009 and 2011. The 2009 exercise was carried out at a time when Social Mobilization Component
was still under implementation. Therefore, it did not take into account SM, whereas 2011 exercise was
carried out after the completion of SM Component in June 2011. In order to keep the both exercises
consistent, the survey questionnaire used in 2009 was updated for 2011 survey. The findings of 2009
survey are presented in Part A and the findings of 2011 survey are presented in Part B.

Part A. Survey Findings

       Following the PO stakeholder roundtable held in Islamabad with eight participants from seven
POs, the ICR mission conducted a PO questionnaire survey. It aimed at gathering PO‘s views regarding
the Project in general including PPAF‘s support to POs and performance of each of project components.
The ICR mission sent out the questionnaire (Appendix 3) to all 75 POs through e-mail. Three staff
members of PPAF were tasked to assist the mission including the development of a database for
analysis. In total, 40 POs (53%) responded by the deadline set by the mission.

       This annex intends to provide an overview of respondents‘ views on PPAF including their needs
and recommendations based on the survey. Appendix 1 of this annex includes an analysis of 40 PO‘s
views and PO performance data supplemented by the use of other data made available by PPAF. Key
results of the survey on a PO by PO basis are given in Appendix 2.

       The result reveals that, overall, POs were positive about the Project and PPAF. It also became
clear, however, that several POs were heavily dependent on PPAF for their institutional survival in terms
of both funding sources and institutional support. Diversification of PO income sources and enhancing
PO‘s institutional capacity appeared to be an important issue for the development of sustainable civil
society in the country.

       35% POs were ―Completely Satisfied‖ with PPAF‘s operation and the support they received
(Q30). The remainder 65% made recommendations to PPAF for the development of PO capacity and to
further strengthen the working partnership with PPAF. Table 1 shows PO‘s views on ―PPAF‘s Future
Challenges‖. (Q31).

       A sum of PKR 6740 million was invested on various CPIs as of June 30, 2011. Out of this a sum
of Rs 4,082 was spent till 2009 and remaining amount under the Additional Support programme. The
nominal cost of Rs 6740 million has been brought to 2011 level using the inflation rate. The present

                                                   58
value at 2011 level is thus, Rs 8,590 million. Weighted average ERR is 23.7% and FRR of 26.5%.
Irrigation is by far the major contributor to overall returns followed by drinking water supply, roads &
bridges and drainage & sanitation.

         PO capacity building topped the list of recommendation16%. It appeared that the request came
primarily from middle to small scale POs. It was followed by the need for improvements in PPAF‘s
project approach such as ―provide support to the POs to carry out research and development (R&D) and
carry out innovative projects for community benefits‖ and ―provide support to POs in non PPAF‘s
conventional areas, including natural resource development (agriculture, forestry and livestock sector),
and environment and climate change projects‖.



         Provision of further financial support ranked third at 13%, followed by a request to increase
communications and coordination between PPAF and POs as well as among POs. It appeared that many
POs had concerns about duplication of work and overlap in work areas with other POs. It further
confirmed the discussion at the stakeholder roundtable, especially POs - working in the same area -
providing microcredit with different interest rates. Another important area identified for PPAF
improvement was the promotion of ―Experience Sharing‖ among POs. This also supports the view of the
ICR mission formed during the field trip.

         In terms of project management, further improvements in PPAF operations were sought for
M&E, both in PPAF‘s own M&E system as well as providing further support to PO‘s M&E systems.
POs also recommended improvement in PPAF‘s approach to dealing with POs. Some related examples
are as follows. PPAF should:

                                                   59
             Increase the focus on small and medium POs;

             Conduct realistic assessment/evaluation of needs (both credit and capacity building) rather than
                     applying a standard benchmark or similar approach towards all POs;

             Reduce documentation and extensive paper work;

             Refine the procedures and shorten the period between initial appraisal to final disbursement;

             Consult with partners in setting up program policies and strategies;

             Improve long term planning that is sometimes weak and needs serious attention; and

             Behave like a partner not as Donor/Lender.

PO’s Training Needs

           The need for training to increase PO institutional and human resource capacity was ranked first
(Table 2). Many POs were keen to develop their institutional management capacity, including finance as
well as capacity building in M&E and CPI project management. For CPI, POs requested improvements
in project management, engineering, and computers/GIS and experience sharing.

Basic Information
             The majority of PPAF‘s funds were channeled to the five major POs (Table 1). NRSP received
approximately 35% of all PPAF disbursements.

             In relation to the dependence of POs on PPAF, 35% POs‘ dependence on PPAF was more than
50% of their total budget (Figure 1). Almost 60% of POs considered that the cessation of PPAF funding
would threaten (3) and/or be serious (20) for their institutional survival. It is noted, however, that the
outcomes of these two questions did not sustain statistical correlation.

Credit and Enterprise Development
       According to PPAF data of September 2008, 35 POs participated in PPAF‘s CED component,
handling PKR 7.7 billion in total. A total of 24 of 35 POs had other funding sources for their microcredit
operations, with a total of PKR 5.6 billion in outstanding portfolio. In total, the 35 POs handled PKR
13.2 billion outstanding portfolio as of September 2008. The average PPAF share of total lending was
57%. Nevertheless, 25 POs were heavily dependent on PPAF for credit operations; only 4 POs stated
that their dependency on PPAF was moderate or that they were relatively independent.

                                          Figure 3. PO’s PPAF Dependency

                          Dependent: 50-80%, Moderate: 20 – 50%, Relatively Independent: 1- 20%

       The survey (Q6&7) revealed that the average annual interest rate(s) charged by the 23 POs to
borrowers was 19%, while the average interest rate(s) required by POs to cover operational costs was
estimated at around 24%. It was clear that the operation of microcredit entailed a subsidy element from
PPAF; this was especially true for middle to small-size POs. There were only three POs that charged
higher interest rates to borrowers than required to cover operational costs. These included two major
POs, NRSP and Kashf Foundation. It should be noted that PPAF‘s CED contracts with both NRSP and
Kashf foundation did not include the CED operational subsidy and they appeared to maintain a
sustainable revenue stream from the microcredit operation. The survey results also showed that the
interest rate(s) charged by 6 POs to borrowers were set at the same level as estimated operational costs,
while the rate(s) of a further 14 POs were set lower than required to cover operational costs.

Community Physical Infrastructure
       PPAF data from December 2008 showed that there were 49 POs engaged in implementing CPI
projects. Of these, 25 - or approximately 50% - responded to the ICR survey. The majority (18 POs)
opined that PPAF financial support was not sufficient to carryout CPI projects while 6 respondents
regarded the support as sufficient. The CPI operational cost provided to POs was calculated by PPAF



                                                           62
based upon the size of POs, and the location (i.e. remoteness) of their working areas. As a result, the
overhead percentage (operational cost) approved for CPI activities varies substantially, ranging from
10% to 70% of total of project costs. The average percentage applied to responding POs was 17% (Q10).

Figure 4. Sufficiency of CPI Operational Cost from PPAF




        Delay in the disbursement of funds from PPAF appeared to occur occasionally (Q11&12).
However, the magnitude of this issue was not considered serious, as confirmed during the stakeholder
roundtable.

        There appeared to be a need for further research on the participation of POs in training provided
by PPAF; 7 POs (30%) stated that they had not received PPAF training (Q13). On the other hand, the
figures provided by PPAF as of December 2008 showed that more than 14,000 PO staff was trained by
PPAF and all POs appeared to have been invited to participate in PPAF organized training whenever
relevant. It may be that some POs received extensive training while others get none.

     Figure 5. Participation in PPAF Training             Figure 6. Participation in PPAF Training




     Note: FY 08 - 09 data is for two quarters

       It appeared that the level of PPAF‘s support for technical assistance was incomplete (Q15).
According to the survey, approximately half of POs appeared not to have received any technical
assistance at all from PPAF in design aspects for CPI projects.

       It is worth noting that enhanced capacity to deal with gender issues was not raised by responding
POs in the survey, despite the fact that 35% of POs hadn‘t received any specific guidance on gender
issues in carrying out CPI projects (Q18). Nevertheless, the ICR mission‘s anecdotal findings as well as
PPAF‘s data suggest that pro-gender activities were widely applied by many POs, and in fact, some POs
dealt only with women.

  Figure 7. Technical Assistance from PPAF                Figure 8. PPAF Specific Guidance on Gender




Human and Institutional Development
       Although a majority of PO recognized PPAF‘s proactive role in strengthening POs‘ institutional
capacity, 13 POs (35%) were unsatisfied with the PPAF support for human and institutional
development. It appeared that middle size POs in particular shared this view, whereas the opinions of
small scale POs on this issue appeared to be more mixed.

  Figure 9. PPAF’s Support to Institutional Development




                                                      64
Monitoring and Evaluation
           Aide Memoires as well as the Bank MTR report explicitly expressed concern with respect to the
weakness of M&E; especially the lack of standard formats for monitoring. As far as a standard
monitoring format is concerned, this now appears to be resolved; all respondents stated that they used a
standard PPAF monitoring format.

           PPAF had introduced a web-based reporting system to a certain number of POs. Although the
majority of survey respondents (21 POs out of 39 POs) stated that they hadn‘t adopted the system as yet
(Q23), the ICR mission confirmed that the system was being gradually adopted by POs17.

           Finally, more than 80% of PO indicated that they were able to meet PPAF requirements on the
basis of their own reporting capacity. Only 7 POs considered that they needed further capacity
development for reporting.

     Figure 10. PO’s Capacity on Reporting




Support from PPAF
           Responding POs expressed the need to develop their institutional and technical capacity and they
felt that PPAF should provide additional support. While more than 60% POs had other opportunities for
training (Q27), as we confirmed during the ICR mission, the role of PPAF was dominant and POs
expected more from PPAF. This was confirmed by the finding that more than 80% of POs preferred to
turn to PPAF for help in case they faced a major institutional problem (Q28).




17
     By mid-March 2009 the web-based system was reported to be in use by more than 60 POs.

        Following the three PO workshops held in Islamabad, Karachi and Hyderabad with 53
participants from 20 POs, the ICR mission conducted a PO questionnaire survey. The questionnaire
(Appendix 3) was sent through e-mail to all 20 POs involved in the implementation of Social
Mobilization Component. In total, 13 POs (65% of the total) responded by the deadline. Appendix 2 of
this annex includes an analysis of 13 PO‘s views and PO performance.

Main Findings
        Overall, POs were positive about the Project and PPAF. It became clear, that 70% POs were
dependent on PPAF‘s financial support, while 30% POs were either relatively independent or
moderately dependent on PPAF funds. It also correlated with 69% POs‘ acknowledgment to have
received adequate support from PPAF for institutional development.

        46.2% POs responded ―Completely Satisfied‖ with PPAF‘s operation as well as its support
(Q36). The remainder (53.8%) felt that PPAF operations and support functions could be enhanced. They
suggested various improvements to PPAF including development of PO capacity and mutual partnership
with POs. Table 1 shows PO‘s views on ―PPAF‘s Future Challenges‖.

       Increased financial allocation for project activities emerged as the top most support (29%)
required by the POs. Support to strengthen M&E function of the POs came out as the second major
(21%) requirement. It was in line with the recommendations of the stakeholder workshops where PO
staff shared the concern over limited budgetary provision for M&E activities as well as a need to
increase the frequency of PO staff‘s field monitoring visits.

       Suggestions for improved coordination and PO capacity building and training stood at 17% each.
It was followed by a need to improve POs‘ capacity in documentation and information management.
Next on the list were training and capacity building in social mobilization and improved networking.

POs Training Needs
       The need for training and capacity building to enhance POs‘ institutional and human resources
emerged as the top priority (table 2). POs were keen to strengthen their management and systems,
including finance, planning, management and managerial skills, and development of operational staff
(Q26). The development of managerial skills (such as training of trainers, skills in using PRA
techniques, proposal writing) was highly ranked at 25%. It was followed by organizational capacity
building (21%) in general management, monitoring and evaluation (10%), and sector specific training
(10%) such as natural resource management, livestock management, gender, health and education. Other
priority training areas included finance, planning, and institutional development and community
development.

       In case of small scale community physical infrastructure (CPI), 40% POs favored further staff
training (Table 3), especially in low cost housing, dam construction, water efficient irrigation, hydro
power, sanitation and water supply. Next in line were project and general management, engineering, and
computers/GIS (Q14). These are followed by managerial skills, financial management, and monitoring
and evaluation.

       In case of training need in education sector, the major focus (50%) was on school management,
multi-grade teaching, teaching methodologies, assessment, quality education, and home school
education. In case of training needs in health sector a large proportion (52%) identified epidemics
control, health standards, emergency health, pharmacy and lab management, primary healthcare, and
waste management. It was followed by capacity building in general themes like management, M&E,
social mobilization and managerial skills with a specific focus on health and education.

         PO dependence on PPAF was analyzed on the basis the proportion of their annual budget coming
from PPAF. It appeared that only 30% POs were relatively independent as they raised 75% of their
annual budget from other sources and PPAF contribution was not more than 25% of their total annual
outlay. The remaining 70% POs are largely dependent on PPAF (Figure 1).

         Almost 85% POs felt that the cessation of PPAF funding would have a limited impact on their
institutional survival, while 16% POs considered it either serious or threatening to their survival (Q4). It
is noted, however, that the outcomes of these two questions did not sustain a statistical correlation. It
may be due to the enhanced capacity of the POs as an outcome of the partnership with PPAF that even
though they were dependent on PPAF they felt positive and confident about their future.

Credit and Enterprise Development
       Microcredit disbursements made by the POs and disbursements using PPAF funds revealed that
the average PPAF share of total lending by the POs was just over 50%. Out of total disbursement of
PKR 11 billion reported by the POs, approximately 50% disbursements were made with the PPAF funds
(Q5). The average annual interest rate POs charged to borrowers was 20.8%, while the average interest
rate required by PO to cover operational costs was estimated at around 24%.

Community Physical Infrastructure
       A majority of POs, 69%, felt that the financial support received from PPAF was not sufficient to
carry out CPI projects, while 31% POs regarded the support as sufficient. The CPI operational cost
provided to POs was calculated by PPAF based upon the size of PO, and the location (i.e. remoteness) of
the project area. As a result, the overhead percentage (operational cost) approved for CPI activities
varied. The average percentage applied to responding POs was 17.75%.

        Delays in the disbursement of funds from PPAF occurred occasionally. This issue also came up
in the stakeholder workshops as it delayed project implementation and at times the work had to be
suspended temporarily.

        All POs benefitted from the training PPAF arranged for better preparation and implementation of
community physical infrastructure schemes. Among the key training needs identified by POs, 41%
concerned CPIs such as CPI project design, environment, water, sanitation, low cost housing and social
mobilization.

       It appeared that the level of PPAF‘s support for technical assistance and training in CPI needed
better coverage as one third of the POs reported that they did not receive any technical assistance and
training from PPAF.

       It was noted that capacity building in gender did not come up in the PO survey or in the
stakeholder workshops, despite the fact that 31% of POs did not receive any guidance on gender aspects
in preparation and implementation of CPI projects. Nevertheless, there was enough evidence found
during the field visits and the workshops held with beneficiaries and POs that partner organizations were
paying greater attention to organizing and mobilizing female groups. The extent to which POs sensitized
males about gender disparities and the need to empower and encourage greater women participation in
local development needed to be examined further.

Health and Education
       Almost two thirds of the POs, engaged in providing health and education services, reported that
they benefitted from training PPAF arranged in health and education sectors. As far as capacity building
needs in health and education were concerned, training in core subjects of health and education was a
priority. It was followed by building institutional and professional capacities to manage health and
education projects effectively such as project management, financial management, monitoring and
evaluation and impact assessment.

Social Mobilization
       Majority of POs, 92%, benefitted from the training PPAF organized in social mobilization. The
POs formed a total of 200,436 community groups. Of these 92% were formed by them after becoming a
PPAF partner. Whereas the COs, VOs and LSOs POs formed under the social mobilization component
were 28%, 10% and 10% of the total community groups formed.

       Priority training needs in social mobilization, identified by POs, included 33% in community
development tools like PRA, TNA, community needs assessment, social mobilization, and advocacy and
31% in project thematic areas such as livelihood, disaster risk management, resource mobilization,
enterprise development and value chains. Other training needs included networking, monitoring and
evaluation, and planning and management.

Human and Institutional Development
       While POs appreciated PPAF‘s proactive role in supporting the POs‘ institutional capacity, 31%
were dissatisfied with the extent of PPAF support for human and institutional development. It appeared
that middle sized POs, in particular shared, this view. Opinions of smaller POs appeared to be mixed.

Monitoring and Evaluation
       An overwhelming majority of 92% POs reported that they used standard PPAF formats for
progress reporting. 69% POs were using the web-based reporting system introduced by PPAF. 77% PO
had adequate capacity to meet PPAF reporting requirements. Seven POs needed further training and
capacity building for reporting.

Support from PPAF
       All POs needed to bolster their institutional and technical capacity and required from assistance
from PPAF. 85% POs had access to other opportunities for training. Nevertheless, an overwhelming
majority of 85% POs would turn to PPAF as the first call of help if they faced a major institutional crisis.
