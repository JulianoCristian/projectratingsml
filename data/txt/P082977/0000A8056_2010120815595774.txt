                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The original Project Development Objective for the PPAF-II remains unchanged: to reduce the incidence of poverty in the country through provision of
                         resources and services to the poor, especially women. The additional financing for social mobilization enables key PPAF partner Organizations (POs) to expand
                         their social mobilization programs to cover an additional one million poor rural households in 25 of the poorest districts of the country and provide a foundation
                         for the expansion of Pakistan's poverty reduction agenda through PPAF and the PPAF-III project. PPAF's POs will mobilize approximately 50,000 Community
                         Organizations (COs), which federate at Union Council levels, to form Local Support Organizations (LSO), and higher level in order to access public and private
                         development resources and services and to link communities more effectively to local government and the private sector. A leadership cadre of 250,000 women
                         and men will be trained to manage the COs and federations and to manage the linkages with outside organizations for long term sustainability. Restructuring of
                         the additional financing in July 2009 introduced additional outcomes on community infrastructure and market linkages including, including the provision of
                         1,200 new infrastructure schemes and skills training for at least 1,000 individuals in the four districts of the Sindh Coastal Area development (SCAD) program.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Second PPAF project and the additional finance credit for earthquake relief and reconstruction have been fully disbursed and the project components closed. This
                         implementation status therefore focuses on the third and fourth additional financing credits related to Social Mobilization that are ongoing. Project restructuring in FY 10 addressed
                         the implementation and disbursement problems and allocated funds for social mobilization and grant activities in four coastal districts under the Sindh Coastal Areas Development
                         Program. Progress is now well underway and the community institutions being established are providing a useful foundation for the interventions of the successor PPAF-III project.
                         The law and security situation in parts of the KPK and Balochistan provinces continue to be a challenge and some of the worst flood affected districts are also the chronically poor
                         districts targeted by the social mobilization additional finance.
