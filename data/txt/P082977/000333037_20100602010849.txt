PROJECT TO SUPPORT PARTICIPATORY DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SOCIAL

                                   Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for Pakistan, Additional Financing for the Second Poverty
Alleviation Fund Project (PPAF II) to support participatory development through social
mobilization, IDA Credits 3834-3-PAK and 3834-4-PAK, P082977 will be extended
from June 30, 2010 until June 30, 2011.

2.       These two additional financing credits were provided for modified Project
activities included as part of a restructuring. These modified activities - a new social
mobilization component and related new institutional development and Project
management components (Components 4-6) - are aimed at strengthening social
mobilization in 25 of the poorest districts of Pakistan through establishing 50,000
inclusive Community Organizations (COs) of the poor enabling them to participate and
manage their development process. As of October 31, 2009, over 30,000 COs had been
formed. Technical support is being provided to improve the participation of poor
households and to provide them with training. A management information system has
been developed to monitor progress and performance of the COs.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow PPAF and its Partner Organizations
(POs) to complete implementation of the social mobilization and two related components,
delayed due to the deterioration in overall security across Pakistan and the military
operations in several of the project implementation districts. The POs were not able to
carry out their activities in several districts of the Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KPK) Province
and work had to be completely halted, due to curfews and insecurity, in Upper Dir,
Shangla, Bannu, and Lakki Marwat. In Balochistan province, the security situation
deteriorated due to escalation in ethnic riots, sectarian killings and also the effects of the
military operation. The districts affected due to these conditions included Khuzdar,
Kharan, Kohlu, and Jhal Magsi. The PPAF has therefore requested an extension in the
Closing Date of the project to enable the POs to carry out remaining activities in the
affected districts of KPK and Balochistan. Extension of the Closing Date until June 30,
2011 was requested by the Economic Affairs Division of the Government of Pakistan on
March 22, 2010. A satisfactory action plan is in place for this extension period. The
performance of the government and the Project implementing entity is satisfactory.

4.      This is the first extension for these additional financings (credits 3834-3-PAK and
3834-4-PAK), which were approved by the Bank's Board in October 2007 but only
became effective in February 20, 2008. The new closing date would be within three years
of the closing date of the original financing (Cr. No. 3834), which was July 31, 2008.
There was a restructuring of the activities and outcomes of this project in June 2009. The

                                              3
Project Development Objective is unchanged and continues to be achievable.
