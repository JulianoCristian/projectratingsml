risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: the strong performance of Pakistan Poverty\n            Alleviation Fund (PPAF) and its achievement of most target\n            indicators provide significant evidence that the approach\n            used for PPAF-2 is appropriate and effective in the context\n            of Pakistan. An emerging need for PPAF is to combine various\n            stand-alone databases and the Social Mobilization Component\n            (SMC) Management Information System (MIS) to an effective\n            integrated MIS that will allow more rapid updating and\n            retrieval of key data and analysis. For such a system to be\n            efficient, it should be effectively linked with the\n            web-based data entry system now in use by several Partner\n            Organizations (Pos). Inclusion of a Geographical Information\n            System (GIS) with the coordinates of interventions will be\n            useful for effective monitoring and reporting. Community\n            participation through cash or labor contribution, managing\n            their own finances, and procuring materials and equipment\n            ensured strong community ownership of Small Scale\n            Infrastructure Project (SSIPs) and Small Scale Development\n            Project (SSDPs). Such experiences in managing a complete\n            project cycle approach gives voice to the poor, creates a\n            path for community members to increase self-confidence and\n            demonstrate that the poor, marginalized, and women can make\n            a difference. An assessment is recommended of the risks and\n            benefits associated with the PPAF approach to health and\n            education where recurrent costs are partially met through\n            PPAF funding. While there is some initial evidence of a\n            successful transition to sustainable financing (either\n            through corporate sponsorship or beneficiary contributions),\n            more options need to be explored for their long term sustainability."}, "docdt": "2011-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
