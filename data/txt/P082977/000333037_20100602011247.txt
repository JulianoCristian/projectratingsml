7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The original Project Development Objective for the PPAF-II remains unchanged: to reduce the incidence 
of
poverty in the country through provision of resources and services to the poor, especially women. The 
additional financing for social mobilization enables key PPAF partner Organizations (POs) to expand their 
social mobilization programs to cover an additional one million poor rural households in 25 of the poorest 
districts of the country and provide a foundation for the expansion of Pakistan's poverty reduction agenda 
through PPAF and the PPAF-III project. PPAF's POs will mobilize approximately 50,000 Community 
Organizations (COs), which federate at Union Council levels, to form Local Support Organizations (LSO), 
and higher level in order to access public and private development resources and services and to link 
communities more effectively to local government and the private sector. A leadership cadre of 250,000 
women and men will be trained to manage the COs and federations and to manage the linkages with 
outside organizations for long term sustainability. Restructuring of the additional financing in July 2009 
introduced additional outcomes on community infrastructure and market linkages including, including the 
provision of 1,200 new infrastructure schemes and skills training for at least 1,000 individuals in the four 
districts of the Sindh Coastal Area development (SCAD) program.
