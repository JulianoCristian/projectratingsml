Does the restructured project require any exceptions to Bank policies?            X Yes      No
Have these been approved by Bank management?                                      X Yes __No
Is approval for any policy exception sought from the Board?                       __ Yes X No
A waiver of OP 12.00 to allow for the financing of cash grants as part of the
Bank's response to the earthquake in Pakistan was approved in connection
with the first Additional Financing of US$l00 million (credit 38341), which
was approved in December 2005. Such a waiver was necessary to allow the
Government of Pakistan to respond effectively to the needs of the population
affected by the earthquake. No new exceptions were sought for the second
Additional Financing of US$138 (approved, credit 38342) and for this
reallocation request, as the activities being financed under it have already
been approved by management under the first Additional Financing.
Revised project development objective/outcomes: N/A The PDO remains the same
PPAF wishes to continue its operational commitments in areas of Pakistan that were affected by
the earthquake of October 8, 2005. These will be consistent with the main PPAF objectives of
participatory development and social mobilization of communities, but will be more focused on
rebuilding houses and community level infrastructure such as link roads and water and sanitation
services for earthquake affected communities.

Introductory Statement

1.    This project paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President to (i) re-allocate
      funds in the amount of SDR 4,637,000 between categories of IDA Credits 38340-PAK
      and SDR 13,210,000 between categories of IDA Credit 3834-2-PAK. This reallocation is
      being submitted for RVP approval as it involves cost savings of over 5%.

2.    Effective management of funds has resulted in savings of 6.9% under the aforementioned
      categories, and the proposed re-allocations will support activities in line with the PDO
      that are currently under funded, namely reconstruction in the earthquake affected areas of
      an additional 850 Small Scale Infrastructure Projects; 164 existing health and education
      facilities; trainings for PPAF's Partner Organizations (POs) and housing subsidy to over
      10,000 tenants that have been now declared eligible to receive cash grants for housing
      reconstruction.

3.    The proposed reallocation would help direct savings to cover costs associated with the
      ongoing rebuilding of houses under the first and second additional financing that is being
      carried out with the full participation of communities in the 34 union councils assigned to
      PPAF. The earthquake affected communities will continue to be mobilized into
      community organizations by Partner Organization's of the PPAF and will be provided
      with housing compensation and training in seismic house reconstruction.


Background and Reasons for reallocation

4.    The scale and extent of the devastation caused by the earthquake left entire communities
      gravely affected and in need of rehabilitation. PPAF was quick to respond to this tragedy
      and because of its previous track record the GoP requested that PPAF manage the
      reconstruction activities in 34 Union Councils of NWFP and AJK.

5.    To finance this initial work, PPAF requested the Bank for a re-allocation of US$ 5
      million from its existing project resources, along with a waiver of O.P. 8.50 (Emergency
      Recovery Assistance) to finance relief activities. As funds from the second phase
      (PPAFII) project were disbursed or committed, the World Bank approved two additional
      financing totaling $238 million which were approved by the IDA Board of Executive
      Directors to implement the Earthquake Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (E3RP)
      program.

6.    PPAF has satisfactorily managed the reconstruction of partially and completely damaged
      houses, small scale infrastructure schemes and health and education facilities. Of the total
      111,790 damaged houses, 91% are under construction with over 95% compliant with the
      seismic reconstruction guidelines approved by the Earthquake Reconstruction and
      Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) of Pakistan. Over 410 community infrastructure
      schemes have been rehabilitated and over 70% of communities in the 34 Union Councils
      mobilized into 3,300 community organizations that are now engaging in development
      activities beyond housing reconstruction. Trainings have been imparted to over 16,000
      masons, steel fixers and carpenters in skill up-gradation and a further 77,000 house-
      owners have been trained in seismic housing reconstruction.

7.    To bridge the gap in funding and to complete remaining, eligible reconstruction activities,
      PPAF has requested for this reallocation of funds from cost savings.

Proposed changes

8.    The following changes are proposed (there is no restructuring or change to the PDO or
      development activities).

      A re-allocation request for each IDA Credit are as follows:
          ·   IDA Credit 38340-PAK: Request to re-allocate SDR 4,637,000 from unspent
              balances available under following categories: 4 (Equipment and vehicles for
              PPAF and POs); 5 (Consultants' and external auditors' services for PPAF); 6
              (Training for PPAF and Beneficiaries); 7 (Incremental Operating costs for PPAF)
              and 8 (Unallocated) to the categories 2 (Grants for Small Scale Infrastructure
              Projects); 2 (Grants for Social Sector Development Projects) and 6 (Training for
              Partner Organizations).

          ·   IDA Credit 3834-2-PAK: Request to re-allocate SDR 13,210,000 from the
              following category 9 (Grants under Part C3; Equipment & Vehicles for POs;
              Consultants' Services; Training; and Incremental Operating Costs) to category 11
              (Cash Grants for construction of low-cost seismologic houses).

9.    PPAF II continues to maintain adequate and acceptable financial management and
      Housing Support Cash Grants to the targeted households, which will continue to be
      disbursed under the operational procedures, eligibility criteria and delivery mechanism,
      meeting high transparency and accountability standards as agreed with ERRA as well as
      the World Bank.

Expected outcomes

10.   Funds will benefit affected and deserving rural communities and households in
      reconstruction of their homes and physical and social infrastructure.

11.   Expected outputs are: Reconstruction of an additional 850 Small Scale Infrastructure
      schemes; 164 existing health and education facilities; trainings for PPAF's Partner
      Organization staff; and Housing subsidies to over 10,000 tenants that are eligible to
      receive cash grants for housing reconstruction.
