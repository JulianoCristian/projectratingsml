REPORT ANID RECOIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DRECTORS ON A PROPOED CREDIT
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A RICE IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recormendation on a
proposed credit to the Federal Republic of Cameroon for the equivalent of
$3.7 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a rice irrigation
project.*
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.          The Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now total $67.1
million and cover seven projects in four sectors of the economv. Most
lending has been for agriculture and transport and was evenly distri-
buted between these two sectors. Consistent with the findings of our
economic mission and our discussions with the Government (see Part II
below), Bank operations in Cameroon over the next few years are expected
to focus more on transport, with agriculture ranking second in the amount
of assistance contemplated. Such a program would support the country's
Third Five Year Plan which allocates a major portion of investment to
infrastructure, while also reserving a "privileged place" for agricultural
development. The emphasis on infrastructure, and particularly the
transport sector, is required if Cameroon is to realize its export
potential in forest products, minerals, and diversified cash crops. In
FY-73 this approach will be specifically reflected in the presentation
of projects for cocoa development, ports, and roads.
3.          A summary of the existing Bank Group projects is given in
Annex I. The implementation of these projects has been generally satis-
factory, though there are some difficulties worth noting. Disbursements
for the CAMDEV plantation project (IDA $11.0 and Bank $7.0 million) are
slightly bedhina schedule, but neither the delays nor their causes are
serious; management requires strengthening and CAMDEV has had considerable
difficulty in recruiting a small number of foreign experts required on
The attached Appraisal Report (PA-103) shows a
proposed IDA credit of $3.5 million and a total project cost of $7.4
.million. The IDA $3.7 million now recommended, with a total project
cost of $7.6 million, reflects the upward adjustment required due to
the general re-alignment of exchange rates. The dollar value of the
CFA franc has recently been increased from CFAF 278: US$1 to CFAF 256:
US$1, and this new exchange rate is the basis for the figures shown
in this report.

a medium-term basis. The Sopame oil 22lm ro4ect (Bank $7.9 million)
is almost on target in its disbursements, but it is now apparent that
significant cost over-runs are to be expected, due primarily to higher
land clearing and establishment costs; a detailed analysis of estimated
expenditures required to complete the project is being made and con-
sultation with the co-lenders, Fonds dtAide et de Cooperation (FAC)
and the Caisse Centrale pour la Cooperation Economique (CCCE), is under
way. The water supEly project (Bank $5.0 million) was completed ahead
of scihdule with substantial savings which have been approved for invest-
ment in further water distribution works; disbursements, however, have
lagged due to the strong working capital position of the borrower; the
Bank has emphasized that an acceleration of disbursements must take place.
The education project (IDA $10o5 million) was delayed in starting and
work is about four months behind the revised implementation schedule.
The roads projet (Bank $12.0 and IDA $7.0 million) is about fifteen
months behind schedule, due primarily to administrative delays on the
part of the implementing agencies, This problem has been reviewed with
the Government on several occasions, and three contracts for construction
and two contracts for consultant services are due to be signed shortly
so that work can begin forthwith. The rail4Xa proect (Bank $5.2 million)
is being implemented satisfactori2y and full disbursement by the closing
date of June 30, 1974 is expected. The first port development project
(IDA $1.5 million) is about six months behind schedule because of
institutional changes required and time-consuming government procedures
involved; a revised disbursement schedule has been set up. The Government's
preparation of the major port development project, integrally linked to
the first project, is also behind schedule by six months.
4.          The proposed rice irrigation credit is the first Cameroon
project to be presented to the Executive Directors during FY-72 and is
due to be followed by an education project at the end of this fiscal
year.
PART II - THE ECONOIfY
5.          The most recent report on the Cameroon Economy , "Current
Economic Situation and Prospects of the Republic of Cameroon" (in five
volumes) (AlW-21a), was distributed to the Executive Directors on
December 21, 1970. The report of the updating mission which visited
Cameroon in October-NIovember 1971 will be distributed shortly. A Country
Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
6.          Cameroon is endowed with diversified although not abundant
natural resources. Its development potential is favorable. A variety
of climates and soils has permitted cultivation of a large number of
export crops, making Cameroon less vulnerable to external price fluctua-
tions than many other countries producing primary commodities. The rivers
have good bydro-electric potential. There are also indications of oil,
copper, natural gas, and bauxite but, thus far, no definite prospects of
commercial exploitation, The lack of an adequate transport network is
a major problem and has hindered economic development. Mich of past and



- 3 -
current development efforts, including those of the Bank Group, have
therefore been devoted to improving transport.
7.          Economically, Cameroon has done well in its first decade of
independence. Throughout the 1960's the econoniy grew rapidly  well
ahead of the 2.1 percent population growth rate. During the last three
to four years real GDP increased by about 7 percent a year, chiefly due
to favorable export prices. GDP per capita for 1968/69 was estimated
at $145, and our latest estimates now show 1970/71 GDP per capita of
$157 at constant 1966/67 prices. The main factors of growth have been
the diversification of agricultural exports, rapid growth of industry
and conmerce, and large infrastructure investments, particularly in
transport. A further important factor was the liberal investment climate
which encouraged foreign firms, usually French, to invest in Cameroon.
8.          A further factor which has boosted economic growth was
favorable world marlket prices for the most important export products,
cocoa and coffee. During 1965 - 1969, Cameroonts terms of trade improved
annually by 9 percent. This factor largely accounted for the 10 percent
annual growth M government revenues during 1965-1969 and for the
increase during those years of foreign reserves (from $27 million in
1965 to $91 million in June 1971, equivalent to four-five months of
imports). Since the beginning of 1970, however, ten-s of trade have
been deteriorating, particularly due to the still continuing decline
in cocoa prices (from 46 cents per lb. in 1969 to 25 cents in November
1971). I4oreover, cotton and groundnut crops were disappointing due to
the effect of drought. Economic growth has also been affected by the
decline in foreign investment. GDP growth in 1970/71 is provisionally
estimated at less than 4 percent in real terms and the prospects are
that the growth rate will drop during 1971/72 as well. As a result of
declining export prices, the balance of trade has shifted from a surplus
of $20 million in 1969/70 to a deficit of $30 million (about 12 percent
of imports) in 1970/71. Gross foreign assets have been declining since
mid-1971.
9.          The worsening of the terms of trade since the beginning of
1970 puts into relief some of the major problems of Cameroon's economyW:
the backward state of agriculture, nh_Thcrease in urban unemployment,
and transport bottlenecks. As far as human resources are concerned, the
number of professionals and skilled workers is still low. Much progress
has been made in the Cameroonization of the civil service, although
foreign technical advice remains vital. Foreign experts still largely
manage and own the private modern sector.
10.         Agriculture remains the mainstay of the economy, accounting
for 37 percent of GDP and about three-fourths of employment. Agricultural
equipment is not modern and techniques are largely traditional; the plots
are small, and credit and extension services are seldom available. !'ile
development efforts to increase some export crops have been effective, the
Government has not yet come to grips with the problem of increasing



production of domestic food stuffs and livestock, on which a large
part of the population depends for its livelihood and which is becoming -
increasingly important in view of the rapidly growing needs of the cities.
This lack of government action is in part due-to the absence of a
federal Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. At present, agriculture
is the responsibility of the state governments of East and lWest Cameroon,
which however neither dispose of the necessary funds nor the qualified
manpowier to launch an effective agricultural development effort. For
the same reasons, the institutional framework has also remained weak.
Concentration of decision-making and establishment of agricultural
organizations for credit, instruction, land reform and extension services
will probably have to await the establishment of a federal Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock.
11.         Among food crops, rice is the crop deserving priority
because of-an expected increase in demand by the rapidly growing urban
population. Experience in other liest African countries (Senegal, Ivory
Coast) has shown that rice consumption is apt to increase rapi,ly with
the increase in the urban population. Since rice production provides
farmers with substantial income and employment, increases in consumption
should be satisfied primarily from increased domestic production.
Cameroon has favorable growing potential, both in the North (where the
proposed project is located) and in the South. However, surveys and
pre-investment studies are urgently needed to select favorable sites
in the South, in rain-forest areas and on irrigation sites.
12.         With regard to domestic food production, the Government
will furthermore need to undertake projects aimed at increased meat and
fish production and at improved conservation and marketing of traditional
staples. For export crops, further action is required to raise the
efficiency of coffee and cocoa production.
13.         Expansion of forestry production depends crucially on
improvements in transport -- roads, railways, ports. Investments in
transport have accounted for 45 percent of public investment during
the past five years and are expected to continue on a large scale.
The Bank Group is vigorously assisting the Government's efforts to
improve the transport network. In spite of improvements in recent
years, the movement of goods and people is still retarded by bottlenecks
in the Douala port, on the Douala-Yaounde railway and on a number of
roads.
14.         Partly due to the slow economic development of rural areas,
people are moving to the cities. The urban population has been increasing
by 6 percent a year and is expected to reach 3.0 million by 1985. This
would be 38 percent of population as compared to only 16 percent in
1963 and 22 percent in 1970. This increase has been far more rapid than
the expansion of employment in Cameroon's secondary and tertiary sectors.
Urban unemployment is likely to increase further in the next decade and
to become a source of political and social unrest. Employment creation-
is thus becoming the most important objective. Since effective agricul-
tural development might slow down but could not possibly stem the rural
exodus, the Government will need to give urgent attention to increasing



5-
urban employment in industry, transport, trade and other services.
15.         The Governmentts success in this endeavor will to a large
extent depend on maintenance of the favorable climate for private
investments, both foreign and domestic. In recent years, however,
Governmentts relations with the private sector became strained by
bureaucratic interventions while efforts to identify and promate
industrialization possibilities remained inadequate. The Government
has become increasingly awiare of these shortcomings and the President
is personally directing an effort to improve communication with the
business community. Future industrialization will principg6lly depend
on the ability of Cameroon to attract foreign capital and expertise
which can produce intermediate products for the local econony and
process local goods for export.
16.         The major development problems discussed in the preceding
paragraphs find adequate recognition in the Government's development
plan 1971/2 - 1975/6. However, action in the crucial areas of agricultural
and industrial development needs more precise definition and thus more
resources (including foreign technical assistance) for project preparation.
The pipeline of directly productive projects is small and without
determined attempts to step up project preparation much of the plan will
remain unrealized. Although Camroon's administrative ability has
increased remarkably, it needs more foreign technical assistance than is
presently available to help work out the practical problems of agricul-
tural and industrial development.
17. The Government announced the development plan at a-time when
prospects for domestic resource mobilization were poor. The plan calls
for total investment of CFAF 280 billion (US$1.1 billion) of uhich half
would be public. This amount is-a 70 percent increase over investment
in the last five years (1966/6 - 1970/1). Vihile it is doubtful whdether
the project content of the plan is sufficiently worked out to permit
the plan's full implementation, financial difficulties are likely to be
even more of a constraint. In spite of the plan's optimistic calculations
of foreign aid disburseinents, the need for public savings was nevertheless
estimated at CFAF 10 billion a year, about 35 percent of proposed public
investment.
18.         To realizd this amount of savings will require a very
determined effort. During the recent period of rising export prices
(1965-70), Government revenue increased rapidly and in spite of rising
current expenditures, budgetary savings averaged CFAF 3 billion, about
8 percent of revenue and 1.5 percent of GDP. Public savings moreover
increased through large surpluses of the agricultural stabilization
funds, The more recent decline in export prices has however led to a
much less favorable situation. In 1970/71 the Government realized only
a small budgetary surplus and the present fiscal year is likely to show
a current deficit.
19.         At the same time, prospects for the agricultural stabilization
funds have become unfavorable. The cocoa fund budget calls for price



-6-
support payments during 1971/2 6f CFAF 3.7 billion plus CFAF 1.5 billion
in arrears frma the past year. These payments would virtually exhaust
the reserves of the fund, which was heavily depleted last year by a
special investment budget of CFAF 10.5 billion. Before long, the
Government will probably have to lower the cocoa producer price. At
present international prices, the Government is paying the private
sector CFAF 24 per kg exported. The recent increase in value of the
CFA franc (from 278: US$1 to 256: US$1) and the prospect for further
decline in world market prices would lead to even larger payments by the
Government. To mitigate the effect of last year's drastic decline in
cotton production, the cotton stabilization fund has also been paying
maintenance subsidies to farmers. Only a partial recovery of cotton
production is expected this year.
20.         In order to improve prospects for savings during the plan
period, the Government will have to curtail first of all the growth
of current expenditureso The Government is aware of this need; the plan
foresees current expenditures growth at 6 percent a year as compared to
about 10 percent a year in the past five years. However, if export income
remains depressed, the Government may have to contemplate an even lower'
growth rate of current expenditures. The Government may moreover have tQ
reduce the cocoa and perhaps other agricultural producer prices in spite
of the serious consequences for farmerts incomes and the risk that export
volume wo4d drop.
21.        Ever since independence the Cameroon Government has followed
sound financial policies and there is every reason to expect that the
Government will attempt to reduce low-priority expenditures to free
resources for economic development. However, the Government recognizes
that a reduction in the development plan may also be required. Meanwhile,
international aid agencies can soften the impact of the export price
decline on domestic savings by providing a high proportion of aid on
concessional terms, and of a high proportion of project cost,, including
the financing of local currency expenditures.
22.         Cameroon's external public debt has increased rapidly. It
amounted to 233 million at the end of June 1971. The debt service ratio
is likely to rise from 4 percent in 1970 to about 7 percent in 1975/76,
taking into account service on existing and estimated new public debt.
In making this projection it has been assumed that grant aid disburse-
ments will remain substantial, that Cameroon's traditional aid donors
will continue to offer relatively favorable terms on official loans and
that meanwhile Cameroon, in order to avoid rapid exhaustion of its
debt servicing capacity, iLll keep supplier credit financing within
strict limits. The forecast debt service ratio is still not very high
and a modest increase in conventional debt would therefore appear
justified. However, in view of the country's poverty and modest growth
prospects, Cameroon's needs for external capital are expected to extend
over a considerable length of time. A continued rapid build-up of external
debt should be avoided and it is therefore desirable that most foreign
assistance be on concessional terms.

PART III - THE PROJECT
23.          The agricultural sector is paramount in Cameroon and about
three-fourths of the population earns its livelihood from farming and
related activities. The export of an increasing variety of agricultural
commodities produces over 80% of the country's foreign exchange earnings;
two crops, however, cocoa and coffee, still account for about three-
fourths of agricultural exports. The Bank Group's two previous agriculture
projects (CAMDEV and Sopame) were to promote the production on large
government-owned plantations of a variety of cash crops other than cocoa
and coffee. Looking to the future, the cocoa project under preparation
will be aimed at assisting small holders to improve their yields and
increase income. After FY-73 there are plans for assisting projects in
livestock and other cash and food crops. Representing this shift in
emphasis, the proposed rice irrigation project would provide benefits for
small farmers, increase the modest exports of rice to adjacent countries,
and help meet the growing domestic demand for rice.
24.          Rice consumption in Cameroon is low compared with that in
other African countries: about 17,000 tons per year or 2.9 kg per capita.
Urban centers in the South are the main markets for rice. Urban population
is increasing by 7 percent per year, and so is rice consumption, in line
with the trend in evidence in other African countries. Some 7,000 tons
of rice are produced domestically, of which about 70% is grown in the
Yagoua district in Northern Cameroon. From this area 1,000 tons of rice
are exported each year to nearby markets in the Central African Republic,
Northern Nigeria, and Chad. Cameroon imports far exceed exports, however,
as around 11,000 tons of rice are imported annually in the South to
satisfy urban consumption. The proposed project would cover about one
quarter of future domestic requirements and also permit an expansion in
rice exports, although Cameroon will remain a substantial net importer
of rice.
25.          The project is in Cameroonts largest rice-growing area,
the Yagoua district, located along the west bank of the Logone River. At
this point the Logone constitutes the border with Chad. Flooding,
drainage, climate, and soils are favorable to the growing of rice, as
has been amply proven by the "Societe d'Expansion et de Modernisation de
la Riziculture a Yagoua"(SEMRY). Established by the Cameroon Government
in 1957, SEMRY was reorganized in February, 1971 as a Societe de D4velop-
pement under the Federal Ninistry of Flanning. SENRY is now the sole owner
of some 6,100 ha of irrigated rice fields bordering the Logone River,
including all buildings and installations and guarantees the continued
right of usufruct to farmers who follow sound practices and deliver their
paddy to it. SEMRY operates and maintains all hydraulic and road works,
carries out mechanical cultivation for farmers and supplies inputs to
them, purchases the paddy for cash and processes it through a rice mill
with an annual capacity of 6,000 tons; SEMRY then sells approximately
20% of its output in local markets, 20% in neighboring countries, and
60% in Yaounde. At the present time SEIRY is exploiting about 4, 200 ha,
of which 1,300 ha are located in the area selected for the proposed
project. (For details on SENRY's operations see paras 3.01 to 3.10 and



- 8 -
annexes 1 to 4 of the Appraisal Report).
26.          The proposed project was identified in 1967 under the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and was prepared to the feasibility stage
by consulting firms financed by FAC. The project would consist of the
following:
(a) reinforcement of the 49 km Logone dike and improvement
of a parallel road;
(b) construction of four pumping stations;
(c) rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage networks to
serve 1,300 ha;
(d) construction of new irrigation and drainage networks to
serve 3,000 ha;
(e) on-farm development works on 3,000 ha; and
(f) construction of a rice mill with an annual capacity of
10,000 tons of paddy and storage for 7,800 tons.
Tha project would also finance the purchase of farm machinery and
expansion of the management and extensinn services offered by SEIRY. A
consulting firm would be engaged to assist in the design, construction,
and supervision of civil works and on4&rm development wiorks, (For further
details on project components see paras 4h02 to 4.o8 of Appraisal Report).
27.          Project costs, including taxes, are estimated at US"07.6
million with a foreign exchange component of US$h43 million. The main
cost elements are as follows:

29.          Responsibility for implementation would rest with SEMRY
whose experience, legal authority, management, and staff are adequate
to carry out the proposed project. The present share capital of CFAF 245
million is not adequate, however; prior to effectiveness of this credit
the Statuts of SEMRY would have to be amended to increase the authorized
capital tFoCFAF 645 million and, of this amount, not less than CFAF 100
million would have to be paid in. (See paras 5.03 to 5.11 of Appraisal
Report). This increase in SEMRY's equity is shown in the table in para
28 above.
30.          Procurement would be in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines
for the cost of (i)im_ported equipment ($1.3 million); and (ii) civil
works contracts ($3.1 million) for the construction of the rice mill,
storage, and the irrigation system including dike and road. The con-
structicn of related buildings, whose cost would not exceed $155,000,
would be tendered locally since the amount involved would not attract
international competition. On-farm development would be carried out on
force account by SEIRY with equipment purchased under the credit. All
IDA funds would be disbursed within three years of effectiveness.
31.          Costs would be recovered (i) by cash surpluses generated
from SENRY's operations through the difference between the sale price
of rice and cash payments for paddy to farmers, and (ii) by sales tax
revenues on incremental rice production. These recoveries, when calculated
at their present value using a discount rate of 9% over 40 years, amount
to 511O of the project's total costs at present value. The subsidy element
in the project, that is, the costs which cannot be recovered, is therefore
49%. A Government subsidy of this magnitude seems justified in view of
the poverty of the local farmers. As beneficiaries, the 2,800 farm
families within the project area would have a fourfold increase in cash
income which, by 1980, is projected at $65 per person per annum -- still
far below Cameroonts present average per capita GDP of 157 per annum
(for details see paras 5.12 to 5.15 in the Appraisal Report).
32.          The project iwould not alter the ecological situation. Bush
clearing would not be required, and the use of pesticides would be limited
by SEIRY to the minimum quantities needed for an adequate pest control
programo Shistosomiasis (bilharzia) is highly prevalent and malaria is
endemic. The Bank has employed an environmental consultant to examine
the consequences of the project for public health. His findings were that
the breeding grounds for malaria would be reduced, whereas the effect
of the project on controlling bilharzia would be beneficial in some wiays
and adverse in others. The consultant's recommendations on public health
measures to be taken have been agreed to by the Government.
33.          In summary, the project is a sound one because rice can be
produced in Cameroon at economic costs comparable to those prevailing
internationally. The project fits wvell into Cameroonts strategy for
encouraging import substitution, since the expected increase in production
by SEIMRY would equal, by 1980. about one-quarter of the country's domiestic



requirements for rice. At full development about 20% of the project's
incremental production would be exported to nearby markets in Chad, the
Central African Republic, and Northern Nigeria. The benefit of an increase
in farmer's income has been mentioned in para 31 above. The project would
also benefit other areas because of increased flood protection, and it
would provide during the dry-season additional employment estimated at
17,000 man-days to about 1,000 farm families who are not involved in the
project but who are living in the vicinity of SEH4RY. The internal econo;
mic return of the project would be 11% (see paras 7.01 to 7.05 in
Appraisal Report for details on economic justification).
PART IV - IEGAL IM7STRUMENTS AMD AUTHORITY
34.          The draft Development Credit Agreement betwneen the Federal
Republic of Cameroon and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and SENRY, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
35.          The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern in
credits for projects of this kind. The following covenants of the
draft Development Credit Agreement are of special interest:
Sections 1.02 (h), and 7.01 (i) refer to the Logone River
Agreement between the Goverments of Chad and Cameroon;
formal validity has been extended from 10 to 40 years
insofar as this Agreement affects the SEERY project.
Section 4.02 provides an assurance that the Government of
Cameroon will undertake the necessary steps to monitor and
protect the public health of the populatian living in the
project area.
36.          I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
37.          I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed credit.
