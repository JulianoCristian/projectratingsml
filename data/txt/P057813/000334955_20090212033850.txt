                IEGWB Mission: Improvingdevelopmentresultsthrough excellence inevaluation.


About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroupassesses the programsand activitiesof theWorld Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank'swork is producingthe
expected results, and second,to helpdevelopimproved directions, policies,and proceduresthroughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGWBannuallyassessesabout 25 percent of
the Bank's lendingoperationsthroughfieldwork. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those
that are innovative,large, or complex; thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudiesor countryevaluations;those for
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management haverequested assessments;and thosethat are likelyto generate
important lessons.
       To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examine projectfiles and other
documents, interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowingcountryto discussthe operationwith the government,
and other in-countrystakeholders, and interviewBankstaff and other donor agency staff bothat headquarters and
in localoffices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subjectto internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commentedon by the responsibleBank department. IEGWBincorporates the comments as
relevant.The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers'comments are attachedto
the documentthat is sent to the Bank's Boardof ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has beensent to
the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


About the IEGWB RatingSystem
       IEGWB's use of multipleevaluationmethodsoffers both rigor and a necessarylevelof flexibilityto adaptto
lendinginstrument, projectdesign, or sectoralapproach. IEGWBevaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto
arriveat their project ratings. Followingis the definitionand ratingscale used for each evaluation criterion
(additionalinformationis availableon the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto
beachieved, efficiently.The rating has three dimensions: relevance,efficacy, and efficiency.Relevance includes
relevanceof objectivesand relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistentwith the country's current development prioritiesand with current Bank country and
sectoralassistancestrategiesand corporategoals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,Operational Policies). Relevanceof design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved, taking intoaccount their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extentto which the projectachieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the opportunitycost of capital
and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives.The efficiency dimensiongenerally is not appliedto adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation,that developmentoutcomes (or
expectedoutcomes)will not be maintained(or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensuredquality at entry of the
operationand supportedeffective implementationthrough appropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequate
transitionarrangementsfor regularoperationof supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievementof developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratingsfor Bank Performance:Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower (includingthe governmentand implementing
agencyor agencies)ensured quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and
agreements,toward the achievementof developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performanceand implementingagency(ies) performance.Possible ratings for Borrower Performance:Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

          This is aProject PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) for three operations in
Georgia: the Judicial ReformProject (FY99), the Third Structural Adjustment Credit
(FY99), andthe Reform Support Credit (FY05).

          The three were chosen for aPPAR insupport o fthe Georgia Country Assistance
Evaluation (CAE) andto complement an earlier PPAR of seven projects carried out and
issued inJuly 2003.

          The Judicial ReformProject, costing $16.3 million, was supportedby a credit of
SDR 9.9 million($13.4 million equivalent) from IDA. The credit was approvedonJune
30, 1999, and closed inJune 30,2006, three years after the original closing date.

          The Third Structural Adjustment Credit (SDR 44.3 million, $60 million
equivalent) was approvedon June 30, 1999 and closedon October 30,2002 - after three
extensions and 22 monthslater than the original closing date ofDecember 31,2000. The
credit was disbursedinthree tranches.

          The Reform Support Credit (SDR 16.6 million, $24 million equivalent) was
approved on June 24,2004, disbursedon August 19,2004, and closedon December 31,
2004. Itwas disbursedinone tranche following effectiveness.

          This PPAR i s basedon a review ofrelevant World Bankdocuments, includingthe
Implementation Completion Reports (ICR) andthe ICR Reviews for the three operations.
It i s also basedon interviews conductedwith Georgian officials, representatives o fthe
private sector, academia, think-tanks,NGOs, other donor agencies, andBank staffat
headquartersandTbilisi ResidentMission.

          Comments from the Bank's Regional Managementhavebeen incorporatedinthe
report. The draft PPARwas sent to the Government o f Georgia for comments following
standardIEGproceduresandno commentswere provided as presented inAnnex B.

          This report was preparedby Jorge Garcia-Garcia (consultant, IEGCR).

Summary

1.      This PPARreviewed three inter-related operations inGeorgia over the 1999-2007
period, insupport o f institutional change. One operation was an investment credit for the
judicial sector that sought to makethe judiciary more effective, professional and
independent.The two other operations were credits that sought to support economic
adjustment and stability, better governance, better use o f fiscal resources, and the growth
o fthe private sector. The Judicial Reform Project (FY1999) was supported by an IDA
credit o f SDR 9.9 million($13.4 million equivalent) that closed inJune 30,2006, three
years after the original closing date. The Third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC3,
FY1999), an IDA credit o f SDR 44.3 million($60 millionequivalent), was closed on
October 30,2002,22 months after the original closingdate ofDecember 31,2000. The
credit was disbursed inthree tranches. The Reform Support Credit (FY2004) - an IDA
credit of SDR 16.6 million($24 million equivalent) was closed as planned, inDecember
31,2004. It was disbursed inone tranche following effectiveness.

2.      Located on the southern flanks ofthe Caucasus Mountains, with a population o f
4.6 million and landarea o f 69,700 square kilometers, Georgia became independent in
April 1991. External shocks inthe early 90s ledto economic hardship andpolitical
instability. A far-reaching stabilization program, launchedinSeptember 1994, succeeded
inendinghyperinflationandrestoring growth, but aweak fiscal situation andthe Russian
financial crisis o f 1998 disruptedthe economy. In 1999 the Laridepreciated sharply,
growth slowed, and inflation increased. Prudent monetary policy restored stability and
growth recovered in2002-2003 but by then the Georgian state was on the verge o f
collapse. The public had lost confidence inthe government, the economy hadbecome
more dollarized, corruption was rampant, and the environment for businesses was dismal.
InNovember 2003, after apeacefulmass uprisingknownas the "Rose Revolution,"
Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgia's president, resigned. His government was replacedby a
group o f reformers that took steps to reduce corruption, improve fiscal management, and
deregulate the economy. The reforms set the stage for developing a market economy and
makingthe private sector the mainagent o fgrowth. They ledto faster growth, a sharp
fall inpetty corruption, and more public revenues and investment.

3.      The credits sought to help solve some o fthe problems noted above. The credit for
Judicial Reform sought to help develop an independent andprofessionaljudiciary,
committed to highstandards o fjudicial ethics and capable of efficient and effective
dispute resolution. An independent and effectivejudicial system was expected to help
the private sector, to uphold property and contract rights, andto reduce corruption. The
thirdStructuralAdjustment Credit (SAC3) sought to support the Government's program
to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and to provide an adequate incentive structure for
private sector development. The credit supported reform o f legislation andregulations,
liberalization o fmarkets andprivatizationo f state-owned companies, and stronger fiscal
performance while lessening the adverse impact o f stabilization on the poor. The Reform
 Support Credit sought to help define a boldprogram o f economic, legal, and social
reforms aimed at improving governance and anti-comption andpublic financial
management; and at resolving crucial issues inthe energy sector. The credits supported

                                              xii


the objectives o f Bank assistance o fpromoting private sector development, strengthening
public finance, and improving governance and efficiency o fpublic expenditure.

4.      Two o f the credits were approved inJune 1999 (SAC3 and Judicial Reform),
when the appetite for reform no longer existed. Followingthe defeat o fhyperinflation
andthe return o fgrowth, the government lost the urgencyto reform, inpart a casualty o f
the influence o f former communist nomenklatura and the shadow `economic elite' that
sapped "the ability o f the new state to reform itself" (Wheatley, 2005, 103.) With
multipleandambitious conditions seeking reform, SAC3 was predestined to fail inthat
environment. The second one, Judicial Reform, sought lofty goals, an independent, more
effective judiciary, committed to highstandards o fjudicial ethics, but lackedthe means
to achieve them. The third credit, Reform Support, approved inM a y 2004, found a
favorable climate for reform and succeeded inachieving its goals. Although its
conditions consisted mainly o f action plans and could not guarantee results, the
government met them; after the credit closed, the Government carried out the plans,
delivering most o fthe results expected.

5.      The government's reluctance to reform andthe Bank's ambitious objectives
marredthe results for the Judicial Reform andSAC3 credits. InJudicial Reform, the
overall objective o fjudicial independence, efficient andprofessionaljudiciary committed
to highstandards o fjudicial ethics was not achieved. InSAC3, the mismatchbetween
the tools used and the objectives sought ledto poor results; these could have been
avoided ifthe government had carried out the reforms indicated inthe actionplans. The
results o f the Reform Support credit didnot suffer the fate o f SAC3 because the
government was committed to sustaining the actions that the program document and the
credit agreement sought. Based on these considerations, this review rates the outcome
for Judicial Reform and SAC3 as moderately unsatisfactory, and for Reform Support as
moderately satisfactory. The review rates as negligible to low the riskto development
outcome for Judicial Reform(the buildings andhardware will remain), as high that for
SAC3 (at the time o f closing) and as moderate that for Reform Support (government
unlikely to backtrack on changes already done).

6.       The following lessons emerge from the three credits evaluated:

             The experience o f SAC3 andReformSupport Credits reiterates that Bank
             support can be effective inpromoting and supporting change when the
             authorities are ready for reform, but not otherwise. When the authorities are
             not ready it could be argued that financial support may weaken the need for
             change and strengthen the capacity to maintain the status quo.

             The experience o fthe Judicial ReformProject shows that makingthejudiciary
             more independent, effective, adherent to higher ethical standards and
             professionalrequires interventions that go beyond rehabilitating infrastructure,
             using information technology, and educating the public. Establishmento f an
             independent and effective judiciary requires strong political will and
             continuous commitment o f the country authorities, which a Bank operation
             can only complement, but not substitute for.

The experience of the Reform Support Credit shows that simpler rules reduce
opportunities for corruption. When the government simplified the rules and
streamlined administrative procedures inorganizations like the traffic police,
customs, and tax administrationtheir staff delivered better services and
extorted fewer bribes.

1. Background

1.1       Locatedon the southern flanks ofthe Caucasus Mountains, with a population of
4.6 million and land area o f 69,700 square kilometers, Georgia became independent in
April 1991. External shocks, civilwar movements, andpolicymistakes ledto economic
hardships and political instability. By 1994 the wars and the economic policies had
ravaged the economy (See Table 1). The appointment o f E. Shevardnadze as president
brought some stability to the country. As the conflicts abated andpolitical instability
declined it became easier to start a stabilization programinSeptember 1994. The
government liberalized prices and trade, increased revenues from taxes, curtailed its
expenditure, and limitedCentral Bank financing o f its deficit. The program succeeded,
endinghyperinflationand restoringgrowth.

1.2       Followingthis success, over the period 1997-2003 the government maintained
macroeconomic stability and sustained reforms until 1997, albeit with difficulties. A
weak fiscal situation andthe Russianfinancial crisis o f 1998 disruptedthe economy. The
Lari depreciated sharply, growth slowed, and inflation increased in 1999. Severe droughts
in1998 and2000, priceincreases ofimportedenergyin2000, andthe Turkishfinancial
crisis o f 2001 also contributed to the slowdown ingrowth. Prudent monetarypolicy
restored stability andgrowth recovered in2002-2003, but the public had lost confidence
inthe financial system andthe economy becamemore dollarized. The Shevardnadze
government became increasingly reluctant to deepen the reforms Georgia neededto
foster a market economy andincrease growth. Public finance did not strengthen as
expected, corruption grew unchecked, andthe environment for businesses deteriorated.

1.3       By2002-03, the Georgian state was on the verge o fcollapse. InNovember 2003,
after a peacefulmass uprising(the "Rose Revolution"), Mr.Shevardnadze resigned. His
government was replaced by a group o freformers, under the leadership ofMikheil
Saakashvili who was elected president inJanuary 2004. The new government took steps
to reduce corruption, improve fiscal management, and deregulate the economy, setting
the stage for developing a market economy andmakingthe private sector the main agent
o f growth. The wide rangingreforms led, amongother results, to faster growth, much
higher tax revenues and public investment ininfrastructure, normal operation o fthe
electricity service, elimination o fpension arrears, and almost complete eradication o f
petty corruption.

1.4       Georgia's economy has advanced since 1994. GDPper capita more than doubled
between 1994 and 2007 andpoverty rates have declined. (See Table 2). Inequality has
increased, though, probably affected by the changes the country had to carry out given
how it started its independence: with war, political turmoil, large external shocks, a stock
o fphysical capital inappropriate for its new market economy, and policymakers
unprepared to handle a market economy.

1.5       The three credits this PPAR evaluates sought to help solve some o f above
problems. The Judicial Reform Project, approvedinJune 1999, sought to help develop
an independentandprofessionaljudiciary, committed to high standards o fjudicial ethics
and capable o fefficient, effective dispute resolution. An independent andeffective
judicial system was expected to help the private sector to enforce property and contract
rights. The third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC3), approved inJune 1999, sought to
support the Government's program to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and to provide
an adequate incentive structure for private sector development. The credit supported the
reform of legislationandregulations, the liberalization o f markets andprivatization o f
state-owned companies, and a stronger fiscal performancewhile lessening the adverse
impact o f stabilization on the poor. The Reform Support Credit, approved inM a y 2004,
sought to help define andlauncha boldprogramof economic, legal, and social reforms
aimed, inparticular, at improving governance, reducing corruption, strengthening public
financial management; andresolving crucial issues inthe energy sector.

Project Objective

2.1     The project sought "to assist inthe development o f an independentandprofessional
judiciary, committed to highstandards ofjudicial ethics and capable of efficient, effective
disputeresolution." (Project Appraisal Document -PAD Report No. 19346-GE,
June 7, 1999, p. 2).

DesignandImplementation

2.2     Components. The project consisted o f seven components with a total expected cost
ofUS$16.3 million, ofwhich the Bank financed US$13.4 million(See Table 3). The court
administration andcasemanagement component (component A) assistedthejudiciary in
(i) establishing a court administration system; (ii) implementingamodemcomputerized
system o fcase management; and (iii)     acquiringa system for audio recordingo fcourt
proceedings to ensure the integrityofcourt protocols. The infrastructure rehabilitation
component (Component B) sought to help establish a systemo fcourt infrastructure that
wouldreflectthenewprocedures o fanindependent andbetter hctioningjudiciary. It
was expected that better infiastructurewould improve the perceptionGeorgians had o fthe
judicial system; the PADnotedthat the "improvement inpublicperceptionis directly
related to physical condition, architectural design, and facilities management and
maintenance" (p.20). For the enforcement of courtjudgment component (Component C)
the PAD didnot specify an objective. Fromthe text inthe PAD the objective would seem
to be improving the enforcement o fjudgments incivil cases, training o fbailiffs (court
 executors) andbetter infrastructure (e.g., means o ftransport) for the bailiffs to discharge
 their duties; it was expectedthat better enforcement would increase the "low public
 acceptanceo fthe court system as a venue for dispute resolution" (p. 22). The assistanceto
 the Ministryo fJustice (MOJ) component (Component D) sought to help MOJbecome the
 leading entity inGeorgia for legal drafting and legal harmonization. The Judicial Training
 Center (JTC) component (component E) sought to assist the JTC inorganizing and
 canying out thejudicial training function. The training was expected to enhance the
 knowledge andjudicial skills o fnew and sittingjudges, assistantjudges, chancery
 personnel andtechnical staff o fthe courts. Thepublic information and education
 component (component F) sought to raise appreciation among the Georgianpopulation
 about the importance o f an independent, competent andequitable judiciary, and o fthe
 reform efforts being carried out at the time. Finally, the project management component
 paid for project coordinationand implementation.

 2.3    Implementation. The credit was disbursed hllyandthe project components had some
 minor revisions. In2003 the government decidedto drop the assistanceto the MOJ
 (Component D)becausethe Ministrywas unable to decide how andwhen to usethe
 allocated fbnds. InJuly 2005, the government decidedto not rollout the pilot case
 managementsystem andwait untilcompleting the ongoing court reorganization (i.e.,
 consolidate 75 first instance courts into regional courts andmagistrate courts); bythat time,
 though, the funds allocated for that component hadbeen disbursed almost inits entirety.

                                                                   4


Also, the Bank andthe government agreedto allocate the contingency ofSDR 1millionas
follows: 10percent morefunds for civilworks to rehabilitate 15 courts insteadof 11,to
double the operating costs for theproject implementationunit (Pnr) andto the Association
for Legal and Judicial Public Education, andto increaseby25 percent the budget for
consultant services, trainingandworkshops inmost components. The changes didnot affect
the distributiono fthe h d s to components inany significant way. Thebulk o fthem
(86 percent, plannedand actual) went to the casemanagement system (23 percent),
infrastructurerehabilitation (5 1percent), andto public informationandeducation
(12 percent). The largest reallocationwent into increasing the funds for the project
managementunit fiom US$0.6 millionto US$1.08 million.

The project took longer to be executedbecausereorganizing the court system required
modifjmgthe infrastructure and casemanagement components. Theproject also neededto
accommodate the interruption inimplementation causebythe RoseRevolution
(November 2003).

Monitoring and Evaluation

2.5         To measure success the PADproposed to look at the extent to which the
following keyperformance indicators were achieved (PAD, p. 2):
            .    degree to which the new court administration system has been established.
            9    introduction o f a new case management system.
                 improved public awareness o f the judicial system including, among others,
                 better appreciation o f the reform program, awareness o f their individual rights,
                 andbetterunderstanding o falternative dispute resolutions; and
            *    increased trust inthe iudicial system by actual andpotential users, including
                 the business and legal community.

2.6        The PAD also proposedother group o fperformance indicators. Some gave a
senseo f direction o fpotential impact, such as reduced delays inenforcing court
decisions, and others sought to establish ifan output hadbeen delivered, such as the
number o f court facilities rehabilitated (See Table 4). Most o f the indicators lacked

                                                       5


baseline and target values since these were not formal requirements at the time o fproject
development.

2.7      Design. The PAD lacked a sound results framework.' It did not present a clear
linkbetween components andobjectives, andlackedanadequate set ofresults indicators,
let alone baseline andtarget values. Most indicators measured output (e.g., rehabilitating
buildings),notresults. The PAD failed to produce goodresults indicatorsbecause it did
not probe into the consequenceso fthe problemsidentified (e.g., what consequences did
poor control o fcaseshave?) or explored insufficiently the linkbetweeninterventions and
intendedresults (e.g., buildingsand independentjudiciary).2 .

2.8      Implementation. The authorities andthe Bank measured those indicators that
could be measured easily (e.g. courts rehabilitated) but did not identifyand resolved the
weaknesses intheir design. Duringproject implementationneither the Bank nor the
authorities made an effort to draw baseline values for indicators lackingthem (e.g.,
improvingcourt administration, improvedenforcement o fcourt decisions). Last, potential
beneficiaries o fthe interventionswere not involved indefining target indicators and
assessingtheir achievements.

credit's hnds was unrelated to M&E.

2.10     Summarizing, the PAD lacked a M&E framework. The PPAR rates the quality o f
monitoring and evaluation as negligible.

RELEVANCE
2.11 The project triedto help deal with problems that affected Georgia: widespread
corruption, legal uncertainty, poor enforcement o f laws andregulations, andinadequate
protection o f contractual andproperty rights. Also, the credit responded to the
government's request for assistanceinthe further definition andimplementation o f its
judicial reformprogram. The credit supported the CAS (FY98) objective o f deepening
anddiversifyingthe sources o fgrowththrough strengthening the rule o flaw. The idea
that adherence to the rule o f law would improve investor confidence and facilitate growth
was supported by surveys carried out for the World Development Report o f 1997, The
State in a Changing World. The PAD quoted a study onpublic awareness andthe rule of
law showing that the majority o f Georgians mistrusted the current legal system, perceived

  To have independent judges a society must create the political and economic incentives to achieve that
result, but the project didnot deal withthese critical factors. Forjudicial independence the fundamental
positive question would be: "Under what circumstances will politicians maintainjudges who are
independents from themselves"? T h ~ question is discussed and evaluated for the Japanese judicial system

Judging in Japan (Chicago, The University o f Chicago Press, 2003), p.4. The project also displayed a lack
ofknowledge ofwhat institutional change means, as explained inDouglas North, Institutions, Institutional
Change and Economic Pe~ormance(Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1990)

thejudicial system as corrupt, and felt that the legal system didnot provide a forum for
obtainingjustice. Insummary, the project identifiedimportant problems inthejudicial
system and tried to tackle them by supporting actions spanning from court administration
to training andpublic information about thejudicial system.

2.12       Theproject sought to deal with the following sector issues: court administration,
judicial training, public information andeducation andrehabilitation o finfrastructure. By
supporting the new court administration systemthe project sought to make courts more
accountable, responsible andresponsive. Bysupportingjudicial trainingthe project sought to
help the government to trainjudges, a cornerstone o fthejudicial reformprogram. By
supporting public information andeducation the project sought to help the government
increasedemandforjustice through "a public that is better informedandengagedwiththe
system" (PAD,p. 6). Finally, byimproving selectedinfkstructure incourts the project
aimedto highlightthe newrole andimportance o fthejudiciary andthe servicesitprovides.
This said, while these components couldleadto betterjudicial performance, they were
unlikely to leadtojudicial independenceor to highstandards o fjudicial ethics, which needed
actions andchangesbeyondthosethe PAD envisaged. Project objectives were, therefore,
highlyambitious for theinterventions andthis reducedtheir relevance.

2.13       This review rates the relevance o fthe project's objectives as substantial.

EFFICACY
2.14       In what follows, this PPAR discussesbriefly the mainoutput indicators associated
with the project andthen discusses inmore detail whether thejudicial system is
independent, delivers better services to people and firms, and the public has a better
perception o fit.

outputs

2.15       The PAD set output andperformanceindicators for some components
(See Table 4), but inseveral cases it failed to specify baseline andtarget values andthe
outcomes (results) associated with them. The ICR made an effort to improve the quality
o fthe indicators, but they were still insufficient to measure the results related to each
objective. This review adds the ICRbaseline and target values for outputs when
analyzing the efficacy o f achievement o fproject objectives.

2.16    The project helpedto improve some ofthe physical andtechnological
infrastructure o fthe courts and to inform the public about the importance o f thejudiciary.
The 15 courts rehabilitated exceed the number planned, 11,because of costs savings
resultingfrom the good management o fthe General Departmentof Courts. The
computers and other peripheral equipment were deliveredbut the case management
system (Component B) was operational in25 percent of cases, not the 100percent
expected at appraisal. The inputs for enforcing court judgments (develop master planfor
an efficient court function, training for bailiffs, equipment for bailiffs -Component C)
were delivered. The assistanceto the MOJ (Component D) didnot happen because the
government droppedthe component. Last, ALPE carried out a variety o fpublic
education and media campaigns and activities aimed at informingthe public about
judiciary (Component E).

Objectives

2.17     To determine the efficacy o f achieving the project's objective this review looks at
whether the project assisted inthe development o f (a) an independentjudiciary; (b) a
professional judiciary, committed to highstandards ofjudicial ethics; and (c) ajudiciary
capable o f efficient, effective dispute resolution. To createa results framework, using
informationinAnnex 2 o fthe PADthis reviewmaps component andoutputs to objectives. It
then examines ifthe project delivered the outputsthe PAD listed and ifthe results were
achieved. Becausethe PADlackedresults indicators, this review usesinternal Bank and
external opinion surveys to gather evidence onwhether the project achieved its objectives.

Independent Judiciary

2.18    The PAD expected that "the entire populationof Georgia, andinparticular the
business community and foreign investors, wouldbenefit from the presenceof an
independent andcompetentjudicial systemleading to the enforcement o fmore secure
propertyrights andcontractual obligations." (PAD,p.6).

2.19    This reviewdiscusses independenceintwo steps. First, basedon the text inthe PAD
itmapscomponents to the objective andusesthe performance indicators associatedwiththe
component to explore ifthere was anadvanceinthe objective sought. Second, it brings
together data from surveys andoutside sources to understandbetter howjudiciary
independencechanged over the period. Component B sought to produce a system o f"court
fiastructure wherein keyelementsreflect the new procedures o fanindependent andbetter
functioning judiciary, withanimprovedpublic perception o fthejudicial system. This
improvement inpublic perception is directly related to physicalcondition, architectural
design, andfacilities management andmaintenance." (PAD, p. 20). Component Fsought to
"raise appreciation among the Georgianpopulationabout the importance o fanindependent,
competent and equitablejudiciary" (PAD, p. 24)

2.20    Table 5 presentsoutput indicators for court infrastructure (component B) andpublic
education (component F) that t h s review mapsto the sub-objective of anindependent
judiciary. As aresult o fcosts savings inconstruction, 15 courts were rehabilitated, four more
thanthe 11courts planned. Theproject alsohelpedALPEto informthe public about the

    deliveredthe intendedoutputs but, asthe following paragraphsdiscuss, the evidence fiom
    surveys andreports o fexternal observers(eg, international NGOs) indicates that the
   judiciary inGeorgia still lacks independence.

    2.21       The project didnot succeed ininsulating thejudicial system from political pressure
    or to enhance legal protections to guarantee its independence. Inits reviewo fpolitical
    freedom inthe world, FreedomHouse concludes that thejudiciary was less independentin
    2007 thanin 1999 (Table 6). Similarly, inits review of economic freedom inthe world,
    the HeritageFoundationreportnotes that "Both foreigners andGeorgians continueto doubt
    thejudicial system's ability to protect private property and contract^".^ The Heritage
    Foundationreport finds that the protection o fproperty rights inGeorgia is low (with a
    rating o f30, where 100measuresthe highestprotection) andremained unchangedover the
    period. Moreover, an increasing number o f firms findthat contract violations constitute a
    problemfor doing business (see Table 11). Other data, discussed inthe following
    paragraphs, also point to ajudiciary that lacks independence.

    2.22       Indirect evidence drawn from public opinion surveys about how people perceive
    their political rights indicates that thejudiciary i s not independent. The surveys show that
    Georgians were less afraidto express theirpolitical views in2004 thanin2003 (See

 lowest since 2003. By2007 Georgianswere more afraidto expresstheir political views
 thanin2003, beforetheRoseRevolutiontook place. The secondlineinTable 7 has only
 one observation, for 2007. Ittells that 88 percent o f Georgians felt their humanrightswere
 violated or partially respectedbythe government. Because there i s not abaseline value this
 review cannot conclude that people felt their humanrights had deteriorated. Even so,
 88 percent is a large number, andit shows how people felt about their rights and their
 relationwith the government in2007. When people feel that they have few political and
 humanrights, it indicates that thepolice, courts, prosecutors andthejudicial system do not
 protect their rights. That normally happens whenthejudiciary lacks independence.

 2.23       Based onthe above discussion this PPARconcludes that the assistanceprovidedby
 the project didnot achieve the objective o fhelping develop anindependentjudiciary.

 A Professional Judiciary, Committed to High Standards of Judicial Ethics

 2.24       This section reviews aspects o fthe project related to its goal o fraisingthe
 professional and ethical standardso fthejudiciary. First, it looks at the outputs the project
  delivered.Second, it looks at indicators from surveys andstudies to draw insights on
 whether thejudiciary became moreprofessional andhadhigher ethical standards.

 2.25       Table 8 presentsthe informationrelated to indicators, outputs, baseline andtarget
 values for the components that supported the goals o fprofessionalism andethical
  standards. The review associates components DandEwith this objective. With Component
 Dthe Banksought to assistthe MOJin"becoming the legal entity inGeorgiafor legal
 drafting andlegal harmonization"; inachievingthis objective the M O Jwould develop
  "substantial capacities to provide for an adequatereview o flegislation andregulation
 preparedbythe Government" (PAD, p. 23). With component Ethe Banksupported the
 Judicial Training Center inorganizing andcarrying out thejudicial training function to

 2.26       Thejudicial trainingcomponent (Component E) supported the annual trainingo f
  about 320judges and 100court personnel. The ICR (p. iv) notes that a systemic training
 planwas executed; it also notesthat the PAD didnot includea systemic (or systematic)
 plan.Becausethe PADlackedindicatorso fanytype (even o fnumber o fpeopletrained) it

2.27       Aftertheproject closed, didGeorgiahave aprofessionaljudiciary, committedto
highstandardsofjudicial ethics? To answer the questionthis reviewpresents information
inTable 9 onhowthe Georgianpeopleperceivethejudiciary. Table 9presentstheresults
o fseveral surveys done over the years asking Georgians questions about their institutions,
the quality ofgovernment andpolitical freedoms. PanelA shows people's views in2006
and2007 onwhether thejudiciary should bereformed. Halfo frespondents think it should
bereformed, indicatingthat the system hasproblems, althoughtheir nature is not spelled
out inthe surveys. Panel B summarizes the responseso fpeople about which institutions
theytrust most and least. Their responsesshow two things. First, their confidence incourts
andtheprosecutor's office has declined buttheirtrust for the policehas increased
(probably a result o fthe reforms carried out inthe traffic police). Second, Georgians in
2007 placedthe courts andthe prosecutor's office close to the bottom quartile, while in
2004 theywere inthe third and second quartiles. These results show that component F
(public educatiodinformation) didnot achieve its goal ofbuildingtrust inthejudicial
system andincreasing the prestige o f judge^.^ Panel C presents rankingso finstitutions for
honesty andintegrity. Again, the numbers show that Georgians ranked low the integrity o f
courts andthe prosecutor's office andfelt that the courts andthejudiciary were less honest
andhadlessintegrity in2007 thanin 1998 and2004. PanelDpresents similar information
for the years 1998-2004 andits messagei s the same: Georgians had low opinions o fpolice,
prosecutors, courts andjudges.

2.28      Based on the above discussion, this PPARconcludes that the project didnot
achieve its objective o fdeveloping aprofessionaljudiciary, committed to highstandards of
judicial ethics.'




 Inacomment fromthe Region, there was disagreement with the interpretation ofthe survey results onthis
issue. It is assertedthat the survey results point instead to "government intervention in some highprofile
cases and interjected itselfinto court procedures inviolation o fthe separation o fpower".
 Elios Chabrava andNatia Kemertelidze ofthe GeorgianYoung Lawyers' Association (GYLA), after
analyzing various aspects ofthe judicial system, also conclude that the judiciary is not independent. See
Judiciary inGeorgia (draft), December 10, 2005.

A Judiciary Capable of Efficient, Effective DisputeResolution

2.29        This section looks at the third element o fthe objectives, ajudiciary capable o f
efficient andeffective dispute resolution. The components court administration
(component A), enforcement o f court judgment (component C), andcourt infrastructure
(Component B) supported this sub-objective. The court administration component sought
to assist thejudiciary "in (i)          the establishment o f a court administration system underthe
leadership o fbodies with adequaterepresentation o fthe three instances ofthe court system;
(ii)  implementationo fa modemcomputerized system o f casemanagement; and
(iii)  provision ofa system for audio recording o f court proceedings to ensure the integrity
ofcourt protocols." (PAD, p.17). Component Blacked an explicit linkto efficiency, butby
supporting a system o f court infrastructure that reflected abetter functioningjudiciary
(PAD,p.22) itcanbe arguedthat the component also sought efficiency gains inthe
judiciary. Table 10summarizes the informationabout the components and what they
achieved. Component C didnot have a specific objective, but reducing delays inthe
enforcement o fcourt decisions was a keyperformance indicator for it.

2.30       Looking at outputs, the project achieved 25 percent o fthe planned output inthe
court administration and case management system but exceededits goals ininfiastructure.
The PADdidnot define an output for component C, butthe component financed a
consultingcontract for the organization o fcourt enforcement (a sub-component o f
component A), a study tour to the U S in2001, training for bailiffs (delivered in2006) and
the purchase o f equipment for the headquarters o fthe Enforcement Department and
12regionalbureaus. The highturnover inthe Ministry o fJustice leadership (six ministers
duringthe credit's life) hindered implementationofthe component (ICR, p. 8). The
consultants produced ablueprint/master planfor improving court andcase administration
covering casemanagement, caseprocessing andchancery fictions, humanresources and
integrity management, court proceedings and enforcement, budgeting andfinance, and
governance and administrative recommendations. The impact o f component C is likely to
besmallbecauseit dependedon component A deliveringits output, whichwas only
25 percent ofits expected output. The ICRnotes that firms' perceptiono fthe courts' ability
to enforce decisions increased between 1999 and 2005, but at the same time acknowledges
that these indicators do not measure actual delays. Infact, BEEPS data show that courts
were slower in2005 than in 1999.

2.31       Fromthe outputs deliveredit is difficult to conclude that the project helpedmake
thejudiciary more efficient andcapable o fefficient andeffective dispute resolution. Ifthe
casemanagement system i s essential for raising efficiency, the impact on efficiency o f
rehabilitatingbuildings wouldbe limitedifthe management system is not inplace. A case
for impact couldbe made by saying that the credit helpedrehabilitate court buildings in
important cities (among others inTbilisi, Kutaisi, Telavi and Gori) andthat the

managementsystemwas operating insome ofthem.6 Because the project didnot collect
informationto determine impact this PPAR looks at evidence indicatingwhetherthe court
system increasedits efficiency duringthe years the project was active. The following
paragraphs look at this byusing information from various sources (e.g., surveys, NGO
reports) to convey anideao fwhat happened with the operation o fthe courts. Most o fthe
information is taken from BEEPS and deals with how businesses see the working o fthe
courts. While not directly related to project components, the indicatorspresentedbelow are
relevant for understandingpotential outcomes incase the project producedthem.

2.32      The following paragraphs summarize the views o ffirms onthejudiciary. Table 11
presentsthe responsesof f m s inthe BEEPS surveys onwhether thejudiciary constrained
doingbusinessinGeorgia. The numbersshow that firms considered thejudiciary more a
problemfor doingbusinessin2005 thanin1999, butfewer firms thought theyhadto use
bribesto dealwithcourts. Firmsalso saw a sharpincreaseincontract violations between
1999 and2005, pointingout towards increasedinefficiency inthejudicial system. Moreover,
the largenumber of firms that in2005 thought so (49 percent) indicates that this was a major
problemandthejudiciarywas not dealingwell with it.

2.33      Other indicators from BEEPS show amixedpicture o fjudicialperformance, with
some advancesbut also some steps backwards (see Table 12). Panel A presentsindicators on
the cost andefficiencyo fcourts. They show that o fallthe firms interviewedfewer felt courts
were more affordable andfaster in2005 thanin 1999(lines 1and2), butmore felt courts
were lesscorrupt in2005 than in 1999(line 3); Itis worth notingthat only28 percent o fthe
firms interviewed thought courts were honest. PanelBpresentsinformation on fairness and
abilityto enforce the law. Firmsfeel there was some small improvement inthe impartiality
andfairnesso fcourts (line 1); theyalsoperceived alarger improvement inthe courts
implementing laws ina consistent andpredictable way (line2), anda substantial one intheir
abilities to enforce their decisions (line 3). They also have more confidence that the legal
systemwill upholdcontract andproperty rights. Onthis latter point, two observations are
worth doing. First, as noted above, an increasing numbero f firms findthat contract
violations constitute aproblem for doing business (see Table 11). Second, the Heritage

buildings would not have been rehabilitated at all. To conclude about potential impact (upper bound) this
review assumes that is the case.

2.34         Summarizing, although some aspects o f thejudiciary seem to have improved, the
data from the surveys andthe project's outputs indicate that thejudiciary was not
necessarily better or more efficient inresolvingdisputes at the end o fthe period than at
the beginning. Even ifcourts are able to enforce their decisions they are notfaster or
affordable. Moreover, ifthe judiciary lacks independence, enhancing its ability to enforce
decisions does not guarantee that its decisions produce good outcomes.

2.35          Based on the above discussion, this PPARconcludes that the project partially
achieved its objective o fdeveloping ajudiciary capable o f effective andefficient dispute
resolution.

2.36        Regarding efficacy for the entire project this review concludes that the
government carried out most o fthe actions envisaged and delivered some o fthe outputs.
Itrehabilitated 15 court buildings, bought some computer hardwareand software, some
equipment for enforcing courtjudgments, and trained lawyers and court personnel.
ALPE carriedout its massmediacampaigns anddisseminationand outreach activities.
Well definedresults are not associated with these actions. It couldbe argued that the
infrastructure andhardware i s there, but that is not enough to conclude that the desired
outcome has been achieved. This review rates efficacy as modest.

EFFICIENCY
2.37        Neither the PADnor the ICR calculated net benefits or rates o freturn (economic
or financial) for the project, and the limitedindicators collected cannot be used for this
purpose. The information gathered indicates that duringproject implementation the
efficiency inrehabilitatingcourt infrastructurewas higher than planned (15 courts
rehabilitated vs. 11courts planned)but that for court administration was substantially
lower thanplanned(only 25 percent o f the case system was inplace at the end o f the
project). Project management took a larger share o fthe financing than the original plan
(8 percent vs. 4 percent) so efficiency was lower than expected. Little can be said about
the efficiency o fthe other components because o f the paucity o f information. This review
rates efficiency as modest.

OUTCOMERATING
2.38         The actions taken failed to make thejudiciary independent, professional and
committed to highethical standards. At best they partially helped thejudiciary to be
more effective and efficient inresolving disputes. This reviewrates the project outcome
as moderately unsatisfactory.

RISKTODEVELOPMENT                       OUTCOME(SUSTAINABILITY)
2.39         The project achieved few results, so the risk o f large losses is small. Whether the
outputs delivered (buildings, computers) can help produce future benefits depends on the
government's will to strengthen the judiciary, improve its performance andmake it more
independent. Inthe meantime, that i s not the case but the situation is unlikely to
deteriorate. First, the deterioration seems to have peaked in2005. Second, the
government has adopted a course geared towards European integration, which requires

improvementsinthe rule-of-law. Basedon these considerations, this report rates the risk

2.40    The Judicial ReformProject responded inpart to the Bank's strategy o f 1997but
also to a request from the government for the Bank to help its efforts o f improving the
judicial system. When the credit was approved the government had little revenue to
finance a larger budget for the judiciary. The project would fulfill that need and
guarantee financing for certain activities (e.g., training, rehabilitating court buildings).
Quality at entry was not satisfactory. Project objectives were ambitious andthe
interventions proposed were inadequate to achieve some of them (e.g. highethical
standards).

2.41    The Bankworked with the authorities, USAID, and GTZ, to design the project. It
ratedthe project risk as modest, and expected the project would close infour years. The
PAD pointedto some risk for the rehabilitationworks but none for implementingthe case
management system. Such assessment turnedout to be mistaken, because the design of
the infrastructure and case management components, about 75 percent o f the credit, had
to bereallocated almost immediately after project effectiveness. Duringexecution,
because o fthe high-risk status of Georgia's procurement system, the Bank also had to
reduce the procurement threshold for national competitive biddingo fworks from
US$500,000 to US$200,000. The Bank didnot address these risks, which existed at
entry, in an adequate manner.

2.42    The Bank staffed the supervisionmissions properly, andmet the requirements for
appropriate reporting andrecord-keeping, but fell short o fwhat could have been done.
Duringthe sevenyears o fproject implementationit didnot seek to havebetter outcome
indicators despite QAGreviews in2000 and2002 pointing out that the project lacked
measureable performance indicators. All ISRs marked as satisfactory the achievement o f
development objectives and implementationprogress, except the final two (6/27 and
6/28), which loweredbothratings to moderately satisfactory.

2.43    Based on these considerations this PPARrates Bank performance moderately
satisfactory.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
2.44    Borrower commitment with the project's objective declined soon after the project
became effective. It didnot provide the needed counterpart funds, andthe reforms it
carried out after the Rose Revolution were not linked with the project components and
outcomes. Despite these shortcomings, the General Department o f Courts achievedcost
savings that permitted to rehabilitate 15 courts instead o fthe 11planned, the Judicial
Training Center was established anddeliveredthe training, and ALPE delivered the
public education campaign andthe training for the media. Based on these considerations
thisPPARratesBorrower performancemoderately satisfactory.

Conclusions

2.45    Banksupport was effective indeliveringmost o fthe inputsplannedbut didnot
achieve its goal o fmaking the judiciary independent andprofessional, committed to high
standardsofjudicial ethics andcapable o f efficient, effective dispute. The project
delivered some o fthe outputs plannedbut these efforts didnot lead to the expected
results for, at least, two reasons. First, buildinginfrastructure (court buildings,
computers, others), while important, does not leadto betterjudicial decisions or a more
independent judiciary. Second, since 2001,while enforcement seems to have improved,
the executive branch continued controlling thejudiciary andthe existing system of
checks andbalances to limit its power was weak. Information gathered during field visits
supports the data from opinion surveys showing that the judicial system does not enjoy
credibility with the general public and that its reputationi s low and declining.

incentive structure for the private sector development." Table 14shows the objectives in
detail.

3.2         Relevance. The objectives were relevant given Georgia's problems in 1999 and
the Bank's strategy (CAS o f September 1997). In1998 weak public finances andthe
shocks from the Russian economic crisis portendedan economic crisis for Georgia. In
early 1999, the fiscal outlook deteriorated, inpart a result ofits small tax base but also of
a weak and corrupt tax administration. Low revenues affected the level and composition
of expenditures, with social expenditure falling as part o fthe retrenchmentingovernment
expenditure. Poverty was widespread. Pensions and government salaries were paid late,
and their realpurchasingpower was minimal. Unable to pay for the expenditure, the
government built large arrears, inparticular to the health sector. Georgia continuedbeing
an overregulated state, creating large costs and impedingthe entry and growth o f firms.
Last, a largegroup of enterprises continued under government ownership and delivered
poor services. Privatizingthem, it was expected, would benefit consumers andmake the
enterprises more productive.

3.3         The credit objectives and its components fitted into the priorities ofthe Bank's
FY98 strategy. The objectives correspond to those o f the strategy, which hadmore
optimistic projections o fmedium-to-long-term growth thanthe project document

                                                     20


(See Table 12). When discussing relevance, the President's report said that "The policy
reforms supportedby SAC I11are also necessary (emphasis added) to the success o f Bank
investment operations", and listed six operations whose results dependedon the SAC3.
(par. 59, Report No. 7316-GE).'

3.4      Conditions and Dates. The program consisted o f 18 core conditions that hadto
be met to disburse the second and third tranches.' Most o f them consisted ofpreparing
action plans, issuingreports, adopting and amending laws and legal codes, preparingand
establishing a regulatory report for the port sub-sector, and preparingand executing an
action planto address problems identified ina report on the business environment carried
out by the EnlargedInvestmentCouncil. Some conditions sought to have more
immediate impact. One established that the budget executed in 1999 and 2000 meet the
standards agreed uponwith IDA. Another requested submitting evidence satisfactory to
IDAshowing that public procurement for state orders hadbeencarried out insubstantive
compliance with the Law on State Procurement.

3.5      The credit, approved inJune 29, 1999 was to bedisbursed inthree tranches, and
was expected to close by December 31,2000. Because o f delays inmeeting the
conditions, the closing date was extended three times andthe credit closed on October 30,
2002. The first tranche was disbursed on August 2, 1999, the second one on December
26,2001, and the third one on October 17,2002.

 Outcomes

 3.6     The project document didnot present indicators o f results associated with the
conditions. Despite this shortcoming, because the credit closed three years later than
planned, it ispossible to look at some plausible results the credit mighthave contributed
to during 1999-2002. Because the credit's structure reflects that o f the CAS FY98, this
report uses some o f the CAS results indicators to establish whether the credit's objectives
were met. This report looks at results. The formal conditions, like preparing action
plans,were met, andAnnex Table 1presents themtogether with their status and
 output/outcome indicators.

 GENERALOBJECTIVE:SATISFACTORY MACROECONOMIC                               FRAMEWORK

 3.7     The project document left undefinedwhat constitutes a satisfactory
`macroeconomic framework. To obviate this problem, this report compares the values for
the indicators listed inthe CAS FY98 andthe projections for economic aggregates inthe
President's Report with their actual values in 1999-2002 (See Table 15)."




  The projects were Health (FY96), Agricultural Development(FY97), Municipal Development and
Decentralization (FY98), Power Rehabilitation(FY97), Oil Institution Building(FY98) and Transport LIL
(FY99).
9 The legal credit agreement lists 18 actions (Schedule 2) for tranches 2 and 3. Maintaining a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework is a general condition for this type o f credits (Section 2.01.do f Article I1o f
credit agreement) as well as carrying out the actions described inRecital A o f the preamble.

  Column 5 summarizes whether the results were achieved. The information shown and
 the assessmentof column 5 show that some results were met. GDP growth exceeded by a

  shows the annual values of these variables).

major concern o f the Bank's support, didnot reach the levels expected, affecting
government expenditure, which fell by about 3 percentage points ofGDP. The deficit
also fell, but the government borrowed from the central bank an amount equivalent to
0.7 percent o f GDP per year. The President's Report mentions credit to the government
from the centralbank and the banking system as condition o f effectiveness but neglected
to set a target value for the second and third tranches. Other conditions for the
macroeconomic framework were treated inthe same casual manner as domestic credit.

OBJECTIVEI:REDUCE          MACROECONOMIC        IMBALANCES

3.9        This objective consisted o fthree sub-objectives: improve revenue mobilization,
strengthen expenditure management, and ensure the provision ofbasic social services.

3.10       Improve revenue mobilization. Government revenue changed little over this
period, as the numbers inTable 16 show. Tax revenues edged up a bit but non-tax
revenues declined. The authorities stopped collecting more taxes in2002, and reduced
their collection in2003. Becausetax collection and, more generally, revenue
mobilization does not show an increasing trend, this review concludes that the credit did
not achieve the objective.

3.11 Strengthenexpenditure management. The actions the credit supported sought to
reorganize the Ministryo fFinance (MOF), establishjob definitions for each post,
establish three coordinating groups, andcarry out other measures ofthe same tenor.
While some o fthese actions may have beencarried out, little was achieved interms o f
expenditure management. Important measures such as establishing a Single Treasury
Account (STA), happened only inearly 2006, and the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) was produced in2005. Although government expenditure declined
as percent of GDP, probably leading to a better use o f fiscal resources, this reflects a
large decline ingovernment employment inthe budgetary sector (about 120,000 jobs),
not necessarily a better administration.

3.12       Ensure theprovision of basic social services. The credit sought to protect
expenditures on health and education and poverty benefits, setting as condition that the
government would allocate 13 and 7.3 percent o fthe overall consolidatedbudget to the
education andhealth sectors in 1999 and2000. For poverty benefits it set as condition
that the budget shouldbe 14.3 million Lari in 1999 and at least constant inreal terms
(relative to 1999) for 2000. Table 17 show that the credit didnot achieve its objective.
The minutes o fnegotiations o fthe credit detail how the conditionwas met. For health it

gathered expenditures from different organizations (Ministryo f Health, Ministry o f
Defense, Ministry o f Internal Affairs, Ministry o f Security, Academy o f the Ministryo f
Security, Department o f Veterans, Department o f Invalids, State Medical Insurance
Company, and local budgets). While this creative accountingmade it possible to meet the
condition in 1999,it didnot solve the fundamental problem o f the budget for health (ICR,
p. 7):the mainprovider o fhealth services inGeorgia, the Ministry o fHealth, receiveda
small budget allocation. Accepting such accounting standards underminedthe purpose o f
the condition. The IMF followed different standards and it reports the same level o f
expenditure as this PPAR does inTable 15                          .'*

DEVELOPMENT

3.13    This objective consisted o fthree sub-objectives: (a) introducing a simplified and
transparent licensingregime; (b) reducingthe cost o f entry, especially for small business;
and (c) introducing atransparentregime to regulate state procurement, control
procurement expenditures, and enable private companies to compete for Government
orders. Because sub-objectives (a) and (b) are closely linked, this report treats them in
the section on licensingandcost o fentry.

3.14    Simpli&ing licensing and reducing cost of entry. The credit asked for drafting
and approving new laws andregulations, and changing and simplifying existing ones.
Perhaps more important, the conditions demanded abolishingthe requirement o f
obtaining a stamp or seal from the local police, eliminatingthe active role of the
Department o f Statistics inthe registration process, and eliminating the requirement that
anynewbusiness hadto obtain a seal from the CentralBank to open anewbank account.
The matrix o f conditions inthe President's Report requiredfollow-up surveys in
December 1999 and every three months thereafter to measure the impact o f licensing
reform. No information is available on whether the quarterly surveys were carried out.
The ICR andthe project status reports (PSR) are silent on this issue, and the Bank did not
know what impact the credit hadat the time of closing. This report, therefore, uses
information from opinion surveys (done by GORBI) and World Bank surveys (BEEPS
andDoingBusiness) to determine ifthe environment for businesses improved.

3.15    Table 18 indicates that the situation related to business licensing deteriorated in
1996-99 but improvedby 2002; still, 26 percent o f firms believedthat business licensing
was a problem. About 45 percent o f firms answered in 1999 that bribery was frequent,
but only 20 percent didso in2002. Regarding customs regulations firms thought the
situation deteriorated between 1996 and 2002, but the frequency o fbribery declined.
Firms saw tax administration as a major problem over the period; by 2002, 85 percent o f
them felt that tax administration was a problem. Besides suffering the tax administration,
about 25 percent o f firms hadto pay bribes in2002, although less than the 40 percent
they paid in 1999. Summarizing, between 1999 and 2002 the burden from licensing
decreasedbut that from customs andtax administration rose.

3.16    Regulationshad a relatively highcost for firms, as senior management spent
much ofits time dealing with the authorities rather than managingthe companies. Over
timethis burdenon managers declined. In1999 managers spent upto 50percent o ftheir
time negotiating with officials about changes and interpretation o f laws and regulations,
but in2002 they spent only 12percent o ftheir time.

3.17    Despitethese improvements the regimefor business licensing didnot improve.
Whenthe government triedto simplify regulations and licensing, like in 1999, the
proliferationo fnewrequirements at the local level undermined the laws passed. As a result,
in2002theburdenofregulationwaspervasive. A studydocumentingthe2005 reforms to
the licensing andregulatory regimesays that "the 2002 Law on Grounds for Issuanceo f
Licenses andPermits for Entrepreneurial Activities madesome cosmetic changesto bringthe
regime inlinewithEuropeanprinciples. But the law didnot simplify any o fthe licensing

hurdlesfacing entrepreneurs. Morethan900business activities still requireda license."12 In
2005, according to DoingBusiness, Georgia ranked152 out o f 155 countries on dealing with
licenses.

3.18         Procurement. The credit sought to support the establishment o fa transparent regime
to regulate stateprocurement, controlprocurement expenditure, andenableprivate
companies to compete for government orders on a levelplaying field. To achieve this
objective the credit required the government to enact anew law on stateprocurernent
(adopted inDecember 1998, enactedbyParliamentinJuly 1999, andamendedinMarch
2001), issueregulations to implement the law, staffthe new procurement agency, trainits
personnel,preparebiddingdocuments, and, not later thanDecember 1999, carry out a
biddingwiththe newproceduresinthe three largestprocuringagenciesat central andlocal
levels.

3.19         This effort achieved little. The first Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR, 2002) foundthat "With the notable exception o fenforcement provisions, the scope
o f existingGeorgian legal instruments would be adequate to control the procurement
process inGeorgia, ifthey were widely followed. The mainissue i s not the lack o f
legislationbut rather the effective application o fthe legislationthat is already inplace."

not be enough" (CPAR, page 38). The report rankedGeorgia as a "high-risk (emphasis
added) country inrespect o fits public procurement system" (Ibid.). A second CPAR
(2007) concludes that "Progress towards improving public procurement has beenlimited
for the past few years. [2002-2007]".'4 The high-risk rankingstill stands.

OBJECTIVE111:REFORMLAND                             OWNERSHIP
3.20      The credit sought to reform landownershipwith the purposeof stimulating
agricultural production andthe development ofreal estate and financial markets.It sought
to achieve this objective by supporting the registration ofprivatizedagricultural and
enterprise land, by amendinglaws (to promoteprivatizationover leasing), delimitingthe
roles ofthe relevant public bodies, andthe issuingofregulations andoperatingprocedures
for agricultural landtitling registration system.

3.21       The ICR for the SAC3 ratesthe outcome for this component as highlysatisfactory
because, among other things, landregistrationwas carried out for 3,000 enterprises. This
PPARlooks at agricultural productionandthe development offinancialmarkets, which the
credit expectedto influence. Table 19 shows that during 1999-2002, total agriculturaloutput
(Panel I) about six percent, a combination of a 20 percent decline incrop output and
             declined
an 11percent increaseinlivestock production. The volume ofcrop harvested (Panel                                                       n)
declined from 2.5 milliontons to about 2.1 milliontons. The credit didnot achieve its
objective o fincreasing agricultural production. This was an ambitious goal for what the
project supported. A goodmonitoring andevaluation framework mighthavehelpedproduce
morerealistic goals andto connect thembetter to the interventions the credit supported.

3.22         Well definedproperty rights anddeveloped real estatemarketsmaycontribute in
providinggoodcollateral andsecurity to banks. Registeringthe landfor 3000enterprises
could give companies some security over their land, but its overall impact was probably
small. First small companies constituted the bulkofprivatizedcompanies. Second, in
Georgia a title to apiece o flanddoesnot guaranteethat the propertyrights ofthe owner are
or will be respe~ted.'~ sum, although registeringthe landto 3000 enterprisesmightbe a
                                      In
worthy goal initself, inthe Georgiancontext the link between landregistration and financial
 sector growth seems to have beenweak at best.16

 3.23        The project document also failedto specify the expectedimpact on financial markets.
Most likely, this impact, ifany, was negligiblegiventhe relatively small numberof
 enterprisesfor which landwas to be registered. Table 20 presents standard indicators o f
 financial sector development which this PPARpresentsanddiscussesfor completeness.
Normally, the growtho fbroad money (M2) andcredit to the privatesector-both expressed
 as aproportionofGDP - depends mostlyon economicgrowth, level o fincome, inflation and
 confidence inthe domestic currency. During 1999-2002 Georgia controlled inflation and
 addressedexternal shocksto provide stability to the Larirelativeto the U S dollar andeuro.
As economic stability took hold, people's confidence inthe Lariincreasedandtheir demand
 for moneyincreased, drivingM2/GDPup. The increaseindeposits allowedthe banks to
 expand credit to the privatesector andincreasetheir asset base. As banksstrengthened,
 competition increased, andconfidence returned,real andnominal interest rates decreasedas
well as the banks' intermediation margin(lending ratesminus savings rate). These
 developments explain to a large extent the performance o fthe financial sector during
 1999-2002.

 l5 The International Crisis Group (ICG) discusses, among other issues, the problemo frespect for property
rights inits report Georgia: Sliding TowardsAuthoritarianism, Europe Report No. 189, December 19,
 2007. Among the people the mission interviewed inGeorgia there was wide consensus about insecure
property rights, arbitrary behavior o f the authorities and, insome cases, fear ofregistering property heldby
 families for generations becausethey might lose it.Moreover, the rapid growth o f the financial sector since
 2004 despite weak property rights underminesthe idea that registering land was essential for its growth.
 l6A report accompanying a BTOR o fJune 18, 1998, for the SAC3 identification mission discusses the
 financial sector as one o fthe constraints to private sector growth. The report discusses the factors that
 influence the availability o f finance, but does not mention specifically the issue of landrights of enterprises
 as a constraint; it does mention, though, "the ability to usebusiness assets to finance growth". See Georgia:

OBJECTIVE     Iv:DIVESTITUREFROMPRODUCTIVEACTIVITIES
3.24     The credit sought to promotethe privatization o fcompanies and activities owned
or managed bythe state. It tried to do it by: (a) promoting private participation in
infrastructure; (b) facilitating the overall privatization program(to provideadequate
coordination andencouragement for potential investors); and (c) completing privatization
o fmediudlarge enterprises (non-infrastructure). The credit expected to complete the
transfer o fviable enterprises andproductive assets to private-sector owners and managers
as rapidly, transparently, and profitably as possible. Inaddition, the credit also sought to
improve the efficiency and quality o f health infrastructure andservices by optimizing the
use o f existingresources.

3.25     Promotingprivateparticipation in infrastructure andfacilitating the overall
privatizationprogram. The credit achieved its immediate objectives of creating the legal
conditions to permit the privatization of companies intelecommunications andports.
The government prepared the strategy andregulatory framework to restructure Poti Port
andthe telecommunications sector. Despite changes inlegislationandregulatory
framework, the business climate deteriorated.

3.26     Completingprivatization of medium and large enterprises. The credit achieved
its objective o fhaving the government privatize about 270 companies slated inthe
program as well as liquidate or start bankruptcy procedures for 14others. It i s unlikely
that the objective ofprivatizing mediumand large enterprises, as the credit sought, was
achieved. First, although the program had closed in October 2002, the 761 companies
privatized in2003 were all small companies, which somewhat indicates the government's
reluctance to divest o fmedium-to-large size companies. Second, total revenues from the
sales o f the 270 companies reached $1.5 million, 3.3 percent o f the revenues collected
from privatization during 1999-2002 (See Table 21). The average price per company
soldwas US$5,555 (US$1.5 million/270), below the price o f $12,180 paid on average for
each o fthe 3,835 companies sold during 1999-2002; therefore, it is quite unlikely that the
companies sold under the Bank's programwere larger thanthose sold outside it. During
this period the government didnot pursue privatization of medium-to-large companies
forcefbllyjudgingbywhat happened in2004-2005: intwo years the government sold
about halfo f the number o f companies sold in 1999-2002and the dollar revenues from it
were six times higher (last column).

3.27     Two reasons explain the failure to sell large companies during 1999-2002. First,
the absence o fpolitical will. Second, the appalling business climate the government
created, with widespread corruption, disregard for the rule o f law andthe harassment o f
firms and their managers. Few investors were willing to invest inGeorgia because o f the
large risks involved. As an example, the government issued international tenders for the
sale o f shares inGeorgia Telecommunications and Georgia Electro Communications, but
no one applied to purchase them. The government only sold one large company: Telasi,
the Tbilisi electricity distribution company, to AES, an American company. Later, AES
had to sell Telasi because the government didnot support its efforts to collect the
electricity bills nor obliged the generating companies to supply it with electricity.

3.28         Health infrastructure. The credit sought a government action planto restructure
hospitals inTbilisi andthe satisfactory implementationo f a hospitalrestructuring
program. Neither the President's Report, nor the credit agreement nor the I C R specify if
the restructuringprogram was national or restrictedto Tbilisi. The government closed
12hospitals inTbilisi inthe first phase o f the hospital restructuringplanbut legal and
political challenges preventedrestructuring as planned. First, a court decision rescinded
the second phase o frestructuring inTbilisi. Second, the number of hospitals inGeorgia
increased at a time when the government was laying-off medical personnel (physicians
andparamedics) and reducingthe supply o fbeds (See Table 22). Government efforts to
privatize hospitals at the time did not succeed. The ICR notes that "Four facilities were
selected for privatization, but none has attracted intere~t"'~.The number o fbeds declined
by some 4,200 o fwhich about 1,000 (24 percent) the credit supported. Medicalpersonnel
also declined, by about 6,500, o fwhich about 900 (some 14percent) the credit supported.
In summary, the credit seems to havebeen effective inreducing some elements o fthe
physical and technical infrastructure o fthe system. It didnot succeed inthe hospital
restructuringprogram because the number o f hospitals increased.

3.29        Summarizing, the project helpedthe governmentmaintain a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework. The project also helpedthe government to carry out some
reforms inlandownership and divest from some small state-owned enterprises but it
failed inachieving its objective o f creating an environment favorable to the private
sector. The overall efficacy o fthe credit i s negligibleand its outcome unsatisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation

3.30        The credit lacked a monitoring andevaluation framework, andits matrix o f
actions inAnnex 1 ofthe program document (Report No. P-73 16-GE) did not present
outcome indicators associated with them. This PPARrates the quality ofmonitoring and
evaluation as negligible.

Ratings

3.31        Relevance. The project sought to help solve important problems Georgia faced at
the time. These were relevant for the country and consistent with the Bank's CAS. This
report rates the relevance o fproject objectives as substantial.

3.32        Ef$cacy and Outcome. The government carried out most o fthe actions envisaged
intheprogrambutthey failedto produceresults becausemost ofthemconsisted of
procedural conditions (e.g., preparing action plans, submitting laws to Parliament). The
government failed to implementthe actions that could have produced results (e.g.,
allocate andexecute the budget for health and education). When the government put for
sale Georgia Telecommunicationsno one applied to buy it because the country had a bad
business climate. Insummary, the credit didnot achieve the benefits sought bythe
credit: "to maintain the momentum o freforms anddeepen the reform process inkey areas
essential to the sustainability of growth." The PPARrates the efficacy as modest, andthe
outcome associated with the credit as moderately unsatisfactory. Table 23 summarizes
the ratings for efficacy and outcome.

3.33        Risk to Development Outcome (Sustainability). The government's interest in
structural reform diminishedin 1999, the year the credit was approved. The weak
conditionality shows the Bank's impotence ingetting the government to accept

                                                    31


conditions tied to results. The government maintained, up to a point, a reasonable
macroeconomic policy. It prevented a surge ininflation, dealt with the external crisis
swiftly, and cut expenditures to prevent the fiscal deficit from exploding. It also
accumulated arrears of about 0.7 percent o f GDP per year andborrowed from the NBG
0.7 percent o f GDPper year, which increasedthe monetarybase (B)by about 12 percent
per year, forcing NBGto keep a tight monetary policy to check the expansion o f credit."
Over the periodthe moneymultiplier for M2 and M 3 (M2/B, M3/B) averaged 0.94 and
1.6, indicating how tight monetary policy was. The tight policy kept inflation low but
caused the highreal lendingrates that contributed to the slow growth. The government
showed its determinationto keep inflation incheck but also its weakness incomingto
grips with its fiscal problems, inpart a result o f the vested interests within the
administration that profited from the fisc.lg The risk to development outcome at the time
of credit closure is rated as high.

3.34    Bank Performance. The Bank diagnosed the situation well ina document that set
the basis for the credit, benefitingfrom analytical work done up to that moment.20The
conditions o f the credit portended the course o f the reforms and the credit's eventual
failure. The credit imposed a large number o f conditions that lacked substantive impact
andresults indicatortiedto them (See Annex Table 1). The authorities could meet the
conditions and maintain the status quo. Evenwith suchbenigntreatment, the
government didnot meet the conditions on time andthe Bank extendedthe closing date
o fthe credit three times, from December 31,2000 to October 30,2002. Despite these
problems, the Bankrated satisfactory the project development objectives every time it
supervised it. Despite evidence that corruption was growing andthe respect for the rule
o f law dwindling, the Bank designed a credit that missed the essential condition for
success: enforcement, for which the government hadno appetite. Despite its knowledge
o f the country the Bank failed to produce a sensible group o f indicators that could help
monitor performance and evaluate impact. With the conditions agreed to, the Banktook
a gamble on reform and lost it.Bankperformance i s rated unsatisfactory.

3.35    Borrower Performance. The government wanted the funds from the Bank but not
the results that Bank lending was seeking. The government met the conditions o fthe
credit but didnot follow through to produce the results that Bank support sought. Most
conditions were proceduralbut to meet them it took the government two years beyond the
original closing date. The government either opposed reform or had lost control o fthe
state apparatus. Whichever is correct, the government ceasedbeing a reliable partner,
andits performance has to beratedunsatisfactory.

4. ReformSupport Credit

Project Objectives and Their Relevance

4.1      Objectives. The Reform Support Credit (Credit No.3937-GEYJuly 1,2004)
provided assistanceto the government ina first phase o f efforts "to define and launch a
boldprogram o f economic, legal, and social reforms" (PresidentReport No. 28548-GE,
May 27,2004, p. i).      The credit supported actions to (i)       improve governance and anti-
corruption; (ii)  improve public financial management; and (iii) crucial issues in
                                                                            resolve
the energy sector. Although not stated explicitly, the credit also supportedthe
government's efforts at protectingthe vulnerable (Annexes 1and2 of the President
Report); this objective was part ofthe structural reform agenda pertinent to the credit and
to IDA'Ssubsequent adjustment operations bar. 16 o fReport).

4.2      Relevance. The objectives were relevant inview o fthe problems Georgia had in
2004. Corruption was rampant and governance low. Tax collection had stagnated, the
MinistryofFinancehadinadequate control over revenuesand expenditures; mechanisms
o f control and audit of financial flows were ineffective. Pensions were paid late, and
their realpurchasingpower minimal. Electricitywas amajor problem: customers didnot
paytheir bills, blackouts were long andfi-equent, andthe debt o fthe power sector was
large and growing. Poverty was widespread, with estimates rangingfi-om27 to 51
percent. The credit pursuedobjectives inline with the CAS FY98 andwith the CPS
FY06. The objectives were also coherent with the government's agenda, stated inthe
Economic Development and Poverty ReductionProgram (EDPRP, June 2003) andthe
poverty reduction strategy papers.

4.3      Componentsand Conditions. The credit was approved inJune 24,2004,
disbursed inAugust 19,2004 and closed inDecember 31,2004. The program consisted
o fnine core conditions and other non-core conditions expected to help achieve the
credit's objectives and sub-objectives (See Table 24).2' Most o f the core conditions
consisted ofpreparing action plans, issuing reports, adopting laws and legal codes, and
establishing a commission with the mandate to promote improvements inthe business
environment (See Annex Table 3). Two conditions sought to have more immediate
impact. The first asked for the Customs Department to eliminate requirements for (a) the
internaltransit document and (b) the non-excise consignment to travel inconvoy. The
second one asked for the government to put into operation the automated systems for
customs data (ASYCUDA).




21The legal credit agreement lists 10actions (Schedule 2) andthe ICR lists 10core actions. Maintaining a
satisfactory macroeconomic framework i s a general condition for this type o f credits (Recital B o f the
Preamble to the credit agreement) as well as carrying out the actions described inRecital A o fthe
preamble.

4.4         The credit lacked an adequateresults framework. Inmost cases the indicators
corresponded to inputs and outputs, and inothers the results were not well defined or the
logic linkingactions andresults was unclear. For example, inthe adoption o f the
ASYCUDA system the program document selected as the outcomeindicator the
simplification of customs requirements but did not go beyondthis (e.g., processingtime
or losses ofmerchandise incustoms). Inthe case o f electricity, the outcome associated
with the actionplan was animproved financial situation o fthe power companies, but the
report didnot specify what that situation could be or when it could be achieved. Inwhat
follows, this report presents informationthat gives abetter idea o fthe credit's potential
impact.

Outcomes

GENERALOBJECTIVE:SATISFACTORY                            MACROECONOMIC          FRAMEWORK
4.5         The credit seems to have accepted the PRGFprogram [agreed between the IMF
andthe government] for 2004-2008 as a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. Its
main elements were:

      e     Annual GDP growth: 6 percent for 2004 and 5 percent afterwards
      e     CPIinflation: 5.8 percent for 2004 and5 percent afterwards
      e     Annual tax revenue increase: 1.6 percentage points o f GDP for 2004 and 1
            percentage points annually afterwards
      e     Expenditure and net lending: gradual increase from 20.5 percent o f GDP to about
            25 percent o f GDP during2004-08
      e     Broadmoney growth: gradual decrease from 19.5 percent to 13.9 percent during
            2004-08.

4.6         Overall, this objective can be considered met based on these criteria (see
Table 25). The results for growth, tax collection, and external debt exceeded the goals o f
the program. Arrears to pensioners and government employees fell by more than three
percent o f GDP. The authorities failed to meet their goals ininflation andmoney growth,
andmet their goals for fiscal balance andcurrent account balance in2004 but not in
2005-06. The growth intax revenues financed more expenditure than the program

                                                      35


envisioned; whether surpassingthe goal i s a good result depends, ultimately,on whether
that expenditure produces more benefits than ifthe private sector haddone it.

OBJECTIVE1:STRENGTHENINGGOVERNANCE,                         ANTI-CORRUPTION AND PUBLIC
SECTOR MANAGEMENT
4.7       This objective consisted of three sub-objectives:

          Formulating, Implementing, andMonitoringan Anti-Cormption Strategy;
          Improving Governance through AdministrativeKivil Service Reform; and
          Improving Governance to Promote Private Sector Development

4.8       Formulating, Implementing, and Monitoring an Anti-Corruption Strategy. The
credit requiredthe government to design an anti-corruption strategy and implement its
recommendations, after submitting a report on the actions taken regardinganti-
corruption. Submittingthe report was a condition o fthe credit while preparing the
strategy was one indicator the Bankwould monitor. The government approved the anti-
corruption strategy on June 24,2005 andthe actionplan inSeptember 2005.22 Onthis



22 Presidential Decree No. 550, June 24,2005, Tbilisi, on the Approval of Georgia's NationalAnti-
corruption Strategy; Government Ordinance #377, September 12,2005, Tbilisi, on the approval of
Georgia's National Anti-Corruption Strategy Implementation Action Plan.

   score, the credit met its immediate objective. The credit also supported actions to reduce
   corruption and improve the functioning of Customs, as well as revisions to the Law on
   Conflict o f Interests inPublic Service. Did subsequentactions reduce corruption?23 To
   answer, this report looks at the status of anti-corruption institutions and legislation, at the
   regulations and practices on conflict o f interests, and at the perceptions o fbusiness
   people and the public at-large about the extent and practice o f corruption inthe country.
   Table 26 presents data on anti-corruption institutions and conflicts o f interest, from
   surveyconducted by GlobalIntegrity, anNGO, and from BEEPSon how corruption
   affects businesses.

   4.9      Anti-corruption and conflicts of interest. Panels A andB o f Table 24 inform
   about the quality o f institutions ando f organizations that deal with corruption and
   conflicts o f interests.24 The ratings and scores inPanel A show weakeninganti-
   corruption institutions andorganizations because three o fthe four components ofthe
   index deteriorated. Georgia has good anti-corruption laws but weak enforcement by the
   anti-corruption agency, thejudiciary and the police. The anti-corruption agency lacks
   independenceandresources to conduct its tasks. Thejudiciary also lacks independence,
   and inpractice neither thejudiciary nor the law enforcement agencies are protected from
   political interferen~e.~~    As regardsconflict o finterest the situation deteriorated between
   2006 and 2007. The regulations governing conflict o f interest weakened because they are
   not effective inpractice. Inits survey on Georgia, Global Integrity considers that the
   regulations governing gifts and hospitality offered to members o f the executive branch
   were not applied in2007 andwere partially applied in2006. It also finds that the asset

I  disclosure records o f the executive branch (ministersand above) were not audited in
   2007. Citizens can access the records o fthe heads o f the state and government, and it can
   take from 10days to one month to get the information requested.

   4.10     Anti-corruption and its impact on business. Panels C andDpresent indicators
   that show the practical impact on businesses o f government actions to streamline
   regulations and improve the operations o f customs andthe tax offices. The information
   compares the views o f firms in2002 and 2005 reported inBEEPS. Firms feel that
   business licensingimproved, as the percent o fthose reporting it as a problem fell from
   26 percent to 23 percent. Regarding regulations on customs and taxes fewer firms
   believe they were a problem in2005 than in2002. That should be expected, because in
   June 2005 Parliament approved a new law on Licensing andPermits that reducedtheir
   number from 950 to 150. For customs the percent o f firms that see them as a problem
   fell from 40 to 29 and for tax administration the numbers fell from 84 to 23 percent.
   Because o f fewer regulations senior management spends less time negotiating changes
   andinterpretationo flaws andregulations, 12percent o ftheir time in2002 and 5 percent
   in2005.

     4.11 Better regulations and simplifiedprocedures reducedthe incidence o fbribery.
     The percentage o f firms respondingthat unofficial payments were frequent fell from
     38 to 7 between 2002 and 2005, andfrom 24 to 10 for customs, from 44 to 11for tax

    that the share o f annual sales paid inbribes fell from 2.7 percent in2002 to about
     0.5 percent in2005. Although businesses note a reduction incorruption, the public at
     large believes that corruption i s still a problem. Ina poll conducted inJune 2006 on
    behalfo f the EU, 39 percent o fthose polled believed that the money collected by tax

4.12    Summarizing, corruption declined after 2004, despite the deterioration o f the anti-
corruption agency and the weak enforcement capacity o fthe state. Suchresult suggests
the needto streamline and simplifyregulations, havingthe desire to fight corruption and
creating the capacity to do it. It is not clear that establishingorganizations will reduce it.27

4.13    Administrative and Civil ServiceReform. The Bank had identified civil service
reform as a second element to improve governance. Again, the approach consisted o f
supporting legislation to define the structure, functions andresponsibilities o f the new
agency, and asking the government to designate an administrative agency incharge o f
oversight and implementingcivil service reform. The program also requested a report
from the Development and ReformFund, an entity established at the initiative o f the
President o f Georgia to promote reforms inpublic administration, andmanage the
reforms and the civil servants' and students're-training. Resources from the Foundation
would complement the salaries o f civil servants while the government increased its
revenues and could pay better salaries.

4.14    After the new president took over inJanuary 2004 the government carried out
reforms to the civil service andto the structure o fthe public sector. It presentedto
Parliament a law on the Structure, Functions and Responsibilities of Government that
Parliament approved. The government created the Civil Service Bureau inOctober 2004,
and its main functions consisted ofdoing research on civil service, implementing relevant
legislative acts, coordinating humanresource management andtraining. As part of the
reformthe government abolished four o fthe 18 ministries and abolished or merged 18
agencies o fthe central government. Between January 2004 and July 2005, the staff o f
10representative agencies fell 18 percent.28 The number o freorganizations per agency
averaged 2, varying from six inthe customs department to one inthe Ministries of Labor
andEducationand inthe DepartmentofCustoms. Total employment inthe public
administration declined from 87400 in2004 to 78600 in2006. The reforms were
accompanied by frequent reshuffles o fpersonnel andministers, changes whose impact on
the integrity o f civil service reform is hardto assess.

4.15    Improvingthe civil service requirespatience andperseverance. Despite the
changes reported, the integrity o fthe civil service is still weak. Global Integrity, an
NGO, ratedas very weak the regulationsgoverning the civil service andweak those
relatedto whistle-blowing (See Table 27). Global Integrityrates as very weak the

4.16        The government made an effort to improve the remuneration o f civil servants
while it was reducingemployment inthe public sector. It created a quasi-fiscal fund, the
Reform and Development Fund, capitalizedwith donations fi-om the private sector. In
2004 the Fundcomplementedthe salaries o f about 120,000 civil servants for a total o f
US$14 million. The contribution fell in2005, when extra paymentsto 34,000 civil
servants reached US$5 million and ended in2006 whenthe Fundcomplemented the
salary o f 337 civil servants for a total of 80,000 dollars. The Fundi s now anNGO andits

governance to promoteprivate sector development. This sub-objective was part o f a
circular reasoning saying that the way to improve governance was to improve
governance. Leaving this point o f inconsistency aside, this report evaluates ifthe actions
the government took in2004-2006 improved conditions for the private sector.

documents andnon-excise consignment to travel inconvoy. The credit expected that the
costs to establish and operate a business would fall, andtransit traffic andcustoms
revenue would increase. Table 28 presents indicators relatedto these results. Group 1
shows that the government has taken steps to reduce the cost (intheory) o f doing
business as measured by the Bank's Doing Business reports. The associated costs fell in
four o fthe six indicators listed: starting a business, dealing with licenses, registering
property and enforcing contracts. Firms still spend the same amount o ftime to pay taxes
and close a business.

4.20        Transport costs have fallen, both for the elimination o ftravel documents and the
government's attack on corruption inthe transit police. Transit police stopped extorting
drivers after the government fired all the officers inthe force, hirednew ones, and
monitored their performance. The credit didnot support actions on the transit police, but
fightingcorruption inthat group had a large impact on transport costs. Itis estimated that

                                                    41


transport costs between Poti port and the border with Azerbaijan fell from US$300to
US$50, the saving owingto the disappearance o fbribes.30

4.2 1 Reforms incustoms have reduced the incentive for corruption and increased
revenues from foreign trade (Table 4, line 3). Customs revenues increased from 6
percent o f GDP in2004 to 9.5 percent of GDP, a result o f the increase inVAT revenues
(3 percent o f GDP) andinexcise taxes (0.6 percent o f GDP). Firms say that corruption
incustoms has diminished, butthepublic at large still feels that customs is aproblem. In
a survey carried out inJune 2006 for the EU, GORBI, a pollingfirm, found that
44 percent o fthose interviewedratedthe performance o fthe department o f customs as
"good" or "neither goodnor poor".31 While customs mayhave improved more thanwhat
the general public believes, the customs department still has a reputational problem.32

4.22     Summarizing, the changes the credit supported helpedto improve governance and
create better conditions for private sector growth. While all the changes cannot be
attributedto the credit, the credit supported actions that went inthe right direction.

OBJECTIVE 11:IMPROVINGFINANCE               MANAGEMENT          AND FINANCIALACCOUNTABILITY
4.23     This objective consisted o ftwo sub-objectives, one dealing with public
expenditure management and the other with financial accountability. To achieve its goals
for public expenditure managementthe credit set as core condition to "prepare an action
planacceptable to IDAfor implementingreforms inthe BudgetSystems Law"; for
financial accountability, the core condition was to "adopt amendments on Administration
Violations Code to makeprocurement fraudpunishable" andto launch the State
Procurement Agency website and improve the format and content o fprocurement related
information. As inprevious sections, the report looks at what happened beyond 2004
using indicators relateddirectly or indirectly to the ultimate results the credit sought.

4.24     Public Expenditure Management. The restructuring o fthe public sector carried
out in2004 improved governmental functions, especially revenue collection. Tax
revenues increased 7.7 percentage points of GDP, andrevenue from privatizations
jumpedfiom 0.3 percent o fGDPin2003 to 4.1 percent ofGDPin2006 (see Table 29).
The improvements made it possible to undertake some fiscal initiatives like increasing
pensions, upgrading defense capacity and clearing arrears. In2004 pensions increased to
20 Lari per month (about 10.4 U S dollars); and since 2005 the minimumpensions has
been doubled.

4.25      The government also continued its reforms inother areas. The Single Treasury
Account (STA) became fully operational inearly 2006, and the first Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF)was produced in2005. The STA has helpedraise the
timeliness andtransparency o f fiscal performance. The authorities also sought to
improvetheir Basic DataandDirections (BDD) document, their equivalent o f anMTEF;
the most recent BDDcovers the period 2007-2010. The 2006 budget had a fiscal
framework inline with the PRSP and MTEF, and its social spendingreflected expected
increases inminimumpensions as well as the targeted poverty benefit program launched
inlate2006.

4.26      Financial Accountability. Since 2004 the authorities have made an effort to
improve fiscal transparency, but they also operated quasi-fiscal funds outside the budget
andwithout oversight. Most o fthe Georgianministries and some institutions o fcontrol
(e.g., Chamber o f Control) have functioning websites, but they are slow and difficult to
access; more important, their information i s scanty and o f variable quality. For over two
years the authorities operated two quasi-fiscal funds -the ArmedForces Fundandthe
Law Enforcement Fundoutside the control o f Parliament; the authorities closed them in
March2006. A third one, the Reform Development Fundbecame an NG0.33

4.27      The credit supported several actions that should leadto better financial
accountability, but the indicators selected measure outputs andinputs. Part o f the
difficulty o f finding good indicators comes from looking at problems incterms o f
processes and o f associating a desirable action with a good outcome (e.g., reduce
procurement offices and costs o fpurchases will fall). This report uses indicators from
Global Integrityfor 2006 and 2007 to gain insights on what happened with financial
accountability. Although the indicators pay attention to processes andregulations, their
compilers try to establish what happens inpractice andrate it accordingly. Table 30
presents the indicators.

4.28      The information inA and B shows weaker accountability in2007 than in2006 for
all categories listed but one. Although the legislation protectingthe right o f access is
good inpractice people cannot exert that right. As for government accountability, the

executive became less accountable, inpart because o fweak regulations governing
conflicts o finterests, but also because the chief executive can hardlybe held accountable.
Budget processes are very weak because the legislature has little impact on the national
budgetand citizens have limited access to the budgetary process. Procurement is also
very weak, to an important extent because its processes are not effective. Last, Georgia's
Supreme Audit Institution has a good legal foundation to do itsjob, but inpractice it
cannot initiate its own investigations, and citizens cannot access audit reports within a
reasonable time or at a reasonable cost. Moreover, the government can remove its head
without relevantjustification and does not act on the findings o f the agency. Ina recent
review (2007) the Bank found that Georgia's procurement systemmade little progress
since 2002 and rates the procurement environment as "high risk". Insummary, progress
infinancial accountability seemsto havebeennegligible.34

4.29        This objective sought to improve performance inthe electricity sector. Its main
instrument was to request from the government a time-bound action plan for electricity
satisfactory to IDA and adopting legislation to address the insolvency o f the electric
utilities. Both conditions were met, but their ultimate success depended on the
government improving the sector's performance. The 2003 Rose Revolution constituted
a turningpoint inthe Government's commitment to energy sector reform. Budgetary
institutions beganto pay their bills, the government ceasedinterferinginthe dispatch o f
electricity, and endorsed disconnection for non-payment o fbills.

4.30        Since 2004 the sector has improved its performance (See Table 31). The long
black outs have disappeared andpaying consumers get 24-hour service. Collection rates
from final consumers increased from 50 percent in2004 to 90 percent at the end o f 2007;
andfrom transmission services from lessthan40 percent in2005 to 90 percent at the end

of 2006. Within Tbilisi, a privatized distribution company provides 24-hour electricity
service and notifies customers inadvanceo fplanned outages. Better collection rates,
fewer losses, and tariff rates set to recover costs have eliminated the quasi-fiscal deficit in
the energy sector, which as recently as 2005 reached 4 percent o f GDP. Despite these
gains, the government had to transfer resources to the sector for about 3 percent of GDP
in2004 and 1.74 percent ofGDPin2006. Also, in2005the sector's debts, includingtax
arrears, reached 2.1 billion Lari, about 18 percent of GDP.

government started its reform o f the social protection system inMarch 2005 when it
issued an order outlining the new concept for protectingthe poor.36 To target benefits the
new system was basedonneeds (poverty) rather than categories (e.g., pensioner, war

Employment State Agency (SAESA) checks and monitors via social agents who visit the
families applying for the benefits. After verifying the applications and the needs o f each
family, the agents enter the information ina databasethat establishes the rankingscore o f
the family. The ranking determines which o f the three assistancepackages the family
receives: (a) electricity subsidy; (b) electricity subsidy andhealth insurance for all family
members; and (c) electricity subsidy, health insurance and cash transfer for subsistence.
Bythe endo f2006 about 500,000 families hadapplied, andafter SAESA cleaned the
rolls the number of families inthe database stood at 430,000.

4.33         The government outlined its policies for social protection inits Basic Data and
Directions (BDD)document o f 2006. The document presents the expenditure plans for
2007-2010 and announces the formation of a residual system o f social assistance that
monetizes benefits, creates reliable mechanisms to identify beneficiaries and checks their
eligibilit~.~~           Inexecutingtheprogram, itincreasedtransfers andsubsidies from
7.6 percent o f GDP in2004 to 11percent of GDP in2006 (See Table 32). For social
assistance, by 2006 about 90,000 extreme poor families hadbeen targeted to receive
benefits and about 25 percent o fpoor benefited from the medical assistance card
program. Also, the coverage o fhealth for infants increased; by 2006 about 86 percent o f
them receivedthe immunization (DPT3) on time, compared with 79 percent in2004.

4.35    Insummary, the credit consisted ofproceduralconditions that ifthe government
acted on them would leadto measureable positive outcomes. The government acted on
these conditions after the project closed, and the objectives o fthe credit related to a
satisfactory macroeconomic framework, resolving critical issues inthe energy sector and
protectingthe vulnerable were substantially achieved. The credit succeeded less in
achieving the objectives o f strengthening governance andpublic sector management and
improvingpublic finance management and accountability.

Monitoring and Evaluation

4.36    Design. The credit lacked a monitoring and evaluation framework, but the matrix
o f actions inthe program document (Annex 1ofReport) hadone column titled
"Outcome/monitorable indicators" mappingthe outcomes to the actions. The outcomes
didnot come out of awell argued, thoughtful, results-based framework, andthe results
referredmore to outputs, intermediate inputs, or further actions the government would
take to achieve the objective.

4.37     The changes incustoms exemplifythe approach inthe program document. The
changes were part o fthe anti-corruption strategy the credit supported. The policy matrix
said the government would take "initial measures to reduce corruption inCustoms and
keypublic enterprises", andthe expected result would be "improved functioningo f
Customs as reflectedinperiodic surveys". The document didnot identifythe specific
actions the government would take (e.g., reduce tariffs, eliminate red tape, and fire
personnel). Second, the indicator lackedprecision inidentifyingwhere customs would
improve (e.g., collecting duties, operating costs, processing time) and the extent to which
an improvement would be acceptable (e.g., time merchandise spends inwarehouses
decreases from 90 to 89 days or from 90 to 3 days). The problems described result fiom
the project document failing to identify the causes behindthe corruption andpoor
performance incustoms. Lacking that framework (problems-causes-solutions) ledto a
weak results chain and to inadequate baseline and final indicators.

4.39     Implementation. The PAD didnot specify the indicators to be gathered nor a plan
to gather them. This review rates the quality o fimplementationnegligible.

4.40     Utilization. The PAD presented a mix o f output, input and results indicators in
the matrix that summarized the actions the credit supported. The information to be
gathered was not intendedto have an impact on the program because the credit was
designed as a singletranche operation. This review rates the quality o futilization
negligible.

4.41     Summarizing, this review rates the overall quality o f monitoring and evaluation as
negligible.

Ratings

4.42        Relevance. The project sought to helpcreate the foundations to solve important
problems inGeorgia and this report rates the relevance o fproject objectives as
substantial.

4.43        Efficacy and Outcome. The government carried out the actions envisaged inthe
program. Insubsequent years it executed the action plans agreed to inthe credit or
carried out actions that contributed to achieve, partially or fully, the results sought (e.g.,
strengthen governance andreduce corruption). Efficacy was modest for two objectives
and substantial for three others. Table 33 summarizes the ratings for efficacy and
outcome.

4.44        Risk toDevelopment Outcome (Sustainability). The risk to development outcome
i s ratedas moderate. The government has taken steps to improve governance and public
financial management, to solve critical issues inthe electricity sector and to protect the
vulnerable. Inits actions the government has shown its political will and administrative
capacity to carry out the reforms it embarks upon. The evidence presented covers three
years beyondthe closing date o f the credit, and it shows that conditions have improved.
The authorities havebeenmore effective inimproving economic management and
carrying out economic reforms than incarrying out reforms inorganizations (e.g., civil
service reform) andinstitutions (e.g., procurement systems). The new administrationis
likelyto continue the economic reforms started in2004, but it also runsthe risk o f
maintaining its authoritarian streak. Were that to happen, the risks to the advances made
in2004-2007 could increase.38

could help monitor performance and evaluate impact. With the conditions set inthe
credit, the Bank took a calculated risk that has paid off. Bank performance i s rated as

how to achieve it, and acted inconsequence. The government met all the conditions,

the government andits different agencies acted on the action plans or enforcedthe laws
andregulationsthat ledto achieving what the credit was pursuing. Borrower
performance is rated as satisfactory.

5. Findingsand Lessons

5.1     Georgia's experience with reform shows again that Bank's support canbe
effective inpromoting and supporting change ifthe authorities are committed. Providing
support when the will is absent may retardrather than accelerate reform, as the
authorities can muddlethrough their problems. When countries need serious reform the
Bank should focus onthe fundamental problems andmake sure that its conditions leadto
results, not to promises o f future reform. Ifthere is no will or commitment to tackle the
difficult problems, the Bank should consider discontinuing lending.

5.2     Thejudicial reformproject deliveredmost o fits inputsbut didnot achieve the
higher level objectives it sought, puttinginto question the validity o f its design. Two
lessons emerge from this. First, changing institutions inthejudiciary demands
interventionsbeyondthose that the project supported. Inparticular, the goal of an
independentjudiciary requires continuous political will andcommitment from the highest
level o f country authorities. Second, projects that support upgradinginfrastructure (court
buildings, computer hardwareand software), andtrainingjudiciary staff could serve a
useful purpose. Inorder to evaluate them it i s necessary to define the "problem" properly,
to identifythe interventionsthat deal with it, and to design performance indicators
tailored to evaluate ifthe interventionshave solved the problem.

5.3     Complex regulations makeit difficult to bringchange to organizations andreduce
corruption. They increase the power o f discretion, encourage corruption, and strengthen
the oppositionto change. Customs andtax administrations inGeorgia exemplify this
problem. After the authorities simplified the tax system and customs procedures it
became easier to deal with the administrative problems incustoms and taxes because
inspectors had lost some o ftheir discretionary power. Before embarking on plans to
improve the administration o f organizations where discretion reigns, the Bank should
assess how to weaken that power by simplifyingregulations and legislations.

5.4     Banksupport fails when itusesthe wrong instrument (andtheory) to solve a
problem. The fight against corruption exemplifies this lesson. The Bank demanded from
the government an anti-corruption planandthe establishment o f an anti-corruption
commission. The government complied but corruption thrived in 1998-2003. In 2004, a
new government took effective actions to eradicate corruption (e.g., traffic police) and
slashed regulations.   This experience suggests that (a) creating an agency does not
guarantee that the government will fight corruption and succeed; and (b) streamlining and
simplifying regulations can be more powerful to fight corruption than creating
organizations and commissions.

5.5     More lessons on fighting corruption are the following. First, Georgia eliminated
egregious cases o f corruption with simple measures, not with an anti-corruption
watchdog or an anti-corruption plan. Second, enforcement is hndamental to fight
corruption. The Georgian government has done extremely well on this front. As a by-
product it has shown that it didnot need specific anti-corruption legislation to succeed.
