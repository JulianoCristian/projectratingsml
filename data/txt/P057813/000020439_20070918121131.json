"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Georgia Judicial Reform\n            Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some of the main lessons learned\n            were: this project illustrated, both the Government and the\n            judiciary are the clients or beneficiaries of much of the\n            assistance provided through judicial reform projects. Bank\n            teams must be prepared to negotiate and work with both\n            clients and, most importantly, must be prepared to mediate\n            and arbitrate as necessary between these two branches of\n            government. One key lesson that has emerged from the\n            Bank's first cohort of judicial reform projects is that\n            the paths to judicial independence and reducing corruption\n            in the judiciary remain highly political. Another lesson was\n            that the lack of measurable indicators and baseline\n            information for each project component hindered the Bank\n            team's ability to evaluate implementation progress effectively"}, "docdt": "2007-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
