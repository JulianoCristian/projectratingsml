independent and\n            professional judiciary committed to high standards of\n            judicial ethics and capable of efficient, effective dispute\n            resolution. The project supports key interventions to assist\n            in establishing the judiciary as an independent third branch\n            of government. There are six main components. The first,\n            court administration provides technical assistance for case\n            management and court administration procedures and\n            implementation, computerizes appellate courts and district\n            courts and provides personal computer packages for each of\n            75 courts, and funds audio equipment. The second component\n            funds civil works, rebuilding court infrastructure including\n            training facilities. The third and fourth components provide\n            technical assistance and equipment for enforcing court\n            judgments and for drafting legislation. The fifth component\n            sponsors study tours and training. The sixth component\n            supports public information and education, including a\n            communications campaign."}, "docdt": "1999-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
