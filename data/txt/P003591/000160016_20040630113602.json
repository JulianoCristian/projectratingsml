A number of key lessons, both positive and\n            negative, were learned which were summarized as follows: 1)\n            Cooperation between government agencies at various levels\n            was good and played an important role, especially in project\n            implementation. However, the difficulty of coordination\n            between the China Trust and Investment Corporation for\n            Economic Development (CTICED) and the Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MOA) was somewhat under-estimated. 2) The\n            CTICED's role as a Project Financial Intermediary (PFI)\n            caused a long drawn-out and unresolved debate over the\n            entire project period. On the one hand, PFI involvement\n            resulted in a much-improved project implementation\n            efficiency; helped the participating state farms and\n            enterprises accelerate their physical construction;\n            delegation of procurement responsibility was much more\n            efficient and better fit the sub-projects' actual\n            needs; and loan disbursement was much faster and more\n            flexible than the traditional on-lending mechanism.\n            Nonetheless, it was also obvious that the unsatisfactory\n            project implementation was caused fundamentally by the\n            CTICED in its role as the PFI. Specifically, the fact of\n            sub-project appraisal by the CTICED, focusing almost\n            entirely on the evaluation of financial viability of\n            sub-borrowers, jeopardized one of the project objectives;\n            the CTICED's revenue-oriented business objective\n            conflicted with the reform effort made by the Project\n            Oversight Office established within the MOA; and the CTICED\n            heavy reliance on local governments' guarantee for\n            repayment of over 50 percent of all sub-loans brought\n            negative impacts on project implementation in terms of\n            quality control and financial risk management. 3) By\n            participating in reforms at the enterprise and state farm\n            level, the project has established successful reform models\n            to facilitate the reform process. This, in general, brought\n            about a profound positive impact on the transformation of\n            enterprises and state farms from subsidized,\n            government-directed, supply-driven entities to profitable,\n            independent, market-oriented and demand-driven entities."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
