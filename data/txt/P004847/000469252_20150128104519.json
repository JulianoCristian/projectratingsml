Almost a third of the\n            borrowers were women. The loans, averaging $360 each and\n            provided through seven participating banks, were used to\n            expand farm production, agricultural processing, and\n            trading. Without the project, most of these borrowers would\n            have reportedly turned to money lenders, whose costs are\n            much higher. The total credit provided by the Bank for this\n            project was $110 million. The project has supported several\n            financing initiatives, one of them being mobile banking,\n            which provides services to remote areas without bank\n            branches. Already, the benefits of mobile banking exceed the\n            costs, highlighting the need to provide more and better\n            banking services to people in remote areas who until now\n            have had no formal banks to serve them."}, "docdt": "2002-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
