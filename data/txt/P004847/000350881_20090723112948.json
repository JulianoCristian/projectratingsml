   had a satisfactory outcome, a moderate institutional impact,\n            and a moderate risk to development outcome.  Both the Bank\n            and the borrower performances were satisfactory.  Findings\n            of the project include:  A study is needed to better\n            understand all the implicit subsidies throughout the system.\n            The Bank also needs to consider a more proactive approach to\n            closed projects with loan funds that are being relent within\n            the same fund, particularly with respect to loan size caps.\n            Both the Bank and the borrower were very slow to resolve the\n            Vietnam Bank for the Poor (VBP) involvement issue and could\n            also have made better analytical use of available data on\n            costs per job created.  The three main lessons learned from\n            the project are: A) Training programs should be designed\n            with the objective of not only making delivery more\n            efficient but of creating a national capacity in financial\n            services. B) The Bank needs to revisit the impact of\n            conditionality on project implementation through the life of\n            the credit not simply the life of the project and to design\n            conditionality to adapt to change. C) The Bank should\n            establish achievable participating financial institution\n            (PFI) participation criteria at appraisal and ensure that at\n            least a significant number of PFIs can meet them prior to appraisal."}, "docdt": "2009-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
