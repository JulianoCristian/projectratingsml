"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Rural Finance Project\n            for Vietnam was satisfactory, the sustainability was highly\n            likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and Borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that the criteria\n            of the participating financial institutions need to be\n            periodically reviewed and adjusted to market conditions.\n            More attention should be given to diversification of the\n            Rural Development Fund (RDF) lending. The institutional\n            development plan targets should be reviewed and updated more\n            often to reflect better the new challenges and issues.\n            Direct credit by crop or type of investments, at subsidized\n            interest rates have not sustained economic growth. Poor\n            financial conditions within participating financial\n            institutions have severely constrained the projects'\n            sustainability. Private financial resource mobilization is\n            extremely important for the institutional sustainability.\n            When interest rates either fall significantly below, or move\n            well above prevailing market rates, serious implementation\n            problems emerge - above market-rates have resulted in slow\n            disbursements, and below-market rates have led to\n            concentration of credit to relatively wealthy clients."}, "docdt": "2002-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
