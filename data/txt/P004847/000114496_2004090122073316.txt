Page  24
to this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
provisions set forth in paragraph 2(b) of Part A, Section II of
Schedule 5 to this Agreement, payments for expenditures to be
financed out of the proceeds of free-limit Sub-loans may be made out

      (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equiva-
lent to $10,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and

Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Association a request or requests for
a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the

Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the
Credit Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or
amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
       (b)   (i)  For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                  Borrower shall furnish to the to the Association
                  requests for deposits into the Special Account at
                  such intervals as the Association shall specify.

                  paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or
                  payments in respect of which replenishment is
                  requested. On the basis of each such request, the
                  Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
                  withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit
                  into the Special Account such amount as the
                  Borrower shall have requested and as shall have
                  been shown by said documents and other evidence
                  to have been paid out of the Special Account for
                  eligible expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Association from the Credit
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the respective
equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and
other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account,
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Association shall reasonably
request, furnish to the Association such documents and other evidence
showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible
expenditures.
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule,
the Association shall not be required to make further deposits into
the Special Account:
      (a)   if, at any time, the Association shall have determined that
Page  25
all further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from
the Credit Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of
the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement;
      (b)   if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Association, within the period of time specified in Section 4.02 (a)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Association pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;
      (c)   if, at any time, the Association shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of
the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account pursuant to
the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or

to the eligible Categories for Part A of the Project, less the amount
of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the Association
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to
Part A of the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Credit allocated to the eligible Categories for
Part A of the Project shall follow such procedures as the Association
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall
be made only after and to the extent that the Association shall have
been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making pay-
ments for eligible expenditures.
6.    (a) If the Association shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or
in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or
(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Association,
the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Association: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Association may request; or
(B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Association shall so
request, refund to the Association) an amount equal to the amount of
such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.
Unless the Association shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by
the Association into the Special Account shall be made until the
Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund,
as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Association shall have determined at any time thatany amount 
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall,
promptly upon notice from the Association, refund to the Association
such outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Association, refund
to the Association all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the
Special Account.

Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance
with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.

      of the Bank or for goods produced in, or services supplied from,
      such territories; or (b) for the purpose of any payment to
      persons or entities, or for any import of goods, if such payment

      the Association shall, in respect of any portion of the Credit:
      (i) have received no applications  or requests under sub-
      paragraphs (a) or (b) of said paragraph; or (ii) have denied
      any such applications or requests. The Association may, by

      submit such applications or requests or to make withdrawals
      from the Credit Account, as the case may be, with respect to
      such amount or portion of the Credit. Upon the giving of such
      notice, such amount or portion of the Credit shall be cancelled."
