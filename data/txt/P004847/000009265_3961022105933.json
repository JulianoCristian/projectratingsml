components of the IDA's country assistance\n            strategy, which are: 1) assist transition to a market\n            economy; 2) strengthen the rural finance system through\n            finance targeted to agriculture and small and medium\n            enterprises in rural areas, accompanied by technical\n            assistance; and 3) reduction of poverty through promoting\n            growth and enabling the poor to respond to opportunities to\n            improve their welfare. The project will also assist Viet Nam\n            in its efforts to improve living conditions in the rural\n            areas through: 1) encouraging private sector investments; 2)\n            strengthening the banking system's capacity to finance\n            private sector investments; and 3) increasing access of the\n            rural poor to financial services. The project will consist\n            of the following components: 1) rural development fund; 2)\n            fund for the rural poor; 3) equipment; 4) vehicles; 5)\n            training; and 6) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1996-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
