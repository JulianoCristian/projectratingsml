1. Summary

In response to the Avian Influenza threat to humans and poultry the World Bank has
launched a global Program for Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness and
Response. The World Bank is supporting the Palestinian Authority to address challenges
posed by the current Avian Influenza (AI) outbreak and the possibility of a human flu
pandemic. A requirement of the World Bank is to conduct an environmental assessment
(EA) of projects proposed for Bank financing to help ensure that they are
environmentally sound and sustainable.

An environmental management plan studies each project activity, consider the impact of
these activities on the environment, and then outlines what mitigation measures should be
taken to prevent the negative environmental impact of each activity.      Afterwards, the
plan indicates which institution will implement mitigation measures and which institution
will monitor the implementation. In addition, the plan identifies the cost of mitigation
and monitoring measures.      The plans purpose it not to prepare procedures or manuals,
however identifies the necessary procedures and manuals and that need to be developed
to prevent and/or minimize the environmental hazards.

Activities that will be conducted under Human Health and Animal Health components of
the project are not expected to generate significant negative environmental impacts.
Most of these activities are focused on improving the readiness of the public sector to
deal with domestic poultry and potential human pandemic.             The main areas of
environmental risks from the project activities are the inadvertent spread of the AI virus
during culling, transport, and disposal of carcasses, animal waste, liter, and used
protective gear, contamination of surface and groundwater fro use of disinfectants and
laboratory biosafety and waste management.              In addition, minor environmental
disturbances may occur during renovation of laboratories. Most of these impacts could
be avoided or minimized as described in the mitigation measures.

The main recommendation presented in the EMP report include:

A- General recommendation to develop the legal setting (for details check section
3.3.15.):
    1) To develop regulation on animal carcasses disposal that have died or were killed
       following a pathogenic infection.
    2) To develop the regulations and bylaws on the bio-security for farms and
       hatcheries by MOA.
    3) To finalize and submit the hazardous waste regulations and the medical waste
       regulations.
    4) Clarify roles of EQA and MOH regarding hazardous waste management.
    5) To identify a mechanism for ministries to be able to supervise and monitor other
       ministries' activities that affect their line of work
    6) To work on approving the Quarantine bylaw drafted by the Ministry of
       Agriculture



                                                5

   7) To draft a bylaw on animal diseases by MOA.

B- Main recommendations to develop the Institutional Setting and Reporting
mechanism
   1) To translate the two plans of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of
      Health into one operational plan that include both ministries as well as the
      Environment Quality Authority, and that the operational plans include standard
      operating procedures for each step, and identification the role of each ministry /
      authority in these procedures. It is recommended that these operational plans
      would include not only positions of responsible persons, but also names of
      personnel and their contact numbers at all levels, starting from the ministerial
      level -represented by the NCAIC - and ending with local or governorate level for
      all stages of operation.
   2) To include an EQA member in the RRCT to ensure that site selection of burial
      site and that the disposal method are conducted in an environmentally sound
      manner and in accordance with the EMP. (this recommendation has already been
      addressed). Now the RRCT include a member of EQA as agreed upon in written
      communications between the two institutions during the plan preparation.
   3) RRCT will monitor all activities related to culling, transport and disposal of
      carcasses and waste, as well as the use of disinfectants.
   4) It is recommended to improve the reporting system to include environmental
      reporting. The following forms are suggested:
          a. For the health forms, it is recommended to include 1) records about
              workers and supervisors at the site, 2) their health status, 3) vaccination, 4)
              past health history, and 5) use of PPE.
          b. For the environmental forms it is recommended to include 1) the location
              of the burial pit, 2) the disposal operations, 3) the factors considered in the
              site selection process, 4) its preferred if the site is also identified by GPS
              to add on a map, 5) water sensitivity, 6) dimensions of the burial site, and
              7) site marking information. A copy of the environmental form should be
              given to EQA, MOH-Environmental Health department, and the Ministry
              of Local Government and the Water Authority.
   5) The Environmental Specialist hired by the Project Implementation Unit will
      monitor waste management at the MOA and MOH laboratories and report on
      compliance with the Mitigation measures indicated in the EMP.                      The
      environmental specialist should give a copy of his/her observations and
      recommendations to EQA and MOH / Environmental Health Department.

C- Main recommendations on Mitigation Measures on Animal Health Component:
Culling and disposal:
   1) To upgrade the current guidelines for culling, transport and operation to include
      the recommendations presented for each step in these guidelines. (See page X for
      details)
   1) To develop the Standard Operating Procedures for culling, transport and disposal
      as soon as possible.
   2) To Train the RRCT on these procedures.



                                             6

Strengthening the surveillance capacity
    1) To develop biosafety manual for MOA laboratories.
    2) To develop waste management manual for MOA laboratories.
    3) To train laboratory technicians on biosafety.
    4) To provide the necessary equipment to improve the biosafety of the laboratory,
        including an autoclave, an incinerator or a disposal method for carcass from
        laboratories, and other equipment required to reach the safety biosafety levels 2
        and 3, such HEPA filter, ultraviolet lamps....etc.
Chemicals use:
    1) Use of chemicals according to code of conduct and procedures.
    2) Selection of chemicals in coordination with EQA to prevent the use of
        environmentally persistent chemicals.
    3) To include a list of chemicals that will be used in the contingency plan.

D - Main recommendations on Mitigation Measures on Human Health Component
    1) To prepare operational manual for waste management produced from the MOH
        laboratory
    2) to equip the laboratory with any required equipment to reach the biosafety level 3
    3) To equip the laboratory with any required equipment to be able to implement
        acceptable waste management practices.

The EA Report has reviewed a number of entity laws, including the Basic Palestinian
law, the Public Health law, the Agricultural Law, the Environmental Law, the Water
Law, the Poultry Farms bylaw, the Poultry Hatcheries bylaw, the bylaw for licensing
poultry and animal farms, Regulations on Animal disease, and Oslo Agreement II. The
EA report further proposes monitoring activities and responsible institutions for
monitoring of each mitigation measure.

A possible outbreak of AI in West Bank and Gaza would require an organized and
systematic response. This means that a number of different sectors would need to work
in coordination, and that the flow of information and action plans would need to be
developed together. One of the most important steps that have been taken is the
establishment of the National Committee on Avian Influenza Control (NCAIC). This
committee facilitated proper planning and coordination of work among the most
important stakeholders, such as the Ministry of health, the Ministry of Agriculture, and
the Environment Quality Authority among others.

2. Project Description
The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemic (HPAI) has placed the
West Bank and Gaza at high risk due to the large number of migratory birds, with
increased risk to spread the infection among domestic poultry.            The proximity of
outbreaks in Israel, Egypt and Jordan increases this risk if it is not handled in an efficient
and rapid mechanism. On April 20, 2006, AI H5N1 presence was confirmed in 8
locations in Gaza according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) reports. In 2006, preventive
culling in Gaza took place of about 400,000 in 45 farms and no human out break was



                                              7

reported. There were also nine outbreaks in poultry coops in Israel between 16th and 31st
of March 20061. Five of the outbreak cases were at the border of Gaza Strip, one close to
the Egyptian border, one nearby Jerusalem, and one in the northern Jordan Valley near
the Israeli Jordanian borders1. The number of culled birds during these outbreaks was
about 1.2 million1.

The World Bank (WB) has launched a global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI) and
Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response2. Under this framework, the World Bank
supports client countries to address challenges posed by the current AI outbreak and the
possibility of a human flu pandemic3.                      The United Nations Development Program
(UNDP/PAPP) with funds from the World Bank and technical assistance from FAO is
assisting the Palestinian people in preparing an emergency operation in response to Avian
Influenza (AI) threat in West Bank and Gaza (WBG).

Consistent with the GPAI, the project development objective is to minimize the threat
posed to humans and domestic poultry by HPAI infection, as well as to prepare for
control and respond to influenza pandemic, including minimization of the loss of income
through compensation.

Project region: The project operation will take place throughout the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, as it is possible that the threat will affect all the country.

The following components are covered in this project:
    1. Component 1: Animal Health and Veterinary Services
    2. Component 2: Human Health Component
    3. Component 3: Public Awareness and Environmental Management

Component 1: Animal Health and Veterinary Services
This component is composed of three sub components: (1) surveillance and diagnostic
capacity; (2) culling and disposal; and (3) compensation for income loss. The following
activities are to be conducted within the framework of each sub-component.

Sub-component 1.1: Surveillance and Diagnostic Capacity
Activities include (a) training of field staff on surveillance and monitoring; (b) provision
of personal protective equipment (PPE) for field technicians directly exposed to the risk
of contamination during surveillance; (c) vaccines; (d) equipping of a veterinary
laboratory in Gaza including supply of reagents and laboratory disposables, as well as the
upgrading of the capacity of the existing laboratory in the West Bank; (e) training for lab
technicians; (f) and some activities in community awareness and social mobilization
(mainly targeted at persons along the poultry production line). Potential activities may

also include the provision of appropriate quarantine measures and the development of a
routine collection and update of epidemiological data.

Sub-component 1.2: Culling and Disposal
This sub-component will support culling and disinfection of disposal sites and poultry
farms, as well as the provision of technical assistance to PA counterparts on culling
procedures and data collection.

Sub-component 1.3: Compensation for Income Loss
This component will provide technical support for the compensation committee and a
proportion of the compensation funding. All the necessary legal, operational and
institutional arrangements for carrying out this sub-component will be developed in the
first few months of implementation through the AITF grant to UN agencies (UNTF
Grant).

Component 2: Human Health Component
This component will support activities aimed at preventing the spread of the AI virus to
humans and will cover the following three sub components: 1) prevention and human
safety; 2) strengthening public health surveillance systems; 3) strengthening health
system response capacity.

The following activities are to be conducted for each subcomponent

Sub-component 2.1: Prevention & Human Safety
This component will support (a) the protection of medical and field staff and other highly
exposed groups involved in identification/surveillance of the disease. Adequate resources
will be allocated for PPE, Prophylaxis treatment, disinfection materials, and vaccination
against seasonal human influenza; and (b) social mobilization and raising public
awareness in the community.

Sub-component 2.2: Strengthening Public Health Surveillance Systems
To assess risks to public health and to guide preventive interventions, information is
needed on the extent of influenza infection in animals and humans, on circulating viruses,
and on other priority infectious diseases. To this end, the project would support
strengthening the capacity of existing laboratories. This will include the provision of
equipment necessary for specimen collection, transportation, and testing. It will also
support upgrading of the diagnostic capacity of existing laboratories.

Sub-component 2.3: Health System Response
While precise figures are difficult to estimate, the burden on the health system is likely to
be considerable. With the present situation, the potential of the HPAI virus to become
transmissible among humans is of serious concern. Thus, building an effective national
public health response would be part of an integrated national plan to bring proven
interventions quickly up to a nationwide scale. Activities under this sub-component will
include: 1) Vaccinations: In the event of an avian influenza pandemic (when vaccines
become available), funding will be made available for implementing a detailed logistical



                                             9

(procurement and distribution) plan for the vaccination of targeted priority groups. 2)
Drug Therapy: The use of anti-viral drugs will be part of the approach to contain an
avian influenza pandemic and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Therefore, support will
be provided for the purchase of Tami flu (antiviral drug). Priority would be given to
population groups most exposed to immediate risk. The project would support the use of
the anti-viral drugs for: (a) post exposure; and (b) extended prophylaxis. 3) Medical
services: Based on the needs assessment which will be conducted under the UNTF Grant,
assistance will be provided to the health care system for preparedness to provide optimal
medical care and maintain essential community services. Strengthened clinical care
capacity could be achieved through establishing specialized units in selected hospitals.

Component 3: Public Awareness and Environmental Management
Current assessments indicate there are at least two areas of activity where contingency
funds will need to meet evolving needs: (a) further activities on public awareness and
information which may have not been addressed under components 1 & 2; and (b)
implementation of an environmental management plan (EMP).

Sub-component 3.1 Public Awareness and Information
A coordinated awareness and information campaign is needed to target the general
public, especially the rural population and areas of common backyard poultry breeding
(high-risk areas). Some public awareness activities will be carried out under Component
2 with oversight from the Ministry of Health (MOH). The Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) also plans to print out and distribute leaflets and brochures (under Component 1)
targeting poultry producers. Additional activities not accounted for under Components 1
and 2 will be financed under Component 3. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will
retain a communications specialist/agency to prepare a public awareness strategy in
consultation with key UN agencies and NGOs (UNICEF, PARC, etc).

Sub-component 3.2 Implementation of Environmental Management Plan
This sub-component will implement measures as described in this EMP after its approval.
This plan is developed as part of the activities under the UNTF. The EMP is developed
following the "Interim Guidelines for Managing Potential Environmental and Social
Safeguard Issues in Bank-Assisted Avian Influenza Control Projects", Quality Assurance
and Compliance Unit, April 2006.

3. Overview of Applicable International and National Agreements, Policies and
Laws

3.1 World Bank Safeguards Policy
The World Bank requires environmental assessment (EA) of projects proposed for Bank
financing to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable, and thus to
improve decision making. EA is a process whose breadth, depth, and type of analysis
depend on the nature, scale, and potential environmental impact of the proposed project.
EA evaluates a project's potential environmental risks and impacts in its area of
influence; examines project alternatives; identifies ways of improving project selection,
siting, planning, design, and implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or



                                            10

compensating for adverse environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts; and
includes the process of mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts
throughout project implementation. The Bank favors preventive measures over mitigatory
or compensatory measures, whenever feasible.

The World Bank classifies the proposed projects into one of four categories, depending
on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the project and the nature and magnitude of
its potential environmental impacts. The West Bank and Gaza Avian and Human
Influenza Prevention and Control Project has been assigned environmental category B,
since it involves moderate environmental impacts that can be managed during
implementation of the project. The EA process for the AI project is addressed through
this EMP. This EMP addresses the moderate adverse environmental effects of the Animal
Health and Human Health Project Components.

For the Animal Health component, the EMP addresses zoonotic disease containment and
waste management as pertain to special waste, emissions and materials at laboratories,
and training for veterinary services workers, to include procedures for safe handling of AI
materials; safe culling of infected and at-risk poultry and disposal of carcasses. For the
Human Health component, the EMP focuses on equipment, refurbishing and training for
laboratories and medical facilities to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease
containment and special waste management. The EMP provides a mitigation and
monitoring plan to ensure appropriate attention to environmental issues, and tracking
progress or problems in their management.

3.2 International agreements

3.2.1) OSLO II - The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip4
This agreement identifies the coordination mechanism between Palestinian ministries and
Israeli side regarding health, environment, and agriculture. In addition, the agreement
bides both sides to commit to issuing standards that is compatible with those that are
internationally recognized.      These standards should be equivalent and compatible
between the two sides in the sectors of health, veterinary service and environmental
aspects.

standards while taking into account WHO recommendations.

B) ANNEX V- Protocol on Economic Relations - Article 8 ­ Agriculture
The relations between the official veterinary services of both sides will be based on
mutuality in accordance with the following principles, which will be applied in all the
areas under their respective jurisdiction:
             a. Israel and the Palestinian Authority will do their utmost to preserve and
                  improve the veterinary standards.
             b. Israel and the Palestinian Authority will take all measures to reach
                  equivalent and compatible standards regarding animal disease control,
                  including mass vaccination of animals and avians, quarantines, "stamping
                  out" measures and residue control standards.
             c. The official veterinary services of Israel and the Palestinian Authority will
                  coordinate and regularly exchange information regarding animal diseases,
                  and will establish a mechanism for immediate notification of the outbreak
                  of such diseases.
The two sides will establish sub-committees of their respective official veterinary, which
will update the information and review issues, policies and procedures in these fields.
Any changes in the provisions of this Article will be agreed upon by both sides.

C) ANNEX III - Protocol Concerning Civil Affairs - Article 12 - Environmental
Protection
Both sides shall respectively adopt, apply and ensure compliance with internationally
recognized standards concerning the following: levels of pollutants discharged through
emissions and effluents; acceptable levels of treatment of solid and liquid wastes, and
agreed ways and means for disposal of such wastes; the use, handling and transportation
(in accordance with the provisions of Article 38 (Transportation)) and storage of
hazardous substances and wastes (including pesticides, insecticides and herbicides); and
standards for the prevention and abatement of noise, odor, pests and other nuisances,
which may affect the other side.

   5) Water Law No. 3 for the year 200210.
   6) Presidential decree to establish National Committee on Avian Influenza Control11
        No. 17 for the year 2006.
   7) Poultry Farms bylaw12: Ministerial Cabinet decree No. 12 for the year 2006
        regarding poultry farms.
   8) Poultry Hatcheries bylaw13: Ministerial Cabinet decree No. 380 for the year 2005
        regarding Poultry Hatcheries.
   9) Bylaw for licensing poultry and animal farms for the year 2005. (Gaza only)
   10) a) Regulation on Animal disease No. 39 for the year 1954 (applicable if it does
        not contradict with other laws in the West Bank)
        b) Regulation on Animal disease No. 43 for the year 1945 (applicable if it does
        not contradict with other laws (Gaza and West Bank).
        Both regulations 10 a 10 b are identical from a technical point of view.
   11) Regulation on animal quarantine (1931) (Gaza Only)
   12) Regulation on animal diseases: import of poultry. (Gaza only 1931)
   13) Regulation on animal disease: epizootic diseases (Gaza only). (1928)
   14) The Palestinian Environmental Impact Assessment Policy (2000)14.

In addition, a bylaw regarding veterinary quarantine was drafted, although not presented
to the Ministerial cabinet yet. This law will be able to replace the laws on animal
quarantine and import of poultry 1931 (Gaza) and to fill the gap of lack of such laws in
the West Bank.          This law will unify the system in Gaza and the West Bank upon
approval in that regard.         A second by law regarding animal drug use was drafted by
MOA, although not presented for approval by the ministerial cabinet yet. This bylaw
when approved will control the drug use and their import to the country, including the
vaccination of poultry.

There are two bylaws that have been drafted by EQA, a bylaw on solid waste and a bylaw
on hazardous waste. However, these bylaws were not submitted to the ministerial cabinet
yet for approval. In addition, work is undergoing to finalize a draft bylaw on medical
waste.

3.3.1) Basic Palestinian Law15:
The basic law states (Article 33) that "The enjoyment of a balanced and clean
environment is a human right. The preservation and protection of the Palestinian
environment from pollution for the sake of present and future generations is a national
duty". Defining clean and safe environment as a human right in the basic law is essential

for the further laws issued on the environment, and for the protection of the
environmental systems.            Also this article indicates the importance of sustainable
development, as the environment has to be preserved and protected for the sake of not
only present but also future generations.

In addition, the principle of the rule of law shall be the basis of government in Palestine.
All authorities, powers, agencies, institutions and individuals shall be subject to law. This
article indicates that all institutions including governmental ministries should abide by
laws (Article 6).

3.3.2) Public Health Law16: No. 20 for the year 2004.
The public Health law assigns the responsibility of combating infectious diseases and
epidemics by all means possible to the MOH. In addition, the law gives the ministry the
authority to take all necessary and precautionary measures to stop the spread of disease
through: 1) imposing vaccinations and needed medications; 2) confiscating and
destroying all material contaminated with the disease, or that could be a source of spread
of the disease, in coordination with competent bodies; and 3) to bury the dead in the
manner the ministry deem fit (Article 10).

The law identifies procedures taken in case of identification of a human case with
infectious disease, including isolation, reporting, and frees treatment. Also it can impose
quarantine measures to prevent the spread of disease. In addition, the ministry could in
coordination with the competent bodies do the following 1) medical inspection, 2) isolate
and monitor animal, and 3) determination of health conditions that should be available in
the exported and imported goods.

Article 42 of the law states that the Ministry shall coordinate with the relevant bodies to
determine conditions for:
    A. transfer, storage, treatment or disposal of hazardous items
    B. usage and exchange of pesticides for agricultural and public health purposes
    C. collection, recycling or reuse of wastewater and rain water
    2. No one is allowed to perform the tasks defined in A, B, and C above unless this
    person is obeying the rules and conditions determined as indicated in this article.

3.3.3) Agricultural law17: No. 2 for the year 2003
This law provides the general framework for agricultural practices. It identifies (Article
59) that MOA will draft bylaws to control and organize farms. These bylaws should be
approved by the ministerial cabinet to be effective. Based on this law the poultry farms
and hatcheries bylaws were issued.                   The Agricultural law also provide general
framework for animal diseases control (Chapter 4).

Based on this law (Article 63) any owner of animals should isolate animals suspected
with disease, and immediately report to closest veterinary department. The law also does
not allow the trade of diseased animals and those that are suspected to be infected with

epizootic diseases. Article 65 of the law, forbids discarding dead animals in the open, or
in public places, and should be disposed off based on the regulations that will be set by
MOA, and in coordination with respective ministries and authorities away from water
resources. However, these regulations were not issued yet. The law gives the authority
to the minister to issue regulations targeting the following (Article 65):
1) Provide a list of infectious animal diseases and epizootic diseases, and methods to
prevent occurrences of such diseases, and procedures to prevent spread of these diseases
2) Procedures required to control sick animals, their treatment or culling.
3) Owners of farm are obligated to register and vaccinate their animals at locations
assigned by the Ministry.
4) Vaccination of animals and disinfection of farms periodically:
5) The minister can announce an area contaminated with a certain disease and take
appropriate measures.
6) Organize and control the isolation and quarantine of sick animals
7) Provide a list of diseases that are common to both human and animals, and methods to
control these diseases in coordination with appropriate institutions.

3.3.4) Environmental Law18: Law No. 7 for the year 1999 regarding the
Environment
This law identifies waste, hazardous materials, and hazardous waste. It is also based on
the polluter pays principle. Although the law does not indicate that culled animals due to
an infectious disease and their waste as hazardous waste directly, it however implies that
these waste are considered hazardous. The definition of hazardous waste based on this
law is: any waste generated by the various activities and operation or the ash thereof
which preserve the characteristics of hazardous substance, where hazardous substance is
defined as any substance of combination of substances, which because of its hazardous
characteristics poses a danger on the environment as toxic, radioactive, biologically
infectious, explosive or flammable substances. Culled animals due to an infectious
disease and their waste are biologically infectious material, therefore are regulated under
the environmental law, and the disposal method of this waste should be approved by
EQA. Also, this law identifies (Article 12) that handling hazardous waste, should be in
accordance to terms, regulations, instructions and norms specified by EQA in
coordination with specialized agencies. Therefore, transport, storage, use, treatment and
disposal of culled animals and their waste, should be according to these norms and
regulations. However, these norms and regulations are not issued yet, therefore, it is
subjective to the opinion of the EQA employees.

3.3.5) Water Law No. 3 for the year 200219.
The law gives the Water Authority the right to consider any area as a conservation area if
this area poses a threat on the groundwater resources (Article 31). In addition, the Water
Authority has the right to inspect any site that is suspected to cause water pollution. The
law is based on polluter pays principle (Article 32).

3.3.6) Presidential decree to establish National Committee on Avian Influenza
Control (NCAIC)
On 24 March 2006, the Palestinian authority via a presidential decree (No. 17)20
established the NCAIC. The committee is formed of the following members:
   1) Minister of Health (Chair)
   2) Deputy Minister of Agriculture (Deputy ­ Chair)
   3) Deputy Minister of Finance
   4) Deputy Minister of National Economics
   5) Deputy Minister of Civil Affairs
   6) Coordinator of the Governorates' Affairs
   7) Representative of the Environment Quality Authority (EQA)
   8) Representative of the Association of Poultry Growers
   9) Representative of the Palestinian Agricultural relief committees (PARC)
The main responsibilities of the NCAIC are:
   1) Take preventive measures to minimize the spread of the disease between birds
        according to international standards.
   2) Take preventive measures to prevent the cross transfer of disease from animal to
        human according to international standards
   3) Take necessary quarantine and treatment measures in the areas with pandemic in
        the case of transfer of the disease to humans.
   4) Management of the awareness programs regarding AI.
   5) Take necessary measures to control the movement of people and products related
        to the AI.
   6) Take necessary measures regarding the import and export of products related to
        the AI.
   7) To deal with the economic consequences of the spread of disease between birds
        and its transfer to humans.
   8) Provide necessary funds and set up a plan for compensation.
   9) Follow up the implementation of decisions taken by the committee in
        coordination with technical and security institutions.
   10) Coordinate with neighboring countries as well as international bodies the
        technical and financial assistance.

3.3.7) Poultry Farms bylaw
This bylaw identifies that the definition of a farm is any farm in which poultry production
is practiced according to certain technical standards, whether it has natural ventilation
(open), or forced aeration and that the size of the farm is more than 300 meters square.
Therefore, this bylaw does not take into consideration the small scale farms. This by law
identifies that each farm to be licensed requires that the farm is following bio-security
regulations issued by the ministry of Agriculture.               However these bio-security
regulations not issued yet, in addition farms has very low bio-security measures in the
farms.




20Official gazette ­ Palestinian Facts ­ June 2006, Page 30-32


                                                     16

The bylaw identifies that in case a disease has been identified in a farm, the Veterinary
services and Animal health department has to be immediately informed, so they can take
samples and follow appropriate procedures according to results of the laboratory tests.

3.3.8) Poultry Hatcheries bylaw
This bylaw states that each hatchery should be licensed, and the requirement for
obtaining this license is to follow the bio-security regulations issued by the Ministry of
Agriculture. However these bio-security regulations are not issued yet. Also the by law
identifies that in case a disease has been identified in a farm, the veterinarian services to
be immediately informed, so they can take samples and follow appropriate procedures
according to results of the laboratory tests.

3.3.9) Bylaw for licensing poultry and animal farms for the year 2005 (Gaza)
This bylaw defines additional regulations regarding the location of farms in Gaza. This
law complements the agricultural law, as it clearly indicates that any licensing of a farm
should be according to procedures and regulations issued by the MOA. So it is a
complementary bylaw to define areas in which farms are permitted in Gaza. This bylaw
is applicable only to Gaza Strip.

3.3.10 A and 10 B) Regulation on Animal diseases
There is no actual difference between these two regulations; they are identical in terms of
their articles with the difference of the authorities, between the Jordanian and British
Mandate Authority. Otherwise from technical point of view the laws regulate the actions
during animal epizootic. Law No. 43 (1945) issued by the British mandate is valid in
both Gaza and the West Bank as long as it does not contradict with other laws. However
Law No. 39 for the year 1954 issued by the Jordanians and valid only in the West Bank
as long as it does not contradict with other laws. Considering that it has not issued any
bylaws to define the procedures for animal disease in Palestine, the procedures in these
laws are still valid, with regards to how to deal with an epizootic disease, starting from
reporting, quarantine within the farm, disinfection, culling and disposal. These two by
laws identify how to deal with a potential animal epizootic. Also it identifies the link
with the Ministry of Health in case diseases are transferable to humans at the district
level.

In case of an epizootic the owner should inform the official governmental veterinarian,
who will in his/her turn inform the veterinary service department at MOA. This official
governmental veterinarian might take isolation measures for the animals and siege the
area.   Then this official governmental veterinarian has to report this to the veterinarian
department at the ministry, which in turn if convinced to be true, would report to the
minister.   When animals die due to disease, the official governmental veterinarian can
issue instructions to dispose the carcasses, as well as the bedding, manure, feed...etc.

The official governmental veterinarian is allowed to take samples for laboratory analysis,
also has the authority to treat the infected animals.           The official governmental
veterinarian has the authority to order disinfection of the farm. He/she has the authority
to prevent trade of animals to prevent the spread of the disease. Also the official



                                             17

governmental veterinarian has the authority to enter any facility that has animals,
including any transportation means.

If necessary, culling and disposal of carcasses, bed, manure and contaminated feed
should be conducted. The disposal can be conducted by the farmer on own land, or
public land that does not have a fence. Also disinfection of the disposal area should take
place. If culling is seem necessary then the law identified compensation mechanism.

In case of identification of a farm with zoonotic disease a written document that identifies
the quarantine area is issued by the veterinary services and the following rules are in
effect:
    1) Animal movement is not allowed without a special permit from the veterinarian
        services.
    2) All animals have to be away from the public roads.
    3) Veterinarian service can ask the owner of the farm to isolate animals.
    4) No person shall leave the area, unless has already followed all instructions
        regarding prevention of disease spread that might be issued by the official
        governmental veterinarian.
    5) If an animal dies due to a disease, then either it can burned immediately, or buried
        at a depth of at least 2 meters.
    6) Nothing that has been used by the dead animal can be transported outside the
        area, unless special permit is given by the veterinary department.
    7) If the disease is transferred to humans, the veterinary services have to
        immediately report to the nearest official health department.

3.3.11) Regulation on animal quarantine 1931.
This regulation controls the movement of animals and the procedures required for import
and export of animals, including testing, health certificate, quarantine until proven to be
safe to import...etc.

3.3.12) Regulation on animal diseases: import of poultry. (Gaza only 1931)
This regulation adds only minor details to the animal quarantine, however specific to the
poultry import. It also indicates the disposal of manure bedding and feed that has been
in contact with poultry at the transportation. It also indicates that if a disease is inspected
in the imported poultry it should be either burned or buried.

3.3.13) Regulation on animal disease: epizootic diseases among poultry (Gaza only
1928).
The law forbids trade in poultry that are infected with zoonotic disease. Also its transport
of these poultry is not allowed.

    1) Every infected or suspected to be infected bird has to be culled and disposed by
        either burning or burying.
    2) Every bird that has been in contact with a suspected bird will be culled or isolated,
        depending on the official governmental veterinarian opinion that the birds can be
        isolated.



                                             18

     3) For two months, no birds can be placed in the infected farm area.
     4) All areas, in which the bird was in contact, has to be disinfected, including all
         utensils, feed, saw dust. The disinfection cost should be paid by the farm owner.
     5) All manure as well as any feed or bedding that has been in contact with the bird
         will be immediately disposed off by either: 1) burning, or 2) burying in ground
         with quicklime.

In addition, procedures for cleaning and disinfection are clearly identified in this bylaw;
these include the way of cleaning, and disinfection materials to be used. The disposal of
culled and dead animals should be conducted by village council either by burning or
burying at a depth of one meter or burn it at the expenses of the farm owner. This bylaw
prevents the movement of birds to and from the contaminated farm, including making
sure those birds do not leave the premises and that they are properly fenced.

3.3.14) The Palestinian Environmental Impact Assessment Policy
This policy defines the activities subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA),
basic principles underling the policy, responsibility for implementation, the reviewing
committee for EIA, stakeholder consultation...etc.

3.3.15 Recommendations for improving the regulatory setting with regards to Avian
Influenza    21

1) Regulation on animal carcasses that have died or were killed following a pathogenic
infection, need to be established. It is suggested that the regulation if developed should
have more than one method of disposal, as some of animal diseases are not
decontaminated by burial and would require burning or some form incineration. Several
methods for safe disposal of these carcasses are known internationally and can be adapted
to the local conditions. The regulation should include a specification of land reuse of the
disposal site if done by burial, and marking and labeling of the site. The perception of
some officials of the MOA is that the land would be safe for reuse for agriculture or other
developments after a short period of time.                    However, other countries have issued
regulations that do not allow the reuse of land for 10 years. In a country like Palestine
where land is limited there should be a time frame identified that is both safe and
practical for the reuse of land.           For project implementation, the procedures for culling
and disposal that will be developed as part of the UNTF project can substitute the lack of
these regulations with regards to Avian Influenza. The culling and disposal procedures
can also form the basis for drafting the recommended by law.                           Expected date of
completion of these procedures is April 2008.
2) Develop the regulations and bylaws on the bio-security for farms and hatcheries by
MOA. Until these regulations are developed, the MOA is recommended to use the OIE
biosecurity regulations. It is recommended that MOA develop these bylaws as soon as
possible. If this cannot be achieved due to lack of resources, Veterinary Service and
Animal Health department at MOA should adapt OIE biosecurity guidelines for farms as
part of the licensing and inspection procedure.



21It is very difficult to estimate a time period for these recommendations given the current instability of the
country.


                                                       19

3) Finalize and submit the hazardous waste regulations and the medical waste
regulations. Both regulations will give handling procedures for laboratory waste disposal
for both the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Health. Currently, work is
undergoing to draft the Medical waste regulations or by laws as part of the Medical
Waste Project at UNDP. Considering that the process of drafting and approving bylaws
from ministerial cabinet is a lengthy process, waste management manuals will be
developed for MOH and MOA laboratories to ensure that waste management practices
would comply with international standards until local standards and bylaws are issued.
These manuals should be developed as early as possible in the project.
4) There is a need to have an agreement on the ministerial level or within the Ministerial
cabinet on the roles of EQA and MOH regarding waste management, including
hazardous, and medical. As the law on environment gives this responsibility to EQA,
while the Public Health law gives it to the Ministry of Health. This has created un-clarity
and conflict in the role of these institutions regarding the hazardous waste management.
Currently meetings are taking place between the two institutions to agree on a work plan
regarding hazardous waste management and to clarify the roles of the two institutions on
the issue. A legal advisor that is hired by Medical Waste Project at UNDP/PAPP is
working on this issue with the two institutions. Expected date for finalizing of the work
of the legal advisor December 2007 that will include the final draft of the medical waste
bylaw. Until an agreement is reached, the environmental specialist that will be hired by
the project implementation unit will ensure that all mitigation measures are implemented
according to this EMP and will report to both institutions22.
5) There is a need to identify a mechanism for ministries to be able to supervise and
monitor other ministries' activities that affect their line of work. Currently, there is a
common understanding that no ministry monitors other ministries' facilities; and any
monitoring is done by a committee from within the ministry itself. Being a governmental
facility, should not waive the authority of other ministries or authorities to monitor these
facilities with regards to their work. As indicated in the basic law, each institution should
abide to the law, the question remains, why do not relevant ministries monitor the
implementation of laws in the governmental sector. This is a recommendation on the
national level, and should be considered by the legislative council and is beyond the
scope of this project. The existence of the NCAIC will ensure that coordination and
cooperation between the different institutions is taking place, including MOH, MOA and
EQA.      In addition, the only task that would require monitoring from one ministry or
governmental agency to another is related to hazardous waste management, and this will
be addressed as indicated in recommendation no. 5 above.
6) Work on approving the Quarantine bylaw drafted by the Ministry of Agriculture.
7) Drafting a bylaw on animal diseases that can replace the laws issued in 1945 and 1954
as the specifications indicated in these laws are outdated. The current guidelines and plan
regarding AI issued by the MOA addresses issues covered in the animal diseases by laws
with regards to Avian Influenza. This plan is presented in section 4.




22The two institutions believe that hazardous waste management is within their responsibility, which
means that the monitoring will be conducted twice rather than not being done at all.

3.4 WHO and FAO/OIE Guidelines
FAO and OIE in collaboration with Who had a strategy to minimize the global threat and
risk of HPAI in both humans and poultry, through progressive control and eradication of
HPAI, particularly caused by H5N1 virus. The strategy would be implemented on three
phases; immediate short term (1-3 years), short to medium term (4-6 years); and medium
to long term (7-10 years0. The spread of H5N1 will have progressively controlled in
domestic poultry of infected countries, and prevented from affecting countries that are
not affected, however at high risk. The strategy originally prepared to control HPAI in
Asia is being revised by FAO and OIE to take into account the current spread on the
disease outside Asia. The strategy will be complemented by more detailed country
specific HPAI control plans. FAO/OIE have also issued specific recommendations for
avian influenza and OIE has recently issued recommendations for each region, in
addition to its standards and guidelines provided for the prevention and control of HPAI
in animals. The summary of the strategy of FAO/OIE is presented in Annex 1.

The Recommended Strategic Action plan prepared by WHO for Responding to the Avian
Influenza Pandemic Threat lays out activities for individual countries, the international
community, and WHO to prepare for a pandemic and mitigate its impact. The objectives
of the plan correspond to the opportunities and capacities to intervene and are structured
in three phases: (i) pre-pandemic ­ supporting the FAO/OIE's control strategy; increasing
collaboration between animal and health services; strengthening Strengthen the early
warning system, (ii) emergence of a pandemic ­ containing or delaying spread at the
source - and (iii) pandemic declared and spreading internationally ­ reducing morbidity,
mortality and social disruption; conducting research to guide response measures. WHO
has also prepared a global plan and guidelines for pandemic preparedness and is in the
process of developing a model country plan that will allow countries to assess their state
of preparedness and identify priority needs. The summary of WHO guidelines is
presented in Annex 2. In addition to the WHO guidelines, the International Health
Regulations are being adapted by the Ministry of Health. A brief of these regulations is
presented in Annex 3.

4. Institutional setting
As described in the laws above there are three major governmental bodies that have
responsibilities related to the Avian and Human Influenza Prevention and Control
Project; Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, and the Environment Quality
Authority. Ministry of Health is the main health care provider in Palestine. MOH has
the regulatory responsibility of the Health system.      The Ministry of Agriculture is the
regulatory body for veterinarian services and animal health; it also provides veterinary
services at the governorate levels.           The EQA is the regulatory authority for
environmental issues. It also holds the responsibility of implementing the environmental
law in cooperation with other agencies to ensure that the environment is protected for
current and future generations. The EQA requires that major agricultural projects should
undergo an environmental impact assessment. Also the EQA has the authority to enter
and inspect any facility that is suspected to pose negative threat to the environment.




                                              21

Cooperation between these three governmental entities is essential to respond to a
possible outbreak in AI. The establishment of the NCAIC was critical to improve
coordination and flow of information among these institutions at the central level. On the
governorate level, a committee that is chaired by the governor was established. The
members of this committee are the MOH, MOA, EQA, Ministry of Public Works, and
Ministry of Local Government. The role of this committee is to facilitate the work of the
Rapid Response and Culling teams that will be supervising the actual culling and
disposal.   Box 1 describes the Rapid Response and Culling teams members and
responsibilities. There are 12 RRCT in the West Bank, in Gaza strip these teams are not
yet established, but it is expected to have 5 teams. There are four coordinators in the
West Bank for these teams. In addition to this level, there is Task Force on Avian
Influenza at MOA that mobilizes the teams. The members and tasks of this task force
are shown in Box 2.      There are two task forces at the Ministry of Agriculture, one in
Gaza Strip, and the other in the West Bank.       Annex 4 shows the current institutional
setting and the mechanism of response of the MOA to the AI outbreak. The mechanism
to respond to AI as documented in Annex 4 include the type of information and forms
that need to be filled and reported. It is recommended that additional forms to be filled
for the health and environmental issues. For the health forms, it is recommended to
include 1) records about workers and supervisors at the site, 2) their health status, 3)
vaccination, 4) past health history, and 5) use of PPE. As for the environmental forms it
is recommended to include 1) the location of the burial pit, 2) the disposal operations, 3)
the factors considered in the site selection process, 4) its preferred if the site is also
identified by GPS to add on a map, 5) water sensitivity, 6) dimensions of the burial site,
and 7) site marking information. A copy of the environmental form should be given to
EQA, MOH-Environmental Health department, the Ministry of Local Government, and
the Water Authority.

Box 1: Rapid Response and Culling Teams (RRCT) ­ MOA
Members:
    1) Director Veterinary Department ­ Chairman
    2) Head of poultry Section within the District of Agricultural Department
    3) Any other local staff (one or more) would be nominated by the Director of
        Veterinary Service and Animal Health
    4) In addition to the representatives of the relevant stakeholders at the governorate
        level (Recommendations to include EQA employees to help in site selection and
        monitor disposal process in a sound environmental manner was suggested during
        the consultation about this plan, and already agreed upon by the Ministry of
        Agriculture and EQA for the West Bank).         The previous experience in Gaza
        indicates that the culling teams (although were not named as such) included EQA.
Roles and responsibilities:
    1) identifying the infected farms and disposal sites;
    2) setting out a date and pre-informing farmers
    3) undertaking culling according to the international standards
    4) Signing and approving the culling forms
    5) Keeping one copy of culling at the Veterinary Service and Animal Health
        Department



                                              22

    6) Following up all the instructions given by the AIHNCC
    7) Coordinating the culling process with team members
    8) Any other needed activities

Box 2: Task Force on Avian Influenza at MOA
Roles and responsibility: it is located within the Ministry of Agriculture, General
Directorate Services and Animal Health, and is responsible of:
        1) Directing the operational component
        2) Monitoring the spread of the disease and
        3) Coordinating with Israeli counterpart.
Members: officers within the Ministry of Agriculture, General Directorate of Veterinary
Services and Animal Health.

During the previous outbreak in Gaza, the culling teams' concept was not established.
Nevertheless, the cooperation and division of tasks between the different institutions was
very successful, and it is recommended that this task distribution is followed in the future
(Box 3).

Box 3: previous experience in Gaza Governorate, the responsibilities of different
stakeholders in the culling and disposal23:
1) The governorate of Gaza with the EQA will choose the burial site and supervise its
lining, the burial and disposal of carcasses based on environmental standards. The
governorate will provide the logistical support.
2) The Ministry of Agriculture will supervise the culling process and its transfer to the
disposal site safely, and provision of the plastic and lime and the formalin24 to disinfect
the site of work.
3) The Ministry of Health provides Tamiflu vaccine and supervises the safety of workers
and farmers and surrounding communities.

If a possible outbreak of AI in West Bank and Gaza occurs, it would require an organized
and systematic response. This will require that different sectors should work together in
a coordinated mater. Therefore, the establishment of the NCAIC has helped in linking
MOH, MOA, EQA, and other stakeholders to work together. Although, one committee
includes all stakeholders, two plans were issued one by the MOH, and the other by the
MOA to respond the risk of Avian Influenza. The Ministry of Health has issued the
Palestinian National Plan for Pandemic Influenza in 2005. For details of the plan see
Annex 4. In addition, MOA issued a National Avian Influenza Control and Eradication
Plan (AICEP) to support the initiative of the MOH. It is recommended that these plans
should be translated into one operational plan that include both ministries as well as the
EQA, and that the operational plans include standard operating procedures for each step,
and identification the role of each ministry / authority in these procedures.               It is
recommended that these operational plans would include not only positions of

responsible persons, but also names of personnel and their contact numbers at all levels,
starting from the ministerial level represented by the NCAIC, and ending with local or
governorate level for all stages of operation.

5. Potential Environmental Impacts and Proposed Mitigation Measures
Activities under this project are not expected to generate significant adverse
environmental effects as they are focused largely on public sector capacity building and
improved readiness for dealing with outbreaks of AI in domestic poultry and potential
human pandemic. These prevention focused activities are expected to have a positive
environmental impact as the project's investment in facilities, equipment, laboratories,
and training for border inspection points and for veterinary and public health services and
laboratories will improve the effectiveness and safety over existing AI handling and
testing procedures by meeting international standards established. This would be
reinforced by mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into protocols and procedures
for the culling and disposal animals during AI outbreaks, decontamination of facilities,
and laboratory biosafety. In addition, waste management manuals for laboratories will be
developed as part of the implementation of this plan according to international good
practice guidelines, and training on these manuals will take place to facilitate the
management of waste accordingly.

The main areas of environmental risks from the project activities are the inadvertent
spread of the AI virus during culling, transport, and disposal of carcasses, animal waste,
liter, and used protective gear, contamination of surface and groundwater fro use of
disinfectants and laboratory biosafety and waste management.           In addition, minor
environmental disturbances may occur during renovation of laboratories. Most of the key
potential impacts could be avoided or minimized as described below by integrating
environmental and public health safety aspects in the preparation/design and
implementation of project activities.

The following are the Project activities and components that may give rise to potential
adverse environmental effects:

(a) Animal Health Component:
(i) Strengthening of veterinary services. Training of field staff and surveillance and
monitoring, equipping of a veterinary laboratory in Gaza as well as upgrading the
capacity of the existing laboratory in WB; training for field technicians.        The key
environmental issues that raise from these activities are those related to zoonotic disease
containment, laboratory waste management practices; and investments in improved bio-
security;
(ii) culling and disposal: This include stamping out by imposing a quarantine area,
slaughter of infected and potentially exposed birds, and decontamination of poultry
houses, sheds and contaminated areas, and disposal of carcasses and wastes. Improper
culling, transport and disposal of contaminated birds, bird products or waste (eggs,
manure and feathers) and equipment (for example in open containers) may pose
environmental and public health risks.




                                             24

Human Health Component: Strengthening the capacity of the existing laboratories, and
support the upgrading of diagnostic capacity of existing laboratories.                    The key
environmental issues from these activities are related to zoonotic disease prevention and
laboratory waste management.

Public Awareness and Environmental Management: No environmental issues, but an
important component for design and delivery of communications tools for good hygiene,
safe culling and disposal of animal carcasses and animal waste management.

The primary potential risks can be grouped into three categories:
(a) Inadvertent human exposure and spread of the virus due to: improper culling and
disposal of dead birds (wild birds, sick and dead birds from backyard and commercial
poultries); lack of, or improper use of personal protection equipment (PPE); improper
disposal of farm waste (i.e., bedding, manure, washings, etc. during and/or after an
outbreak); and inadequate lab biosafety protocols.
(b) Inadvertent release of chemicals in the environment from unsatisfactory
decontamination procedures (for personnel, poultry sheds, and transport vehicles, etc.).
(c) Release of chemicals and infectious agents into the environment from inadequate
laboratory and medical facility waste management.

Social Safeguards
There are no social safeguards triggered by the project, development of compensation
policies to affected poultry owners will contribute to mitigate the effects of losses
suffered from HPAI pandemic. The compensation manual has already been developed
under the UNTF project and adapted by the PA. This manual was formulated in
accordance with the recommendation of the World Bank Task Team Leader. Furthermore
the manual was developed according to the guidelines of FAO, OIE, World Bank, and the
International Food Policy Research Institute25. The manual and its procedures were
customized to accommodate the existing financial system in Palestine, in order to
establish its implementation and sustainability. In addition, the compensation manual
addresses all poultry growers in the WBG regardless of their size, type, or legal status
(licensed or not).

There will be no land acquisition (voluntary or involuntary) under the project, and
carcasses of culled birds will only be disposed on public land.                 Therefore, social
safeguard OP/BP 4.12 on involuntary resettlement is not triggered. For backyard poultry
operations, the local committee witnessing the culling and the local official governmental
veterinarian sign a document stating the carcass deposit area for is public property and
free of encroachers/ informal settlements. In case of semi-commercial poultry farms, the
zonal veterinarian and an official from the local administration will sign a document
stating that the carcass deposit area is public land and free of encroachers/informal
settlements.

5.1 Mitigation Measures for Animal Health Component

5.1.1. Culling, Transport and Disposal activities shall be carried out in accordance with
the procedures defined by the FAO/OIE and the Ministry of Agriculture. Guidelines of
the MOA are shown below with recommendations for each step, these guidelines are
compatible with OIE guidelines. OIE guidelines for disposal are presented in Annex 6
The main disposal method chosen by all stakeholders is the burial pit, that will be
constructed according to standards and specifications set by the Ministry of Agriculture.
The second disposal option was cremation, this option will be used for manure and other
wastes if burial would be impractical due to space limitations. Incineration, mobile and
fixed was seen too expensive to purchase and operate. In addition, incinerators if not
properly operated will cause severe air pollution, therefore incineration was not seen as
an option. Composting is not seen as a viable option even for manure because of lack of
biosecurity measures at the farms. All farms visited were accessible to wild birds; some
of them were accessible to rodents. Considering that these farms cannot be secured, the
composting option was discarded. These methods are generally presented with regards
to their environmental impact and include specifications on environmental safeguarding
in Annex 6. Box 4 displays the options for disposal with priorities.


Box 4: Disposal options prioritized
    1) A) Disposal of animal carcass on farm if the location within the farm area if
        acceptable (conditions for sitting the disposal location that are shown in Annex 6
        should be met).
        B) Disposal of other contaminated waste in the same burial pit with the animal
        carcass.
        C) Cremation of waste other than animal carcass on farm if space is limited to
        include other wastes with the animal carcass in the burial pit. Cremation should be
        performed according to the specification in Annex 6.
    2) A) Disposal of animal carcass in a burial pit outside the farm.
        B) Transport of animal carcass to an offsite location if the farm area does not
        allow for disposal. This site should be located within the 3 kilometers zone in
        which culling will take place. No transfer of poultry will take place outside the
        infected zone.
        C) Cremation of waste other than animal carcass on farm if transport of these
        wastes is not feasible. Cremation should be performed according to the
        specification in Annex 6.
    3) If options 1 and 2 are not feasible, then cremation onsite of all animal carcass and
        waste should take place.          Cremation should be performed according to the
        specification in Annex 6.

The Rapid Response and Culling Teams will decide upon the siting the burial pit. The
EQA will prepare plans in coordination with competent bodies26 for water sensitivity, and
soil permeability that will help the environmentalist participant in the RRCT to make a

                                                   26

decision on a location. The environmentalist will take into consideration the following
issues before giving an approval on the site; 1) sensitivity to water resources, 2) soil
permeability, 3) distance to human settlements, 4) accessibility to digging equipment, 5)
slope of the land, and 6) availability of space for temporary storage of soil.

The persons involved in culling, transport and disposal operations need to have Personal
Protection Equipment, be vaccinated by the Ministry of Health, and to have undergone
specific, required training for such activities.           Transport vehicles also need to be
approved prior to use, while transport personnel needs to meet all the requirements set
forth for personnel dealing with culling and disposal.

The Standard Operating Procedures for culling, transport and disposal are not
issued yet, therefore it is recommended to start this activity as soon as possible. In
addition, training on these procedures is recommended. Both of these activities are
covered under the UNTF project activities. Although the operating procedures are not in
place, there is a common acceptance among the stakeholders that OIE standards will be
followed. The following guidelines are agreed upon by Ministry of Agriculture for
culling, transport and disposal until the standard operating procedures manual will be
prepared. The Standard operating procedures for culling, transport and disposal will be
ready by April 2008.            Recommendations for improvement are embedded in the
guidelines is in italic.

Guidelines for culling, transport and operation27:
    1) Divide the country in geographical units, and prevent animal transfer from one
        area to another. (Requires a ministerial decree).
    2) All poultry within 3 km radius will be culled. According to the number of
        outbreaks and poultry population density, the department of Veterinarian Services
        and Animal health will decide whether to cull or vaccinate poultry between three
        and 10 kilometers of the outbreak. Active monitoring and surveillance will take
        place for the zone 3 to 10 kilometers.
    3) Animal slaughter is not allowed unless at designated locations (requires a
        ministerial decree)
    4) Birds that require culling should be placed in plastic bags;
        Recommendations: There should be a clear specification of how to collect the
        live birds in plastic bags without releasing too much aerosols in the atmosphere28.
        Whatever the method for collecting the birds and placing them in bags chosen, it
        should be clarified. Any safety procedure, or PPE use should be clearly identified
        and the RCCT should be properly trained to supervise bird collection and culling.
        The RRCT are going to be supervising workers and ensuring that all operations
        are conducted according to procedures. The actual work is expected to be
        conducted by a contractor. Training of potential contractor workers should take
        place one day before commencing the procedures, and the training should be


27Note: Some of these guidelines were in the National AI Control and Eradication Plan, the rest was agreed
upon by the Veterinary Services and Animal Health Department during the preparation of the EMP.
28(In 2006 in Gaza, these birds were poisoned, which made the collection of the birds with minimal
aerosols production).


                                                  27

         included in the contract. If these birds to be cremated, the plastic bags should not
         be burned as this will lead to dioxin production.
     5) After birds are collected in these bags they are placed in culling chambers using
         carbon dioxide29. Other methods can be used if Carbon Dioxide chambers are not
         available, however should be according to OIE guidelines for culling. The current
         requirements issued by MOA are:
              a. Prior to introduction of carbon dioxide, the chamber must be appropriately
                   sealed to allow control over the carbon dioxide concentration
              b. The culling chamber should be gradually filled with carbon dioxide so that
                   all birds are exposed to a concentration above 40% until the birds are
                   dead.
                   Recommendations: In addition to the above recommendations on the use
                   of the chambers, Standard operating procedures for this step should
                   include; 1) how many birds can be placed in the chamber at a time, 2)
                   how to place the birds in the chamber, 3) retention time, 4) how to empty
                   the birds from the chambers, 5) where to place the birds when emptying
                   the chambers, 6) how to disinfect these chambers after the culling process.
     6) All Culled birds to be buried as follow:
              Recommendations; the environmental considerations should be specified
              clearly on ground water protection of the site. Considerations of the water
              sensitivity, proximity to springs and wells, and soil permeability should be
              considered. The EQA officials indicated that they will prepare appropriate
              maps with the support of other Agencies, such as Water Authority and the
              Ministry of Planning detailing issues of importance to help in the selection of
              the burial sites.
              a. Favorable location of burial is onsite, however if that is not possible, then
                   transportation to an offsite location should take30.                In this case, all
                   procedures followed should that takes into considerations safe
                   environmental and biosafety standards.
                   Recommendations: Because biosafety standards are not issues yet, it is
                   important to make sure that these procedures include transportation in
                   closed containers, use of PPE, and disinfection of vehicles.
              b. Excavate the burial pit with the following dimensions: 4 meters depth, 2
                   meters width, the length of the burial pit depends on the amount of the
                   waste and carcasses that need to be buried.
              c. This hole should be lined with quicklime.
                   Recommendations: it suggested issuing specification for the quicklime;
                   including the approximate thickness, or the amount of quicklime required
                   per square meter. In addition, a clear differentiation between quicklime



29 Note: When communicating with the Ministry of agriculture, it was indicated that the bags would be
open, although not mentioned in the plan, and that the six mobile chambers were build, each can hold about
800 birds.
30 The ministry of agriculture, indicated that probably only about 40% of the farms will be able to have
onsite burial in case of an epidemic; the rest (about 60%) will probably has to be transported to a different
site, considering the current geographical and demographical conditions.


                                                     28

                 and slaked lime should be indicated, as many might use slaked lime
                 instead of quicklime.
            d. All sides of the specific hole should be covered by HDPE plastic above
                 the quicklime. Thickness of 0.15mm. This plastic is widely available in
                 the country as it is used in agricultural practices, and usually is delivered
                 in less than a day. In addition, this plastic has low permeability and can be
                 ordered in any size required, so it can be ordered according to the size of
                 the burial pit.
                 Recommendations: need specification of type, grade, thickness, and
                 permeability.31
            e. The hole should be sanitized by anti viral reagents. A list of disinfectants
                 and concentrations will be issued by MOA, and the RRCT will guide the
                 proper and safe use of these chemicals.               Only chemical accepted
                 internationally will be used.
            f. The carcasses are then placed in the burial pit.
            g. Add 40 cm of excavated soil.
            h. Add an unbroken layer of slaked lime.
            i. Cover with plastic
                 Recommendations: The type of plastic, grade, and thickness should be
                 identified.
            j. Cover with soil (at least 2 meters of soil is required in total).
            k. The location of the burial site is then disinfected with anti viral drugs.
            l. The team leader should ensure that health and safety measures of the
                 personnel and biosecurity measures were implemented properly to prevent
                 transmission of the AI to humans and to other locations.
            m. Team leader should provide a descriptive report a the conclusion of the
                 culling procedures, and report on the progress and on any problems
            n. Recommendations: It is recommended to add a step for marking the site,
                 and its identification on the map.
            o. Recommendation: It is recommended that a report regarding the site use
                 and location to be given to the local governmental unit if available and to
                 the Ministry of Local Government, as they are authorized body to give
                 licenses for construction.
    7) Recommendation: It is recommended that the Ministry of Health at the
        governorate level would keep records of all workers, farmers and supervisors at
        the culling and disposal sites, and to follow up their health status afterwards.
        Currently the ministry of Health is in charge of vaccinating these workers and
        supervisors.
    8) All manure and effluents should be burned, and then sanitization to the premises
        and all area around it should be done.
    9) Disposal and or disinfection of the PPE standard procedures should be in place.
    10) Recommendation It is recommended that standard operating procedures for
        vehicles disinfection should be established.



31 In Gaza, they used Grade 2 as they could not afford paying for grade 1. Grade 2 would have some
production problems, and might have holes and leak.


                                                  29

    11) Recommendation It is recommended: that standard operating procedures for
        disinfection of the farm should be established, it should include 1) the frequency
        of disinfecting the site,2) the time required between two disinfection events after
        an AI outbreak, and 3) the time when the farm can resume operations.

Strengthening the laboratory capacity The project will address laboratory waste
management through specific training based on guidelines such as the International Best
Practice in Safety of Research Laboratories (Annex 7), or the Guidance on the Biosafety
Level for Laboratories (Annex 8). It is important to note that this segment will focus on
existing structures and will not entail large-scale construction. Because biosafety Level II
and Level III is required for laboratories handling HPAI, these laboratories would have to
meet certain criteria, which include 1) containment of pathogenic agents, 2) access
control, 3) release solely of disinfected and harmless agents, 4) the development of
currently non-existent biosafety and waste management laboratory manuals, and 5)
conduct training on these manuals for laboratory technicians.          The project activities
include these mitigation measures except for developing the manuals for biosafety, and
developing the manuals for waste management. The EA recommends biosafety manual
as well as waste management manual to be developed. This activity will require a
budget that was not included in the animal component and should be utilized from the
implementation of the environmental management plan component.                 The EA also
recommends training of laboratory technicians on biosafety, however this activity
will be conducted by the support of FAO as agreed upon with the MOA.

The Ministry of Agriculture referral laboratories, the current laboratory practice is below
biosafety and biosecurity standards. There is a need to have an autoclave that is big
enough to disinfect all contaminated waste with pathogenic AI. Currently, the hoods are
not installed, and safety cabinets are not installed as well, all air is released without any
filters posing a threat of release of the virus to the atmosphere. Wastewater produced
from the laboratory is not treated, and even it is not decontaminate. The project under
UTNF grant includes construction of the referral laboratory in Birzeit. This laboratory
will be constructed according to international biosecurity and biosafety standards and will
accommodate sections with biosecurity levels 2 and 3. Meanwhile, the purchase of the
autoclave is a necessity to disinfect liquid and solid waste produced, as the size of the
autoclave in the laboratory is too small and located at another floor.

The referral laboratory is currently conducts pathology of animals.            In the newly
established laboratory, a separate section will be for pathology. Although it is better to
obtain samples for AI at the farm, and chicken should not be transported outside the farm,
in case of suspicion in AI. However, when farmers bring animal to the laboratory for
pathology test, therefore the laboratory have to dispose the carcasses properly. Currently
all carcasses is placed in an autoclave bag, closed and placed in the municipal solid waste
container, that is open and accessible for public and wild animals.

It is recommended to equip the agricultural laboratories with incinerators for carcasses
disposal that arrives to the laboratory, particularly those that are infected with zoonotic
disease or cannot be disposed otherwise.          However, these incinerators should be



                                              30

provided with air purifying units to minimize air pollution, and all plastic is prohibited to
enter to the incinerator as its burning leads to dioxin and furan production, well known to
be carcinogenic materials.      The operators for these incinerators should be properly
trained, and manual of operations should be included with the project. The disadvantage
of the incinerators, is its high cost, however it is characterized by a very high efficiency
in decontamination. The ashes produced should be handled as special hazardous waste
and disposed off accordingly. Monitoring of operation of these incinerators should take
place by both MOH and EQA. If incinerators cannot be purchased by the project, then
an alternative sanitary method for the disposal of carcasses produced from the laboratory
on daily basis should be determined and utilized.

The EA recommends that necessary equipment to improve the biosafety of the
laboratory to be provided from the project activities, including an autoclave, an
incinerator or a disposal method for carcass from laboratories, and other equipment
required to reach the safety biosafety levels 2 and 3, such HEPA filter, ultraviolet
lamps...etc.

Chemical use needs to be limited to the chemicals listed in the official list to be included
within the updated contingency plan and strategic documents. The list of chemicals needs
to be discussed with EQA to ensure that these chemicals are not resistant for
biodegradation and will not cause harm to the environment. Chemicals, such as
disinfectants need to be carefully used according to the defined procedures, in order to
prevent excessive chemical inflow into the natural environment, and to prevent possible
poisoning.

5.2 Mitigation Measures for Human Health Component
The only project activity under the human health component that can pose a moderate
negative impact is strengthening the capacity of existing laboratories, including the
provision of equipment necessary for specimen collection, transportation, and testing. It
will also support upgrading of the diagnostic capacity of existing laboratories. The key
environmental issue for this component is related to zoonotic disease prevention and
special waste management.

The Ministry of Health has a referral laboratory for samples from humans such as blood,
urine, swaps for diseases, as well as testing water, food, and drugs. The laboratory has
the ability to conduct both chemical and bacteriological tests. The current laboratory has
a room with biosafety level 2. However the HEPA filters have not been maintained or
changed since installation, all ultraviolet lamps were not maintained. In addition, spare
ultraviolet lamps are not available. There are no emergency eye wash facilities in the
laboratories, and all liquid waste is disposed off in the sink without any treatment. The
only treatment of waste in the laboratory is for infectious materials. Other hazardous
chemicals are disposed without any control.           A problem that has been facing the
Laboratory is disposal of hazardous waste, in the past an Israeli company used to take the
waste to an Israeli facility. However for the past 6 years this company did not come due
to political reasons. In addition, there is no Palestinian hazardous waste storage or
treatment facility in the West Bank. Therefore, there is a need to find a temporary



                                              31

storage facility until a final solution is found at the national level. In Gaza city there is a
cell for storage of hazardous waste that can be used for hazardous disinfected wastes
from laboratory facilities after he introduction of a proper management plan is
introduced.

Therefore, the EA recommends preparing operational manual for waste
management produced from the laboratory and equipping the laboratory with any
required equipment to reach the biosafety levels 3 and acceptable waste
management practices. Necessary equipment includes emergency eye wash devices,
maintenance of the HEPA filters, and ultraviolet lamps. After developing the hazardous
waste management plan, additional equipment might be necessary, and at that stage
should be included in the project.              In order to improve the biosafety levels, the
Laboratory biosafety Manual issued by WHO can be used in these laboratories32.

The major identified environmental impacts are presented in the Environmental
Management Plan, along with the proposed mitigation measures and monitoring
requirements are presented in Table 1.

6. Monitoring and Supervision
The monitoring activities are closely linked to the reporting procedure outlined in Section
12 and the Institutional and Implementation Arrangements in Sections 10and 11. During
outbreak among poultry, RRCT will conduct all necessary measures for containment and
control of the outbreak, including mitigation measures prescribed within this EMP, and
will report to TFAI, which in turn will report to the veterinarian services and animal
health department. This in turn reports to NCAIC as described in the plan of measures in
case of an outbreak of AI in Occupied Palestinian Territory.       Because environmental
mitigation measure implementation cannot be separated from the activities defined within
the national plans and guidelines, it is suggested that the RRCT will monitor all activities
related to culling, transport and disposal of carcasses and waste, as well as the use of
disinfectants. The team will report all activities, additional reporting on environmental
and health issues to be reported, will allow the monitoring process. The environmental
reporting will be done by the EQA member of the RRCT, i.e. an environmentalist;
therefore it is crucial that logistical support is provided to EQA staff to join the RRCT.
These reports can be discussed afterwards within the NCAIC to make sure that culling,
transport, and disposal were conducted according to environmental mitigation measures.
As for laboratories waste management, the law gives this authority to both EQA and
MOH. It is recommended that each governmental laboratory reports about its waste
management practices to both EQA and MOH / Environmental Health Department, and
that a copy of this report is been given to the NCAIC to make sure that implementation is
conducted according to mitigation measures suggested.

7. Legal Agreements
In keeping with good practice, all legal agreements dealing with the Project
implementation, made between the World Bank, the Palestinian Authority and
Implementing Units will reflect the major findings and issues pointed out in this
Environmental Assessment and shall be consistent with the project implementation plan
or operations manual.

8. Bidding Contracts
Requirements of the EMP can be broadly grouped into four different categories and
activities that can be conducted by subcontractors, for which specific requirements need
to be made. These groups of activities are as follows:
a. Minor construction works during rehabilitation of laboratory structures and healthcare
facilities
b. Inadvertent virus spread from outbreak sites, laboratories and diseased animal
management
c. Exposure or releases of chemicals used during disinfection
d. Transport of culled animals

The construction works and contractors would need to follow the FIDIC ­ International
Federation of Consulting Engineers (www.fidic.org) along with some of the general
clauses for good construction and engineering practice listed in Annex 9.

Laboratory Containment ­ during construction and rehabilitation of the laboratory, the
laboratory experts will closely participate in the rehabilitation process and will provide
input on the Biosafety requirements, including decisions on the material to be used,
containment of the laboratory, ventilation, filters, wastewater collection and disinfection,
UV light disinfection of air and surfaces, hazardous solid and liquid waste management
requirements.

Culling, Transport and Disposal activities shall be carried out in accordance with the
procedures defined by the FAO/OIE and the Ministry of Agriculture. The persons
involved in these operations need to have Personal Protection Equipment, be vaccinated
by the Ministry of Health, and to have undergone specific, required training for such
activities. Transport vehicles also need to be approved prior to use, while transport
personnel needs to meet all the requirements set forth for personnel dealing with culling
and disposal.

Chemical use needs to be limited to the chemicals listed in the official list to be included
within the future Contingency Plan and strategic documents. Chemicals, such as
disinfectants need to be carefully used according to the defined procedures, in order to
prevent excessive chemical inflow into the natural environment, and to prevent possible
poisoning.

                     To allow quick, however well planned
                     decision making on the site, maps will be
                     prepared by EQA for water sensitivity in

                     Area C according to OSLO II agreement to
                     obtain approval for proper disposal. This

10 Implementation arrangements
EQA and MOH overlapping/conflicting responsibilities particularly in relation to
disposal of waste, its monitoring, whether it be from laboratories or at the farms. This is
because of the overlapping in responsibilities as assigned by the laws. There is an urgent
need to solve this issue legally.         Although this overlapping responsibility and
arrangement for implementation of this project, the problem was solved at the district
level as the RRCT will monitor and supervise the implementation of the arrangements.
Also the existence of committees on the governorate level in which both are members
facilitate cooperation for implementation.       MOA and MOH has clear cut different
responsibilities with no overlap or conflict with regards to the AI activities.

11 Institutional arrangements

The establishment of the NCAIC was critical to improve coordination and flow of
information among member institutions at the central level. Members of this committee
include all important stakeholders, such as the MOH (chair), MOA (Deputy ­Chair),
MoF, EQA, Ministry of National Economics, Association of poultry growers, Ministry of
Civil affairs, Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees, and coordinator of the
governmental affairs.. On the governorate level, committee was established that is
chaired by the governor, in which members from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of
Agriculture, EQA, Ministry of Public Works, and Ministry of Local Government. The
role of this committee is to facilitate the work of the Rapid Response and Culling teams
that will be supervising the actual culling and disposal.        In addition, RRCC were
established to supervise and monitor culling, transport, disposal and disinfection during
an outbreak in poultry.

12 Reporting

Reporting of AI control and containment activities was discussed in the institutional
setting section. The reporting will follow the different stages of activities as described in
the plan of action in case of an AI suspected among poultry (see section 4.2). Also
reporting between sectors is at three levels, the governorate level, an intermediate level
(West Band /Gaza Strip), the national level, as well as at the regional level. The most
important that there is two way major communications between the MOA and the MOH
to report any suspect cases immediately to the NCAIC, and to inform each other at other
levels. After all reports are finalized, it is suggested that they will be summarized and
disseminate the reports to the project implementation unit and other agencies included in
the project.

13 Visits to Industrial and Backyard Poultry Farmers
Five farms and one hatchery were visited.          The distribution of the farms among
governorates, rural/urban, and type is shown in Table 2.

The farm in Hebron was a rural area farm, composed of 10,000 broilers. The farm was
seen to be on the first floor, while the owner lives on the upper floor with his family. The
farm did not have any biosecurity procedures, it was open to the atmosphere, and kids
were around the place.      The farmer indicated that there was a great economic loss last
year, when the AI hit Gaza Strip, and he could not sell his broilers which were ready to
sell just couple days after the disease was found in Gaza. The farmer use open burning to
dispose any dead birds if few, when many, the farmer takes the deceased animals to an
open area further away from his residence and dispose it off or burn it.

The farm visited in Beit Jala was a layers farm, and it also had about 10,000 chickens, the
farm capacity is about 20,000. The farmer had problems with rodents entering to the area
of the chicken, also some chicken were seen outside the barracks area.            Birds were
observed within the farm premises; the net covering the farm is not tight and has several
holes. This farm was in the backyard of the farmer. The owner indicated that the price of
eggs went down dramatically when AI cases were identified in Gaza, as many people
stopped eating poultry products.         The hatchery visited in Hebron had moderate
biosecurity procedures, the vehicles entering the farm was disinfected, then disinfectant
for shoes was at the door, and the area is cleaned and disinfectant regularly. The waste
from the hatchery is disposed off with municipal waste, on the day that waste is collected,
the hatchery manager call the municipality to collect the waste. A loading duck is
available for the waste hauling.

The commercial farm visited in Ramallah rural area (Ein Samia) had no biosecurity
procedures, wild bird shared the feed with poultry. The farm itself was in a building that
was used strictly for the farm. There was a barrel outside the farm in which carcass is
disposed off by burning. Many of the farms in Palestine are taking the form of backyard
(i.e. in the backyard, or downstairs), however at a commercial level, with 10,000 chicken
per circle.

Two backyard farms in an urban and rural area were visited in Ramallah governorate,
these farms, and raise animals for household consumption only.              The birds were
separated from other animals in most cases. Nets were available to prevent the entrance
of wild birds.

In general it was noticed that biosecurity levels are very law at all farms, and would
require an investment to improve these levels, to prevent entrance of rodents and wild
birds to the farms. It was noted that disinfection procedures for employees when entering
or existing farms were not in place in these farms; therefore, posing these farms to higher
risks. The current poultry practices are under developed in the biosecurity field, which
increase the risk of spreading the zoonotic disease rapidly. Special attention should be
given to those farms that are built in the backyard or inside the household. If any of the
backyard farms, particularly those inside the houses is infected, the risk to transmission to
human increases significantly.

15. Public Briefing:
Briefing held:        August 15th 2007, Rocky Hotel ­ Ramallah
Announcement Made     In Al-Quds and al-Ayyam Newspapers for two consecutive
                      days on August 10th and 11th 2007.
                      The announcement included the website where the EMP can
                      be obtained, time and location.
Invitations sent:     Individual invitations sent to all relevant ministries,
                      institutions, international organizations an NGOs.
EMP availability:     The EMP was available online at the following site:
                      http://www.undp.ps/en/aboutundp/forms.html
                      The EMP was drafted in English, although all
                      communications, consultations took place in local language.
                      The EMP will be translated into Local language after its final
                      approval from the World Bank.
Major points made:    The EA/EMP Report was presented in Arabic, accompanied
                      with a PowerPoint presentation in English. Discussion took
                      place in local language.
                      Major points presented were the requirements of the World
                      Bank, already defined project components, legal setting,
                      institutional setting, individual environmental impacts,
                      monitoring and reporting, local legislation, and responsibility
                      scheme.
Participants          The Minister of Health and the deputy of the Minister of
                      Agriculture opened the meeting.

                      35 participants attended the briefing; list of participants within
                      the public briefing and consultations is given in Annex 10.
Minutes of the Meeting
1. what is an         Some audience thought that the aim of the environmental
environmental         management plan is to prepare standard operating procedures
management plan       for culling, transport and disposal and to prepare laboratory
                      manuals. It was explained that these will be developed during
                      the project implementation, and not part of the environmental
                      management plan, however the plan recommends their
                      preparation as soon as possible. Therefore, it was
                      recommended to add a paragraph in the beginning of the
                      document explaining what is an EMP. This comment has
                      been integrated in the document.
2. EQA and MOH        Both EQA and MOH announced that hazardous waste
roles                 management is their responsibility. Both laws the public
                      Health law and the Environmental Law gives the authority for
                      both of them to conduct their task. Although conflict
                      regarding the issue is not an attempt to avoid doing the work,
                      on the contrary, both institutions wanted to do the work.
                      Therefore, lack of coordination is seen to be the conflict
                      between the two. The lack of coordination should not affect

                                 project implementation negatively, because the National
                                 Committee on Avian Influenza Control will be the ultimate
                                 responsible for implementing the project. In addition, an
                                 environmental specialist will be recruited for the project
                                 duration that will ensure implementation of mitigation
                                 measures is according to the EMP. The National Committee
                                 on Avian Influenza is recommended to have its final say
                                 regarding the implementation of the hazardous waste issues
                                 until an agreement is reached between EQA and MOH.
3. Law section                   Some indicated that the law section is big, and not necessary
                                 to include. It was explained that these laws will govern the
                                 environmental, agricultural and health practices, therefore
                                 they should be included to avoid any conflict between the
                                 project activities and laws. In addition, this section is
                                 important because it addresses the gaps in the regulations that
                                 might hinder project implementation according to appropriate
                                 environmental practices, as well it identifies roles and
                                 responsibilities of different stakeholders to implement and
                                 monitor the mitigation measures identified in this plan.
4. Public Control                When discussing that there is a need to establish a mechanism
Commission                       to monitoring the work of ministries to abide to the
                                 Palestinian laws, the Minister of Health indicated that the
                                 Public Control Commission does this role, administratively,
                                 financially, and technically. However, the law No 17 for the
                                 year 1995 regarding the Public Control commission33, the law
                                 indicated that this commission conducts only financial and
                                 administrative control over all Palestinian ministerial and non
                                 ministerial governmental institutions. Therefore,
                                 recommendation no. 5 in section 3.3.15 in the EMP report is
                                 still valid.
5. Role of NGOs in               A non Governmental organization asked if it is possible to
surveillance of AI in            have a role for NGOs in surveillance of wild birds for AI. It
wild Birds                       was agreed that the Ministry of Agriculture is the official
                                 organization to conduct this task, however if an environmental
                                 organization would like to share responsibility, it should
                                 coordinate this task with the Ministry of Agriculture and
                                 follow all their precaution practices and procedures for
                                 obtaining samples, wear of PPE...etc.
6. Identifying of                The main question asked whether the plan has identified
disposal locations               centralized locations for disposal of carcass and waste. The
                                 scatter of farms in Palestinian makes it impossible to allocate
                                 limited centralized locations for disposal of wastes and
                                 carcasses. Nevertheless, in Gaza Strip, they identified that
                                 location of burial if needed to be offsite, can be in the same

                        location of burial used in the 2006 outbreak. It is still
                        preferable to have the first option of disposal on farm, and
                        only if the site is not suitable the location will be off site,
                        however within the 3 kilometers already announced to be
                        infected area. However, indication of necessary coordination
                        with the Israeli would be necessary if Area C is concerned.
                        This comment has been integrated in the body of the EMP.
7. Bio security         It was discussed that licensing of new farms should include
measures at farms       preventive measure for disease control, and impose
                        biosecurity measures. However these biosecurity measures
                        are not yet established and the licensing only is for
                        commercial size farms. Therefore, approaching farms can be
                        conducted via public awareness campaigns for the poultry
                        growers. The EMP already recommends establishing of these
                        bio security measures.
8. Draft By law on      One of the ministry of Agriculture employees indicated that a
animal drugs            draft law on animal drugs has already been drafted and should
                        be included in the EMP. The EMP integrated this comment in
                        the text.
9. The word             This comment was taken care of in the EMP.
veterinarian should be
replaced by a
governmental or
official veterinarian.
10. Human               The Ministry of Health indicated that Vaccination is not part

Minutes of the Meeting
1. Environmental Impact    Request to add to the laws section the Environmental
Assessment Policy          Assessment Policy. (Integrated in the EMP text).
2. Roles of EQA and MoH    Unlike the roles conflict in the West Bank between EQA
                           and MOH, it is seen that these roles do not overlap,
                           however there is some lack of coordination, and
                           requested to change the document from over lap to lack
                           of coordination.
3. Role of EQA as part of  The inclusion of the Environmental specialist from EQA
RRCT                       in the RRCT was seen as a very positive and important
                           role. It is important to mention, that this
                           recommendation was suggested for stakeholders during
                           the preparation of the report, and immediate action took
                           place to achieve this recommendation. EQA requested
                           to include the provision of necessary communication

                             units, and training for all team members in both Gaza
                             Strip and the West Bank. Also provision of necessary
                             logistics such as transportation during an outbreak is
                             essential and should be considered in the plan. Therefore
                             communication devices for 12 members in the West
                             Bank and 5 in Gaza should be considered as part of the
                             project, the transportation will take place with MOA
                             team to minimize the amount of vehicles entering the
                             site, the training that will be conducted by FAO, should
                             include the additional members of EQA. These
                             comments are included in the EMP.
4. Site selection            EQA emphasized the importance of taking into
                             consideration indicated in Annex 4. EQA emphasized
                             on the importance of drafting animal carcass disposal
                             bylaws as soon as possible. Also indicated that it might
                             be a good idea to study potential centralized locations at
                             least one in each governorate. Also preparation of
                             maps that indicate potential locations would be
                             important, and recommended that a national plan where
                             these sites can be identified and addition of these
                             locations on the maps using GPS and GIS to study their
                             sensitivity for water resources, agriculture and proximity
                             to human settlements. The EQA recommended
                             establishing a committee to conduct the study of the
                             following institutions: EQA, MOA, Ministry of
                             Housing, Ministry of Local government and
                             municipalities within each governorate, and PWA. The
                             committee at the governorate level can start identifying
                             these potential sites if resources are available.
5) Disinfectant lists        EQA indicated that all chemicals imported to the
                             country should have an environmental approval by
                             EQA. Therefore, the EQA requested that when
                             discussing the disinfectant list to be reviewed from an
                             environmental perspective with them.
6) Disposal of Human         An employee of the ministry of Health asked about the
Bodies in case of infection  environmental impact of disposal of human bodies that
with AI                      has been diagnosed with the virus. It was noted that this
                             aspect will be covered in the case management, in
                             addition, any other method for handling human bodies
                             than the current religious method would require
                             approval by the highest religious leaders in Christian,
                             Muslim, and Jewish religions.
7) WHO guidelines for        An employee of the MOH wanted to have the WHO
laboratory biosafety         guidelines for laboratory biosafety mentioned in the
                             report. This comment was integrated in the document.

  Annex 1: Summary of the FAO and the OIE Global Strategy for the Progressive
                Control of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)

Vision and goal. The long-term vision of the strategy is to minimize the global threat and
risk of HPAI in humans and domestic poultry, through progressive control and
eradication of HPAI, particularly that caused by H5B1 virus, from terrestrial domestic
poultry in Asia. Achieving this goal will diminish the global threat of a pandemic,
stabilize poultry production, enhance a robust regional and international trade in poultry
and poultry products, increase human and food safety, and improve the livelihoods of the
rural poor.

A phased approach. The global strategy will be implemented over three time frames:
immediate to short (1-3 years), short to medium (4-6 years) and medium to long term (7-
10 years). During this period the spread of HPAI, mainly of the H5N1 strain, will have
been progressively controlled in domestic poultry of all infected countries of Asia, and
prevented from affecting those Asian countries not currently infected, but at high risk.

The immediate to short-term objective is to reduce the risk to humans by preventing
further spread of HPAI in those countries that are currently infected by H5N1.

Over the medium to long-term (7-10 years), a more focused approach to HPAI will be
mounted to progressively eradicate the disease from the remaining compartments of
infected domestic terrestrial poultry in the region. The medium-to-long term strategy will
consider all control measures, including vaccination, zoning and compartmentalization as
defined in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. For the long-term success of this
strategy, restructuring of the poultry sectors in the region will need to be seriously
considered.

To prevent the threat of HPAI from spreading to avian influenza-free countries, the long-
term strategy supports the development of active surveillance programs and emergency
preparedness plans for non-infected, at risk countries. The application of OIE standards
relating to the international trade of poultry and poultry products will further assist in
preventing the spread of HPAI virus across continents.

Capacity building. Inadequate capacity in many countries is the principal limiting factor
for effectively and quickly stamping out and controlling infectious diseases. Thus, the
strategy suggests building a strong and sustainable human and physical resource capacity
in the countries, to respond in a more effective and timely manner in stamping out not
only HPAI outbreaks, but also other newly-emerging infectious zoonotic and trans-
boundary animal diseases. Capacity building will be wide ranging and include all aspects
of disease control as well as policy development and socioeconomic impact analysis.

Strategic research. The global strategy recognizes that the dynamics of the current rapid
spread and persistence of HPAI remain unclear. Therefore, the strategy will facilitate
strategic research to investigate the epidemiology of avian influenza, evaluate the
efficacy of vaccines in domestic ducks to reduce the virus shedding in domestic duck


                                             51

reservoirs, and work in close collaboration with regional and international advanced
research institutions to promote the development of improved vaccines and rapid
diagnostic tests. Risk analysis of various poultry production systems and along marketing
chains will be carried out to better target effective disease control.

Implementation. Implementation will be at the national, regional and international
levels. At the national level, well-defined country specific projects will be formulated,
which will be underpinned by the formation of sub-regional HPAI support units. Through
these units, sub-regional disease diagnosis and surveillance and socio-economic and
policy analysis networks will be established. These subregional networks will provide the
lead in the development of harmonized technical standards and regional policies related
to the management of live animal movement, compensation plans, capacity building,
disease reporting requirements and long term planning to restructure poultry sectors.

At the international level, coordination of the national programs and sub-regional
networks will be under the umbrella of GF-TADs (global framework for the control of
trans-boundary animal diseases), a joint FAO/OIE initiative. The international
coordination will provide technical backstopping to the subregional networks and
national programs, promote international cooperation, and mobilize and coordinate
resources for HPAI control.

Partners. The main partners in implementation of the strategy will be infected and non-
infected at-risk countries, and regional organizations, all of which are committed to
controlling trans-boundary animal and zoonotic diseases. Given the zoonotic nature of the
HPAI, and the complex interface between farming systems, livestock trade, food safety
and public health, a strong international partnership among FAO, OIE and WHO will be
continued. A number of other partners will be involved, important among these would be
the private sector, NGOs, and regional national agriculture extensions systems (NARES).

Resources. The implementation of the strategy will require funding to support the
national, regional and international HPAI control programs as outlined above.

Framework for Implementation
A Framework for Implementation has been developed by FAO/OIE, promoting national,
regional, and international initiatives. It includes the following:
National initiatives:
· Development of a National Strategy for each country specific to its own conditions. It
  would address farming systems, presence/absence of ducks, presence of human cases or
  not, trade orientation, implementation capacity, and wildlife migration patterns;
· Preparation of contingency and emergency preparedness plans;
· Development of economic impact and policy frameworks;
· Prevention of avian influenza to non-infected at-risk countries through awareness,
  reporting, and early detection; and
· Improvement in epidemiological information on source of infection and transmission
  dynamics in farming system and marketplaces.




                                               52

Regional initiatives:
· Standardization of diagnosis and reporting techniques among countries;
· Sharing of disease information between countries;
· Development of a regulatory framework for management of animal movements; and
· Promotion of adherence to OIE guidelines to facilitate regional trade.
Global initiatives:
· Strengthening of partnerships (FAO, OIE, WHO, UNDP, donors);
· Support for global networks (OIE Global Service Center supported by WB/DGF and
  donors);
· Support for sub-regional networks --OIE/FAO epidemiology collaborating centers and
  Avian Influenza Network (OFFLU);
· Further development of control strategies for trans-boundary animal diseases (utilizing
  the GF-TADs mechanism);
· Development of a Global Early Warning System (FOA/OIE/WHO);
· Coordination of research on improved tools for avian influenza control;
· Provision of global vision for avian influenza control; and
· Mobilization of resources through donor liaison and advocacy.

       Annex 2: Summary of the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategy

The strategic plan lays out activities for individual countries, the international
community and WHO to prepare for a pandemic and mitigate its impact. The objectives
of the plan correspond to the opportunities to intervene and are structure in the following
three phases:

Phase 1 -Pre-Pandemic:
(i) Reduce opportunities for human infection. An immediate priority is to halt spread in
poultry to reduce human exposure to the virus. More intensive collaboration is needed
between the animal and health sectors. Communication activities targeting stakeholders,
particularly rural poultry holders, should be strengthened. Workers carrying out the
culling of poultry must be protected against infection by clothing and equipment.
(ii) Strengthen the early warning system. To assess risks to public health and guide
protective measures, information is needed on the extent of influenza infection in animals
and humans and on circulating viruses. National surveillance systems must be improved
urgently in potentially affected countries. When outbreaks in animals occur, active
human case detection should be pursued by a coordinated animal-human health team.
Phase 2- Emergence of a Pandemic:
(iii) Contain or delay spread at the source. Aggressive containment measures such as
isolation and prophylactic use of antiviral drugs may slow pandemic spread and allow
time for response measures. An international stockpile of antiviral drugs for an
emergency response should be established, starting with a stockpile for targeted early use.
Phase 3­ Pandemic Declared and Spreading Internationally:
(iv) Reduce morbidity, mortality, and social disruption. Although mass vaccination is the
preferred intervention, serious issues related to the time lag between emergence of the
virus and vaccine production as well as production capacity constraints must be
addressed. Anti-viral supply and production capacity are also limited. Therefore, the main
responses in the immediate term should be classic "social distancing measures" such as
quarantine, bans on mass gatherings, and travel restrictions, backed up by a well-
designed communication strategy. For the longer term, options with industry to improve
antiviral and vaccine capacity need to be explored.
(v) Conduct research during pandemic. Research is needed for policy development and
adjustments for current and future epidemics. The main elements include: assessing the
epidemiologic characteristics; monitoring the effectiveness of the interventions; and
evaluating the medical and economic consequences.

Recommended Strategic Actions
In view of the immediacy of the avian influenza threat, WHO recommends that all
countries undertake urgent action to prepare for a pandemic. Advice on doing so is
contained in the recently revised WHO global influenza preparedness plan (2005) and a
new WHO checklist for influenza pandemic preparedness planning (2005).

Table 1 describes the phases of increasing public health risk associated with the
emergence of a new influenza virus subtype that may pose a pandemic threat, and the
overarching public health goals under each phase.

          a New Influenza Virus Subtype that May Pose a Pandemic Threat

Interpandemic period
Phase 1. No new influenza virus subtypes have been Strengthen influenza pandemic

instances of spread to a close contact.                  detection,     notification     and
                                                         response to additional cases.

                                                         vaccine development.
Phase 5. Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human Maximize efforts to contain or

Phase 6. Pandemic: increased and sustained Minimize the impact of the
transmission in general population                       pandemic
Note:
a) The distinction between phase 1 and phase 2 is based on the risk of human infection or
disease resulting from circulating strains in animals. The distinction is based on various
factors and their relative importance according to current scientific knowledge. Factors
may include pathogenicity in animals and humans, occurrence in domesticated animals
and livestock or only in wildlife, whether the virus is enzootic or epizootic,
geographically localized or widespread, and/or other scientific parameters.
b) The distinction between phase 3, phase 4 and phase 5 is based on an assessment of the
risk of a pandemic. Various factors and their relative importance according to current
scientific knowledge may be considered. Factors may include rate of transmission, geo-
graphical location and spread, severity of illness, presence of genes from human strain (if
derived from an animal strain), and/or other scientific parameters.(Source: WHO 2005)




                                             55

In order to accomplish the public health goals described for each phase, WHO
recommends strategic actions that can be undertaken to capitalize on each opportunity to
intervene. Given the many uncertainties about the evolution of the pandemic threat,
including the amount of time left to prepare, a wise approach involves a mix of measures
that immediately address critical problems with longer-term measures that sustainabilly
improve the world's capacity to protect itself against the recurring pandemic threat.

The strategic actions are:
Reduce opportunities for human infection, including:
· Support to the FAO/OIE control strategy;
· Intensify collaboration between the animal and public health sectors;
· Strengthen risk communication to rural residents; and
· Improve approaches to environmental detection of the virus
Strengthen the early warning systems, including:
· Improve the detection of human cases;
· Combine detection of new outbreaks in animals with active searches for human cases;
· Support epidemiological investigation;
· Coordinate clinical research;
· Strengthen risk assessment;
· Strengthen existing national influenza centers throughout the risk-prone regions; and
· Give risk-prone countries an incentive to collaborate internationally.
Contain or delay spread at the source, including:
· Establish an international stockpile of anti-viral drugs;
· Develop mass delivery mechanisms for anti-viral drugs; and
· Conduct surveillance of antiviral susceptibility.
Reduce morbidity, mortality and social disruption, including:
· Monitor the pandemic in real time;
· Introduce non-pharmaceutical interventions;
· Use of antiviral drugs to protect priority groups;
· Augment vaccine supplies;
· Ensure equitable access to vaccines; and
· Communicate risks to the public.
Conduct research to guide response measures, including:
· Assess the epidemiological characteristics of an emerging pandemic;
· Monitor the effectiveness of human interventions; and
· Evaluate the medical and economic consequences.

                   Annex 4: The institutional setting to respond to AI
The Ministry of Agriculture has developed the following mechanism to respond to an
avian influenza outbreak35.
Stage 1: A suspect case is reported to the District Veterinary Department
Stage 2: District Veterinary Department reports the suspect case to the General
directorate of Veterinary Services and Animal health
Stage 3: The general directorate of Veterinary services and Animal health notifies the
suspicion of an HPAI case to the NCAIC. Comment: Considering that the committee is
chaired by the Ministry of Health, and has a representative of the EQA, therefore these
governmental institutions are immediately informed to take necessary measures.
Stage 4: If the tests resulted in positive to H5N1, the NCAIC declares emergency and
authorizes the general directorate of Veterinary services and Animal health - MOA to
start Culling and take all appropriate steps needed to contain the disease (Quarantine
measures, vaccination, and others).
Stage 5: The Task Force on Avian Influenza (TFAI)-MOA mobilizes the Rapid
Response and Culling Teams (RRCT) and communicates the culling arrangements
Stage 6: The RRCT commence Culling
Stage 7: RRCT compile the necessary forms and handle them to the District Veterinary
Department. The district Veterinary Department enters the culling data into a database
and sends the culling forms to the General Directorate of Veterinary Services and Animal
Health. These forms include the compensation paper work, including the number, type,
owner of the farm.
Stage 8: The General Directorate of Veterinary Services and Animal Health sends the
culling forms with the covering letter to the Department of Planning and cross-checks the
information of the district database with the information of the:
            a) Two forms are available for culling and disposal of birds:
                     i. The first one, is the form that list the plan of action of the culling
                        team, this form include, date, time, hours, location, number, weight
                        and type of birds, culling method, requirements for culling, method
                        of disposal, materials used in disposal, materials used in
                        disinfection, names of team, other institutions that might contribute
                        to the culling and disposals procedure.
                    ii. The second form, lists the details of the procedures as happened,
                        including any obstacles faced the team, comments and
                        recommendations by the team leader.
            b) Documentation of the procedure should take place ­ according to a form.

                          GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR THE
                            DISPOSAL OF DEAD ANIMALS




                                       Article 3.6.6.1.

Introduction

The mass disposal of dead animals associated with an animal disease outbreak is often
subject to intense public and media scrutiny thereby obligating the Veterinary Authority
of a Member Country to not only conduct disposal operations within acceptable scientific
principles to destroy the causative pathogen but also to address public and environmental
concerns.

The guidelines in this Appendix are general in nature. The choice of one or more of the
recommended methods should be in compliance with relevant local and national
legislation and be attainable with the resources available. The guidelines should also be
applied in conjunction with the procedures described for the killing of animals in
Appendix 3.7.6.

Strategies for the disposal of dead animals (entire animals or parts thereof) should be
prepared well in advance of any emergency. Major issues related to the disposal of dead
animals include the number of animals involved, biosecurity concerns over the movement
of infected or exposed animals, people and equipment, environmental concerns, and the
psychological distress experienced by farmers and animal handlers.

                                       Article 3.6.6.2.

Regulations and jurisdiction

The legislation regulating animal health and the organisation of the Veterinary Authority
should give the Veterinary Services the authority and the legal powers to carry out the
activities necessary for the efficient and effective disposal of dead animals. Cooperation
between the Veterinary Service and other relevant government bodies is necessary to
developing a coherent set of legal measures for the disposal of dead animals in advance
of any emergency. In this context the following aspects should be regulated:

                                             62

           1. Powers of Veterinary Services (inspectors, veterinary officers, etc.) to
               effect controls and direct persons as well as the right of entry to an
               establishment for the Veterinary Services and associated personnel;
           2. movement controls and the authority to make exemptions under certain
               biosecurity conditions, for example for transport of dead animals to
               another location for disposal;
           3. the obligation on the involved farmer and animal handlers to cooperate
               with the Veterinary Services;
           4. any need to transfer the ownership of animals to the competent authority;
           5. the determining of the method and location of disposal, and the necessary
               equipment and facilities, by the Veterinary Services, in consultation with
               other involved authorities including national and local governmental
               organisations competent for the protection of human health and of the
               environment.

Should the chosen option for the disposal of dead animals be applied near the border of a
neighbouring country, the competent authorities of that country should be consulted.

                                      Article 3.6.6.3.

Preparedness

The mass killing and disposal of animals in the event of a disease outbreak or disposal of
animals in the event of natural disasters such as floods, usually must proceed with the
minimum delay. The success is determined by the structures, policies and infrastructure
established in advance:

           1. Relationship with industry

               A relationship with industry organisations, such as farmer associations,
               commodity representatives, animal welfare organisations, security
               services, media and consumer representatives is essential to obtain
               compliance with animal health policies.

           2. Standard operating procedures

               Standard   operating    procedures    should   be   developed   (including
               documented decision-making processes, training of staff).

           3. Financial preparedness

               Financial preparedness means a compensation or insurance mechanism, an
               access to emergency funding and an access to personnel through
               agreements with private veterinarians.

           4. Communication plan



                                            63

               Information sharing with officials involved in the outbreak, affected
               farmers, professional organizations, politicians and the media is essential.
               A well informed spokesperson should be available at all times to answer
               enquiries.

            5. Resources

               The management of resources should address such items as personnel,
               transport, storage facilities, equipment (such as mobile handling facilities
               for animals, disinfection equipment), fuel, protective and disposable
               material and logistical support.

            6. Special equipment

               Special equipment such as trucks, tractors, bulldozers, and front-end
               loaders should be available.

                                      Article 3.6.6.4.

Critical elements

Critical elements which need to be considered in planning and implementation include:

            1. Timeliness

               Early detection of new infections, immediate killing of infected animals
               and rapid removal of the dead animals with inactivation of the pathogen
               are important. Spread of the pathogen from the dead animals and their
               surroundings should be blocked as soon and as effectively as possible.

            2. Occupational health and safety

               Disposal should be organised in such a way that the workers are
               safeguarded against the risks of handling decomposing dead animals.
               Special attention should be given to zoonotic aspects. Workers should
               receive appropriate training and be sufficiently protected against infection
               with protective clothing, gloves, face masks, effective respirators, goggles,
               vaccination, and effective anti viral medicines. Workers should also
               receive regular health checks.

            3. Pathogen inactivation

               The disposal procedure should be selected to result in inactivation of the
               pathogen.

            4. Environmental concerns



                                              64

    Different methods of the disposal of dead animals have different effects on
    the environment. For instance, pyre burning will produce smoke and
    smells; burial might lead to gas and leachate production resulting in
    potential contamination of air, soil, surface and sub surface water.

5. Availability of capacity

    An assessment of capacities of different methods of disposal should be
    made prior to any emergency. Temporary storage of dead animals in cold
    stores may relieve a lack of processing capacity.

6. Adequate funding

    Adequacy of funding for the options chosen must be ascertained and
    committed at the earliest possible stage.

7. Staff resources

    Availability of sufficient and well trained staff resources in particular for
    extended and /or large operations should be ensured. This is particularly
    important for technical and inspection personnel who are usually in short
    supply.

8. Societal acceptance

    Societal acceptance is an important point in choosing a disposal method.

9. Acceptance by farmers

    Farmers will be sensitive to the safety measures taken to prevent spread of
    the disease by disposal method selected and the transport of the dead
    animals to the disposal site. Adequate compensation of owners for the loss
    of animals or for burial or burning sites will improve acceptability.

10. Equipment

    Equipment used in the disposal of dead animals can transfer infection to
    other premises. The cleaning and disinfection of the outside surfaces of
    equipment such as cranes, containers and trucks, and the departure of
    vehicles from the farm should receive special attention. Trucks
    transporting dead animals should be leak proof.

11. Scavengers and vectors




                                  65

              When disposing of dead animals, full attention should be given to
              preventing scavengers and vectors gaining access to dead animals, which
              might cause spread of disease.

          12. Economic impact (short and long term including recovery)

              The method of disposal used has a significant bearing on economic
              impact.

                                      Article 3.6.6.5.

Practical considerations

          1. Selection of disposal site

              Sufficient top soil to cover the site; soil type; water drainage; prevailing
              wind conditions; easy access to transport; availability of meteorological
              data; separation from sensitive public sites, and the effect on future use.

          2. Contractors

              Contractors -- availability of manpower, materials and equipment
              including transport vehicles; can they supply in all the needs; exclusive use
              of vehicles or would they also be used for other purposes (risk of disease
              transmission); access to available roads; suitable for the purpose to be
              used.

          3. Logistical preparedness for the appropriate technology

              Availability of fuel; sufficient manual labour available; sites and
              availability of disinfection tents for personnel; storage and disposal of
              protective clothing; housing for personnel to minimise the spread of
              infection; facilities for entry and exit control; availability of electricity for
              night operations; personal facilities for personnel such as toilets, drinking
              water; availability of communication ­ mobile phone reception; protection
              (e.g. vaccination) of personnel; rendering capacity at rendering plants;
              arms and ammunition, additional cold storage and holding facilities at
              rendering plants and abattoirs.

          4. Procedures and policies for disposal of other possibly contaminated
              products

              Animal products such as litter, manure, wool, eggs and milk; animal feed;
              non-animal products such as protective clothing.

          5. Wildlife



                                             66

               Need to minimise the risks posed by wildlife, including by excluding or
               repelling them from the disposal site.

                                       Article 3.6.6.6.

Recommended methods for the disposal of dead animals

The method(s) chosen should be based on local conditions and the required capacity and
speed of outcome and on the conditions required for the inactivation of the causative
agent.

Some of the methods below may require on-farm pre-processing prior to transportation of
dead animals to central facilities for rendering or incineration. Preprocessing could
include the grinding of dead animals which can then be transported in sealed containers,
or be subjected to fermentation, composting or freezing.

           1. Rendering

               This is a closed system for mechanical and thermal treatment of animal
               tissues leading to stable, sterilized products, e.g. animal fat and dried
               animal protein. The technology exists in dedicated facilities. It produces
               an effective inactivation of all pathogens with the exception of prions
               where infectivity is reduced. The availability of the capacity should be
               determined in advance.

           2. Incineration in a dedicated facility

               In such a facility, whole dead animals or parts of animals can be
               completely burned and reduced to ash, often in conjunction with other
               substances (such as municipal waste, hazardous waste or hospital waste).
               Effective inactivation of pathogens, including spores, occurs. Fixed
               facility incineration is wholly contained and has some advantages from the
               environmental viewpoint as the exhausts may be fitted with afterburner
               chambers to completely burn hydrocarbon gases and particulate matter
               from the main combustion chamber.

           3. Rendering and incineration

               These may be combined for improved security and to provide additional
               fuel for furnaces in facilities used for other purposes such as in cement
               kilns and electricity generation plants.

           4. Air curtain incineration

               This process fan-forces a mass of air through a manifold, thereby creating
               a turbulent environment in which incineration is accelerated up to six



                                             67

   times for example in a burn-pit. The equipment can be mobile and,
   because it can be used on site, there is no requirement for transportation of
   the animal material. It also produces effective inactivation of pathogens.

5. Pyre burning

   This open system of burning dead animals is a well established procedure
   that can be conducted on site with no requirement for transportation of
   animal material. However, it takes an extended period of time and has no
   way of verifying pathogen inactivation, and there may be particulate
   dissemination from incomplete combustion. Further, because the process
   is open to view, there may be a lack of acceptance by the public.

6. Composting

   Composting is a natural biological decomposition process that takes place
   in the presence of oxygen. In the first phase, the temperature of the
   compost pile increases, organic materials break down into relatively small
   compounds, soft tissue decomposes, and bones soften partially. In the
   second phase, the remaining materials, mainly bones, break down fully to
   a dark brown or black humus containing primarily non-pathogenic bacteria
   and plant nutrients. However, some viruses and spore forming bacteria,
   such as Bacillus anthracis, and other pathogens such as Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis may survive.

7. Burial

   In this method, whole dead animals are buried and covered by soil. Burial
   is an established procedure which may be conducted on site. It may not
   inactivate all pathogens. In some circumstances, dead animals may be
   disposed of by mounding whereby they are covered by a layer of soil
   above ground.

8. Biogas production

   This is a closed system of anaerobic fermentation which would require for
   the disposal of dead animals or their parts prior mechanical and thermal
   treatment of the input material (such as the liquid product of rendering
   plants). This process may not inactivate all pathogens.

9. Alkaline hydrolysis

   This method uses sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to catalyse
   the hydrolysis of biological material into a sterile aqueous solution
   consisting of small peptides, amino acids, sugars, and soaps. Heat is
   applied (150°C) to accelerate the process. The only solid byproducts are



                                 68

                the mineral constituents of bones and teeth. This residue (2% of the
                original weight of the animal) is sterile and easily crushed into a powder.
                The temperature and alkali conditions of the process destroy the protein
                coats of viruses and the peptide bonds of prions. Both lipids and nucleic
                acids are degraded. The process is carried out in an insulated steam-
                jacketed, stainless steel pressure vessel.

            10. Bio-refining

                This is a high pressure, high temperature hydrolytic process, conducted in
                a sealed pressurised vessel. The waste material is treated at 180ºC at 12
                bar pressure for 40 minutes, heated by the indirect application of steam kj,
                other compostable material, paper and comparable materials, and cereal
                straws either alone or in combination. The process inactivates all
                microbiological agents.

            11. Dead animal disposal at sea

                International Conventions define the conditions to be met for the disposal
                of dead animals at sea.

                                       Article 3.6.6.7.

Guidelines for decision-making for the disposal of dead animals

The disposal of large numbers of dead animals will be expensive. As well, fixed and
variable costs will vary with the choice of the disposal method. Each method used will
result in indirect costs on the environment, local economies, producers, and the livestock
industry. In addition to biosecurity considerations, decision makers need to understand
the economic, social, environmental protection and aesthetic impact of various disposal
technologies.

A disposal option hierarchy may be incapable of fully capturing and systematizing the
relevant dimensions at stake, and decision makers may be forced to consider the least
preferred means. It therefore requires a comprehensive understanding of any array of
dead animal disposal technologies and must reflect a balance between the scientific,
economic, and social issues at stake. Timely slaughter, maintenance of security and
prevention of further spread of disease, are the essential considerations in terms of
disease control.

The following is an example of a possible process for aiding decision-making by
comparing the suitability of various disposal options against factors that are considered
important for the specific disposal event in question:

            1. Step 1 - Define the factors to be considered. Include all relevant factors
                and allow enough flexibility to permit modifications for different



                                              69

   situations and locations. Examples of possible factors include operator
   safety,   community      concerns,    international  acceptance,   transport
   availability, industry standards, cost effectiveness and speed of resolution.
   These factors can be modified or changed, as is shown in the following
   example, to best fit the situation of event involved.
2. Step 2 - Assess the relative importance of the factors by weighting each on
   their considered importance to addressing the event in question. The sum
  of all the weightings, regardless of the number of factors, must total 100.
3. Step 3 - Identify and list all disposal options under consideration. Rate
   each disposal option against each factor and assign a Utility Rating of
   between 1 to 10 to each comparison. The Utility Rating (U) is a number
   between 1 and 10 which is allocated according to how well the option
   achieves the ideal with respect to each factor (eg 1 = the worst possible fit,
   and 10 = the best fit).
4. Step 4 - For each factor and each disposal option, multiply the Factor
   Weight (F) x Utility Rating (U) to yield a numeric Balanced Value (V),
   (eg V = F x U).
5. Step 5 - By adding the Balanced Values to a sum for each disposal option,
   it is possible to compare the suitability of disposal options by numerically
   ranking the sums of the Balanced Values for each disposal option. The
   largest sum would suggest that disposal option is the best balanced choice.

Segregation / Triage of Waste
Multi-hazardous waste ­ goal is reduction of waste to a waste that presents a single
hazard.
· Consider frequency and amount of waste generated; assess risk
· Identify / characterize waste:
        · Physical description
        · Water reactivity
        · Water solubility
        · pH and possibly neutralization information
        · ignitability / flammability
        · presence of oxidizer
        · presence of sulfides / cyanides
        · presence of halogens
        · presence of radioactive materials
        · presence of bio-hazardous materials
        · presence of toxic constituents
· Minimize waste's hazards
· Determine options for management of hazards
· If appropriate, take steps to neutralize waste or render it non-hazardous
· When possible, select a single management option
· Establish procedures for dealing with unstable waste, or waste that requires special
  storage or handling
· Store safely:
        · Designated room or facility modified to contain the waste (with ventilation and
          effluent trapping)
        · Protect workers
        · Minimize risk of fire or spill
        · Minimize radiation levels outside of area
        · Consider compatibility of materials being accumulated (e.g., aqueous and non-
          aqueous waste should be separated)
· Give particular attention to the handling or cleaning of radioactive laboratory ware, and
  to the proper disposal of sharps.
        · Non-contaminated (non-infectious) waste can be reused or recycled or disposed
          of as general waste
        · Contaminated (infectious) sharps ­ collect in puncture-proof containers fitted
          with covers and treated as infectious; autoclave if appropriate
        · Contaminated material for decontamination by autoclaving and thereafter
          washing and reuse or recycling
        · Contaminated material for direct incineration




                                             78

Disposal

No activity should begin unless a plan for the disposal of hazardous waste has been
formulated
        · Use appropriate disposal method for each category of waste
        · Use appropriate containers
        · Label and securely close waste containers
        · Separate wastes as appropriate

For low level radioactive waste, options include
· Storage time for decay and indefinite on site storage,
· Burial at a low-level radioactive waste site,
· Incineration, or
· Sanitary sewer disposal

For biological waste, options include
· Disinfection
· Autoclaving
· For liquids disposal in sanitary sewer putrescible waste disposed of by incineration
  needles and sharps require destruction typically by incineration or grinding

Collection and storage of waste
· At satellite area near lab:
        · should be clearly identified, ventilated if necessary
        · determine whether to recycle, reuse, or dispose
        · hold here for less than one year; when containment volume limits reached, move
          to central accumulation area ­ package appropriately
· At central accumulation area:
        · separate according to compatibility, commingle solvents when appropriate
        · label clearly, store in appropriate containers
        · limit storage time to 90 days
        · Ensure that employees are trained to handle waste materials as well as
          contingency planning for emergencies
        · When transporting, make provisions for spill control in case of accident; have
          internal tracking system to follow movement of waste
        · Ensure that all necessary records have been generated (Quantities and
         identification of waste generated and shipped; Documentation and analyses of
         unknown materials; Manifests for waste shipping as well as verification of waste
         disposal; Any other information required to ensure compliance and safety from
         long-term liability)




                                              79

Disposal options:
       · Incineration ­ is method of choice for most wastes, but is most expensive
       · Normal trash ­ only where appropriate, must be clearly identified and
          appropriately labeled
       · Sanitary sewer ­ not commonly used; solutions must be aqueous and
          biodegradable, or low toxicity inorganics ­ make sure sewer doesn't drain into
          water supply inappropriate for waste disposal, and make sure waste is highly
          diluted
       · Release to the atmosphere ­ not acceptable; fume hoods must have trapping
          devices to prevent discharge to atmosphere

· If hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are mixed, entire waste volume must be treated
  as hazardous
· Preparation for transport to a treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF)
· Waste generator must obtain assurance (in terms of documentation, permits, records)
  that provider is reliable

For infectious material
· Decontaminate, autoclave, or incinerate in lab
· Package appropriately (for incineration or for transfer to another facility for
  incineration)
· Protect against hazards to others to those who might contact discarded items

Annex 9: Environmental Management Guidelines for Civil Works Contracts

All contractors are required to use environmentally acceptable technical standards and
procedures during the implementation of construction of works. All construction
contracts will contain the following requirements:
· Take necessary precautions against negative impacts on the environment, any
  environmental damage or loss through prevention or suppression measures (where it is
  possible), instead of liquidation or mitigation of negative consequences.
· Observe all national and local laws and rules on environmental protection.
· Identify officers responsible for the implementation of activities on environmental
  protection conforming to instructions and directions received from the construction and
  design or environmental protection agencies.
· Minimize dust, smoke and particulate emissions to avoid or minimize negative impacts
  on air quality.
· Provide pedestrian crosswalks and roads to ensure access to public places.
· Prevent or minimize vibrations and noise from the operation of vehicles and machinery
  during construction activities.
· Minimize damage to natural setting and vegetative cover and assure vegetation
  recovery.
· Protect surface and underground water from pollution sources. Assure adequate water
  collection and distribution.
