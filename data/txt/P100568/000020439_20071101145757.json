Influenza Prevention and Control\n            Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans by HPAI\n            infection and Avian Influenza in domestic poultry and to\n            prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and\n            other infectious disease emergencies in humans. The main\n            areas of environmental risks from the project activities are\n            the inadvertent spread of the AI virus during culling,\n            transport, and disposal of carcasses, animal waste, liter,\n            and used protective gear, contamination of surface and\n            groundwater fro use of disinfectants and laboratory\n            bio-safety and waste management. In addition, minor\n            environmental disturbances may occur during renovation of\n            laboratories. Culling, Transport and Disposal activities\n            shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures\n            defined by the FAO/OIE and the Ministry of Agriculture.\n            These guidelines and other mitigation measures are given in\n            the report."}, "docdt": "2007-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
