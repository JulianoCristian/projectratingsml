were\n            as follows: the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the Borrower performance was rated\n            unsatisfactory, and all other ratings are not applicable\n            since the operation is cancelled. The avian influenza\n            portfolio globally has been slow to implement due to its\n            complexity of design and technical requirements. Global\n            experience to date indicates that implementing such projects\n            takes an average of five years. In fragile states the\n            timeframe for successfully implementing such projects may\n            require an even longer periods for successful\n            implementation. Standard Bank implementation arrangements\n            may not be the most suitable vehicle to apply in a volatile\n            political environment and the use other channels such as the\n            United Nation (UN) system proved to be much more effective.\n            All conditions should be met before Board presentation. This\n            is particularly challenging for emergency grants due to time\n            pressure created by the avian influenza outbreak in Gaza.\n            Linking conditionality's to project effectiveness and\n            to disbursements did not contribute to moving the project\n            forward. Given the project's performance, the decision\n            for project cancellation or restructuring should have been\n            made earlier when it was evident that the Palestinian\n            Authority (PA) showed a lack of interest and ownership in\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2009-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
