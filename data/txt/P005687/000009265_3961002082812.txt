MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPU8LIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A MUNICIPAL SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT
*  1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Tunisia for US$75 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would finance a Municipal Sector Investment Project (MSIP) that
aims to increase the efficiency of local governments (municipalities and regional
councils) in planning and delivering local services, financing and implementing
investments, as well as mobilizing and allocating resources. This project is
part of the Government of Tunisia's (GOT) macroeconomic and institutional reform
programs, which the Bank has been supporting through adjustment lending and a
Public Enterprise Reform Loan. The project will support GOT's objective to
strengthen local governments and finance part of their investments, thereby
increasing their contribution to the economic, social, and political development
of the country.
Bahkamu4d
2.          Tunisia is a highly urbanized country; 60 percent of its eight
million inhabitants live in urban areas.   More than 80 percent of its GDP
originates in the Tunis Metropolitan Area and three other cities along the coast
(Sfax, Sousse and Bizerte). The urban growth rate is about 3.7 percent p.a.,
while the population growth rate is 2.2 percent p.a. It is projected that by the
year 2000, about 7 million people will live in Tunisian cities, creating further
demands on the provision of infrastructure and services.
3.          Many urban services are provided by Central Government utilities and
agencies. This has proved to be an efficient approach in a small country like
Tunisia: population coverage and cost recovery are adequate and the highest among
the Maghreb countries. Whereas the quality of services provided by national
agencies is good, other municipal services, such as solid waste collection and
disposal, have been neglected. GOT has started the process of strengthening its
local governments; its objective is to reinforce their capacity to (a) plan and
manage their own investment programs; (b) coordinate central agencies' activities
in their jurisdiction; (c) improve the quality of services they do provide (minor
road and sewer works, refuse collection, street lighting, and some community
facilities); and (d) increase the municipalities' capacity to mobilize local
resources. The process is now moving forward as a cabinet-level position of
State Secretary for Local Governments was created in 1989 within the Ministry of
Interior (MO!).   More significantly, C-O9  has made regional and municipal
development the foundation of its Eighth National Economic Plan (1992-1996).
4.          Municipalities' contribution to GDP is almost negligible. The total
budget of Tunisian municipalities represented only 1.3 percent of 1988's GDP, and
their resources reached barely 5 percent of GOT's revenues. The annual average
level of investments controlled by municiRalities is about Ust'2 per capita,
mostly self-financed. Twenty-two percent of municipal revenues are constituted
by local tax receipts.

5.          In 1988, GOT financed 47 percent of the municipalities, total
sAcurent budgets with transfers via the Local Government Common Fund (FCCL), and
40 percent of their iestments through the budgets of various ministries. The
Municipal Development Agency (Z4DA), an agency under the supervision of MO0,
provides additional investment financing in the form of loans (about 35 percent
of municipal investments) for local governments but has operated as a cashier's
window for the General Directorate for Public Local Governments (DGCPL) of MOI.
Under the project, MDA is being restructured and strengthened.
6.          The project would provide an essential link in the implvmentation of
GOT's regional and municipal development strategy. MDA would become GOT's main
instrument for developing municipal capacity for designing and financing their
investments. It would also contribute to the replicability and sustainability
of Government investment in the municipal sector.   Better technical and
managerial skills, developed through project-financed training programs and
studies, would allow the municipalities to improve planning and coordination of
investments carried out within their jurisdictions by national agencies.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
7.          The Bank's support to GOT's urban sector activities has gradually
moved beyond financing infrastructure investments to supporting changes in sector
policies and institutional responsibilities. Initially, the Bank focused on
providing support to site-specific urban works; this evolved to assisting GOT in
improving urban policies that affect other economic sectors and institutions.
8.          The Eighth Plan highlights regional and municipal development as one
of the main underpinnings of its development strategy. The plan contemplates
about US$470 million to finance the municipal investment program (PIC), out of
which the project would finance priority investments that have a high positive
social and environmental impact. The municipalities' own revenues would be
increased through a revamped local tax regime and improved cost-recovery
practices. MDA would achieve financial viability by building its equity through
GOT's transfers and loan recovery, and moving towards efficiency pricing in
public investment financing. Investment quality would increase because projects
would be selected on the basis of technical, financial, institutional and
economic criteria. Central Government's matching grants for investments would
be allocated according to national priorities (e.g., the environment and
rehabilitation) using criteria agreed with the Bank.
the Proke¢t
9.          Proiect Objectives.  The objective of the project is to help GOT
increase the efficiency of municipalities and regional councils in decision
making, resource mobilization and allocation, and project financing and
implementation.   As the first Bank operation directly supporting  local
governments, the project would focus on: (a) increasing the local authorities'
ability to carry out their responsibilities in planning, identification,
implementation, and maintenance of municipal investments; (b) restructuring MDA;
and (c) improving the municipalities' provision of basic infrastructure and
services through the financing of infrastructure investments.
10.        Proiect Descrintion.   The project would finance the following
-omponents:



(a)   Institutional  strengthening  %or the  municipalities,  MOl, and
Ministry of Finance (MOP) (US$6.7 million--3 percent of total
project cost). This component would benefit all municipalities; it
would  finance  training,  consultant  services,  vehicles,  and
equipment, and would comprise two main elements: (i) establishment
of a Training Directorate in MOl to manage the training program for
the   municipalities, the regional councils, and their elected
officials, and delivery of this training program, and (ii) studies
to improve the local tax system and municipal management;
(b)   Institutional strengthening for MDA (US$1.0 million--I percent of
project costs) to assist in strengthening MDA as the technical and
institutional agent of the Government for municipal investment
finance and development (this component will finance consultant
services, training, vehicles, and equipment); and
(c)   Priority infrastructure investments for municipalities and regional
councils (US$200 mi" 'on--96 percent of total project costs). These
would include: (i) upgrading of low-income neighborhoods; (iLi)
construction,  maintenance,  and  rehabilitation  of  municipal
infrastructure including urban roads, street lighting, drainage,
solid  waste  collection,  and  disposal  systems5    and  (iii)
construction  of  municipal   facilities   (e.g.,   markets  and
slaughterhouses).
11.         Proiect Implementation.  The Borrower would be GOT, and MOT would
have overall project coordination responsibility. MDA would be responsible for
evaluating and financing local government investments following eligibility
criteria for both subprojects and sub-borrowers satisfactory to the Bank. The
DGCPL, with participation of MOF for the local tax reform, and the Project
Coordinator of MOl would be responsible for the implementation of the
institutional strengthening components. The training program will be managed by
the training directorate of MOl and executed by existing institutions. GOT has
already appointed the Project Coordinator, who reports directly to the State
Secretary for Local Governments in MOI, to follow the day-to-day project
activities.   GOT has also constituted a Consultative Steering Committee,
including representatives of the main ministries concerned, to facilitate
coordination among all agencies involved. The decree (ddcret d'application)
redefining MPA's responsibilities has been signed, and MOT has prepared and
appraised a first tranche of municipal subprojects with the assistance of the
Urban Rehabilitation and Renewal Agency (ARMI).
12.         Cost and Financi a.   The total cost of the project is estimated at
about US$208 million. The proposed loan of US$75 million would finance about 36
percent of total project cost, approximately equivalent to the estimated foreign
exchange component. The Government would finance US$79 million of total project
costs, includlng taxes and duties estimated at US$37 million (18 percent of total
project costs). Municipalities would finance the remaining US$54 million. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. To
facilitate the timely implementation of project activities, which have taken
place after project appraisal in November 1992, retroactive financing for
institutional strengthening and municipal investments of up to US$7.5 million is
included. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. Since most subprojects would be dispersed over many sites,
committed separately, and executed by different municipalities, it would not be



efficient to aggregate contracts into large packages to attract international
contractors through IC8; LCB procedures have been provided. A t Lmetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Tunisia are given
in Schedules C and D rearectively. The Staff AppraJoal Report No. 10348-TUN is
being distributed separately.
13.         Finanoina Arranoements.  The proposed US$75 million loan would be
made to GOT which would onlend US$72 million to MDA for municipal investments,
in local currency. GOT would bear the foreign exchange risk. The remaining part
(US$3 million) would be allocated, as grants, to MDA and to the Ministries of
Interior and Finance for institutional strengthening components. MDA would re-
lend part of the loan funds (about 85 percent) to the municipalities initially
at 6.5 percent, up from 2 percent, and from January 1, 1997 at 8.5 percent, and
would make the remaining loan funds (about 15 percent) available to
municipalities on a grant basis for low-income neighborhood upgrading. MDA's
onlending interest rates are expected to be positive in real terms given
projected inflation rates of around S percent for the period of 1992-1996; an
understanding has been reached that the Bank would review MDA's interest rates
with the Government if the inflation rate differs significantly from the
forecasts. Government transfers to the municipalities would decrease gradually
in relative terms as local resource mobilization improves over time (through
local tax reform, increased cost recovery, better municipal technical and
managerial capacity) and as MDAWs interest rates are progressively raised to
market levels in the long term to prepare the municipalities to tap part of their
financial resources directly from the financial markets.
14.         Princ_nal actions agreed unons
(a)   Prior to effectiveness, (i) MDA's management team shall have been
recruited and on board; (ii) the Training Directorate in MOS shall
have been established and staffed; (iii) MDA's Operation Manual and
Statement of Policy shall have been formally adopted; and (iv) the
subsidiary loan agreement between GOT and MDA shall have been
signei.
(b) In addition to standard conditions, assurances that (i) GOT would
prepare an action plan for local tax reform (including a study on
urban services cost recovery), provide it to the Bank for review,
and thereafter carry it out; (ii) MDA would maintain financial
ratios and interest rates as agreed; (iii) NDA would finance all
municipal subprojects according to eligibility criteria and on
conditions agreed with the Bank; (iv) the Project Coordinator, the
Steering Committee, and the Training Directorate would be maintained
during the execution of the project; (v) GOT would provide funds to
NDA for matching grants to municipalities in addition to the
subloans; and (vi) the Project Coordinator and ADA would furnish to
the Bank project progress reports including details of the training
program and of the studies to be carried out the following year.
15.         Project fenefits. Economic benefits would materialize mostly in the
form of increased land values in beneficiary areas. New community infrastruc-
ture, slaughterhouse investments, and solid waste disposal schemes, would reduce
the negative health and environmental impacts from hazardous food processing and
unsanitary waste management practices. Street maintenance subprojects would
yield savings in vehicle operating costs and help to reduce congestion-related



air contamination from vehicle exhaust. Allocation efficiency is also expected
from the decentralization of public local services. A cost-benefit analysis
would be required for projects costing more than US$1 nillion. To be eligible,
these projects would have at least minimum economic and financial rates of return
of 12 percent. The institutional strengthening components of the Project would
contribute to improving the self-sustainability of the municipal sector.
16.         Proiect Aisks.  The project execution involves a number of agencies,
many of which are weak. Risks include the possibility of: (a) insufficient
project preparation capacity at the local level, res3lting in slow implementation
or low-quality subprojects; and (b) political pressures undermining the technical
and  financial criteria  introduced  into MDA  lending.    The  institutional
strengthening components were designed to minimize these risks.
17.         Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. The Bank has had experience
with municipal aspects of infrastructure projects in Tunisia with the financing
of twenty projects--five in urban development, seven in water supply, three in
sewerage, and five in transportation. More directly, the project draws on the
experience in municipal development and finance in similar projects in other
countries. The main lessons of these projects, in Tuniqia and elsewhere, are the
necessity to address the institutional weaknesses of the municipalities
(concerning both the staff training needs and the administrative procedures) and
the urban services cost recovery issue.
l8a         Environmental Asoects. Investment subprojects to improve solid waste
management and slaughterhouse disposal schemes will have a positive environmental
impact on communities. Subprojects presenting substantial environmental issues
would be subject to approval by the Agency for Environmental Protection (ANPE).
The project has been reviewed and rated in Category B.
19.         Recomendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
