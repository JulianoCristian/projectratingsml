"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Municipal Sector Investment Project\n            has been rated satisfactory, with good performances from\n            both the Bank and the Borrower, due largely to\n            pre-established institutional arrangements. Although\n            preparation was delayed, coupled with extreme optimism on a\n            successful local tax reform, drastic changes in the fiscal\n            system promoted the development of the project, and its\n            efficient disbursement demonstrates the usefulness of these\n            changes. Lessons show that sustainable municipal investments\n            and finances are reliable on municipal resources, and,\n            autonomous local governments with appropriate human\n            resources, in addition to a financial institution providing\n            technical and financial assistance. This sustainability\n            requires long-term strategic planning to allow progress\n            continuity. With the introduction of the local tax reform,\n            whose effects are only expected within 3 years, issues\n            exist, which undermine Government decentralization. A strong\n            political will is required for local tax reforms to succeed,\n            thus, the next operation will need to address these issues.\n            A realistic view of the Government's willingness to\n            decentralize needs to be assessed, for autonomous local\n            governments to deliver effective local services, and,\n            improve management and development priorities. Local finance\n            and management issues should have been addressed in balance\n            with restructuring issues."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
